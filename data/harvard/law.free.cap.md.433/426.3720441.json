While Exxon contends that it notified Herbert Meade, administrator for the oil control program in the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), of the spill on February 17, and that Meade contacted immediately the president of the local community association, Respondents maintain that they learned of the leak only after local media reported the story four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Following notification of the leak, the MDE, pursuant to its statutory authority, ordered Exxon to submit an Interim Remedial Measure Plan. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1982, 2007), Environment Art., \u00a7\u00a7 4-401-4-419. As part of its immediate remediation efforts, Exxon drilled wells for monitoring and recovery surrounding the proximate vicinity of the Exxon station. The monitoring wells were dug at various depths in order to conduct water samples indicating the presence and extent of the contamination, also known as the \u201cstrike line.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>purpose of the recovery wells was to treat groundwater to prevent further expansion of the strike line. There were 227 monitoring wells installed by October 2007, and the MDE ordered an additional thirty wells in order to conduct long-term monitoring. Since February 2006, water samples have been taken from the monitoring wells and residential potable wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Respondents filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Exxon. Their claims alleged that their properties had decreased in value, and that their health was threatened as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals \u2014 specifically, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d), a possible carcinogen, and benzene, a known carcinogen<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 in the gasoline leak. The Respondents\u2019 alleged exposure arose from their use of water from the potable wells on their properties. The properties owned by Respondents were located at varying distances from the source of the leak. The overview of Respondents\u2019 claims and summary of the evidence at trial are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A32\">I. Respondents\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">A single complaint was filed on 17 October 2006. Respondents, composed of eighty-four households,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sought compensatory and punitive damages based on allegations of fraudulent concealment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> intentional infliction of emotional distress, strict liability, trespass, private nuisance, and negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They sought punitive damages and three types of compensatory damages: (1) monetary damages for diminution in the fair market value of their real property; (2) non-economic damages for emotional distress, including fear of contracting cancer; and (3) damages for the costs of future medical monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress were dismissed subsequently by all Respondents, but the trespass counts were dismissed by only some Respondents. Petitioner admitted liability for trespass, private nuisance, negligence, and strict liability, but denied liability for fraud and punitive damages. Petitioner further maintained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>certain of the compensatory damages claimed \u2014 non-economic emotional distress damages arising from injury to property and fear of cancer, and damages for medical monitoring costs \u2014 were not compensable under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The cases were consolidated by the Circuit Court for trial. On 14 October 2008, a jury trial began, presided over by the Honorable Maurice W. Baldwin, Jr., and lasted until 12 March 2009. Liability was not contested by Exxon, so the trial focused on whether any Respondents suffered compensable injuries as a proximate result of the leak and, if so, what compensatory damages should be awarded. The jury was asked also whether Exxon was liable for fraud warranting the award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">II. Contamination of Wells on Respondents\u2019 Properties</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Of the eighty-seven properties implicated in this case, water testing of the residential potable wells in 2006 indicated MTBE concentrations above the MDE action level of 20 ppb in only two.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Exxon paid for the installation of point of entry treatment (\u201cPOET\u201d) systems to filter well water entering those homes. Measurable amounts of MTBE below 20 ppb were found in samples from potable wells on sixty-three of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties in 2006. By the time of trial, however, the most recent samples revealed no potable wells with MTBE concentrations exceeding 20 ppb.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although five potable wells tested for detectable amounts of benzene,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>potable well samples tested for benzene at an amount exceeding the MDE\u2019s 5 ppb action level.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Monitoring wells installed on all properties were used also to measure the extent of MTBE and benzene contamination. Monitoring wells were dug on at least thirteen of Respondents\u2019 properties, ranging from one to a maximum of nineteen monitoring wells on each property. The samples from the monitoring wells showed MTBE concentrations exceeding the action level on five properties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Benzene levels exceeding the 5 ppb action level were found in samples from monitoring wells on four properties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">III. Lay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Respondents\u2019 testimony involved: the nature, extent, and impact of remediation activities on a particular property; the extent to which residents\u2019 outdoors and/or indoors activities were limited by the effects of the leak; the nature and extent of MTBE and/or benzene contamination on a property, as reflected by well test readings; whether harmful chemicals not attributable to gasoline were found in wells; the location of each property in relation to the strike line; the nature and extent of use of well water; the impact of the leak consequences on the value of each property;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> employment and other financial concerns of Respondents; matters related to emotional distress; and Respondents\u2019 perceived need for future medical monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>IV. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Much of the expert testimony at trial turned on whether a property had been contaminated by MTBE or benzene as a result of the leak, based on a property\u2019s location in relation to the strike line and the extent of contamination, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">A. For Respondents</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Respondents\u2019 attorney arranged for any Respondent, who wished to, to see Abdul Malik, M.D., a psychiatrist. Eighty-seven individual plaintiffs accepted the offer. Thirteen sought follow-up treatment in Dr. Malik\u2019s office. Dr. Malik, and his colleagues, interviewed these Respondents individually for about forty-five minutes to an hour each. The parties stipulated at the beginning of trial that if a witness from Dr. Malik\u2019s organization, Psych Associates of Maryland, were called to testify, the witness would testify that each of these Respondents was diagnosed with a disorder that was caused by, or exacerbated by, the leak. The stipulation included a recitation that Petitioner disagreed with the proffered testimony and asserted that none of the Respondents suffered permanent psychological injuries or longterm emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Eight of the Respondents covered by the stipulation had pre-existing psychological conditions that, at some point, required psychotherapy, counseling, or medication. Of those other Respondents covered by the stipulation, Dr. Malik did not recommend therapy or counseling for thirty-six of them, recommended treatment for twenty-one Respondents with no prior history of treatment for emotional distress, and advised four Respondents with preexisting conditions to continue therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">A second stipulation was entered by the parties as to the testimony of Nachman Brautbar, M.D., where they agreed that, if Dr. Brautbar were called to testify, he would state that all Respondents required medical monitoring.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Dr. Brautbar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>recommended annual tests for testicular cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, and hematolymphatic cancers, with estimated total costs per Respondent of $2,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Another expert for Respondents was Harvey Cohen, a geologist with a specialty in hydrogeology, who testified about the movement of ground water generally, the function of potable wells, his mapping of the well test results, and his opinion about future contamination of the aquifer. His opinion was that, from the time of commencement of the leak through April 2007, sixty-six properties had detectable levels of MTBE, and five had a detectable amount of benzene. He also described the levels of contaminants found in monitoring wells over the same time period. His testimony was based on exhibits displaying the maximum concentrations, without indicating the point in time at which those levels were recorded. He further opined that the area of contamination would be ever-changing because of the movement of ground water.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Edward Sullivan, a geologist with a specialty in hydrogeology, employed by the Whitman Companies, also testified as an expert for Respondents. He described underground fractures, aquifers, and the movement of ground water generally. Sullivan opined that the detected levels of contamination were caused probably by the gasoline leak, that the Baigs\u2019 potable well likely would be contaminated in the future, and that the gasoline forced down in the deeper bedrock would likely not be recovered by remediation, and that it would be difficult to determine its movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Dr. Kenneth Rudo, a toxicologist employed by the State of North Carolina, also testified as an expert witness for Respondents. He stated that there is a relatively sparse body of knowledge relating to MTBE because it has been used in gasoline for only about twenty to thirty years. He opined that MTBE is a probable human carcinogen and a probable human mutagen, and that MTBE exposure can occur through in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>gesti\u00f3n, bathing or other skin contact, or breathing vapor containing MTBE. He stated that exposure produces an increased risk of cancer. Dr. Rudo testified that he could not state that any of the Respondents would, more likely than not, contract cancer as a result of the leak, but that there is \u201cno safe level\u201d of exposure to MTBE.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Kenneth Acks testified as an expert in real estate appraisal and \u201cenvironmental economics.\u201d Relying on a stipulation by the parties as to the pre-leak value of each property and on information provided by the other experts, Acks\u2019 testimony discussed the diminished value of each property. We discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Acks\u2019 testimony in greater detail in Section V.A. of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Dr. Ira Whitman, Ph.D, a civil engineer, and Dr. Jerold Jaynes, Ph.D, an economist, were the last two experts who testified for Respondents. Dr. Whitman testified as an expert in environmental engineering and worked with the geologists, Cohen and Sullivan, to explain that thirty-eight or thirty-nine potable wells were likely contaminated between 13 January 2006 and 17 February 2006. He noted that, as of the date of his 2006 report, fifty homes showed some contamination at some point in time, and that number later rose to sixty-six homes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Dr. Jaynes testified about the present value of the cost of future medical monitoring for Respondents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">B. For Petitioner</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Gary Krieger, M.D., testified that all people in this country are exposed to carcinogens and mutagens, including MTBE and benzene, every day, including in food and water that is consumed. He emphasized that the dose is the real issue \u2014 essentially, that mere exposure does not cause cancer. He further stated that the risk of disease Respondents faced was no different than the risk of disease for the general population.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Ronald Lipman, a real estate appraiser, testified that, in 2007 and 2008, there was a general downturn in the real estate market nationally, and that the effect of the gasoline leak on property values in Jacksonville ranged from 0% to 15 <em>%, </em>depending on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Another expert for Petitioner was Gregory Martin, who described the remediation efforts conducted pursuant to a consent order entered into between the MDE and Petitioner. In compliance with the order, Petitioner filed a corrective action plan and intends to continue efforts until the remediation goals are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Herbert Meade, administrator for the oil control program in the MDE, testified regarding the Maryland action level for MTBE. He asserted that the MDE action level is protective of human health. Significantly, he noted that MTBE is the most frequently found ground water contaminant in Maryland. With respect to the properties in this case, he stated that some needed filter systems and others should have them as a precautionary matter, but that the potable well water is safe to drink. Meade also acknowledged that, because of the lack of human studies, he did not know the long term effects of exposure to MTBE.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Thomas Maguire, another expert testifying for Petitioner, discussed the nature of an underground fuel leak and how gasoline and its contaminants are dispersed, removed, or attenuated naturally. He opined that the underground plume for this leak had stabilized, meaning the residual contaminants were trapped and immobile.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He acknowledged there likely was still some residual contamination which, in the future, would be removed as part of the remediation efforts, or would be attenuated naturally.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">V. The Jury\u2019s Verdicts</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Before the trial court gave the jury instructions on causation and damages, the court advised the jury that the instructions applied to each plaintiff, unless otherwise indicated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The instructions were all phrased in terms of what each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>plaintiff had to prove to be entitled to recover. In particular, the jury instruction as to recovery for emotional distress damages based on fear of contracting cancer was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aac\">A Plaintiff may also recover non-economic damages for fear of contracting a particular disease such as cancer. To recover for such fear, however, the Plaintiff must demonstrate that the fear genuinely exists and that his or her fear of contracting the disease in question is objectively reasonable. There can be no compensation for fear and anxiety that is objectively unreasonable. To be objectively reasonable, it is not enough that a ... Plaintiffs fear be genuine and sincere. There must be reliable medical or scientific evidence that it is more likely than not that the substance can cause cancer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The same format for the jury\u2019s awards appeared in the verdict sheets for each plaintiff: each asked essentially \u201c(A) do you find ... fraud by concealment? (B) do you find that [Petitioner\u2019s admitted liability for negligence, strict liability, nuisance, and trespass] caused [the plaintiffs] any injuries and damages? and (C) if the answer to (A) or (B) is yes, how much [compensatory] damages do you award?\u201d The last question was followed by individual categories of damages to be filled-in if the jury responded \u201cyes\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Economic Damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Damages to Property Owner [name of property owner]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ari\">Diminution in Property Value $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Medical Monitoring</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1s\">[names of plaintiffs] $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">Non-Economic Loss (Emotional Distress)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">[names of plaintiffs] $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">Punitive Damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to [question (A) ], should the Plaintiffs be awarded punitive damages? [names of plaintiffs]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0I\">YES NO</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">On 12 March 2009, the jury returned its verdicts. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Exxon with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>fraudulent concealment and punitive damage claims, but found in favor of all remaining plaintiffs<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as to all other claims for compensatory damages. The jury found that each of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties was worthless, and awarded monetary damages for diminution of real property value in an amount equal to the full value of the properties before the leak. The jury also awarded to all plaintiffs non-economic damages for emotional distress, including fear of contracting cancer and damages for the cost of future medical monitoring. Generally, in households with children, the awards for the adults were reduced by the amount of the awards for the minors. The total amount of damages awarded to Respondents was approximately $147 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Petitioner filed six post-judgment motions<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, for a new trial, or for remittitur, challenging the property damage awards, the emotional distress awards, and the damages for medical monitoring, based on various grounds. Although Judge Baldwin denied each motion,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> he reduced the awards for non-economic damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>four plaintiffs because of the applicable statutory cap of $665,000, pursuant to \u00a7 11-108 of the Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Court and Judicial Proceedings Article. Respondents filed a motion arguing that Petitioner should be estopped from challenging the jury verdicts because of seemingly concessionary statements made by its counsel during opening and closing arguments; however, the Circuit Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">VI. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On 9 September 2009, Exxon noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. It challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s awards for complete diminution of property value, damages for emotional distress, and damages for future medical monitoring costs. It also challenged the jury instructions regarding the legal standards to be applied by the jury in deciding the claims for damages based on fear of developing cancer and future medical monitoring costs. Respondents contended, in turn, that Exxon\u2019s attorney at trial waived Exxon\u2019s right to challenge the compensatory damage awards by certain things he said in opening statement and closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On 6 January 2010, the Court of Special Appeals consolidated the eighty-eight appeals. In January 2011, a three-judge panel of that court (consisting of Judges Meredith, Zarnoch, and retired Judge Thieme, the latter specially assigned) heard argument. The panel did not issue a decision. Thus the court ordered rehearing in banc on 9 June 2011.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">On 9 February 2012, the in banc panel, consisting of nine incumbent members of the court, issued a per curiam opinion and a number of attributed opinions on various questions presented by the appeal. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Ford, </em>204 Md.App. 1, 40 A.3d 514 (2012). The Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, having the effect of reducing the $147 million in damages awarded to the Respondents by more than half.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The intermediate appellate court rejected unanimously the Respondents\u2019 contention that Petitioner was estopped from challenging the compensatory damages awards, and concluded unanimously that the Circuit Court had not abused its discretion in admitting Respondents\u2019 expert testimony in support of their claims of diminution in property values. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11, 40 A.3d at 519 (per curiam).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Different majorities of the sitting court explained, in various written opinions, their support for the remaining portions of the judgment announced by the per curiam opinion. Regarding the claims for diminution in property value, six of the nine judges affirmed the portion of the judgments that awarded damages to each Respondent (whose judgments had not been remitted by the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals based on the post-leak sale of the property for value) in an amount equal to the value of their property prior to the leak. <em>See id. </em>at 11, 40 A.3d at 519. The reasoning for this result, however, differed in several respects between the judges\u2019 opinions. <em>See id. </em>at 34-50, 40 A.3d at 534-43 (Zarnoch, J., joined by Meredith, Woodward, and Wright, JJ.), <em>id. </em>at 148-68, 40 A.3d at 600-12; (J. Eyler, J., joined by Watts, J.); <em>id. </em>at 241-44, 40 A.3d at 655 (Graeff, J.), <em>id. </em>at 247-52, 40 A.3d at 658-60 (Watts, J.); <em>id. </em>at 269-74, 40 A.3d at 671-74 (D. Eyler, J).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The court\u2019s decision as to the non-economic damages awards also resulted from different views. Most of the court concluded that a plaintiff may recover damages for emotional distress based on fear of contracting cancer in certain circumstances, and that an error in the jury instructions related to this issue required reversal of all of the judgments for non-economic damages. The judges disagreed, however, about whether the circumstances that would permit recovery had been established and about the legal standard that should apply to such claims. <em>See id. </em>at 52-53, 40 A.3d at 541-42 (Zarnoch, J.).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nevertheless, a majority voted to reverse judgment awarding damages for emotional distress for fifty-three plaintiffs based on insufficient evidence, and reversed and remanded the remaining claims for a new trial due to a faulty jury instruction. <em>See id. </em>at 11, 40 A.3d at 519 (per curiam); 40 A.3d at 600-12 (J. Eyler, J., joined by Hotten, J.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>, <em>id. </em>at 245, 40 A.3d at 655-56 (Graeff, J.),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 254, 40 A.3d at 661-62 (Watts, J.);<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>at 259-69, 40 A.3d at 665-71 (D. Eyler, J.).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As a result, the court reversed all emotional distress judgments and ordered a new trial for all but fifty-three of the plaintiffs on those claims, to be conducted consistent with the views of the majority/plurality opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 40 A.3d at 520 (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Respondents\u2019 awards for damages for future medical monitoring costs also produced split majorities of the in banc panel. Although a majority would recognize a claim for monetary damages for medical monitoring, <em>see id. </em>at 63-70, 40 A.3d at 550-55 (Zarnoch, J. joined by Meredith, Woodward, and Wright, JJ.), <em>id. </em>at 247, 40 A.3d at 658 (Graeff, J.), a differently aligned majority decided that the evidence did not warrant any plaintiffs entitlement to this form of damages. <em>See id. </em>at 11, 40 A.3d at 520 (per curiam); <em>id. </em>at 132-47, 40 A.3d at 591-600 (J. Eyler, J.), <em>id. </em>at 247, 40 A.3d at 658 (Graeff, J.), <em>id. </em>at 255-57, 40 A.3d at 663-64 (Watts, J.).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Hence, the court reversed the portions of the judgments that awarded damages for medical monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On 27 February 2012, Respondents filed a motion under Maryland Rule 8-605 requesting that the Court of Special Appeals reconsider its February 9 in banc decision because the portions of that decision that were supported by fewer than seven judges \u201cviolate the clear mandate\u201d of Section 1-403(c) of Court and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) authorizing the court to decide an appeal through the in banc mechanism.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>On 6 March 2012, the Court of Special Appeals denied, in a per curiam opinion, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of \u00a7 1\u2014403(c) was \u201coverly technical,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with sound rules of statutory construction,\u201d and \u201ccontrary to well-reasoned authorities.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. 274, 277, 40 A.3d 674, 675 (2012).

The consolidated questions presented by the petitions are as follows, rephrased for purposes of brevity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">(1) Did the Court of Special Appeals violate Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Court and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP), \u00a7 1\u2014403(c), by issuing its in banc decision without a \u201cconcurrence of a majority of the incumbent judges of the entire Court[,]\u201d for each non-unanimous judgment, such that this Court otherwise has no authority to review the merits of the current appeal?<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that counsel for Petitioner did not waive his client\u2019s right to challenge the compensatory damage awards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(4) Does Maryland permit awards for emotional distress due to fear of developing cancer? If so, what is the appropriate standard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">(5) Should the emotional distress verdicts be overturned where the uniform awards ignored the substantial differences among Plaintiffs, evidence satisfying the standards of <em>Vance v. Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 408 A.2d 728 (1979), for recovery of such damages was not presented, and the jury instruction permitted recovery for fear of cancer without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>any evidence of exposure to the alleged carcinogen or that the exposure made it \u201creasonably probable\u201d that a Plaintiff would contract cancer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">(6) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the \u201cfear of cancer\u201d jury instruction given at trial was erroneous and prejudicial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">(7) Does Maryland permit damages for medical monitoring and, if so, may such damages be awarded where a) no Plaintiff claimed to have any current disease caused by exposure to contaminant, b) there was no proof that any Plaintiff had a significantly increased risk of developing any disease, and c) as to many Plaintiffs, there was no proof of exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">(8) Should Respondents\u2019 property damage expert\u2019s opinions have been admitted where he did not use any generally accepted method of valuation and he did not use actual sales or valuations in his assessment of the diminution in value of Respondents\u2019 properties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">(9) May a jury\u2019s verdict that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 properties were worthless be upheld where (a) the properties were all still habitable and many had no contamination; (b) all experts testified that the properties retained substantial value; and (c) those properties which were sold all obtained a substantial price?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">(10) Is a new damages only trial required when a jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages is not based on the Plaintiffs alleged injuries?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">I. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s In Banc Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">We address first a threshold procedural issue raised by Respondents in their cross-petition: whether the Court of Special Appeals violated CJP \u00a7 1-403(c)<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> in its in banc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>procedure here.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Respondents and Petitioner agree that we have the authority to resolve all issues in this case; however, Respondents contend that this Court has also the authority not to decide the issues presented to the Court of Special Appeals and, instead, resolve only this procedural issue, dismiss the Writ of Certiorari as to the others, and vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We decline Respondents\u2019 invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We begin our analysis with a brief summary of the in banc proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. As the court noted in its 6 March 2012 denial of the Respondents\u2019 second Motion for Reconsideration, the appeal before the in banc panel was argued before nine incumbent qualified judges of the Court of Special Appeals, a majority of which participated in deciding each of the issues on appeal. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Ford, </em>204 Md.App. 274, 281, 40 A.3d 674, 678 (2012). The intermediate appellate court\u2019s March 6 ruling stated that three members of the court elected to disqualify themselves under Rule 2.11 of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>another seat on the court was vacant when the case was argued.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 276 n. 1, 40 A.3d at 675 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Respondents contend that the in banc decisions that were not decided by a proper majority of the Court of Special Appeals \u2014 requiring, in their view, a seven-member majority\u2014 violate CJP \u00a7 1-403(c). As a result of this violation, Respondents assert, this Court should withdraw or decline certiorari on all other issues not decided by a seven-member majority of the in banc panel, and reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict. We hold, however, that the questions presented in the petitions that we granted bypassed the intermediate appellate court and are properly before this Court for review, assuming, for the sake of argument, that the arguments regarding CJP \u00a7 1-403(c) and the in banc decision have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Even if we were to agree with Respondents\u2019 argument that the in banc panel did not decide certain issues by the requisite majority (which we do not so decide), our precedent allows us to treat the present appeal as if a writ or writs of certiorari had been granted on bypass \u201cprior to entry of a proper judgment by the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d <em>Wildwood Med. Ctr., LLC v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>405 Md. 489, 496, 954 A.2d 457, 461 (2008).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In <em>Wildwood, </em>a member (Judge Theodore G. Bloom) of a three-judge panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in a case decided purportedly by a 2-1 vote, died before the opinion (which facially reflected him as the author of the majority opinion) was filed, leaving the remaining panel judges divided evenly as to the proper disposition of the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 954 A.2d at 460. Similar to the instant case, a threshold jurisdictional issue seemingly impeding our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>review of the merits in <em>Wildwood </em>was whether a decision arising from an improperly-constituted panel\u2019s facial opinion, which lacked a concurrence in the majority, under Section 1-403(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), prevents this Court from reviewing an appeal of that decision.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 494-96, 954 A.2d at 460-61. We determined that the consequence of Judge Bloom\u2019s death was to dissolve the \u201cconcurrence of a majority of the panel\u201d that is \u201cnecessary for the decision of a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), CJP \u00a7 1-403(b)). We held ultimately that the panel\u2019s decision and its posthumously-issued opinion and mandate were unauthorized because the judges had failed to achieve a concurrence of a panel majority. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 954 A.2d at 461. Although we concluded that the lack of majority nullified the intermediate three-member panel\u2019s decision and mandate, we held that this Court obtained jurisdiction to decide the merits by virtue of its authority to bypass the intermediate appellate court and consider appeals not yet decided by that court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, we granted both parties\u2019 petitions for Writs of Certiorari, which, as in <em>Wildwood, </em>enables us to consider and decide \u201call the issues that would have been cognizable by the intermediate appellate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Md. R. 8-131(b)(2)).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Even if, as the Respondents argue here, the in banc decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>attributed majority status erroneously to 6-3 and 5-4 rulings, thereby lacking a concurrence of a majority of the entire court under a possible reading of CJP \u00a7 1\u2014403(c), then, under <em>Wildwood, </em>this Court nonetheless has the authority to review the issues of this appeal. Whether a majority of an in banc panel issued the underlying decision is of no moment to whether we have authority to decide the instant appeal.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> For these reasons, we hold that, regardless of whether the in banc panel had a concurrence of a majority under CJP \u00a7 1-403(c), our precedent allows us to consider (and we shall) the merits of the appeals before us.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Before moving to the next question, we reiterate that we do not decide whether our intermediate appellate court brethren failed to comply with CJP \u00a7 1-403(c). We observe, however, that they gave thorough and comprehensive consideration of all issues in a complex and difficult case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II. Petitioner Did Not Waive its Right to Appeal Compensatory Damages Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Respondents contend that Petitioner\u2019s counsel waived Petitioner\u2019s right to appeal the compensatory damages awards when he made certain statements during opening and closing arguments. According to Respondents, Petitioner\u2019s waiver arose when Petitioner sought a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d arrangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>with the jury, promising the jury that Exxon would pay any compensatory damages awarded in exchange for the jury\u2019s decision not to award punitive damages. We see it differently and agree with the unanimous in banc panel of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Respondents contend that, in Exxon\u2019s opening statement, Exxon\u2019s counsel \u201cmade it abundantly clear that the trial was not about compensatory damages but was about punitive damages!,]\u201d quoting the following excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Well, it occurs to me at this point that you\u2019re probably wondering, if Exxon takes responsibility and accepts liability to pay compensatory damages for that harm, then why are we here? ... So, [Respondents\u2019 counsel] says we\u2019re trying to blame \u2018em. This, of course, is not true. Blame \u2018em for the \u2014 for the compensatory liability? No. I told you. We\u2019re paying that. Whatever you decide is right about that, we\u2019re paying that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Respondents\u2019 claim relies also on the following excerpts of Petitioner\u2019s closing argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">[W]e accept responsibility to pay for whatever damages you find occurred here, that\u2019s not blaming somebody else. That\u2019s saying it\u2019s us. We\u2019ve taken responsibility. We pay. You find that people were hurt here, you charge us. We pay. Now, are we blaming people for punitive damages. Of course, not. We spent a lot of time proving to you they couldn\u2019t be guilty of punitive conduct because they didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">[Respondents\u2019 attorney] argues to you that your verdict should send a message ... But his message can\u2019t be sent because he did not prove to you what he said he was going to prove to you about fraud. I want you to send a message that when a company makes a mistake and then does what it ought to do, which is take responsibility, apologize and try to make it right, that if a company stands up and does what it is supposed to do to make things right, that it will not be punished if all there is an accident. So it is not a reward, it is a withholding of punishment in order to send the message <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>we want you to behave like ExxonMobil behaved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Regarding the compensatory damages for diminution in property value, Petitioner\u2019s attorney told the jury, also in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">I\u2019m not going to put up a chart where I tried to tell you what are the suggested numbers for each household. My reasoning is this: I do not want you to award even a dollar less than the amount you think it takes to make it right for each plaintiff household that you determine is actually harmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">That\u2019s your call. I want you to make that decision. Not [Respondents\u2019 attorney]. Not somebodyt\u2019s] expert. I want you to make that call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">Now, obviously, some homes are not impacted and some are, and you know the difference. Those with nondetects, those that are now nondetect, there\u2019s no impact. Those that have detections ... then it\u2019s a question of how much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">These statements, Respondents contend, amounted to Petitioner forfeiting its right to appeal by its counsel\u2019s anticipatory acquiescence to the jury\u2019s verdict. We hold that these statements did not indicate that Petitioner\u2019s counsel acquiesced to the jury\u2019s judgment or waived Petitioner\u2019s right to appeal the subsequent judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Waiver is conduct from which it may be inferred reasonably an express or implied \u201cintentional relinquishment\u201d of a known right. <em>Gould v. Transamerican Assocs., </em>224 Md. 285, 294, 167 A.2d 905, 909 (1961). \u201cThe doctrine of acquiescence \u2014 or waiver \u2014 is that \u2018a <em>voluntary </em>act of a party which is inconsistent with the assignment of errors on appeal normally precludes that party from obtaining appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 200, 725 A.2d 1027, 1032 (1999) (quoting <em>Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 69, 427 A.2d 1002, 1004 (1981)) (emphasis in original). The doctrine of waiver is also known as \u201cestoppel, acceptance of benefits creating mootness, and acquiescence in judgment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Downtown Brewing Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Ocean City, </em>370 Md. 145, 149, 803 A.2d 545, 547 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">A party\u2019s right to appeal may be waived only \u201cwhere there is acquiescence in the decision from which the appeal is taken or by otherwise taking a position inconsistent with the right to appeal.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 765, 506 A.2d 580, 620 (1986). The waiver doctrine applies only to conduct that is necessarily \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the right to appeal. <em>Downtown Brewing, </em>370 Md. at 149, 803 A.2d at 547; <em>see Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 381, 809 A.2d 18, 35-36 (2002). \u201cTo take actions that are necessarily inconsistent with challenging a judgment, a party <em>must have knowledge of the nature and effect of the judgment.\u201d Boyd v. Bowen, </em>145 Md.App. 635, 666, 806 A.2d 314, 331 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We concluded that a waiver of a right to appeal was warranted where a party accepted a condemnation award in the underlying proceeding, but later sought to appeal that same judgment. <em>See Downtown Brewing, </em>370 Md. at 151, 803 A.2d at 548. We recognized that \u201cthe right to appeal may be lost by acquiescence in, or in recognition of, the validity of the decision below from which an appeal is taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 803 A.2d at 547 (quoting <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 630, 217 A.2d 531 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Moreover, waiver by acquiescence is limited to a party\u2019s post-judgment conduct. Except for consent to a judgment, we have not applied waiver by acquiescence to conduct before entry of judgment, namely because a party cannot relinquish knowingly a right to appeal the nature and effect of a judgment before that judgment is known and entered. <em>Boyd, </em>145 Md.App. at 666, 806 A.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In the present case, Respondents maintain that, before the return of the jury\u2019s verdicts and the entry of judgment, the Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s statements to the jury in argument constituted acquiescence in what became the jury\u2019s verdict and a waiver of Petitioner\u2019s right to appeal the resultant entry of final judgment. The Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals rejected Respondents\u2019 waiver argument. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>with their reasoning. A reasonable view of the closing argument of Petitioner\u2019s counsel is that, by counsel saying \u201cwe pay,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel asserted only his client\u2019s intention to take responsibility for its actionable and proven conduct affecting adversely Respondents. Counsel\u2019s other statements, taken within their context, urged the jury to award an appropriate compensatory award based on the properly admitted evidence at trial and proper jury instruction. Counsel\u2019s arguments illustrate strategic advocacy, rather than a blatant offer of a quid pro quo arrangement with the jury to avoid a punitive damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In any event, the conduct of Petitioner\u2019s counsel occurred before the rendition of the jury\u2019s verdict and entry of judgment, and thus it is unreasonable for Respondents to argue that Petitioner could relinquish knowingly the right to challenge the jury\u2019s decision. As there was no implicit or express consent to the jury\u2019s actual judgment, we hold that the conduct of Petitioner\u2019s counsel was not inconsistent with the Petitioner\u2019s right to appeal the final judgment, and therefore did not amount to Petitioner\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">III. Emotional Distress Damages for Fear of Cancer</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Albright, </em>we addressed directly whether a plaintiff may recover emotional distress damages based on a fear of contracting a latent disease after tortious exposure to a toxic substance. 433 Md. at 349-64, 71 A.3d at 58-67. Exxon seeks here also reversal of the trial judge\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment not withstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) regarding damages for fear of contracting cancer as well as medical monitoring. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to allow or deny judgment or JNOV to determine whether it was correct legally. <em>Jones v. State, </em>425 Md. 1, 8, 38 A.3d 333, 337 (2012); <em>Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 503, 16 A.3d 159, 163 (2011). A party is entitled to JNOV \u201cwhen the evidence at the close of the case, taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, does not legally support the nonmoving party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d <em>Gallagher v. H.V. Pierhomes, </em>182 Md.App. 94, 101, 957 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>628, 632 (2008). Error in a denial of JNOV is found if the evidence \u201cdoes not rise above speculation, hypothesis, and conjecture, and does not lead to the jury\u2019s conclusion with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md.App. 34, 51, 651 A.2d 908, 916 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Respondents argue that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it concluded that the jury instruction on fear of cancer was erroneous and prejudicial. \u201cThe standard of review for jury instructions is that so long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them.\u201d <em>Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. v. Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 337, 795 A.2d 107, 113 (2001) (quoting <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 46, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999)). \u201cThis standard for reversible error places the burden on the complaining party to show both prejudice and error.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>355 Md. at 46, 733 A.2d at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In <em>Albright, </em>we held that, to recover emotional distress damages for fear of contracting a latent disease, a plaintiff must show that (1) he or she was exposed actually to a toxic substance due to the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct; (2) which led him or her to fear objectively and reasonably that he or she would contract a latent disease; and, (3) as a result of the objective and reasonable fear, he or she manifested a physical injury capable of objective determination. 433 Md. at 363-64, 71 A.3d at 67. Hence, we hold that, viewed in the light most favorable to the Respondents, the evidence in this record is insufficient as a matter of law to support Respondents\u2019 claims for emotional distress damages based on a fear of contracting cancer. We hold further that, as the trial court\u2019s jury instructions did not cover fairly the standard for recovery that we have adopted, the jury instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The test results, at the maximum detection levels, for the potable wells on the Respondents\u2019 properties showed that the potable wells of seventeen<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> of the eighty-four properties did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>not have any measurable MTBE contamination \u2014 labeled as \u201cnon-detects\u201d \u2014 as a result of the leak. Results from the monitoring wells indicate that five of the properties contained contamination above the MTBE action level of 20ppb. Benzene above the 5ppb action level was not found in any of the Respondents\u2019 potable wells, although results of the monitoring wells indicate that four had benzene contamination above the action level.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Dr. Rudo, the toxicologist who testified as an expert witness on Respondents\u2019 behalf, testified that MTBE is a mutagen that causes changes in DNA, and, therefore, there is \u201cno safe level\u201d of exposure to MTBE. In contrast, the MDE (consistent with the EPA standard) has set an action level for MTBE at 20 ppb. Herbert Meade from the MDE testified that aesthetic standards, such as the MTBE 20-40 ppb standard, which is consistent with the EPA standard, do not evince any evidence of a risk to human health and are meant only to ensure acceptable odor and taste.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">It is significant that none of the Respondents claimed sickness or symptoms of a disease attributable to the leak, despite their claims that they had a fear of contracting a latent disease. None of the Respondents claimed a physical injury, apart from emotional distress caused allegedly by the leak.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Some Respondents testified that they experienced emotional or psychological difficulties prior to the leak and some of them had sought treatment for their problems. Some Respondents stated that they had experienced stress unrelated to the leak, such as problems in their marriage or other relationships, or concerns about their health or health of family members. Lastly, we note that for those Respondents who elected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>consult Dr. Malik regarding their emotional distress evaluations, each evaluator relied in his or her later opinion on self-reported information from Respondents. The evaluators did not have medical records regarding those Respondents prior to February 2006, and did not speak to any of the Respondents\u2019 personal physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">A. No Evidence of Actual Exposure That Would Give Rise to Objective Reasonable Fear</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">As there are no air samples or vapor studies in evidence to demonstrate that breathing vapors may have caused exposure to MTBE or benzene, the only evidence relevant to assessing actual contamination and consequent exposure is that collected from the Respondents\u2019 potable wells and the monitoring wells. No other evidence was presented to show that exposure could occur absent contamination in a potable well.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The evidence reflects that there are seventeen properties for which there was no past or current evidence that the potable wells were contaminated by the leak, or that would become contaminated in the future. Respondents\u2019 experts testified that the chance of future contamination of the wells for these properties was \u201clow,\u201d which they meant as unlikely to occur. Further, Respondents owning these particular properties did not adduce any evidence that contamination was present in the ambient air or water vapor in any of their houses (including those using well water for bathing). Thus, without proof of contamination in the potable wells on these 17 properties, there can be no ingestion or skin contact with contaminated water. As there is no indicia that these Respondents were in contact with any form of contamination as a consequence of the leak, the likelihood of potential future exposure is insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Despite the absence of proof of contamination, the Respondents who own these seventeen properties received awards for emotional distress damages based on fear of contracting cancer. In the absence of any exposure, there can be no objective reasonable fear of cancer. The trial court erred in not granting Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV with respect to these Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>spondents\u2019 emotional distress claims.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We reverse the judgments and shall remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand to the Circuit Court and direct the entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">B. Insufficient Evidence of Actual Exposure That Would Give Rise to an Objectively Reasonable Fear</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">For the remaining Respondents\u2019 fears to be objectively reasonable, they must have a rational basis to apprehend reasonably that they would develop cancer as a result of exposure to the toxic substances of the leak. The evidence presented at trial indicated that all Marylanders are exposed to toxic substances (some carcinogens, some mutagens) in our daily lives.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As Judge James Eyler summarized aptly in his concurring and dissenting opinion in this case in the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">People who pump their own gasoline are exposed to MTBE and benzene, by contact with or by breathing vapors. People who drive many miles and fill their tanks often are more exposed than those who drive less. People who keep gasoline in their homes for use in generators, lawn mowers, or other engines, have greater exposure than those who do not. <em>In order to have a valid tort claim, a claimant must be different from the general population.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">204 Md.App. 1, 128-29, 40 A.3d 514, 590 (2012) (J. Eyler, dissenting and concurring) (emphasis added). Claiming mere exposure to MTBE as a result of the leak is insufficient under the standard we adopted in <em>Albright. </em>Based on the evidence presented, mere exposure to MTBE would not lead a reasonable person in the Respondents\u2019 position to believe that they will develop cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Respondents\u2019 claims arise from the same factual background as in <em>Albright. </em>In <em>Albright, </em>we determined that the rational basis for an objective and reasonable fear arising from the leak\u2019s toxic exposure was at the point a reasonable person under these circumstances would believe that a toxic chemical was actually present in their potable water.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> 433 Md. at 365-66, 71 A.3d at 67-68. There is ample evidence and testimony that the exposure to MTBE above the MDE\u2019s action level of 20 ppb is still considered safe; however, the MDE chose the 20 ppb standard to measure the point at which an individual\u2019s level of tolerance to odor and taste is triggered. As we concluded in <em>Albright, </em>assuming that an objective reasonable fear of developing cancer may arise when an individual is exposed to a level of MTBE significantly beyond that which is deemed aesthetically tolerable, based on the MDE\u2019s 20 ppb level, we conclude that those individuals exposed to MTBE at levels below the 20 ppb do not have a rational basis to fear they will develop cancer. 433 Md. at 367-68, 71 A.3d at 69. Moreover, Meade, on behalf of the MDE, stated at trial that the water was safe to use, and that he communicated this information to several Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Hence, those Respondents belonging to the sixty-three households whose properties\u2019 potable wells were tested with results below the MDE 20 ppb action level do not have an objective reasonable fear, as a matter of law, that they may develop cancer as a result of exposure to the leak.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>reverse those judgments entered in favor of these Respondents and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand to the Circuit Court and direct the entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">C. Legally Insufficient Evidence of Demonstrable Physical Injury as a Result of Exposure</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">None of the Respondents\u2019 evidence or testimony provided sufficient manifestation of physical injury as a matter of law. As we discussed in <em>Albright, </em>to sustain an award for emotional distress for fear of cancer, a plaintiff must prove that as a result of actual exposure and his or her objective reasonable fear, he or she sustained an objectively demonstrable physical injury manifesting emotional distress, which may include a mental state, physiological or psychological symptoms, or an actual physical harm. 433 Md. at 358-64, 71 A.3d at 63-67. Pursuant to <em>Vance v. Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 500-01, 408 A.2d 728, 733-34 (1979), and <em>Hunt v. Mercy Med. Ctr., </em>121 Md.App. 516, 524-25, 710 A.2d 362, 366 (1998), a physical injury is manifested and objective if the evidence is not conclusory or speculative, and provides some quantifiable basis for the jury to determine the appropriate award.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The trial court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV with respect to the emotional distress awards entered in favor of Respondents who did not testify, and therefore presented no evidence to show that they experienced any emotional distress.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We reverse those judgments and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with direction that it remand to the Circuit Court and direct the entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The trial court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV regarding the awards for emotional distress entered in favor of Respondents who briefly and intermittently mentioned in testimony and provided minimal-to-no evidence of emotional distress.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> These Respondents\u2019 evidence of physical injury, if any, did not demonstrate physical injuries of an objective and quantifiable nature. The evidence they did present did not indicate any objective and demonstrable injury arising from exposure to the leak because it included only the following: (1) proof that any emotional stress resulted from a concern about property damages only, such as the loss of use and enjoyment, rather than human health or safety; (2) proof that any emotional stress was due to preexisting mental or emotional conditions or was attributed to the maintenance of the litigation; and, (3) lack of sufficient physical manifestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Most of these Respondents did not provide any supporting medical testimony as to their emotional distress. Further, these Respondents, based on the opinion of their expert, Dr. Rudo, asserted that their physical injuries included subcellular changes as a result of exposure to MTBE\u2019s likelihood of causing cell mutation and increasing the risk of cancer. As discussed in <em>Albright, </em>however, such injuries are not compensable in Maryland without symptoms of disease or actual impairment. 433 Md. at 362, 71 A.3d at 66. There is no such evidence or testimony in this record. We reverse those judgments and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to order remand to the Circuit Court for the entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Our holdings by no means exclude the filing of future actions by those Respondents who may develop, unfortunately, a future latent disease as a result of exposure to the 2006 leak. Such claims would not be barred by res judicata or the statute of limitations: the tolling period for causes of action for latent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>disease would begin to run only when a plaintiff knew or should have discovered reasonably the nature and cause of the disease. <em>See Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 334, 635 A.2d 394, 399 (1994); <em>Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 663, 464 A.2d 1020, 1025 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">IV. Compensatory Damages for Future Costs of Medical Monitoring</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Maryland recognizes now a remedy of recovery for medical monitoring costs due to enhanced risk from sufficient exposure to toxic substances resulting from defendant\u2019s tortious conduct. <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 381-82, 71 A.3d at 77-78. Petitioner argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for JNOV regarding damages for medical monitoring. Respondents urge us to affirm the jury\u2019s awards for medical monitoring costs to all of the Respondents. Our consideration of these contentions requires us to view the evidence in the record \u201ctaken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 101, 957 A.2d at 632. Viewing the evidence in that light, we conclude that it was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s awards for medical monitoring and thus hold that the trial court was legally incorrect in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">To sustain an award for recovery of medical monitoring costs, a plaintiff must show that such costs are necessary due to a reasonably certain and significantly increased risk of developing a latent disease as a result of exposure to a toxic chemical. <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 389-90, 71 A.3d at 83. In determining whether to award relief, a court must consider whether the plaintiff has shown: (1) that the plaintiff was exposed significantly to a proven hazardous substance through the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct; (2) that, as a proximate result of significant exposure, the plaintiff suffers a significantly increased risk of contracting a latent disease; (3) that increased risk makes periodic diagnostic medical examinations reasonably necessary; and (4) that monitoring and testing procedures exist which make the early detection and treatment of the disease possible and beneficial. <em>Id. </em>To determine what is a \u201csignificantly increased risk of contracting a latent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>disease\u201d for a particular plaintiff, the plaintiff must present quantifiable and reliable medical expert testimony that indicates the individual plaintiffs particularized chances of developing the disease had he or she not been exposed, compared to the chances of the members of the public at large of developing the disease. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Here, the jury awards indicated that if, at any point in time, a household\u2019s potable well had a MTBE reading above 0.5 ppb, the members of that household received 100% of his or her claimed costs for future medical monitoring; if the MTBE reading was less than 0.5 ppb, that individual received 50% of his or her claimed costs for future medical monitoring; and, lastly, if a household\u2019s potable well never tested positively for MTBE, each member of that household nonetheless received 25% of his or her claimed future medical monitoring costs. As discussed in our summary of the contamination results in Section II of the procedural history of this case, tests of the potable wells on the all properties showed that seventeen properties did not suffer any contamination as a result of the leak. Monitoring well results show that benzene levels above the action level were found only in five of the Respondents\u2019 potable wells, while six of the properties contained contamination above the MTBE action level.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Those Respondents who owned and/or resided on properties where the potable well lacked any contamination failed to show exposure to a toxic substance, which is a threshold requirement to recover for medical monitoring.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Although Cohen, one of Respondents\u2019 hydrogeologist experts, testified that the potential for future contamination of these non-detect properties was possible, he could not predict which well or wells might become contaminated in the future or when. The possibility of future contamination for these non-detect properties is therefore too speculative. With respect to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>claims, the trial court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV. We reverse those judgments and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand to the Circuit Court for entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">As discussed in our analysis related to emotional distress damages for fear of contracting cancer, the evidence demonstrates that most Marylanders are exposed to MTBE every day. Evidence at trial demonstrated that exposure to MTBE above the 20 ppb action level is still considered safe, and that the selected 20 ppb standard measures merely the point at which an individual\u2019s level of tolerance to the odor and taste of MTBE in water becomes an impediment to its consumption. Those who are exposed to MTBE or benezene at well-recognized safety levels are no more at risk of developing a latent disease than the rest of the population \u2014 much less face a <em>significantly </em>increased risk in relation to other Marylanders\u2019 exposure to MTBE. Hence, those Respondents whose properties tested below 20 ppb are not suffering, as a matter of law, a significantly increased risk of developing a latent disease for which medical monitoring costs are necessary.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court erred in denying the Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV regarding these Respondents\u2019 judgments, and thus reverse those judgments, and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand to the Circuit Court for entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Lastly, Respondents from the remaining six households<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> also have not demonstrated a significant risk of developing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>disease in the future because the expert testimony did not indicate that any individual faced a particularized and significantly increased risk as a result of the leak in relation to the public at large. We concluded in <em>Albright </em>that particularized evidence is necessary to prove a \u201csignificantly\u201d increased risk of developing a future disease, such as medical testimony specifically noting a plaintiffs individually increased risk to develop cancer. 433 Md. at 381-88, 71 A.3d at 77-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">No such evidence was presented in this case. Although some Respondents consulted with Dr. Malik and were evaluated for their described symptoms, neither Dr. Malik nor Dr. Brautbar indicated any particularized evidence that an individual Respondent faced an increased risk of developing a future disease that was significantly higher than similar risks posed to the general population. Rather, Respondents\u2019 expert testimony generalized that all Respondents faced a significantly increased risk of developing a future disease, without providing individual assessments of any Respondent. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV with regard to these Respondents. We reverse those judgments and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to direct entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">V. Property Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Respondents sought damages for diminution in their property values as a result of the leak. The jury found that all of their properties had become worthless, and awarded the owners of each home 100% of the pre-leak market value based on (1) the difference in market value prior to and subsequent to when notice of the leak became public; and, (2) loss of use and enjoyment for the time between the date of the leak to the commencement of trial. Judge Baldwin granted Petitioner\u2019s blanket post-trial motion challenging the award, but as to only three Respondents\u2019 households who had sold their homes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>following the leak,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> reducing the award to the difference between the full pre-leak value and the actual sales price. The court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial or remittitur for the judgments awarded to the remaining households whose properties had not been sold after the leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Petitioner appeals Judge Baldwin\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, a remittitur (on the basis of excessive compensatory damages) because (1) the testimony of Respondents\u2019 real estate appraisal expert, Kenneth Acks, was inadmissible; (2) Respondents produced insufficient evidence to warrant a jury verdict finding that their properties were worthless; and (3) the evidence shows that those Respondents\u2019 properties retained substantial post-leak value.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We hold that the trial court was correct in admitting Acks\u2019 expert testimony. Nevertheless, we hold also that, because no competent evidence in this record indicated that Respondents\u2019 properties had \u201czero value,\u201d the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV or a new trial was erroneous. Thus, Respondents shall receive a new trial for their claims of property damage based on diminution in value, in light of our decision in <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 395-426, 71 A.3d at 86-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Ordinarily, an abuse of discretion standard governs appellate scrutiny of the admissibility of expert testimony and the denials of motions for a new trial or remittitur. We will find an abuse of discretion when the court\u2019s ruling is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the eourt[,]\u201d when the decision is \u201cclearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying a just result[,]\u201d when the ruling is \u201cviolative of fact and logic[,]\u201d or when it constitutes an \u201cuntenable judicial act that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>defies reason and works an injustice.\u201d <em>Powell v.

Thus, the admissibility of expert opinion \u201cis within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Blackwell v.

Based on this collection of facts and data, Acks concluded that properties with evidence of contamination had decreased in value by 60%; properties with a high probability of future contamination had decreased in value by 50%; properties with a medium probability of future contamination had decreased in value by 45%; and properties with a low probability of future contamination had decreased in value by 30%.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Petitioner challenges the admission of Acks\u2019 testimony under the third requirement of Maryland Rule 5-702, asserting that (1) the methodology underlying his diminution in value estimates was unreliable; and (2) those estimates lacked a sufficient factual basis because he ignored actual comparable sales of real property within proximity of those properties affected by the leak. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Petitioner first asserts that Acks\u2019 conclusions \u201cignored\u201d the comparable sales of forty-nine properties, five of which belonged to plaintiffs, located near or within a half-mile radius of the strike line. Comparable sales are often utilized in determining fair market value of single-family residential properties, and \u201cha[ve] long been accepted in Maryland.\u201d <em>Albright, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>433 Md. at 423, 71 A.3d at 103; <em>Bern-Shaw Ltd.

City of Balt., </em>236 Md. 66, 202 A.2d 335 (1964)) (discussing use of comparable sales in condemnation cases). The use of comparable sales data, however, is not the only methodology accepted to appraise the fair market value of a residential property. <em>See Albright, </em>433 Md. at 423-24, 71 A.3d at 103-04. The record indicates that, rather than ignoring the data of comparable sales in the strike line area, Acks thought the comparable sales were of minimal use to his assessment of the value of Respondents\u2019 properties, either because (1) the four properties sold by plaintiffs since the leak were \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and thus not indicative necessarily of the overall diminution in value of the other properties, or (2) the lack of pre-leak appraisals for the other approximately forty-five properties<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> sold by non-parties between the date of the leak and the date of trial was not available, and he believed it was impossible to conduct an accurate appraisal based only on sales price.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Acks recognized thus the existence of the comparable sales data and explained his reasons for rejecting or minimizing the utility of that information in his appraisal calculations, rather than completely rejecting the use of such data, as alleged by Petitioner.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We agree with the view of Judge Zarnoch of the Court of Special Appeals in the present case, that \u201cthere is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>support in Maryland case law for the proposition that a <em>reasoned decision </em>not to incorporate such data, <em>due to the particular circumstances of the case, </em>mandates the exclusion of the expert\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 29-30, 40 A.3d at 531 (Zarnoch, J.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Likewise, the exclusion of market fluctuations in Acks\u2019 appraisals did not render his testimony inadmissible. Acks considered the data of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Baltimore County housing market provided by the Maryland Association of Realtors, but concluded that, as the market went up in 2006 and 2007, but dropped in 2008, the fluctuations were not helpful in his assessments. Petitioner\u2019s claim that Acks did not reach the same conclusions as its own expert, based on the same data, is a \u201ccritique going to the weight, not the admissibility, of Acks\u2019 testimony. [Petitioner] properly addressed it during cross-examination of Acks and its direct examination of its own property value expert.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 28-29, 40 A.3d at 530. (Zarnoch, J). We therefore conclude that Acks\u2019 testimony was admissible, despite his minimization of market fluctuation data.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Lastly, we examine Petitioner\u2019s assertion that Acks\u2019 methodology rendered his testimony inadmissible. Petitioner contends that Acks used \u201c \u2018combined\u2019 aspects of various methodologies,\u201d instead of a single commonly accepted appraisal method. To constitute reliable methodology, \u201can expert opinion must provide a sound reasoning process for inducing its conclusion from the factual data\u201d and must have \u201can adequate theory or rational explanation of how the factual data led to the expert\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 202-03, 858 A.2d at 1071. The explanation must not be conclusory, or constitute a \u201cbecause I say so\u201d approach. <em>Wood v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>134 Md.App. 512, 525, 760 A.2d 315, 323 (2000) (concluding that the trial judge had not erred in excluding an expert\u2019s opinion where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>expert determined that the cause of the plaintiffs injuries was the size and location of the vent holes in an air bag in a motor vehicle, but provided no rational explanation why such information had anything to do with the injuries sustained).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Acks stated that he employed a combination of methods because, in his experience, the leak presented an unusual situation requiring several methods to obtain the most accurate appraisal of the leak-impacted properties. Further, he cited a peer-reviewed publication that recommended the use of several \u201ctechniques\u201d of valuation in instances of toxic substance contamination of groundwater in rural areas.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> In contrast to the expert testifying for the respondents in <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 422-26, 71 A.3d at 102-05 (where he relied on a nuanced view of \u201cmarket price\u201d and informal interviews with real estate agents to conduct his estimations), Acks testified that his methodology included the peer-reviewed PCB contamination study and other studies, such as one assessing, by surveying potential buyers, how an underground storage tank leak impacted the value of residential properties.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Acks considered also a study that examined the effect of pre-sale environmental disclosure requirements, from which he concluded that \u201ca lot of people use data points to come up with relatively low value diminutions which really aren\u2019t very relevant because [potential buyers] don\u2019t know about the contamination or don\u2019t understand it.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Respondents\u2019 expert\u2019s testimony indicates that, although he did not identify a peer-reviewed article sanctioning the exact combination of methods he employed, he provided a \u201csound reasoning process\u201d for how his methodology produced his appraisals of the diminution in value of Respondents\u2019 properties. <em>See CSX Transp., </em>159 Md.App. at 202, 858 A.2d at 1071. As Judge Zarnoch explained aptly for the unanimous Court of Special Appeals in banc panel, \u201c[r]eal estate appraisal is not an exact science in the same way as automobile engineering or DNA comparison. [Petitioner] raises legitimate concerns about Acks\u2019s methods, but these criticisms go to the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 31, 40 A.3d at 532 (citing <em>Thomassen Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Goldbaum, </em>45 Md.App. 297, 305, 413 A.2d 218, 223 (1980) (concluding that \u201cappellant\u2019s complaints about the manner in which [an expert witness] derived and stated his opinion as to value go to the weight to be accorded his testimony rather than to its admissibility.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">For expert testimony to be admissible, his or her conclusions must be based on a sound reasoning process explaining how the expert arrived at those conclusions. Here, Acks\u2019 calculations included consideration of market fluctuations and recognition of comparable sales data, using a combination of reasonably explained methods, but did not reach the same conclusions as Petitioner\u2019s experts based on that information. The trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in finding Acks\u2019 testimony admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">C. Respondents May Not Recover Emotional Distress for Injury to Real Property, But May Recover for Damages for Diminution in Property Value</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">1. Emotional Distress Damages for Injury to Real Property</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In addition to recovering for emotional distress damages for fear of cancer, Respondents sought and recovered damages for the diminution in value of their properties; the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties; nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>due to annoyance, embarrassment, inability to use their yards, noise, dust, and unusual traffic; and, anxiety about the loss in value of their properties. Petitioner challenges these judgments in its conditional cross-petition, arguing that Maryland law denies compensation for emotional distress resulting from damage (or fear of damage) to property. Petitioner therefore asks us to adopt Judge James Eyler\u2019s dissenting and concurring opinion in <em>Ford </em>reversing the emotional distress awards and allowing only thirty-five of the Respondents to pursue emotional distress claims at a new trial. In light of our decision in <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 395-98, 71 A.3d at 86-88, we hold that Maryland law does not recognize ordinarily recovery for emotional distress resulting from injury to real property, and therefore reverse all judgments of such awards to all Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We recognized in <em>Albright </em>that ordinarily, absent evidence of fraud or malice in the underlying tort, emotional distress resulting from property damage (or fear of property damage) is not compensable in Maryland. <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 396-97, 71 A.3d at 87; <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 101, 40 A.3d at 573 (Eyler, J., concurring and dissenting in part). <em>See also H &amp; R Block, Inc. v. Testerman, </em>275 Md. 36, 48-49, 338 A.2d 48, 55 (1975), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), (recognizing that \u201cMaryland decisions have generally denied compensation for mental anguish resulting from damage to property\u201d); <em>Zeigler v. F. Street Corp., </em>248 Md. 223, 226, 235 A.2d 703, 705 (1967) (emotional distress damages attendant to injury to property may be recovered only where there is fraud or malice). As the jury rendered judgment in favor of Petitioner for Respondents\u2019 claims of fraud <em>(see supra </em>Section V of procedural history), the judgments for emotional distress damages related to fear of lost property value entered for the Respondents were erroneous. Those awards are therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">2. Recovery for Diminution in Property Value</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">When trial began, Petitioners sought damages for diminution in their properties\u2019 market values and the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>use and enjoyment, with each owner claiming damages for the difference between the fair market value of property before disclosure of the leak and its fair market value after disclosure. The evidence at trial focused on the post-leak value because the parties stipulated to the pre-leak value of those properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">First, we note that Andrea Greco and Veronica Greco withdrew their claims for property damages and resulting diminution in value. Nonetheless, they received property damages equal to the full pre-leak value of their property. Thus, the Circuit Court erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV with respect to the Grecos\u2019 claims. We reverse that judgment and remand to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to remand to the Circuit Court for the entry of judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Second, in light of <em>Albright, </em>those Respondents here who owned or resided in non-detect properties<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> failed similarly to show a substantial interference sufficient to sustain actions for nuisance, trespass, negligence, or strict liability. <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 409-15, 71 A.3d at 95-98. Apart from complaints of modest disturbances (such as using bottled water, reducing the use of outdoor spaces, or taking shorter baths and showers) and allegations that their properties are tainted by perceived stigma, the evidence indicates that any adjustments Respondents made to the use of their properties was out of fear of possible contamination. As their properties lacked any tangible evidence of contamination, such fear is not objectively reasonable for purposes of making a prima facie showing of nuisance. <em>Id. </em>at 412-14, 71 A.3d at 97. There was no evidence that Respondents were deprived of any part of their properties or that Exxon\u2019s remediation efforts and the consequences of the leak impaired greatly Respondents use and enjoyment of their properties. Hence, \u201c[i]n the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>physical injury to property resulting from Exxon\u2019s actions, [Respondents] must demonstrate more than modest adjustments in their use of their real property resulting from the leak in order to establish nuisance.\u201d <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 411, 71 A.3d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Third, as the remaining Respondents requested damages for diminution in value based on the difference between their properties\u2019 pre-leak fair market value and fair post-leak market value (essentially, full compensation for a permanent injury), we presume that Respondents\u2019 property damage claims were based on their properties\u2019 allegedly permanent diminutions in value. The evidence presented at trial \u2014 namely, Acks\u2019 expert testimony, the evidence of contamination as to some of Respondents\u2019 properties, the evidence and testimony of Petitioner\u2019s experts that there was substantial value retained by Respondents\u2019 properties \u2014 raises a question for the jury as to whether Respondents sustained damages for diminution in value, in light of our holdings in <em>Albright. </em>Hence, we hold, on remand, that those Respondents may recover only for damages to their property resulting in diminution of his or her property\u2019s market value, in light of our decision in <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 395-426, 71 A.3d at 86-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">D. Respondents\u2019 Lay Testimony Lacked Value Probative of Diminution in Market Value</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Petitioner asserts that the jury\u2019s finding that each property was \u201cworthless\u201d was contrary to all of the evidence. Petitioner maintains, and we agree, there was evidence showing that: Respondents\u2019 properties retained some market value after disclosure of the leak; although two of the eight Respondents who decided to sell their homes post-leak were unsuccessful,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> four were successful in selling their properties;<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> evidence showed that owners of ten properties were able to procure refinancing; and approximately forty-five properties sold by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>non-parties within the Jacksonville strike line were sold for substantial prices after public disclosure of the leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Petitioner argues that the lay witness testimony had no probative value \u2014 or if it did, that value was limited to the homes of those owners.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We hold that none of the Respondents\u2019 lay testimony had any probative value as to the measure of damages for diminution in property value and, thus, that the lay testimony was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the Respondents\u2019 properties were worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Owners of seventy-three of the eighty-seven properties involved presently in this litigation testified as to their own opinion of their properties\u2019 post-leak value or as to the marketability of other properties in the neighborhood.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> These owners either expressed no opinion on the value of their properties,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> or testified that (1) their property diminished in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>value by some unspecified percentage; <footnotemark>79</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> (2) they believed that their properties were worthless;<footnotemark>81</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> or (3) that the owners were unwilling to sell for \u201cmoral\u201d reasons.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> While some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Respondents stated that their neighbors could not sell their properties after publicity about the leak, other Respondents testified that they had tried unsuccessfully to sell their homes. Almost all of the Respondents opined that the news coverage of the leak created a \u201cstigma\u201d on their neighborhood, with some Respondents reporting that there was \u201can absolute stigma about real estate in the area.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The reasons provided by the Respondents for the diminution in value of their homes were: (1) the lack of or diminished safety and convenience due to actual contamination of their properties\u2019 wells and the potential risk for future contamination; (2) contamination-induced stigma associated with the neighborhood; and, (3) the inconvenient and unsightly remediation efforts.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Respondents described what they believed were the post-leak value of their properties; however, their testimony was not probative to measure damages for a property\u2019s diminution in value. Rather, such damages in a claimed toxic contamination situation must be measured by the <em>market </em>value of property' \u2014 a definite valuation produced by analysis of the property in relation to any impact produced by contamination. <em>See Albright, </em>433 Md. at 420-21, 423, 71 A.3d at 101-02, 103. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>This valuation may generally be made reliably only by expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21, 71 A.3d at 101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">A landowner who testifies as to the value of his or her property is \u201cnot opining as to market value but rather is opining as to the effect of the contamination of the landowner\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 151, 40 A.3d at 602 (J., Eyler, J., concurring and dissenting.). It is well established that expert testimony is not required \u201con matters of which the jurors would be aware by virtue of common knowledge.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs., </em>109 Md.App. 217, 257, 674 A.2d 106, 125-26 (1996) (citing <em>Babylon v. Scruton, </em>215 Md. 299, 307, 138 A.2d 375, 379 (1958)). As we recognized in <em>Albright, </em>the effect of contamination on a property\u2019s value is ordinarily beyond common knowledge and therefore requires expert testimony. <em>See </em>433 Md. at 420-21, 71 A.3d at 101-02; <em>see Ford, </em>204 Md.App. at 151, 40 A.3d at 602 (J.

Masterwear Corp., </em>569 F.3d 673, 676 (7th Cir.2009) (concluding that, even though a property owner knew his property value at certain time periods, he could not offer a responsible opinion about the cause of a change in the value of his property; rather, the landowner needed evidence by a real estate agent or real estate appraiser to establish the contamination effect on his property\u2019s value); <em>Hous. Auth. v. Suydam Investors, </em>355 N.J.Super. 530, 810 A.2d 1137, 1149-50 (Ct.App.Div.2002), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>177 N.J. 2, 826 A.2d 673 (2003) (\u201c[T]he effect of environmental contamination upon a property\u2019s value must be determined on the basis of expert appraisal evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Respondents\u2019 testimony indicated that they believed their properties had decreased in value, but did not offer substantive valuations. Instead, several Respondents asserted in a conclusory fashion that they could not sell their properties in good conscience, and they believed therefore that their properties had zero sale value. While lay testimony may be relevant to any possible loss of use and enjoyment suffered in conjunction with Respondents\u2019 property damage claims, it offered no probative value as to the diminution in value claims. None of the Respondents \u2014 even those who identified themselves as real estate agents \u2014 testified as offered-and-accepted experts, and none testified based on any relevant training or expertise to accredit their lay opinions. While almost all Respondents maintained that a stigma was associated with their properties because of the leak, there was no evidence that there such stigma was permanent, which would be relevant to their claims of nuisance and the level of substantial interference. <em>See Albright, </em>433 Md. at 411-13, 71 A.3d at 96-97. Even Respondents\u2019 expert, as discussed above, testified that the properties retained some value after the leak. <em>See </em>Section V.B of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">No evidence in this record supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Respondents\u2019 properties became worthless in terms of market value as a result of the leak; however, there is evidence that the properties suffered diminution in value. The trial court erred, however, in not performing an individualized assessment of each verdict in ruling on the motion for new trial or remittitur. Therefore, we hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial was legally incorrect. We reverse the judgments in favor of Respondents who received awards despite owning or residing on non-detect properties. We reverse the jury\u2019s verdicts as to the remaining property diminution damage judgments, and direct remand of those cases for a new trial in light of our opinion here and in <em>Albright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

The histoiy of this gasoline leak is explained in detail in <em>Albright. </em>433 Md. at 316-27, 71 A.3d at 37-45. To summarize, a leak from underground service lines at the Exxon Mobil-owned gasoline service station occurred on 13 January 2006. A contractor who responded to an electronic alarm surmised incorrectly that a pump motor triggered the alarm, replaced the pump motor, and caused incidentally the leak detection system to require recalibration. Because the system was recalibrated improperly, it failed to detect the continuing leak when placed back in service. On 16 February 2006, the service station operator reported a possible leak based an inventory discrepancy. The service station was shut down thereafter. On February 17, Exxon confirmed the existence of the leak, which amounted to approximately 26,000 gallons of gasoline, and notified the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). In conjunction with and under the supervision of the MDE, Exxon initiated remediation efforts, including constructing monitoring and/or recovery wells used to monitor and recover contaminants. These remediation efforts are described in <em>Albright,</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\">. MTBE is a toxic substance found in gasoline. Since 1979, MTBE has been added to gasoline to reduce emissions of air pollutants from exhaust systems. There are no human studies indicating the MTBE is a proven carcinogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\u201d) has identified MTBE as a possible carcinogen, in large doses, but not at low exposure levels. Based on the absence of proven scientific studies showing that MTBE is a human carcinogen, the EPA has not set a maximum contaminant level (\"MCL\u201d), but instead has established a maximum MTBE level at 20-40 parts per billion (\"ppb\u201d) based on the substance's unpleasant taste and odor at and beyond that level. The EPA has recognized that a range of 20-40 ppb provides \"a large margin of exposure (safety) from toxic effects.\u201d United States Environmental Protection Agency, Drinking Water Advisory: Consumer Acceptability Advice and Health Effects Analysis on Methyl TertiaryButyl Ether (MTBE) 2 (1997). The MDE has adopted likewise an MCL of 20 ppb for MTBE based on the chemical's unpleasant odor and taste at and beyond that level, but has noted that any contamination above the 20 ppb level is a matter of \"concern.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 26.10.02.03(B)(3)(e). MCL standards for MTBE are different across the states, with some lower and some higher than those adopted by the EPA and MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Benzene is a toxic chemical classified as a carcinogen.

RUDO: Well, Number one, they were most certainly exposed. They had the positive [well] tests, you know, had exposure to a chemical that we consider more likely than not to be carcinogenic. Because we also consider it to be more likely than not a mutagenic chemical that can change DNA, that that implies that in essence <em>there is no safe level; there is no safe level in terms of exposure time and there is no safe level in terms of the amount of chemical that is there.

We concluded that the Court of Special Appeals may have an institutional interest in the resolution of this question, if reached by this Court. Thus, on 26 June 2012, we issued an order inviting the Attorney General of Maryland to submit an <em>Amicus Curiae </em>brief to address questions concerning the Court of Special Appeals's in banc procedure in the present case. We specified in the order that the Attorney General's brief \"on behalf of the Court of Special Appeals\u201d address only the issues raised by Respondents regarding the procedural posture of the intermediate appellate court's in banc decision, not the substantive merits of the case.

Between the time that the three-judge panel heard argument in January 2011 and the in banc hearing in September 2011, the Maryland Judicial Ethics Committee published an opinion in response to requests from three undisclosed appellate judges who questioned whether they should participate in an appeal involving a corporate appellant-litigant in which two of the judges owned stock and in which the third had held recently stock that the judge had since sold. <em>See </em>16 August 2011 Maryland Judicial Ethics Committee Opinion in Request Nos.2011-19, 2011-20, 2011-21. The ethics opinion disclosed that the appeal in question was from a judgment in \u201cthe amount of $147 million.\u201d The Committee opined that these interests did not amount to express grounds for disqualification, but that the judges may wish to consider whether recusal was appropriate based on a risk of a potential perception of impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. Judge Ellen M. Hollander, formerly an incumbent judge on the intermediate appellate court, was selected for a federal district court judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Her vacancy on the state court was filled by Judge Stuart R. Berger, who was appointed in December 2011. Neither Judge Hollander nor Judge Berger participated in the court\u2019s consideration of the appeal in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. The Attorney General explained persuasively in its <em>Amicus Curiae </em>brief this particular ground for our review of the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Sessions; panels; hearings in banc.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">(b) <em>Panels. </em>\u2014 A case before the Court of Special Appeals shall be heard by a panel of not less than three judges.

This approach, as explained in its <em>Amicus Curiae </em>brief, is one of the Attorney General\u2019s suggested resolutions to this procedural issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">.

We disagree, primarily because <em>Lee </em>and the present case arise from two distinctly different procedural backgrounds. In <em>Lee, </em>the Court of Special Appeals was evenly divided on one issue, and therefore affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Here, Respondents maintain that the decision of the intermediate appellate court is rendered null by its lack of majority concurrence of a seven-member majority. <em>Id. Lee </em>does not support the reasoning of Respondents\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">. Respondents contend also that the in banc panel did not constitute a quorum of the eligible voting members. Section 1-403(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article defines a quorum of an in banc panel as six members. As there were nine members of the intermediate appellate court who heard and decided the instant appeal, we need not address further this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">.

Twelve properly owners questioned his or her property's value, stating they would not sell or that no sane person would buy, without actually stating that the property was worthless. Their explanations ran a gamut: (1) no sane person would buy the property, (2) the person testifying would not buy it if they did not live there and were looking for a house, and (3) the person testifying would not sell it either because he or she did not want to move or, as a matter of conscience and good morals, would refuse to sell it to anyone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"81\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">.

Another Respondent (not Ford), who was also a real estate agent, opined that there was a stigma associated with the Jacksonville area. Another Respondent asserted that potential buyers would not consider his property even if he decided to sell, while others testified that even though they desired to sell, they felt they could not do so because any sale price would be insufficient to pay their home mortgages.
