As we shall explain, in this case the answer to that question is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The facts giving rise to this appeal are not complicated. Petitioner Robert Oku was convicted in the District Court of Maryland in Montgomery County, and again in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on the charge of second-degree assault. The crime occurred on July 21, 2011. On that day, Petitioner attacked Santos Mijango in the elevator of Mijango\u2019s apartment building in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Mijango testified at the trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court that Petitioner was inside the elevator when he entered the elevator on the first floor. Before Mijango could press the elevator button for his floor, Petitioner punched the left side of Mijango\u2019s face, then hit him a second time. Mijango fell to the ground. The next thing he remembered was getting up and going to his apartment to find his wife. By the time Mijango and his wife went downstairs to call the police, the police had responded to the lobby of the apartment building. Mijango sustained injuries to his head and face as a result of the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Petitioner was charged with second-degree assault and reckless endangerment in connection with that incident. The case came on for trial in District Court. At that proceeding, Petitioner, testifying on his own behalf, admitted to having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>punched Mijango.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner was convicted of both charges. Petitioner exercised his right, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), to have his case tried <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Before the start of that trial, Petitioner waived his right to a jury. He also made a motion <em>in limine </em>to have the Circuit Court exclude the testimony he gave at the District Court proceeding. The Circuit Court denied the motion, concluding that the <em>de novo </em>system did not require the court to ignore testimony previously given under oath in a District Court trial, as long as the proper foundation could be laid for its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Mijango, testifying as the State\u2019s sole witness, identified Petitioner as his attacker. The State then moved for the introduction of a certified recording of Petitioner\u2019s testimony from the District Court trial. Petitioner objected, arguing that both the nature of the <em>de novo </em>trial and his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination barred the State\u2019s use of his testimony in District Court during its case-in-chief. The court overruled the objection, reasoning that the admission of Petitioner\u2019s testimony in District Court did not run afoul of the hearsay rules and, insofar as the court could determine, there was no rule or statute prohibiting the introduction of a defendant\u2019s statement made at a District Court proceeding. At that point, the parties agreed simply to stipulate \u201cthat there was a prior trial below at which the defendant testified that he was the person on the elevator, that he struck Mr. Mijango [twice], and that he wasn\u2019t in fear \u2014 in other words, there was no self defense issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The Circuit Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the reckless endangerment charge, and, relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>on Petitioner\u2019s District Court testimony and Mijango\u2019s in-court identification of Petitioner, found him guilty of second-degree assault. Following imposition of sentence on a later date, Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, pursuant to CJ \u00a7\u00a7 12-305 and 12-307. We issued the writ, <em>Oku v. State, </em>428 Md. 543, 52 A.3d 978 (2012), to answer the following questions, as posed by Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">1. Whether Petitioner\u2019s right to a <em>de novo </em>appeal of his District Court conviction under Maryland Code \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was violated when Petitioner\u2019s testimony from the District Court trial was admitted into evidence in his Circuit Court trial, effectively nullifying Petitioner\u2019s ability to have a \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d and relieving the State of its burden to present evidence and prove Petitioner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">2. Whether Petitioner\u2019s due process rights, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, were violated when Petitioner\u2019s testimony from the District Court trial was admitted into evidence in his Circuit Court trial, thus denying him the full benefit of the process that must be afforded him under the <em>de novo </em>system?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In briefing his argument on the second question, Petitioner set forth three separate grounds in support of why, in his view, the Circuit Court committed legal error in allowing the State to use Petitioner\u2019s inculpatory testimony at his District Court trial during the State\u2019s case-in-chief at the trial <em>de novo. </em>Petitioner grounded his argument on the following constitutionally-based protections: (1) the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination; (2) the rights to counsel and to present a defense of his choosing, embodied by the Sixth Amendment; and (3) the Fourteenth Amendment entitlement to due process. Petitioner, however, raised in the Circuit Court only the argument based on the Fifth Amendment privilege. He made no mention of either the Sixth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, or any argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>based on those Constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a consequence, only Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument is properly preserved for appellate review, and it is only that argument we shall address. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The issues raised by this appeal implicate the <em>de novo </em>system for adjudicating less serious criminal cases in Maryland. We therefore begin by examining that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The District Court of Maryland was created in 1971 following ratification of a constitutional amendment by the voters of the state. <em>See </em>Md. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 41A through 41-I; CJ \u00a7 1-601 <em>et seq.; </em>Chapter 789 of the Acts of 1969; Chapter 528 of the Acts of 1970. This uniform, limited jurisdiction tier<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Maryland\u2019s state court system replaced the \u201chodgepodge of magistrates, justices of the peace, People\u2019s Courts, the Municipal Court of Baltimore City and the Housing Court of Baltimore County.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Giordano, </em>16 Md.App. 264, 267, 295 A.2d 881 (1972). Yet, the right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court on appeal from a judgment of a court of limited jurisdiction long predates the inception of the District Court. <em>See, e.g., McDonald v. State, </em>314 Md. 271, 275, 550 A.2d 696 (1988) (\u201cHistorically, review of decisions rendered in courts of limited jurisdiction have been subject to de novo review in the circuit courts.\u201d); <em>Harper v. State, </em>312 Md. 396, 404-05, 540 A.2d 124 (1988) (\u201cAn appeal from a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>court of limited jurisdiction to a trial court of general jurisdiction in Maryland has traditionally meant a trial de novo in the latter court.\u201d); <em>Borden Mining Co. v. Barry, </em>17 Md. 419, 428-29 (1861) (\u201cUnder our law regulating appeals from judgments of justices of the peace, the cause is taken up <em>de novo </em>in the appellate court, and disposed of in the same manner as if no judgment had been rendered----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The right of <em>de novo </em>appeal persists today. \u201cA defendant convicted in the District Court of Maryland is guaranteed a right to appeal that conviction to the circuit court.\u201d <em>Garrison v. State, </em>350 Md. 128, 135, 711 A.2d 170 (1998). \u201c[I]n an appeal from the District Court, when a criminal defendant requests an appeal de novo, he generally receives a new trial virtually automatically; whether the appeal is meritorious is simply not relevant in that context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 711 A.2d 170; <em>see Burch v. State, </em>278 Md. 426, 428, 365 A.2d 577 (1976) (noting that Maryland law \u201cgrants to a criminal defendant, without qualification, the right to appeal from a final judgment in the District Court\u201d); <em>see generally </em>CJ \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 through 12-404 (\u201cReview of Decisions of District Court\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CJ \u00a7 12-401(f) explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>De novo and on record appeals. </em>\u2014 In a civil case in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees if attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable by law or contract, in any matter arising under \u00a7 4-401(7)(ii) of this article, and in any case in which the parties so agree, an appeal shall be heard on the record made in the District Court. <em>In every other case, including a criminal case in which sentence has been imposed or suspended following a plea of nolo contendere or guilty, and an appeal in a municipal infraction or Code violation case, an appeal shall be tried de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">(Second emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 7-102 (describing \u201c[mjodes of appeal\u201d from a District Court judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We have recognized that \u201cthe historical reason most frequently assigned for perpetuating de novo appeals, following the creation of the District Court of Maryland, is to enable persons who could not afford a transcript of the record the opportunity to have adverse judgments rendered by the District Court subject to a second look.\u201d <em>Huff v. State, </em>325 Md. 55, 72, 599 A.2d 428 (1991). Despite criticism of the <em>de novo </em>system, both past and present,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cthe legislature\u2019s commitment to de novo review has remained.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>314 Md. at 277, 550 A.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u201cIt is generally accepted that [the term] \u2018de novo\u2019 means \u2018afresh\u2019 or \u2018anew.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardy v. State, </em>279 Md. 489, 492, 369 A.2d 1043 (1977). Indeed, allowing a trial <em>de novo </em>gives a criminal defendant a \u201cbrand new bite at the apple,\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>350 Md. at 138, 711 A.2d 170, \u201cas if charges had not been heard before and no decision had been rendered,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 136, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>711 A.2d 170 (quoting <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>319 Md. 674, 681, 574 A.2d 918 (1990)). A defendant convicted in District Court can invoke his right to a trial <em>de novo </em>as an added layer of protection, forcing the State twice to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cf. Justices of Boston Mun.Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 312, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984) (describing the advantages of Massachusetts\u2019s then-in-effect two-tier trial system, including that \u201ca defendant is given two opportunities to be acquitted on the facts\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In providing for the right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court in criminal cases, \u201cthe Legislature intended that the appeal be treated as an original circuit court proceeding.\u201d <em>Hardy, </em>279 Md. at 494-95, 369 A.2d 1043. \u201cThe common meaning of a de novo hearing is a \u2018new hearing of a matter, conducted as if the original hearing had not taken place\u2019 and requires a \u2018reviewing court\u2019s decision of a matter anew, giving no deference to a lower court\u2019s findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marcus J., </em>405 Md. 221, 234, 950 A.2d 787 (2008) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 738 (8th ed.2004)). The Circuit Court at the trial <em>de novo </em>\u201creceive[s] evidence and make[s] determinations of facts as though no prior proceeding had occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 950 A.2d 787. Consequently, \u201cthe State and the defendant, if they so choose, normally must produce evidence a second time. Additionally, the parties in the circuit court de novo trial generally neither are limited to the evidence presented at the District Court trial nor are required to present the same evidence.\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>350 Md. at 136, 711 A.2d 170 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The filing of an appeal to the Circuit Court, however, does not extinguish the District Court judgment. <em>Stanton v. State, </em>290 Md. 245, 249, 428 A.2d 1224 (1981). Rather, \u201cthe District Court judgment remains in effect pending the appeal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>circuit court, unless and until superseded by a judgment of the circuit court or a disposition by <em>nolle prosequi </em>or stet.\u201d <em>Stone v. State, </em>344 Md. 97, 104, 685 A.2d 441 (1996); <em>see </em>Md. Rule 7-112(b) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Petitioner\u2019s first argument focuses on the meaning of the term <em>\u201cde novo,\u201d </em>as it is employed in CJ \u00a7 12-401(f). In his view, the <em>de novo </em>system contemplated by the statute bars the State from using a criminal defendant\u2019s admission \u2014 made while testifying at a District Court trial \u2014 during the State\u2019s case-in-chief at the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court. Consequently, Petitioner asserts, the Circuit Court committed legal error in allowing the State to make use of his inculpatory testimony in District Court. This argument implicates a question of law, requiring us to undertake an independent review of the legal correctness of the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling, without according it any deference. Our independent assessment of the court\u2019s ruling leads us to affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Petitioner\u2019s argument relies on the notion that the trial <em>de novo </em>is a \u201cbrand new bite at the apple,\u201d <em>see Garrison, supra, </em>undertaken \u201cas if the original hearing had not taken place,\u201d <em>see Marcus </em>/., <em>supra. </em>Petitioner extrapolates from these phrases in <em>Gamson </em>and <em>Marcus J. </em>that the District Court proceedings in their entirety are rendered, in effect, a nullity, once a criminal defendant avails himself of a <em>de novo </em>appeal. Therefore, according to Petitioner, any admission a defendant makes while testifying in District Court virtually ceases to exist for purposes of the State\u2019s use of the admission during its case-in-chief in Circuit Court. As Petitioner puts it, \u201cfor all practical purposes, the District Court \u2018statement\u2019 was never made,\u201d and it \u201cis shielded from use in the Circuit Court by the design of the de novo statutory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Generally, the <em>de novo </em>\u201cappeal shall proceed in accordance with the rules governing cases instituted in the circuit court,\u201d Md. Rule 7\u2014112(d)(3), which serves to incorporate the rules of evidence that apply in Circuit Court. Petitioner urges us to adopt, in effect, an exception to those rules, which otherwise would permit the introduction at the trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court of a defendant\u2019s inculpatory testimony previously given in District Court. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Rule 5-803(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Our jurisprudence on the meaning of <em>\u201cde novo\u201d </em>and the implications of the two-tier trial system do not support the exception Petitioner seeks. We have emphasized consistently that a <em>de novo </em>appeal has the effect of ignoring the <em>judgment </em>below, but only for the limited purpose of granting a defendant, who was convicted upon trial in the District Court, a second trial. <em>See Hardy, </em>279 Md. at 493, 369 A.2d 1043 (\u201cThis Court has consistently treated de novo appeals as wholly original proceedings, that is, as if no <em>judgment </em>had been entered in the lower court.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Zitzer v. Jones, </em>48 Md. 115, 117 (1878) (\u201cOn appeals of that kind the case is tried <em>de novo, </em>the parties are not restricted to the proof given before the Justice <em>[of the </em>Peace], but the case goes on and is decided as if no <em>judgment </em>had been rendered.... \u201d (emphasis added)). At the second trial, no deference is accorded to the District Court\u2019s factual findings or legal conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sions. Yet, as we have said, the judgment itself remains in effect until the Circuit Court\u2019s final disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Supreme Court, in describing another state\u2019s two-tier trial system, has explained that, in a trial <em>de novo, </em>the \u201c[pjrosecution and defense begin anew\u201d and \u201cneither the judge nor jury that determines guilt or fixes a penalty in the trial <em>de novo </em>is in any way bound by the inferior court\u2019s <em>findings or judgment.\u201d Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 113, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972) (emphasis added) (rejecting a constitutional challenge to Kentucky\u2019s two-tier trial system). The <em>Colten </em>Court\u2019s description of Kentucky\u2019s <em>de novo </em>trial system applies with equal force to Maryland\u2019s two-tier, <em>de novo </em>trial system established by CJ \u00a7 12-401. Our <em>de novo </em>trial system provides for what is essentially a \u201cdo-over\u201d in terms of the findings of fact and judgment of guilt. Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s view of it, this statutory scheme does not call for the exclusion of testimony voluntarily given in the District Court trial, as long as that testimony is admissible under our rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In a related statutory argument, Petitioner contends that allowing the introduction of testimony given at trial in the District Court blurs the distinction between a trial <em>de novo </em>and an appeal \u201con the record.\u201d <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 12-401 (f), <em>supra. </em>Petitioner argues that the State, if allowed to use a criminal defendant\u2019s District Court testimony at the trial <em>de novo, </em>is relieved of its burden to put on its case a second time. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In contrast with those appeals from the District Court that are reviewed \u201con the record,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in a trial <em>de novo, see generally </em>Md. Rule 7-112 (\u201cAppeals heard de novo.\u201d), there is a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>finder of fact who owes no deference to the District Court\u2019s findings or conclusions. Both parties are free to present new evidence or a new theory of the case. <em>See Garrison, </em>350 Md. at 136, 711 A.2d 170. Just as occurs in trials that originate in the Circuit Court, the presiding judge at a trial <em>de novo </em>must decide the admissibility of proffered evidence by resort to the applicable evidentiary rules. Md. Rule 7-112(d)(3) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the appeal shall proceed in accordance with the rules governing cases instituted in the circuit court.\u201d). Likewise, the factfinder at a trial <em>de novo </em>makes a fresh determination of the weight to be accorded to any evidence that is admitted. In short, applying the rules of evidence to Circuit Court trials that are the result of a <em>de novo </em>appeal in the same manner as they are applied in a trial that originates in that court does not deprive a defendant of the second \u201cbite at the apple\u201d mandated by CJ \u00a7 12-401, nor does it convert a trial <em>de novo </em>into a record appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The <em>de novo </em>trial system in Maryland affords the defendant many benefits, for example, a quicker, less costly resolution of minor offenses, a chance to preview the State\u2019s case against him in District Court, and, if the defendant chooses to appeal, a second chance at acquittal. But the purpose and structure of our <em>de novo </em>system, as laid out in our statutes, rules, and caselaw, do not require the feature Petitioner seeks, that is, to have his District Court testimony ignored by the State during its case-in-chief in Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the Circuit Court was legally correct in determining that the <em>de novo </em>nature of the trial did not require disallowance of Petitioner\u2019s admission, made while testifying on his own behalf at the trial in District Court, that he assaulted the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Petitioner separately contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s allowing the State to make use of his District Court testimony during the State\u2019s case-in-chief violated the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Amendment\u2019s privilege against compelled self-incrimination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This contention, like the first, requires us to make an independent assessment of the legal correctness of the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The parties\u2019 stipulation acknowledges that Petitioner waived his Fifth Amendment privilege in District Court by testifying on his own behalf. \u201c[W]here there is no evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that the evidence so given was voluntary.\u201d <em>Henze v. State, </em>154 Md. 332, 347, 140 A. 218 (1928). There has been no suggestion that Petitioner\u2019s decision to testify in the District Court was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Petitioner acknowledges \u201cthe general evidentiary rule that a defendant\u2019s testimony at a former trial is admissible in evidence against him in later proceedings.\u201d <em>Harrison v. United States, </em>392 U.S. 219, 222, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968). Indeed, \u201c[a] defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives.\u201d <em>Id.; see Edmonds v. United States, </em>273 F.2d 108, 112-13 (D.C.Cir.1959) (\u201cThe fact that the defendant does not take the stand at the second trial does not prevent the use of his testimony given at the former trial, if it would otherwise be admissible.\u201d); <em>Henze, </em>154 Md. at 347, 140 A. 218 (holding that, when a defendant had testified at a former trial \u201cof his own volition,\u201d the testimony is admissible at a later proceeding). \u201cIf this were not so, voluntary confessions could never be used where the accused declines to take the stand.\u201d <em>Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 144, 88 A.2d 556 (1952) (describing the Court\u2019s holding in Henze). Thus, Petitioner does not dispute that, in the normal course, when a Circuit Court judgment is reversed on appeal and remanded for a new trial, any testimony voluntarily made by the defendant at the prior Circuit Court trial could be admitted against him in the retrial without offending the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Instead, Petitioner argues that a trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court is unlike a retrial after appellate reversal, such that the application of the <em>Harrison </em>rule here would violate the Fifth Amendment. In Petitioner\u2019s view, the Circuit Court\u2019s allowing the State to introduce his District Court testimony during the State\u2019s case-in-chief effectively forces him to waive in Circuit Court the privilege against compelled self-incrimination and renders compelled, post hoc, the testimony he gave in District Court. In support, Petitioner cites <em>Hardy v. State, </em>279 Md. 489, 369 A.2d 1043 (1977), for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s de facto waiver of a fundamental right in District Court \u2014 here, waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege by the election to testify \u2014 cannot be held against the defendant when he requests a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We examined in <em>Hardy </em>the effect of a defendant\u2019s decision to proceed to trial in District Court on the exercise of that defendant\u2019s right to a jury in the trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court. Lillian Hardy was charged in District Court with shoplifting goods valued at less than $100, a misdemeanor. <em>Id. </em>at 491, 369 A.2d 1043. Because the maximum punishment for that offense was more than three months, she was entitled to demand a jury trial and have her case removed to Circuit Court. <em>Id. See </em>CJ \u00a7 4-302(e), <em>supra </em>note 4. She did not exercise that right, and instead was tried and convicted in District Court. <em>Hardy, </em>279 Md. at 492, 369 A.2d 1043. In her trial <em>de novo </em>in Circuit Court, the court denied her request for a jury trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On appeal to this Court, the State argued that Ms. Hardy\u2019s failure to \u201celect[] to have her case removed to the circuit court for a jury trial\u201d from the District Court \u201camounted to a waiver of her right to a jury trial on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 369 A.2d 1043. We rejected that argument, observing that \u201cthe Legislature intended that the <em>[de novo </em>] appeal be treated as an original circuit court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 369 A.2d 1043. We held that \u201ca criminal defendant, appealing from a District Court judgment, has a right to a trial by jury in the circuit court de novo proceedings regardless of the seriousness of the criminal charges or whether he or she could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>elected a jury trial\u201d under CJ \u00a7 4-302. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 369 A.2d 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><em>Hardy </em>is inapposite to the case before us. Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself was alive and well in the Circuit Court, notwithstanding that he had chosen to waive the privilege in District Court by electing to testify at that trial. Petitioner in fact elected to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to testify in Circuit Court and so could not be forced to take the stand or bear witness against himself at that proceeding. Petitioner\u2019s District Court testimony, not compelled at the time it was given, did not transform into compelled testimony when later introduced in Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We view Petitioner\u2019s situation at the trial <em>de novo </em>to be no different, in this respect, than that of a defendant who faces retrial after reversal of the prior conviction on appeal. The applicable rule in the latter situation was well expressed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in <em>Edmonds: \u201c[A] </em>defendant in a criminal case who takes the stand in his own behalf and testifies without asserting his privilege against self-incrimination thereby waives the privilege as to the testimony given so that it may be used against him in a subsequent trial of the same case.\u201d 273 F.2d at 112-13. We see no good reason, and Petitioner has given us none, for applying any different rule to the situation in which he found himself. Petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument fails, as does his argument grounded in the text of CJ \u00a7 12-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
