He argues that it should \u201conly be applied where the offense of conviction involved causing, transporting, permitting, or seeking by notice or advertisement a minor to participate in the production of the child pornography.\u201d Miller further asserts that his postings on the Internet were not part of the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-15\">Miller pled guilty to the charges alleged in the indictment: (1) transporting computer visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and (2) possession of computer disks containing depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-16\">Miller stipulated in the plea agreement that he had used electronic mail to solicit teenage boys to engage in sexual activity. The agreement includes exhibits of two such electronic messages sent to Internet newsgroups. The first message described the sexual activities Miller was allegedly willing to perform on teenage boys. The message concluded with the statement, \u201c[e]-mail me at <em>Dad4Lad@Hotmail.com </em>for immediate sucking. Let me satisfy you.\u201d The second message read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-17\">[I]\u2019m a 35 yo wm, seeking young teens for friendship, possibly more ... [I] can travel to surrounding areas of [Cjolumbus to pick you up and spend time with you ... [I]f you like to show yourself off, have your picture taken, be video taped alone or with a friend e-mail me even sooner. [I]f you\u2019re interested in making a buck well, we can discuss that when we come to it. [Hjope to hear from as many of you as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-18\">Exhibit B at R.l. This message also contained a return electronic mail address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-19\">The probation officer determined that the guideline for Miller\u2019s offense is found in \u00a7 2G2.2, which provides for a base offense level of 17. In light of the electronic mail messages, however, the probation officer applied the cross-reference in \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l), which provides that \u201c[i]f the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct, apply [the base offense level in] \u00a7 2G2.1.\u201d As a result, Miller\u2019s base offense level rose from 17 to 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-20\">Miller objected to the application of the cross-reference, arguing that (1) the electronic mail messages only constituted mail, rather than a notice or advertisement and (2) no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>reasonable nexus connected the electronic messages and the counts of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AKSd\">The district court summarily overruled Miller\u2019s objection and adopted the findings and guideline application in the Pre-Sen-tence Investigation. Based on a guideline range of 63 to 78 months, the court sentenced Miller to a total of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"AURL\">On appeal, Miller contends that the district-court erred in applying the cross-reference contained in \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l). He argues that it should \u201conly be applied where the offense of conviction involved causing, transporting, permitting, or seeking by notice or advertisement a minor to participate in the production of the child pornography\u201d (emphasis in original). Miller asserts that the electronic mail messages were not part of the offenses of conviction, nor were they relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) as they did not occur during the commission of, or in preparation for, the offense of conviction. Miller further points out that the offenses of conviction were not grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2; thus, they could not be considered relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Miller also argues, for the first time, that the \u201cpostings\u201d on the Internet newsgroups are not electronic mail messages, the listed newsgroups are not normally accessed by children, and the \u201cpostings\u201d do not include a method to respond to the author. The government responds that the district court properly applied the cross reference in calculating Miller\u2019s offense level. It argues that the transmission of electronic messages by Miller, an act to which he stipulated in the plea agreement, qualifies as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. As such, the government asserts that the court correctly considered conduct not covered by the counts of conviction in determining Miller\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"AasC\">In reply, Miller \u201cacknowledges having posted two [electronic mail messages] to newsgroups.\u201d He argues, however, \u201c[t]his activity does not set forth a new, more serious offense, as the government alleges.\u201d Further, Miller asserts that nowhere in the plea agreement did he stipulate that the return electronic mail addresses belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"ATby\">Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2, which pertains to \u201cTrafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor,\u201d carries a base offense level of 17, compared to a base offense level of 27 under \u00a7 2G2.1, which pertains to \u201cSexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material.\u201d The cross-reference provision provides, \u201c[i]f the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct, apply [the base offense level in] \u00a7 2G2.1.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l). Under the sentencing guidelines, \u201c[a] plea agreement ... containing a stipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additional offense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additional count(s) charging those offense(s).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"Aazp\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, but <em>de novo </em>review applies to the court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Pompey, </em>17 F.3d 351, 353 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"A_q6\">In this case, the district court did not <em>err in </em>applying the cross-reference in \u00a7 2G2.2 to adjust Miller\u2019s base offense level from 17 to 27. Contrary to Miller\u2019s argument, the term \u201coffense,\u201d as used in the cross-reference, includes both charged and uncharged offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment., backg\u2019d; <em>see also United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1010 (11th Cir.1994). Although the government did not charge Miller with any offenses arising out of the use of electronic mail, Miller did acknowledge in the plea agreement that he had used electronic mail to solicit teenagers to engage in sexual activity. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>6 F.3d 715, 718-19 (11th Cir.1993) (uncharged offenses stipulated in the plea agreement \u201care treated as if they were additional counts of conviction for sentencing purposes\u201d).' Thus, the district court properly used the uncharged conduct in determining Miller\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"AIHl\">Moreover, the transmission of messages on the Internet satisfied the criteria of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>the cross-reference provision, which \u201cis to be construed broadly.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, n. 3. Miller (1) induced minors, (2) by \u201cnotice or advertisement,\u201d (3) \u201cto engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l). First, Miller\u2019s messages were aimed at \u201cyoung teens.\u201d Second, by posting information on Internet newsgroups, Miller\u2019s messages amounted to a notice or advertisement. <em>Cf. Zeran v. America Online, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 327, 328 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201c \u2018The Internet is an international network of interconnected computers,\u2019 currently used by approximately 40 million people worldwide.\u201d) (quoting <em>Reno v. ACLU, </em>521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2334, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997)), <em>cert. denied., </em>- U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 2341, 141 L.Ed.2d 712 (1998). Third, the messages invited teenagers to engage in sexual activity, \u201chave [their] picture taken, [and] be video taped.\u201d He also offered to pay those teenagers \u201cinterested in making a buck.\u201d Clearly, the district court did not err in applying the cross-reference in \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"AePB\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
