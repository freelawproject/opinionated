Bank, N.A., the appel-lees, contractually bound the appellees to comply with provisions of Subtitle 9, which address the form of the notice required when a Cardholder Agreement is amended, where the Cardholder Agreement in the section captioned \u201cGoverning Law,\u201d references Subtitle 9 of the Commercial Law Article, Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-901 \u2014 12-924 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cSubtitle 9\u201d) and \u201capplicable federal law.\u201d Although the parties agree that State laws purporting to regulate the appellees\u2019 lending activities have been preempted by \u00a7 5(a) of the Homeowners Loan Act (\u201cHOLA\u201d) 12 U.S.C. 1464(a) and its implementing regulations, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. pt. 560, the appellants characterize the reference to Subtitle 9 in the Cardholder Agreement as a provision in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>contract, which, notwithstanding federal preemption, defines a particular aspect of the relationship between the parties, the manner in which notice is to be given when the Cardholder Agreement is amended. Consequently, rather than because it was a failure to comply with state law, the appellants seek to recover damages from the appellees for breach of their contract with the appellants to comply with Subtitle 9 when amending the Cardholder Agreement. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City observed that it \u201cseems both implausible and inconsistent with federal preemption to claim that a state regulatory scheme was agreed to between [the] parties by a mere reference to Subtitle 9\u201d and, thus, rejected the appellants\u2019 argument. We do not agree. Accordingly, we shall reverse and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">This is not the first occasion on which this case, the parties to it and the issues presented by it, have been before this Court. <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., et al., </em>363 Md. 232, 768 A.2d 620 (2001) <em>(\u201cWells I </em>\u201d) was an appeal taken from an order compelling arbitration. Preparatory to addressing the substantive issue that case presented, whether the appellants agreed to arbitrate, we summarized the factual and procedural history of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint alleges that the Defendants, in a number of aspects, breached the open end credit agreement (the Cardholder Agreement) in effect between Plaintiffs, as cardholders of credit cards issued by Chevy Chase, and Chevy Chase, as card-issuing credit grantor. \u201cPrior to January 16, 1996, Chevy Chase had maintained its home office in Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Cardholder Agreement provided for an annual fee, a minimum late charge fee of fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>dollars, described the method of computing the finance charge, and stated that the \u2018ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will never exceed 24%\u2019 With respect to amendments the Cardholder Agreement read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">\u2018We may amend the terms of this Agreement in accordance with applicable law at any time. Also we may at any time add new credit services, discontinue any credit services, or replace your card with another card.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">\u201cThe Cardholder Agreement also contained a \u2018Governing Law\u2019 provision reading:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u2018This Agreement is made in Maryland. It is governed by Subtitle 9 [\u2018Credit Grantor Revolving Credit Provisions\u2019] of Title 12 [\u2018Credit Regulations\u2019] of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code and applicable federal laws.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThere was no mediation or arbitration provision in the Cardholder Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cOn or about January 16, 1996, Chevy Chase moved its home office to Virginia. With the periodic statements mailed in January and February of 1996 to its cardholders, Chevy Chase included a notice of change of terms of the Cardholder Agreement. The notice of change took the form of a restatement and revision of the Cardholder Agreement, with the new or revised terms italicized and, with respect to a waiver of jury trial provision, both italics and all uppercase print was used. Solely for purposes of this appeal, and without indicating any opinion on whether the Cardholder Agreement was effectively amended or whether the amendments are substantively valid, we shall call the product of the January and February mailings the \u2018Amended Agreement.\u2019 The Amended Agreement provided that it was made in Virginia and was \u2018subject to and governed by Virginia law and applicable federal law and regulations.\u2019 The Amended Agreement further recited that \u2018[t]he parties agree that by engaging in activities with or involving each other, they are participating in transactions involving interstate commerce.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cAlso contained in the Amended Agreement was an alternative dispute resolution section which in relevant part reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akq\">\u2018Mediation and Arbitration \u2014 Any controversy or claim (\u201cClaim\u201d) between or among you and us or our agents, employees and affiliates, including but not limited to those arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related agreements, including without limitation any Claim based on or arising from an alleged tort, shall, at the request and expense of the claiming party, be submitted to mediation, using the rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u2018If mediation fails to resolve the Claim within 30 days from the date of engagement, then the Claim shall be determined by binding arbitration. (Mediation or Arbitration, as appropriate, are sometimes referred to below as the \u2018Proceeding\u2019.) Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S.Code), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the rules of the AAA. Either you or we may, by summary proceedings (e.g., a plea in abatement or motion to stay further proceedings), bring an action in any court having jurisdiction for the sole purpose of compelling compliance with these mediation and arbitration provisions.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cOn or about September 30, 1998, First U.S.A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> purchased the credit card portfolio of Chevy Chase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs instituted the ... action [in <em>Wells I </em>] in January 1999. They allege that the defendants breached the Cardholder Agreement by charging interest in excess of twenty-four percent, by increasing the interest on past balances, by failing to provide legally required notice of the amendments, by changing the method of calculating the finance charge without proper notice, and by increasing the late fees and over-limit fees without proper notice. Plaintiffs also allege violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>land Code (2000 Repl.VoL), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101(d) and 13-303(3) of the Commercial Law Article (CL).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><em>Wells I, </em>363 Md. at 235-37, 768 A.2d at 621-22 (footnote omitted). This history applies as well to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Court identified the principal theory of the appellants\u2019 case as being that the Cardholder Agreement had not been effectively amended and elucidated the supporting rationale underlying it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs principally rely on CL \u00a7 12-912 that addresses amendment of the agreement governing a revolving credit plan. In broad strokes, that section requires, \u2018at least 25 days before the effective date of the amendment,\u2019 a clear and conspicuous written notice, \u2018if the amendment has the effect of increasing the interest, finance charges, or other fees and charges to be paid by the borrower ... or altering the manner of their computation.\u2019 \u00a7 12-912(b)(1). The notice must include \u2018[a] clear statement comparing the original terms and the terms under the amended agreement.\u2019 \u00a7 12-912(b)(1)\u00ae. The initial notice is also to include \u2018a statement that a second notice will be sent in the borrower\u2019s next periodic statement.\u2019 \u00a7 12-912(c)(7). Both notices are to be in ten point type. Id. The notice is to advise of the cardholder\u2019s optional right to refuse the amendment and to describe the manner of refusing. \u00a7 12-912(c)(7)(ii). Where, as here, the plan charges an annual fee, rejection of the amendment entitles the cardholder to \u2018use the account pursuant to its original, unamended terms, for ... the duration of the time for which a fee was paid for use of the plan.\u2019 \u00a7 12-912(c)(5)(i)1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIn addition, \u00a7 12-912(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u2018If the terms of the agreement governing the plan, as originally drawn or amended!,] provide, any amendment may, on or after the date on which it becomes effective as to a particular borrower, apply to all then outstanding unpaid indebtedness in the borrower\u2019s account under the plan, including any indebtedness which shall have arisen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>out of purchases made or loans obtained prior to the effective date of the amendment.\u2019 \u201c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><em>Wells I, </em>363 Md. at 237-38, 768 A.2d at 622-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We noted, that in addition to moving to compel arbitration, the appellees also argued in the trial court that \u00a7 12-912, on which the appellants principally relied, was preempted by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(a), a regulation of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) that undertakes to \u201coccupy[] the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As indicated, the motion to compel arbitration prevailed in the trial court, prompting the appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In response, the appellees moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the Maryland law permitting an appeal from an order compelling arbitration was, itself, preempted by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)(2) of the Federal Arbitration Act. This preliminary procedural issue, <em>see Wells I, </em>363 Md. at 235, 768 A.2d at 621, was premised on the fact that the arbitration order \u201c \u2018was entered in the context of a larger breach of contract dispute, the arbitration issue was \u2018embedded\u2019 in appellants\u2019 contract and state statutory claims, and therefore the Arbitration Order is not an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 for purposes of FAA \u00a7 16.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wells I, </em>363 Md. at 242, 768 A.2d at 625, quoting the appellees\u2019 brief, which cited <em>In re Pisgah Contractors, </em>117 F.3d 133, 136 (4th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The Court resolved both the preliminary procedural issue and the substantive issue in favor of the appellants and, thus, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. As to whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, it reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201cThe arbitration clause in the Amended Agreement in this case is susceptible of but one reasonable interpretation. The promise is to mediate and, if necessary, arbitrate \u2018at the request and expense of the claiming party.\u2019 The Plaintiffs are the claiming parties, not the Defendants. This conclusion is neither altered, nor the language made ambiguous, by the provision in the next following paragraph reading: \u2018Either you or we may, by summary proceedings (e.g., a plea in abatement or motion to stay further proceedings), bring an action in any court having jurisdiction for the sole purpose of compelling compliance with these mediation and arbitration provisions.\u2019 Ordering the claiming party to mediate and, \u2018if mediation fails\u2019 to arbitrate, when the claiming party has not requested mediation does not compel compliance with the mediation and arbitration clause provisions; rather, an order so compelling exceeds those provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqc\"><em>Wells </em>I, 363 Md. at 251-52, 768 A.2d at 630.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Therefore, the issue we resolved in <em>Wells I, </em>related solely to whether \u201cthe appellants ... agreed to arbitrate,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 235, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>768 A.2d at 621. This was an issue related to, but different from the issue the parties principally argued which was whether the appellees\u2019 attempt to amend the Cardholder Agreement was effective. Although, the gravamen of the complaint in <em>Wells I, </em>as it is in the case <em>sub judice, </em>centered on that latter question, this Court did not address it. Indeed, we expressly did not venture an opinion as to \u201cwhether the Cardholder Agreement was effectively amended or whether the amendments are substantively valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 768 A.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On remand, the question of whether arbitration was a requirement having already been decided was squarely before the court for resolution. As they had done in the earlier action, the appellants argued that the Cardholder Agreement had not been amended effectively and that the appellees, therefore were in breach of the contractual terms of the unamended Cardholder Agreement. Once again, the appellants relied on the Governing Law provision of the Agreement, emphasizing that provision\u2019s reference to \u201cSubtitle 9 of Title 12 of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City, agreeing that appellants\u2019 claims are preempted by federal law, granted the appel-lees\u2019 motion to dismiss. It opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201c[I]t is both ingenuous, and a trifle disingenuous to, to admit that the specific state imposed notice restrictions are preempted by federal law, while at the same time contend that the general reference to Maryland law, as the governing law, specifically reincorporates into the Cardholder Agreement these provisions as private agreements. It seems both implausible and inconsistent with federal preemption to claim that a state regulatory scheme was agreed to between the parties by the mere reference to Subtitle 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>This is a great deal beyond the scope of preserving the traditional infrastructure of state laws that undergird commercial transactions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzl\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cThis court is convinced that to permit [appellants] to thwart the admitted preemption of the relevant law solely because of a general reference to Maryland law, flies in the face of common sense and contract interpretation. When the parties mentioned Subtitle 9 [of Title 12] of the Maryland Code and \u201capplicable federal law\u201d as governing law, they did not incorporate the protections of a Maryland regulatory scheme into the agreement. Had they meant to do that, they could have done so in clear-cut terms. As the <em>Chaires [v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>131 Md.App. 64, 748 A.2d 34 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 334, 753 A.2d 1031 (2000),] case makes clear, they could not waive federal preemption and could only have intended that state law apply as \u2018governing law' should \u2018federal law' not apply. There is no basis for claiming that they entered into a private agreement incorporating a complex and detailed state regulatory scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The appellants noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and this Court issued, on its own initiative, a Writ of Certiorari, <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase, </em>369 Md. 570, 801 A.2d 1031 (2002), prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Although, the appellants agree that Subtitle 9 is preempted by HOLA and its implementing regulations, they nevertheless insist that the appellees\u2019 agreement to comply with that subtitle\u2019s relevant notice provisions and protections may still be enforced. The appellants argue, in other words, that while Subtitle 9 may not be invoked to evaluate the adequacy of a credit agreement where there is no agreement by the parties as to its applicability, when there is such an agreement, federal preemption cannot negate the appellees\u2019 promise. They rely on <em>American Airlines v. Wolens, </em>513 U.S. 219, 228-29, 115 S.Ct. 817, 823-824, 130 L.Ed.2d 715, 725-726 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>(1995), which they submit stands for the proposition that parties to a commercial transaction may elect, as a self-imposed, voluntary undertaking, to follow otherwise preempted state law and thus preserve state law claims for breach of contract. The appellants also find support for their position in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2. Section (c) of that regulation exempts, <em>inter alia, </em>contract and commercial laws \u201cto the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of Federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.\u201d Consequently, they argue that the claims they advance have been expressly excluded from the preemptive scope of HOLA and the OTS regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The appellees rejoin that the appellants have misinterpreted the governing law provision of the Cardholder Agreement. Specifically, they characterize the appellants\u2019 argument that the parties agreed to a notice regime prescribed by an otherwise preempted statute as an \u201cattempt to impose Subtitle 9\u2019s preempted regulatory requirements on Chevy Chase through the back door of the choice-of-law provision in the Cardholder Agreement.\u201d The appellants\u2019 contract claim would not exist, they argue, if the requirements of Subtitle 9 are not imposed on Chevy Chase. Furthermore, they submit that a mere reference in the \u2018governing law\u201d provision of the Cardholder Agreement is insufficient to transform a preempted state law into a private contract. With respect to the exception to preemption recognized in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(c), they point out that, in 61 Fed.Reg. 50951, 50966 (1966), the OTS noted the narrowness of the exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cOTS wishes to make clear that the purpose of paragraph (c) is to preserve the traditional infrastructure of basic state laws that undergird commercial transactions, not to open the door to state regulation of lending by federal savings associations.... For these purposes, paragraph (c) is intended to be interpreted narrowly. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of preemption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The appellees rely on <em>Chaires v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>131 Md.App. 64, 748 A.2d 34, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 334, 753 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>1031 (2000), which they contend rejected the precise argument, on virtually identical facts, being made by the appellants. It also was correctly decided, they maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The appellants\u2019 reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wolens </em>is rejected by the appellees as being \u201cunsupported by an analysis of the holding in that case.\u201d Contending that, if relevant, it supports their position, the appellees argue (citing <em>Wolens, </em>513 U.S. at 233, 115 S.Ct. at 826-827, 130 L.Ed.2d at 728-729) \u201c[t]he Supreme Court held in <em>Wolens </em>that claims based on state laws or policies external to a contract, as opposed to the express terms of the contract, are preempted by governing federal law.... [The appellants\u2019] claims in this case are premised entirely on the terms of Subtitle 9, all of which are external to the Cardholder Agreement itself. Thus, those claims are preempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The federal preemption doctrine has its origin in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See, </em>U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. That Clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The constitutional mandate imposed on this Court by the Supremacy Clause requires this Court to declare state law unenforceable to the extent that federal law expressly so provides or the circumstances indicate that federal law super-cedes state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The rules governing preemption are well settled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Preemption may occur in one of three ways. Where Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>has expressly stated its intent to preempt state law, federal law prevails. <em>Law v. Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers Local No. 37, AFL-CIO, </em>373 Md. 459, 467, 818 A.2d 1136, 1141 (2003) (citing <em>Harrison v. Schwartz, </em>319 Md. 360, 364, 572 A.2d 528, 530, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 851, 111 S.Ct. 143, 112 L.Ed.2d 110 (1990)); <em>see also, Becker v. Litty, </em>318 Md. 76, 86, 566 A.2d 1101, 1106 (1989). Preemption of state laws also may still occur, even where Congress has not expressly stated its intention in that regard, if there is evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to \u201coccupy a given field,\u201d and the state law falls within that field. <em>Harrison, </em>319 Md. at 364, 572 A.2d at 530. Finally, state law is preempted when \u201ccompliance with both federal and state law is a physical impossibility.\u201d <em>Law, </em>373 Md. at 466-67, 818 A.2d at 1141 (2003) (citing <em>Sanders v.

When the administrator promulgates regulations intended to pre-empt state law, the court\u2019s inquiry is similarly limited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8f\">\u2018If [his] choice represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency\u2019s care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 81 S.Ct. 1554.\u2019 \u201c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ7\"><em>de la Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. at 153-154, 102 S.Ct. at 3022-3023, 73 L.Ed.2d at 675. When reviewing the preemptive effect of federal regulations on state laws, a court must not confine its inquiry to whether Congress intended to preempt state law. Rather, the appropriate inquiry, the Court instructs, considers whether the administrative agency intended to preempt state law and whether the action taken was within the delegation of authority by Congress. <em>Id., </em>at 154, 102 S.Ct. at 3023, 73 L.Ed.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In this case, we are concerned with Congressional intent in enacting the HOLA and the intent of the OTS, the federal agency charged with administering the HOLA, when it promulgated the regulations to implement that act. The HOLA was enacted by Congress largely in response to the effect the Great Depression had on the national housing market. <em>See generally, Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Fox, </em>459 F.Supp. 903, 908 (C.D.Cal.1978). Its purposes were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah0\">\u201c \u2018To provide emergency relief with respect to home mortgage indebtedness, to refinance home mortgages, to extend relief to the owners of homes occupied by them and who are unable to amortize their debt elsewhere, to amend the Federal Home Loan bank Act, to increase the market for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>obligations of the United States and for other purposes.\u2019 Preamble, 48 Stat. 128 (1933).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">A significant component of HOLA was the creation of a \u201csystem of federal savings and loans associations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909. Rather than subject the operation of federal savings and loans associations to state regulation, much of which was \u201cill-advised\u201d and the object of the remedial legislation, Congress created the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, the predecessor of the Office of Thrift Supervision, <em>id. </em>at 908, and \u201cgave the Bank Board plenary authority over the creation and operation of federal associations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cIn order to provide local mutual thrift institutions in which people may invest their funds and in order to provide for the financing of homes, the Board is authorized, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, to provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of associations to be known \u2018Federal Savings and Loan Associations\u201d, and to issue charters therefor, giving primary consideration to the best practices of local mutual thrifts and home-financing institutions in the United States. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cFederal savings and loan associations were not to be operated and regulated by what a particular state conceived to be the \u2018best practices.\u2019 Rather, the Bank Board was delegated by Congress the authority to select from the prevailing practices in all states what it deemed the best practices and to prescribe a nationwide system of operation, supervision, and regulation which would apply to all federal associations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\"><em>Glendale Federal, </em>459 F.Supp. at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Comprehensive rules and regulations have been adopted by OTS and its predecessor agency concerning the \u201cpowers and operations of every Federal savings and loan association from its cradle to its corporate grave.\u201d <em>de la Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. at 145, 102 S.Ct. at 3018, 73 L.Ed.2d at 669, citing <em>California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>v.

Section (c) exempts from preemption those state laws that only incidentally affect lending operations or that are consistent with section (a)\u2019s purpose of \u201cgiv[ing] federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Subtitle 9, the Maryland statute at issue in the case, contains the \u201cCredit Grantor Revolving Credit Provisions.\u201d The term \u201cRevolving credit plan\u201d is defined to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cmean a plan that contemplates the extension of credit under an account governed by an agreement between the credit grantor and a borrower under which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c(1) the credit grantor permits the borrower and, if the agreement governing the plan permits, persons acting on behalf of or with the authorization from the borrower to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201c(2) The amounts of purchases and loans are charged to the borrower\u2019s account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201c(3) The borrower is required to pay the credit grantor the amounts of all purchases and loans charged to the borrower\u2019s account under he plan but has the privilege of paying amounts due from time to time as agreed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201c(4) Interest or finance charges may be charged and collected by the credit grantor from time to time on the amounts due under the plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-901(e) of the Commercial Law Article. Additional statutory provisions in Subtitle 9 provide explicit directives for the regulation of revolving credit plans in the State of Maryland, including, without limitation, variation in interest rates, the amount of fees and charges that may be imposed, and procedures for amending revolving credit plans. Because they impact how credit grantors may operate and conduct their lending activities, which is inconsistent with OTS\u2019s expressed intention to \u201coccupy the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations,\u201d any attempt to enforce these provisions as a matter of State law and as additional requirements of a credit agreement with a federal savings association must fail.

Acknowledging and conceding the right of the Airline to change the terms and conditions of the program, the plaintiffs there complained that the application of the program modifications retroactively devalued the credits they had already earned and, thus, violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and was a breach of the Airline\u2019s contract with them. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 115 S.Ct. at 822, 130 L.Ed.2d at 723. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied the plaintiffs the injunction they sought, holding that to issue one would be a regulation of the Airline\u2019s current rendering of service, but, opining that \u201conly those State laws and regulations that specifically relate to and have more than a tangential connection with an airline\u2019s rates, routes or services\u201d are preempted, allowed their breach of contract and consumer actions to proceed. <em>Id </em>at 225, 115 S.Ct. at 822, 130 L.Ed.2d at 724.

Significantly, it responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cAmerican\u2019s argument is unpersuasive, for it assumes the answer to the very contract construction issue on which plaintiffs\u2019 claims turn: Did American, by contract, reserve the right to change the value of already accumulated mileage credits, or only to change the rules governing credits earned from and after the date of the change? See Brief for Respondents 5 (plaintiffs recognize that American \u2018reserved the right to restrict, suspend, or otherwise alter aspects of the Program prospectively,\u2019 but maintain that American \u2018never reserved the right to retroactively diminish the value of the credits previously earned by members\u2019).

Relying on the provisions of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2 providing that the regulations occupied the entire field of lending and \u201care to be the governing law for certain activities, including the charging of fees, by federal institutions,\u201d <em>Chaires, </em>131 Md.

The former is a defense requiring an analysis of federal law and the determination of the impact the relationship of the parties has on the ability of that law to fulfill its intended goal. The latter involves contract interpretation, discerning the parties\u2019 intent, either actual or presumed. Contract interpretation, unlike the question of federal preemption, is a matter of state law. <em>Volt Info. Scis. v. Bd. of Trs., </em>489 U.S. 468, 474, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1253, 103 L.Ed.2d 488, 497 (1989) (\u201cthe interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law, which this Court does not sit to review\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The appellants point out, accurately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cFederal preemption is a defense that argues that even if plaintiffs\u2019 state law contract claims are correct \u2014 i.e. even if Chevy Chase had promised to follow \u201csubtitle 9 of the Maryland Commercial Code\u201d with respect to the notice it would give cardholders of amendments, and even if it broke that promise \u2014 federal law bars those claims. The contract interpretation issue, by contrast, raises the question of whether or not the language of the contract specifying Subtitle 9 requires Chevy Chase to comply with the credit card amendment provisions of Subtitle 9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Although purporting to decide the issue on preemption grounds, at bottom, <em>Chaires </em>was decided on contract interpretation principles. To be sure, the Court of Special Appeals is correct, where there is a conflict between federal and state law or where federal regulations preempt a field, state law may not be elected over federal law in that field. Here, however, the court acknowledged that 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(c) excludes some state laws from preemption and that it was reasonable for the parties in that case to include a choice of law provision. <em>Chaires, </em>131 Md.App. at 83, 748 A.2d at 44-45. But rather than addressing the preemption issue directly, the court ana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>lyzed the parties\u2019 agreement, including extraneous documents, and decided what the appellees in that case intended:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cit appears that the appellees were not attempting to opt for Maryland law over federal law, but were attempting to include a choice of law provision to govern the areas not preempted by the federal regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Moreover, by emphasizing that the parties could not \u201celect to have state law govern <em>over </em>federal law,\u201d the court suggests that there was a conflict between federal and state law. Where that occurs, preemption in favor of the federal law necessarily follows. <em>See de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. at 152, 102 S.Ct. at 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d at 675. In this case, as the appellants point out, \u201c[t]here is no conflicting federal law for Chevy Chase to have selected Subtitle 9 \u2018over.\u2019 \u201c <em>See Williams v. First Gov\u2019t Mort. and Investors Corp., </em>176 F.3d 497, 500 (1999), in which the D.C. Circuit held that the federal Truth in Lending Act did not preempt the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201cNothing in TILA or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended the Act\u2019s disclosure regime to provide the maximum protection to which borrowers are entitled' nationwide; states remain free to impose greater protections for borrowers.

The appellees\u2019 response, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cTILA and its implementing regulations establish a uniform federal scheme for disclosure of credit terms, applicable to all creditors including federal savings associations, and OTS has expressly precluded any state regulation of such disclosures insofar as federal savings associations like Chevy Chase are concerned,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>is not persuasive. It relies only on 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(a) and fails to take account of the exemption in \u00a7 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The other cases the appellees cite are no more persuasive. In <em>de la Cuesta, </em>unlike in this case, there was direct conflict between federal regulations permitting due-on-sale clauses in mortgage agreements and restrictions placed by the California Supreme Court on the exercise of the clauses, which was resolved in favor of preemption. 458 U.S. at 154-56, 102 S.Ct. at 3023-3024, 73 L.Ed.2d at 675-677. In <em>Brown v. Investors Mortgage Co., supra, </em>121 F.3d 472, and <em>Atkinson v. Gen. Elec. Credit Corp., supra, </em>866 F.2d 396, the court rejected the argument that a general choice of laws provision was effective to avoid the preemptive effect of Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA) when the agreement otherwise indicated the contrary intent. In <em>Brown, </em>the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cThis language does not address federal law or the relation between state and federal law. The fact that the parties chose to apply the laws of Washington, rather than the laws of another state, does not mean the parties decided that federal law should not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">121 F.3d at 476. In <em>Atkinson, </em>to the court, it was \u201creadily apparent that the parties intended that DIDMCA apply.\u201d 866 F.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\"><em>Fantastic Fakes, Inc. v. Pickwick Int\u2019l, Inc., supra, </em>661 F.2d 479, 483 does not directly involve the question of preemption. Thus, the statement to which the appellees refer, that \u201c[a] choice of law provision, therefore, merely designates the state whose law is to be applied to the extent its use is not preempted by nor contrary to the policies of the,\u201d 661 F.2d at 483, applicable federal law, has little relevance to this discussion. It is significant that, in that case, the court engaged in extensive contract interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84. Neither is <em>Roadway Package Sys., Inc. v. Kayser, supra, </em>257 F.3d 287, 293-94 apposite. There, the court held that contracting parties may opt out of the FAA\u2019s default vacatur standards and fashion their own. 257 F.3d at 288. It was in this context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>that the court stated that the generic choice-of-law clause, indicating that the agreement in that case \u201cshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d \u201csheds little, if any, light on the parties\u2019 intent,\u201d and thus rejected Kayser\u2019s argument that it should be \u201cread as expressing a desire to opt out of the FAA\u2019s default regime and to incorporate arbitration rules borrowed from Pennsylvania law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is significant that the court characterized the issue, as simply a matter of contract construction, <em>id., </em>\u201cnot one of choice-of-law or preemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. It is also significant that the court acknowledged that a different result would have been appropriate had the parties agreed that \u201cany controversy shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Pennsylvania Uniform Arbitration Act.\u201d Id. at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Finally <em>Jones v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra, </em>No. 90-5005, 1992 WL 202327, 1992 U.S. Dist. Lexis 12303 is inapposite. It involved the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (ERISA), a \u201cdeliberately expansive\u201d statute designed to make regulation of employee benefit plans an exclusively federal concern. <em>Hansen v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>940 F.2d 971, 979 (5th Cir.1991), citing <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 </em>U.S. 41, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987). Thus, the statute expressly preempts state law where it relates to any ERISA Plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Degan v. Ford Motor Co., </em>869 F.2d 889, 893 (5th Cir.1989) (all \u201ccommon law contract and tort claims based upon laws of general application, that is, not specifically related to insurance or employee severance or discrimination are preempted by ERISA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Despite its protestations to the contrary,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> implicit in the appellees\u2019 <em>Wolens </em>argument is the notion that, in contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>where preemption is an issue, even though federal law may exempt contracts from preemption, all of the terms of the parties\u2019 contract must be set forth in the contract, none of the principal provisions may be supplied by reference. They read the passage from <em>Wolens, </em>prohibiting \u201cenlargement or enhancement [of the parties\u2019 bargain] based on state laws or policies external to the agreement\u201d to mean that, as the appellants put it, \u201cfederal law does not preempt a private party from undertaking obligations spelled out in a contract, but does preempt a party from undertaking contractual obligations by reference in a contract to some body of rules \u2018external\u2019 to the contract.\u201d Not only does such a distinction make absolutely no sense, it fails to distinguish between the preemption issue and the contract interpretation issue. The latter is, as we have seen, a question of state law. Maryland law recognizes that parties may agree to define their rights and obligations by reference to documents or rules external to the contract. <em>Kirby &amp; McGuire, Inc. v. Board of Education, </em>210 Md. 383, 385, 123 A.2d 606, 608 (1956) (\u201cIt is clear, too, that by virtue of the incorporation by reference of the contract into the bond and of the other documents into the contract, the bond and all of the documents are to be read and construed together, as if set forth in the bond.\u201d); <em>Ray v. William G. Eurice &amp; Bros., Inc., </em>201 Md. 115, 128, 93 A.2d 272, 279 (1952) (\u201cThe lower court seemingly attached significance to the fact that the plans and specifications were not physically fastened to the contract document which was executed, although it specifically and explicitly referred to both. In this situation physical attachment has not the significance so attributed to it. It is settled that where a writing refers to another document that other document, or so much of it as is referred to, is to be interpreted as part of the writing.\u201d). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>346 Md. 122, 128, 695 A.2d 153 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The <em>Wolens </em>Court drew no such distinction. And the courts applying <em>Wolens </em>do not draw such a distinction either. The distinction that the Court drew was between what is required, as a matter of law, without any necessity for a specific agreement to that effect, and what a party voluntarily agrees to do, -without regard to what the law might require in the absence of that agreement. It is the law or policy that applies to any agreement made by parties that is external to, not a part of, the parties\u2019 bargain, not the fact that terms of the agreement are supplied by reference. The cases applying <em>Wolens, </em>including those on which the appellees rely, prove the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Breitling U.S.A., Inc. v. Fed. Express Corp., supra., </em>45 F.Supp.2d 179, Breitling sought to recover damages under an agreement providing that FedEx was liable only for its own negligence, by interposing the doctrine of waiver. The-court held, \u201cbecause Breitling seeks to impose common law principles and policies on the agreement between the two parties, Breitling\u2019s claims are preempted by the ADA\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183-84. The common law principle was not included in the contract, but would ordinarily have been applicable to the contract as a matter of law. Similarly, in <em>Smith v. Comair, Inc., supra, </em>134 F.3d 254, a passenger\u2019s breach of contract action against Comair and Delta Arlines for refusal to allow him to board his flight was held to be preempted. The court was persuaded by the effect of Comair\u2019s federal defenses on the preemption question, noting \u201c[bjecause Comair invokes defenses provided by federal law, Smith\u2019s contract claim can only be adjudicated by reference to law and policies external to the parties\u2019 bargain and, therefore, is preempted under the ADA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. It also pointed to the fact that the action implicated the airline\u2019s discretion and/or duty under federal law, <em>id., </em>and the practical effect on federal law: \u201cIf passengers could challenge airlines\u2019 boarding procedures under general contract claims alleging failure to transport, we would allow the fifty states to regulate an area of unique federal concern \u2014 airlines\u2019 boarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, citing <em>Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 334, 339 (5th Cir.1995) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">To like effect, <em>see, Travel All Over the World, Inc. v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, </em>73 F.3d 1423 (7th Cir.1996), in which the court, applying <em>Wolens, </em>permitted a contract action to proceed, <em>id. </em>at 1432, but also held the claim for punitive damages to be preempted, opining, \u201cRather than merely holding parties to the terms of a bargain, punitive damages represent an \u2018enlargement or enhancement [of the bargain] based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.\u201d \u2018 <em>Id. </em>at 1432 n. 8. <em>Deerskin Trading Post, Inc. v. United Parcel Service of America, </em>972 F.Supp. 665, 672-73 (N.D.Ga.1997) (breach of contract claim not preempted but prayer for punitive damages and injunctive relief is, because such relief goes beyond the parties\u2019 agreement); <em>Richmond Capital Corp. v. Federal Express Corp., </em>29 F.Supp.2d. 737, 740 (M.D.La.1998); <em>Manning v. Skywest Airlines, </em>946 F.Supp. 767, 769 (C.D.Cal. 1996) (although involving a tort action, the analysis is supportive of non-preemption and indeed non preemption was held).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Nor are the appellees correct \u201cthat the requirements of Subtitle 9 can be imposed on Chevy Chase.\u201d It is true that Subtitle 9 is a state law, as defined by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(a) and, thus, falls within the category of state imposed obligations that regulation preempts. It is not true that Subtitle 9 is required by a state statutory regulation, ruling, order or judicial decision to be complied with in this case. It is in this case only because the agreement between the parties refer to it and do so in the context of the notice to be given in the event that the agreement is amended. Indeed, that agreement was prepared by Chevy Chase; it was not imposed on Chevy Chase as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">To be sure, the disputed contract provision has been included, as we have seen, in the section of the Cardholder Agreement dealing with \u201cGoverning Law,\u201d rather than the section covering amendments. In addition, it refers both to Subtitle 9 and \u201capplicable federal law. Contract interpretation will determine what the agreement means, the intent of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in entering into this agreement, Chevy Chase\u2019s intent in drafting it and, in particular, the scope and extent of the parties\u2019 obligations and rights under it.
