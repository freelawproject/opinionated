(Chevy Chase) and Clyde\u2019s of Columbia, Inc. (Columbia).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Clyde\u2019s received a hearing before a hearing officer on December 8, 1999 to determine the validity of the assessment. On May 5, 2000, the hearing officer upheld petitioner\u2019s assessment and respondent appealed to the Maryland Tax Court. After a November 1, 2000 hearing, the Tax Court issued a written order on November 29, 2000 reversing the hearing officer and denying petitioner\u2019s admissions and amusement tax assessment against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Petitioner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and on August 23, 2001, a hearing was held in front of the Honorable Clifton Gordy. Judge Gordy upheld the Tax Court\u2019s decision in an order dated October 2, 2001. Respondent appealed that decision to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion filed on January 7, 2003, that court upheld the Tax Court\u2019s decision in favor of respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Petitioner then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, and, on May 7, 2003, we granted the petition. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc., </em>374 Md. 358, 822 A.2d 1224 (2003). Petitioner presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cDid the lower courts erroneously hold that the gross receipts that are derived from the sale of refreshments and that pay for entertainment at a restaurant are not subject to the State\u2019s admissions and amusement tax because the refreshments are not sold \u2018in connection with entertainment\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>within the meaning of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) of the Tax General Article?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We answer the question in the negative and hold that \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) requires a direct financial nexus between the sale of refreshments \u201e and entertainment provided by the establishment. Under the specific facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>where the restaurant providing the music charged no cover or admissions charge, required no minimum purchase by its patrons during periods of live music and did not inflate its refreshments\u2019 prices during the playing of the live music, the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the refreshment sales were not \u201cin connection with\u201d the entertainment is correct. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Clyde\u2019s Restaurant Group<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Clyde\u2019s) operates the two Maryland restaurants involved in the dispute in the case <em>sub judice. </em>One restaurant is located in Chevy Chase while the other is located in Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">A. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The Chevy Chase location, which opened in 1995, is a two-floor restaurant comprising of around 16,000 square feet. The main dining area is located at street level just inside the primary entrance. This area is a nonsmoking area that accommodates 298 customers. The bar area, known as the Race Bar due to its classic auto racing theme,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is located one floor below street level. The Race Bar, where smoking was permitted, contains a hardwood floor section with an oval bar in the center of the room with approximately 80 to 90 bar stools surrounding it. Encircling the bar is a carpeted section with 120 booths for dining. At the end of the room is a raised stage/display area which is approximately six feet deep. Mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>sicians hired by Clyde\u2019s perform in this stage area on certain nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">To enhance the restaurant\u2019s ambiance, increase revenue, expand patronage, and maintain a varied atmosphere in the Race Bar area, the Chevy Chase location provides music. Three nights per week the music is live in the Race Bar. The restaurant provides background music played through a cable music system at lunch and on the remaining nights of the week. The type of music played is dependent on the night of the week and occasion. The cable system generally plays easy-listening and background music.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On Friday nights, a traditionally busy night for restaurants, the restaurant hires a disc jockey to play CDs in the Race Bar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The manager specifies the general type of music to be played, but the disc jockey decides the specific songs to be played. Testimony revealed that the music played on Friday nights tended to be played at a much higher volume than that of the cable music system. On Saturday nights, a \u201cthree to five piece group\u201d plays an upbeat style of music.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The final night of live music consists of either a Wednesday night easy-listening duo or a Thursday night jazz duo or trio. All musicians play on the stage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The restaurant announces the musical performances on the back of the restaurant\u2019s menu and on the restaurant\u2019s web site. \u201c[Fjree unsolicited listings in local newspapers,\u201d including, but not limited to, the Washington Post, the Burtonsville Gazette and the Germantown Gazette are also made (alteration added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These publications list the names of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>formers and the date and time of the performances. The restaurant does not encourage dancing. There is no dance floor in the Chevy Chase location, although, occasionally, patrons will spontaneously dance in the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The restaurant does not impose any admission fee or cover charge when it provides live entertainment. It similarly does not increase the prices of any food or drinks, nor does it require any minimum purchase in order for a patron to be present for the live entertainment. A person could be present for the entertainment without purchasing any product or service from the restaurant. Musicians, or the disc jockey (DJ), are paid out of the till at the end of the night regardless of the amount of sales from food or beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The prices at the Clyde\u2019s restaurant in Chevy Chase are competitive with the prices of similar local establishments. Competition with other local restaurants and overhead costs, including the cost of food, drinks, utilities, payroll, supplies, menus and music, drive the restaurant\u2019s price setting. The restaurant considers all of these factors, compares them with what the market can bear, and accordingly determines the prices for its food and beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">B. Clyde\u2019s of Columbia, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Columbia restaurant is a one-floor establishment located in the Columbia Town Center. The restaurant can accommodate about 320 for dinner and the bar has approximately 40 bar stools. This restaurant has a cable music system similar to that of the Chevy Chase location for the purpose of providing background music to enhance the atmosphere and dining experience. Thursday night is the only night the Columbia location provides other music. This usually consists of one or two acoustical guitarists playing contemporary music from 9:30 p.m. until 12:30 a.m. Customers generally may request songs to be played. No location for dancing is provided and dancing is not encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Similar to the Chevy Chase location, the Columbia restaurant does not charge an admissions or cover charge, raise its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>prices or require any minimum purchase on Thursday evenings when the musicians play. Its prices are competitive in relation to the other local restaurants. The performers are paid in a similar manner to the entertainers in the Chevy Chase location. If there is not enough cash in the cash drawer to pay the performers, funds are taken from stored cash in the main office. There are no local publications that regularly announce the Columbia restaurant\u2019s entertainment. The restaurant only announces its live music on the restaurant\u2019s menu board. The general manager of the Columbia restaurant testified that the percentage and rate of sales for food and beverages at the Columbia location do not differ between the nights when live music is offered and the nights when it is not offered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">C. The Comptroller\u2019s Audit and Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The Comptroller\u2019s audit revealed that the proprietor of the Chevy Chase location had not regularly collected or remitted the admissions and amusement tax<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on sales of refreshments (food and beverage) made in the Race Bar of the restaurant during the periods when the restaurant provided live entertainment. During the audit, the Comptroller reviewed the sales records for a sample week chosen by the restaurant and then somehow made a determination of the percentage ratio of the sales made in the Race Bar when live music or the services of a DJ were provided, to the total refreshment sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>for that week. To arrive at the total amount of admissions and amusement tax it alleged was due for the assessment period, this percentage was then multiplied by the Chevy Chase location\u2019s total annual gross sales for the assessment period. From this an assessment was made and a total tax due amount determined. The amount in admissions and amusement tax already paid by the Chevy Chase proprietor was then subtracted from the total tax alleged to be due to arrive at the claimed deficiency. On October 27, 1999, the Comptroller alleged a total tax due from Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc. in the amount of $48,524.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Comptroller\u2019s audit of the Columbia location revealed that the proprietor of that restaurant had, on a regular basis, remitted the admissions and amusement tax<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on refreshment sales made during the time that live entertainment was provided. The auditor, however, determined that the proprietors had underpaid the tax, and thus issued a tax assessment. The Comptroller used the same process in determining the assessment against the Columbia location as he did for the Chevy Chase location. On October 28, 1999, the Comptroller alleged a total tax due from Clyde\u2019s of Columbia, Inc. in the amount of $4,886.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The determinative issue on review in this case is whether the Tax Court correctly interpreted the meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d contained within Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) of the Tax-General Article. We hold that the Tax Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v), and that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact that respondents\u2019 gross receipts derived from the sale of refreshments during live entertainment were not \u201cin connection with entertainment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">(1) In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we review the decision of the Tax Court, which is an administrative agency. <em>See Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County v. Keeler, </em>362 Md. 198, 207, 764 A.2d 821, 825-26 (2001); <em>see also Read v. Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel County, </em>354 Md. 383, 391, 731 A.2d 868, 872 (1999); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Brown, </em>334 Md. 650, 658 n. 1, 640 A.2d 1142, 1146 n. 1 (1994); <em>Shipp v. Bevard, </em>291 Md. 590, 592 n. 1, 435 A.2d 1114, 1115 n. 1 (1981); <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>276 Md. 36, 38, 343 A.2d 521, 522 (1975). \u201cThe standard of review of a decision of the Tax Court is, of course, a very limited one.\u201d <em>318 North Market Street, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>78 Md.App. 589, 593, 554 A.2d 453, 455 (1989). Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article directs that, when reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s decision, a court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201c(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">The decisions of the Tax Court are subject to this standard of judicial review pursuant to Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 13-532(a) of the Tax-General Article, which states, \u201cA final order of the Tax Court is subject to judicial review as provided for contested cases in \u00a7\u00a7 10-222 and 10-223 of the State Government Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In <em>Keeler, </em>this Court, in reference to judicial review of a final order of the Tax Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201c \u2018[A] reviewing court is under no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>See, e.g., Supervisor of Assess, v. Carroll, </em>298 Md. 311, 469 A.2d 858 (1984); <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-Election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977). On the other hand, where the Tax Court\u2019s decision is based on a factual determination, and there is no error of law, the reviewing court may not reverse the Tax Court\u2019s order if substantial evidence of record supports the agency\u2019s decision.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\"><em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cAccordingly, in this case, we are limited to determining the legality of the decision of the Tax Court and whether there was \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 in the record to support its findings and conclusions. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Disclosure, Inc., </em>340 Md. 675, 683, 667 A.2d 910, 914 (1995); <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v. Consumer Programs, </em>331 Md. 68, 73, 626 A.2d 360, 362 (1993); <em>see also CBS, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>319 Md. 687, 697-98, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990); <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County v.

Supervisor, </em>307 Md. 441, 446, 514 A.2d 1215, 1218 (1986); <em>Ramsay, </em>302 Md. at 838-39, 490 A.2d at 1302. In short, a reviewing court is authorized to reverse a decision of the Tax Court, if the agency \u2018erroneously determines or erroneously applies the law.\u2019 <em>State Department of Assessments and Taxation v. Consumer Programs, </em>331 Md. 68, 72, 626 A.2d 360, 362 (citing <em>Roach v. Comptroller, </em>327 Md. 438, 610 A.2d 754 (1992)); <em>see also Friends School v.

Gannett Co., Inc., </em>356 Md. 699, 707-08, 741 A.2d 1130, 1134-35 (1999). We do not specifically address the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact as neither petitioner nor respondent challenges the validity of those factual findings, and, in addition, the record is replete with evidence supporting such findings. Petitioner\u2019s challenge is confined then to the Tax Court\u2019s legal interpretation of the admissions and amusement tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">When this Court has interpreted statutes, we have annunciated that the \u201c \u2018paramount goal ... is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003)(quoting <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000)). The legislative intent can be ascertained through an analysis of the plain language of the statute and from consideration of its context within the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566; <em>see also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001). Where \u201c \u2018the words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning,\u2019 we \u2018will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994)). In situations where the statutory language is ambiguous, however, this Court looks beyond the statute\u2019s plain language in discerning the legislative intent. <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566; <em>see also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 711, 782 A.2d at 346. Once the language is found to be ambiguous, it is then appropriate to look to the legislative history and other relevant factors that may reveal the intent or general purpose, such as \u201ca bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments ... and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>372 Md. at 677, 814 A.2d at 566 (quoting <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 58, 763 A.2d 136, 140 (2000)(internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>citation omitted)). A \u201c[construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, 352 </em>Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (alteration added)(quoting <em>Tracey v.

In <em>Gannett, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u2018When ambiguities arise in construing tax statutes, Maryland courts must interpret tax code provisions that aid in determining taxable income in the taxpayer\u2019s favor.

Admissions and Amusement Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The statute at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is located within Title 4 of the Tax-General Article of the Maryland Code, entitled \u201cAdmissions and Amusement Tax.\u201d Section 4-102 of the statute provides that a Maryland county \u201cmay impose, by resolution, a tax on ... the gross receipts derived from any admissions and amusement <em>charge </em>in that county.\u201d Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 4-102(a) of the Tax-General Article (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that the Tax Court misinterpreted the definition of what constitutes an admissions and amusement charge, specifically, its interpretation of the nexus required between entertainment and sales of refreshments <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> contained within \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v). The relevant text of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Admissions and amusement charge. </em>\u2014 (1) \u2018Admissions and amusement charge\u2019, unless expressly provided otherwise, means a charge for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">(i) admission to a place, including any additional separate charge for admission within an enclosure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">(v) <em>merchandise, refreshments, or a service sold or served in connection with entertainment at a nightclub or room </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>in a hotel, restaurant, hall, or other place where dancing privileges, music, or other entertainment is provided.\u201d </em>[Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol.2003 Supp.) \u00a7 4-101(b)(1) of the Tax-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Petitioner argues that \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute and the common sense, logical interpretation of that language authorize the assessment of the admissions and amusement tax on receipts Clydes collected from the sale of refreshments during periods when entertainment is provided\u201d (alteration added). Specifically, petitioner asserts that the Tax Court\u2019s decision misinterpreted the \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d language that \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d allowed for the tax. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The phrase \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d is not clear and unambiguous. Connection is defined, generally, as \u201ca relationship in which a person, thing, or idea is linked or associated with something else\u201d or \u201cthe action of linking one thing with another.\u201d <em>The Oxford American College Dictionary </em>294 (Putnam 2003). Connection is also defined elsewhere as \u201c[t]he state of being ... joined; union by junction, by an intervening substance or medium, by dependence or relation, or by order in a series.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>302 (6th ed., West 1990)(alteration added). Here, the refreshments, including food, sold at the two Clyde\u2019s restaurants must be \u201cin connection with\u201d the five entertainment at the-restaurants. The statute provides no guidance as to the level of nexus necessary to satisfy the \u201cconnection\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">A broad interpretation would allow virtually any relation, no matter how minimal, between the refreshments and entertainment to be taxable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One could literally interpret this to mean that all sums paid for any refreshments served at any time in the same room, regardless of whether prices reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the cost of entertainment, are assessable for tax purposes under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">A strict interpretation would allow only those connections with direct financial implications, such as raising the price of food during a performance or the imposition of an admission, cover or minimum charge, to be taxable. The statute\u2019s text provides no guidance in this regard. As the necessary level of dependence or relation between the refreshments and the entertainment is not set forth in the text of the statute, the statute is not clear, but inherently ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">A brief review of the history of Maryland\u2019s admissions and amusement tax and its federal predecessor is necessary to illustrate the extent of the direct financial nexus between refreshment sales and entertainment for profit that was intended by Maryland\u2019s admissions and amusement tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The admissions and amusements tax first appeared in Maryland when it was enacted in 1936; the tax was levied against gross receipts from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cany admission or cover charge for seats and tables, reserved or otherwise, at any restaurant, hotel, caf\u00e9, night club, cabaret, roof garden or similar place furnishing a floor show or similar entertainment. In cases where there is no charge for admission or cover charge to such place of entertainment, furnishing a floor show or similar entertainment, but a charge for admission is wholly or in part included in the price paid for refreshments, service or merchandise, an equivalent tax shall be levied and collected upon twenty per cent of the gross receipts from refreshments, service and merchandise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">1936 Md. Laws, Chap. 10, \u00a7 3. This earlier version of the statute might have better supported the position taken by petitioner. In 1949, however, the Maryland admissions and amusement tax statute was amended<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> into a form that is similar to the current statute. The 1949 statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cADMISSIONS AND AMUSEMENT TAX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">\u201c338.

Laws, Chap. 255 (emphasis added). By 1957 this statute had been recodified, without substantive change, as Md.Code (1957), Art. 81 \u00a7 402. In 1971, the Legislature repealed and reenacted Article 81 \u00a7 402 \u201cto change the kinds of places and events to which the State tax on admissions and amusements is charged on amounts for entrance to such places or events.\u201d 1971 Md. Laws, Chap. 429.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In 1988, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>General Assembly again rewrote and recodified this statute when it added the Tax-General Article to the Maryland Annotated Code. The \u201cAdmissions and Amusement Tax\u201d was placed in Title 4 of the Tax-General Article and the language specific to the issue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the language derived from Article 81 \u00a7 402, was recodified into \u00a7 4-101(b) of the Tax-General Article. That version of the statute read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWq\">\u201c4-101.

Laws, Chap. 2. The Revisor\u2019s Note as to these amendments states, in part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201c[I]n item (1) of this subsection, the former references to \u2018cover charges\u2019 and \u2018a cover charge for seats or tables at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar place\u2019 are deleted as unnecessary in light of the inclusion of any \u2018charge\u2019 for admission to any \u2018place\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-13\">... in item (1) of this subsection, the former condition if \u2018payment of the amount[s] entitles the patron [thereof] to be present during any portion of the performance\u2019 and the former limitations \u201cwhere there is furnished a performance\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>are deleted as unnecessary in light of the right to attend all or part of a performance implicit in the reference to a \u2018charge for ... admission\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">... in item (5) of this subsection, the former reference to entertainment as being \u2018afforded the members, guests, or patrons\u2019 is deleted as surplusage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration added). These notes appear to reflect an interpretation that this assessment is directed at taxing charges allowing patrons access to the entertainment, <em>ie., </em>a direct financial connection between the charges and entertainment. The right to access implicit in an admission charge is the driving force behind the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">As we have noted and as the Court of Special Appeals stated, the admissions and amusement tax \u201calthough authorized by the General Assembly, is imposed by local authority.\u201d The Comptroller administers this tax on behalf of the local taxing authority, retaining a portion only to cover the cost of its administration of the tax. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 2-102(1) of the Tax-General Article (stating, \u201cIn addition to the duties set forth elsewhere in this article and in other articles of the Code, the Comptroller shall administer the laws that relate to: (1) the admissions and amusement tax; ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Substantive changes, not relevant to the issue before us, were added in 1994, which created a subsection \u201c(c),\u201d thus adding a \u201cGame of Entertainment,\u201d under the definition of this tax. The current version of the admissions and amusement tax, last amended in 1999,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>ie., </em>the statute at issue in this case, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The total music expenditures for 1999 for the Chevy Chase restaurant, including recorded music, totaled $66,871, while the gross sales for food and beverages totaled $7,091,728.

Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>256 Md. 381, 386, 260 A.2d 307, 309 (1970), we said, \u201cIt is quite apparent that \u00a7 402 [a similar version to that interpreted in the <em>Burn Brae </em>case] is structured in a fashion strikingly similar to \u00a7 1700(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700(e)(1), which imposed the federal cabaret tax, since repealed....\u201d The federal cabaret tax was substantively amended after the creation of the Maryland admissions and amusement tax in 1936 and those amendments, for the most part, were reflected in the 1949 amendments to the Maryland statute. <em>See Villa Nova, </em>256 Md. 381, 260 A.2d 307. Accordingly, this Court, in reference to the federal cabaret tax, has said that \u201c[decisions concerning this federal statute are instructive\u201d as to its Maryland antecedent. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. The Mandel, Lee, Goldstein, Burch Re-Election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 580, 374 A.2d 1130, 1133 (1977)(alteration added)(holding that the admissions and' amusement tax did not apply to a fund-raising committee\u2019s event because the live organ music being provided, which was being played from behind a curtain, did not fit within the statutory definition of a performance as the patrons of the event did not attend the event to hear the music; the ambiguity in the statute was resolved in the taxpayer\u2019s favor). A brief history of the federal statute is in order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Section 1700 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700, the federal cabaret tax, was first enacted as an admissions tax by Congress in 1917 and repealed in 1965. As stated in <em>Geer v. Birmingham, </em>88 F.Supp. 189, 197 (N.D.Iowa 1950), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>185 F.2d 82 (8th Cir.l950)(emphasis added)(alteration added),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the original tax was subdivided into two parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cThus, from its inception, the admissions tax was imposed upon the general field of entertainment, which was further subdivided for purposes of the imposition of the tax into two different categories because of the nature of the entertainment subject to the tax. On the one hand was that form of entertainment to which a direct admission charge was made upon the patrons ... and on the other hand that form of entertainment to which no admission charge as such was made <em>but rather the charge for admission was included in whole or in part in the price paid by the patron for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>refreshment, service or merchandise. </em>\u2018What are commonly know as cabarets\u2019 comprised this secondary category.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In Section 622 of the Revenue Act of 1942, Congress made substantive changes to the federal cabaret statute; the <em>Geer </em>court quoted from the amended Section 1700(e)(1) when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201c \u2018A tax ... of all amounts paid for admission, refreshment, service, or merchandise, at any roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place furnishing a public performance for profit, by or for any patron or guest who is entitled to be present during any portion of such performance. The term \u2018roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place\u2019 shall include any room in any hotel, restaurant, hall, or other public place where music and dancing privileges or any other entertainment, except instrumental<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or mechanical music alone, are afforded the patrons in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshment or merchandise. <em>A performance shall be regarded as being furnished for profit for purposes of this section even though the charge made for admission, refreshment, service, or merchandise is not increased by reason of the furnishing of such performance.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-7\"><em>Geer, </em>88 F.Supp. at 211 (emphasis added). The amendments, including the addition of the emphasized language, were \u201cintended to support the position the Treasury Department had taken in its Regulations, that hotel dining rooms similar to those in the cases of ... <em>Broadmoor Hotel ... </em>and <em>Deshler Hotel ... </em>should come within the category of a \u2018roof garden, cabaret or other similar place furnishing a public performance for profit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Geer, </em>88 F.Supp. at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In <em>Deshler Hotel Co. v. Busey, </em>36 F.Supp. 392 (S.D.Ohio 1941), the court found that the federal cabaret tax was improperly assessed even where a hotel offered live dance music <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>played by an orchestra with instrumental and vocal soloists during dinner hours in one of its three dining rooms, the Ionian Room, and advertised the playing of such music and singing. While the orchestra was playing, the hotel did not institute a cover charge, a minimum charge for purchases or any other special charge on patrons entering the room where the music was being played. Patrons only paid for the food or refreshments being served. Patrons of any of the three dining rooms were allowed to enter the Ionian Room during the performance. The prices were higher in the other two dining rooms because they were more exclusive than the Ionian Room, although the latter room was the location of the entertainment. In holding that there was no charge for admission, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201c[I]t is clear that the law, as a prerequisite to imposition of the tax, requires that there must be a charge for admission, which may be wholly or in part included in the price paid for refreshment, service, or merchandise. This is the first essential requirement of the act. It has not been changed by regulation and it cannot be so changed by regulation as to eliminate the requirement of an admission charge. In this respect the law is definite and no room is left for administrative interpretation; there must be a charge for admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cThe stipulated facts in the instant case show that the plaintiff made no cover charges, minimum charges, door charges, or special charges; therefore, there could have been no direct charge for admission. Persons might enter the Ionian Room, remain there for a time, and leave again without paying, or becoming liable for the payment of any sum whatever. There remains only the possibility that some sort of an admission charge might be included in the price of food, service, or merchandise purchased. This is refuted by the facts of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 395-96. (alteration added). The court went on to hold that the performance in <em>Deshler Hotel </em>was not a performance for \u201cprofit\u201d when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cSince it has been found that no admission charge in any form was made, it follows as a matter of logic, that the performances could not have been given for a <em>direct </em>profit. Rather it would appear that the entertainment was furnished at the expense of the hotel as an ordinary accompaniment of the service of food and refreshment in the manner customary to hotels of the class to which the plaintiff belongs; something expected by the customer and essential to good and profitable business relations, but in itself yielding no profit. In this case, the expense of the entertainment was an overhead expense incidental to the class of business in which the plaintiff was engaged. This court is therefore of the opinion and holds as a finding of fact, that such performances were not for profit in any accepted sense of the word, but that the expense involved was borne by the plaintiff as overhead. In general, it may be said that no commercial firm undertakes expenditures in the form of overhead without expecting a profit from the business in which the expenditures are made, but it is not from these overhead items that profit is derived. The profit is derived from the business itself and it is partially consumed by the overhead expense; hence, such items are, in themselves, items of expense and not of profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 396 (emphasis added). The court\u2019s analysis interprets the need for both an admission charge and a direct financial nexus between the entertainment and profit. Without any charge for admission or a \u201cdirect profit\u201d or nexus, the entertainment should be seen as an overhead cost, an expense much like the cost of employees, supplies and the like. The facts of the current case are strikingly similar to that of <em>Deshler Hotel. </em>There is no cover charge, minimum charge or the like for patrons to enter either of the Clyde\u2019s restaurants and avail themselves of the entertainment. The only possible charge would be the price generally paid for refreshments, which themselves are not required to be purchased. In essence, there is no direct charge for admission to the entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Similarly, eleven years prior to <em>Deshler </em>the District Court in <em>United States v. Broadmoor Hotel Co., </em>30 F.2d 440 (D.Colo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>1929), held that the tax did not apply to a hotel that provided free orchestra music to the public in its ballroom. Afternoon tea was served in public rooms at the price of seventy-five cents; the price was the same in all of the hotel\u2019s rooms, regardless of whether entertainment was provided. The rooms were available free from any cover or admission charge to all guests of the hotel and to the general public as well. The general public was not required to purchase anything; the dancing and entertainment were free of direct charge. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">\u201cMusic has been a common accessory of hotel dining rooms and lobbies, both before and after the enactment of this statute; so, if Congress had intended to cover the situation we are considering, they would have definitely said so. Therefore, how can it be said that the defendant, in addition to running a hotel, is conducting a roof garden, cabaret, or other similar entertainment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cIt is contemplated that the entertainment referred to shall be conducted for profit and admission charged. But it may be assumed from the statement of facts that 75 cents is not an excessive charge for tea; so, where is any admission charge, and where is any direct profit, found?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cThis section of the Revenue Act calls for something that might be termed entertainment, as distinguished from the mere service of food in the manner and with the accessories customary and expected by the patrons of a hotel of the character of the Broadmoor. Otherwise, it would logically follow that every restaurant, that maintains a radio, victrola, or other musical instrument, would come within the provisions of this section. Such was not the intent of Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoG\"><em>Id. </em>at 441. Although the courts in these cases were answering questions slightly different than in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the logic expressed by those courts is instructive on the question before us. The federal cases required a direct connection between the taxed sales and the entertainment provided. The courts held that the federal tax did not apply where an establishment did not require a cover or admission charge and did not require patrons to purchase refreshments, even where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the general purchase of refreshments could have been the only possible source of the revenue necessary to pay for the music.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">As previously mentioned, in response to the above and other similar decisions, Congress, in 1942, amended the federal cabaret tax to include the definition of a \u201croof garden, cabaret or other similar place.\u201d Congress included the following phrase within the amendments, <em>\u201cA performance shall be regarded as being furnished for profit for purposes of this section even though the charge made for admission, refreshment, service, or merchandise is not increased by reason of the furnishing of such performance.\u201d </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700(e)(1)(1942) (repealed). This all-encompassing provision demonstrates a Congressional intent to tax gross receipts in situations where there may be little or no direct financial nexus between the entertainment and refreshments; it taxes the receipts from any and all such sales when a defined entertainment is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In <em>Jones v. Fox, </em>162 F.Supp. 449, 460 (D.Md.l957)(footnote omitted), that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201cIn 1942, after several court decisions refusing to apply the tax to establishments which neither charged an admission fee nor increased the prices for food and drink so as to include a hidden charge for admission, Congress amended the statute by providing in substance that a public performance is deemed to be for profit despite the fact that any charges made are not increased by reason of the furnishing of such performance.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The <em>Jones </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the federal all-encompassing provision illustrates that such language, if it had been included within the amended Maryland statute, might encompass respondents\u2019 gross receipts during the periods when live music was being played. The General Assembly, however, in spite of expressly being asked to do so, has never chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>incorporate that language into the Maryland version of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">As mentioned, major amendments were made to the Maryland admissions and amusement tax statute in 1949, which recodified the statute into a form resembling the present day statute. The statute, Article 81 \u00a7 338-348, closely resembled its federal counterpart, with a noticeable omission \u2014 the all-encompassing provision of the 1942 amended federal cabaret tax. The 1949 Maryland Legislature is presumed to be fully aware of the federal case law, such as <em>Broadmoor </em>and <em>Desfi-lar, </em>and the Congressional reports<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> outlining the 1942 amendments to the federal cabaret tax.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Armed with that knowledge, the Legislature initially chose not to incorporate the all-encompassing provision of its federal counterpart and has never done so. The General Assembly, whatever its reasons, has chosen not to incorporate the federal language that might clearly make taxable the gross receipts under the factual situation in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Respondents argue that not only did the 1949 Maryland General Assembly choose to exclude the all-encompassing provision, but that the 2003 Maryland Legislature similarly rejected language paralleling the omitted federal provision in its recent rejection of a proposed amendment to \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v). Respondent argues that this rejection supports the interpretation that Clyde\u2019s refreshment sales were not in connection with its entertainment. While not the determining factor, we agree that this legislative rejection of the proposed amendments lends support to the Tax Court\u2019s finding regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ing the financial nexus required by \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v). In <em>Caffrey v. Dep\u2019t of Liquor Control for Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 272, 309, 805 A.2d 268, 290 (2002), this Court recently reaffirmed the use of the amendment-rejection theory as one tool in ascertaining the intent of the Legislature, when we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201c[W]hile \u2018 \u201cwe have never held that the amendment-rejection theory is a completely determinative method of ascertaining legislative intent, we have indicated that such action strengthens the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to achieve the results that the amendment would have achieved, if adopted.\u201d \u2019 <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. [709] at 721, 720 A.2d [311] at 317 [1998] (quoting <em>Demory Bros., </em>273 Md. [320] at 326, 329 A.2d [674] at 677 [1974]) (citing, in part, <em>NCR Corp., </em>313 Md. [118] at 125, 544 A.2d [764] at 767 [1988] (\u201cWhile a committee\u2019s rejection of an amendment is clearly not an infallible indication of legislative intent, it may help our understanding of overall legislative history.\u2019)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjV\">We have long recognized that the rejection of proposed legislation has some relevance in respect to ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. In <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 60 A.2d 691 (1948), we held that a legislative rejection of the addition of a statutory provision lent support to the argument that the Legislature\u2019s intent was not to include the provision. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWo\">\u201cSections 359 and 415, which relate to appeals from orders of the Commission, stand today as they were written in the Act of 1910. While the Legislature made amendments to the Public Service Commission Law in 1922, 1924 and 1927, and could then have authorized the People\u2019s Counsel to take appeals from orders of the Commission, it is significant that it did not do so. On the contrary, an effort at the 1947 session of the Legislature to authorize the People\u2019s Counsel to appeal from orders of the Commission was defeated. The bill was introduced in the Senate January 7, but was reported unfavorably February 26 by the Senate Committee on Judicial Proceedings and the unfavorable report was adopted. Senate Journal, 1947 Sess., 46, 1053. The rejection of the bill strengthens the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that the Legislature has not intended that the People\u2019s Counsel shall appeal from orders of the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 239-40, 60 A.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Similarly, in this case, the admissions and amusement tax, which was modeled after its federal counterpart, originally omitted the all-encompassing provision of that federal statute and, despite several amendments, the Legislature has failed to incorporate such a provision since 1949, including the 2003 General Assembly\u2019s very recent rejection of similar language.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The proposed 2003 legislation, House Bill 982 (HB 982), attempted to add the following language to \u00a7 4 \u2014 101(b)(1)(v): \u201cREGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CHARGE FOR THE MERCHANDISE, REFRESHMENTS, OR SERVICE IS INCREASED BECAUSE ENTERTAINMENT IS PROVIDED.\u201d This clause, it might be argued, would have included the gross receipts from the refreshment sales during the times when establishments such as Clyde\u2019s provided live entertainment. In fact, had the proposed amendment passed the Legislature, the Maryland admissions and amusement tax would look similar to the all-encompassing language of the 1942 amended federal cabaret statute. More important, the \u201cFiscal and Policy Note\u201d for HB 982 specifically recognized that the proposed amendment was in reaction to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion in the case <em>sub judice; </em>it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2S\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Comptroller v. Clyde\u2019s, </em>two restaurants, Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase and Clyde\u2019s of Columbia, challenged the imposition of the admissions and amusement tax when the restaurants provided free entertainment without a means to recoup the cost of the admissions and amusement tax from their patrons. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling that the admissions and amusement tax should not have been imposed by the Comptroller since there was no financial connection between the entertainment provided and the sale of food to support imposition of the tax because Clyde\u2019s did not impose a cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>charge, did not raise prices during the period of entertainment, or did not have any minimum purchase requirements while entertainment was provided. The Comptroller and local government attorneys are currently appealing the court\u2019s decision. If the ruling is upheld, the Comptroller estimates that approximately $8.4 million in admissions and' amusement tax collected during fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003 would be subject to a refund.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 unreported opinion also called for the General Assembly to resolve any ambiguity in the interpretation of the \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d language. The Legislature obviously was aware of that opinion. In light of these factors before it, the General Assembly nonetheless rejected HB <em>982.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>HB 982\u2019s failure to pass both houses of the Legislature is a continuation of over 50 years of rejection of that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The amendment rejection-theory is supported further by the Court of Special Appeals case of <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Burn Brae Dinner Theatre Co., Inc., </em>72 Md.App. 314, 528 A.2d 546 (1987), a case on which both petitioner and respondents rely.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Burn Brae, </em>found that the Maryland admissions and amusement tax required a financial nexus between the refreshments and entertainment provided by a restaurant. The Legislature, nonetheless, did not change the relevant substantive language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of the statute.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In <em>Burn Brae, </em>the intermediate appellate court, after discussing the history of the Maryland admissions and amusement tax, discussed the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of the statute when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c[A]t first blush, \u00a7 402(a)(4) would appear to levy a tax on refreshment receipts at any place furnishing a performance regardless of whether the purchase of refreshments entitles the patron to attend the performance. <em>This interpretation, which the Comptroller urges, is too broad for several reasons.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">First, by its own terms, the tax applies to refreshment receipts at places where entertainment is afforded \u2018in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshments or merchandise.\u2019 Md.Ann.Code art. 81, \u00a7 402(a)(4) (1980 Repl.Vol.). The critical inquiry then is whether the entertainment is afforded \u2018in connection with\u2019 the refreshments. That inquiry, in turn, leads immediately to the question: <em>what \u2018connection\u2019 must exist between the two? </em>We have demonstrated the striking similarities between the Maryland and federal admissions tax. The legislative history of the federal act provides an answer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u2018[F]rom its inception, the admissions tax was imposed <em>upon the general field of entertainment, </em>which was further subdivided for purposes of the imposition of the tax into two different categories because of the nature of the entertainment subject to the tax. On the one hand was that form of entertainment to which a direct admission charge was made upon the patrons, as is the ease with theaters, skating rinks or the like, and on the other hand that form of entertainment to which no admission charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>as such was made but rather the charge for admission was included in whole or in part in the price paid by the patron for refreshment, service or merchandise. \u201cWhat are commonly known as cabarets\u201d comprise this second category.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><em>Geer, </em>88 F.Supp. at 197, quoted in <em>Villa Nova, </em>256 Md. at 387, 260 A.2d 307. <em>Thus, to be taxable, the refreshment price must give the patron access to the entertainment. </em>What the 1971 amendment appeared to take away by moving the limiting language of \u00a7 402(a)(4) to \u00a7 402(a)(1) remained by virtue of the definitional paragraph of \u00a7 402(a)(4). <em>Refreshment receipts are taxed at places where access to the entertainment is paid for through the price of refreshments.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201cSecond, cases construing the federal counterpart to Maryland\u2019s admission and amusement tax have consistently held that refreshment receipts are subject to the tax only when the sale of refreshments is directly related to the cabaret entertainment.... The following language from <em>LaJolla Casa de Manana v. Riddell, </em>106 F.Supp. 132 (S.D.Ca.1952), <em>aff'd, </em>206 F.2d 925 (9th Cir.1953), provides a unifying basis to these decisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u2018It is clear that Congress envisioned an essential unity between the service of refreshment and the enjoyment of the entertainment. The reason for this unity is the reason for the tax itself: that the payment for the refreshment should operate to entitle the patron to view the entertainment, or participate in the dancing, as the case may be.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">106 F.Supp. at 135.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201cThird, it is important to remember that \u00a7 402(a) is an \u2018admissions and amusement\u2019 tax. We are called to consider the statute in the context of that purpose, <em>Mandel Re-Election Com\u2019n [Committee], </em>280 Md. at 579, 374 A.2d 1130, and to resist any interpretation that would extend the scope of the tax to \u2018embrace matters not specifically pointed out,\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 580, 374 A.2d 1130, quoting <em>Gould v. Gould </em>245 U.S. 151, 38 S.Ct. 53, 62 L.Ed. 211 (1917). It is apparent that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>impose this tax upon receipts from refreshments that neither include an admission in its price nor entitle the purchaser to be present during a performance would make \u00a7 402(a)(4) a sales tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Burn Brae, </em>72 Md.App. at 325-27, 528 A.2d at 552-53 (alteration added)(some emphasis added). The Court of Special Appeals later defined its concept of the required nexus when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\"><em>\u201cFurther, there must be a financial nexus between the service of refreshments and the entertainment provided. </em>Otherwise this \u2018amusement\u2019 tax would become a \u2018sales\u2019 tax. For instance, <em>if buying refreshments entitles the patron to see the show, or if refreshment prices are inflated during performances, or if the sale of refreshments pays for the entertainment, then a connection exists between the entertainment and the serving of refreshments. Without such a connection, the tax does not apply. </em>The Comptroller\u2019s contention that \u00a7 402(a)(4) applies whenever refreshments are served in an entertainment area affronts the rule that tax statutes are construed against the State when there is doubt as to its scope. Therefore, that contention must be rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 528 A.2d at 553-54 (alteration added)(emphasis added). While the <em>Burn Brae </em>court was construing an older version of the statute and the central issue was whether the Burn Brae Dinner Theatre was a roof garden or other similar place, the case and its examination of the history of the admissions and amusement tax provide insight directly relevant to the question of the direct nexus required between the entertainment and refreshment sales in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">A person need not purchase refreshments, or pay any charge, in order to be present, although management certainly hopes that such a person will spend money at the establishment. Patrons visiting the same bar on a night without entertainment will pay the exact same price for their meal or other refreshments as would someone ordering the same menu items on a night when live music is provided. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>music at Clyde\u2019s is a secondary attraction.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The refreshments do not entitle the patron to hear the music or see the musicians and the refreshment prices are not inflated during the times when entertainment is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Petitioner argues that respondents\u2019 restaurants fall within the last example of a sufficient financial nexus set forth in the <em>Burn Brae </em>case, \u201cif the sale of refreshments pays for the entertainment.\u201d Petitioner highlights the fact that the musicians hired by Clyde\u2019s are paid out of the till at the end of the night to support this claim. The musicians are paid out of the till regardless of whether the restaurant makes a profit on that evening. In fact, testimony elicited the fact that musicians are often paid from extra cash kept on hand when the sales from that night are less than what is owed to the musicians. Under petitioner\u2019s rationale, no restaurant could ever pay for entertainment without subjecting itself to the tax on all of its receipts. Unless they receive some type of grant, etc., from other sources, restaurants generally pay the costs of operations from the revenue generated by the business. The statute\u2019s phrase, \u201cif the sale of refreshments pays for the entertainment,\u201d might better apply at Clyde\u2019s if the musicians were conditionally paid in relation to the refreshments sold during their performance, <em>i.e., </em>they received a percentage of that night\u2019s extra sales or they agreed to be paid a fixed amount only if the sales increased by a certain amount or if a specific charge for the music, <em>ie., </em>cover, minimum, admissions, etc., was imposed during the period when the live music was played. As we have noted, ambiguity in a taxing provision of a tax statute must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. In this case, the facts illustrate that the musicians were hired at a predetermined rate, regardless of the amount of refreshment sales during their performance. There was no admission, cover or minimum charge to be present during the entertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ment, nor were prices raised during the periods of live music nor was a person required to purchase refreshments in order to be present. Given this factual scenario, we hold that the financial nexus, as a mere overhead cost, between the entertainment and refreshment sales at Clyde\u2019s is too attenuated and the admissions and amusement tax does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Petitioner argues that the lower courts\u2019 decisions interpreting \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) render superfluous \u201cthe exemptions expressed both in the statute and the regulations adopted interpreting the statute.\u201d We do not agree. Maryland Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 4-103(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of the Tax-General Article state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">\u201c \u00a7 4-103. Limitations on authorization to tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">(b) <em>Counties and municipal corporations. </em>\u2014 The admissions and amusement tax may not be imposed by a county or municipal corporation on gross receipts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">(1) derived from any charge for merchandise, refreshments, or a service sold or served at a place where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">(i) dancing is prohibited; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">(ii) the only entertainment provided is mechanical music,' radio, or television.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">This language stems from the 1949 amendments to the Maryland admissions and amusement tax and was derived from a specific limitation on the definition of the type of entertainment able to be taxed under the statute. The relevant provision of the 1949 statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">\u201cThe term \u2018roof garden or other similar place\u2019 shall include any room in any hotel, restaurant, hall or other place where music or dancing privileges or other entertainment, except mechanical music, radio or television, alone, and where no dancing is permitted, are afforded the patrons in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshment or merchandise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>1949 Md. Laws, Chap. 255. This limitation merely excludes certain examples from the statutory definition of entertainment, and does not alter the nexus required, by the phrase, \u201cin connection with,\u201d between that entertainment and the refreshment sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Additional evidence of this is found in the 1942 federal cabaret tax statute, on which the 1949 Maryland law was based. The federal statute which excluded \u201cinstrumental or mechanical music alone\u201d from the definition of entertainment also included the aforementioned all-encompassing provision, which stated, \u201cA performance shall be regarded as being furnished for profit for purposes of this section even though the charge made for admission, refreshment, service, or merchandise is not increased by reason of the furnishing of such performance.\u201d These exceptions would be unnecessary in relation to the all-encompassing provision if those limitations referred to the \u201cin connection with\u201d language and not merely the definition of entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Similarly, Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR), 03.06.02.05B.(1)(e), which states that the \u201ctax does not apply to gross receipts.... Of a restaurant in Baltimore City and Hagerstown which provides for its patrons entertainment in the form of an individual roving performer who does not employ or is not dependent on amplified sound,\u201d is not rendered meaningless by our interpretation of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v). The fact that in Baltimore City and Hagerstown there is a specific exclusion of a certain type of entertainment from the assessment of the admissions and amusement tax in those two locations has no bearing on whether other live entertainment is \u201cin connection with\u201d refreshment sales in other parts of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Petitioner also argues that the court should give deference to \u201cthe long-standing administrative interpretation of the Comptroller,\u201d which states \u201cthat receipts, such as those in question in this case, collected during times when entertainment is provided, are subject to the admissions and amusement tax.\u201d This Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cIn determining the proper weight to be accorded an administrative interpretation or practice, various factors must be taken into account. One of these factors is the consistency of the administrative interpretation or practice with the purposes of the statute. Still another is the thoroughness, breadth, and validity of the considerations underlying the administrative interpretation or practice. The method by which the agency established its interpretation or practice reflects varying degrees of study and evaluation of the particularized problem. Certain methods indicate less thoroughness and breadth than others. Thus, if an administrative interpretation has not resulted from a contested adversary proceeding, or from a <em>promulgated </em>administrative decision, rule, regulation, or departmental statement, it is entitled to relatively little weight. Similarly, if the administrative practice has not been publicly established, it is not entitled to substantial weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Mack Truck, Inc., </em>343 Md. 606, 618, 683 A.2d 777, 782-83 (1996)(quoting <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., Inc., </em>285 Md. 527, 544, 404 A2d 1045, 1055-56 (1979) (citations omitted)). Petitioner\u2019s argument, based on the testimony of an Assistant Chief Auditor of the Compliance Division, has insufficient merit as its \u201clong-standing administrative interpretation\u201d has not been publically promulgated through any regulation, rule or other publication. It does not meet the <em>Mack Truck </em>standard. Under such circumstances, the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation is of insufficient weight to carry the day in the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Finally, as we have previously indicated, this Court\u2019s holding that any ambiguity in taxing provisions of tax statutes shall be interpreted in favor of the taxpayer, <em>Gannett, </em>356 Md. at 707, 741 A.2d at 1135, supports our interpretation of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v). As we have held that the \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d phrase within \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) is inherently ambiguous, our interpretation, while- consistent with the legislative intent, the relevant case law and other factors, must also resolve the ambiguity in favor of the taxpayer. We note petitioner\u2019s concern that our interpretation of the financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>nexus will cause the local taxing authorities to lose a source of revenue in these present, hard fiscal times. Such concerns however, are more appropriately addressed by the General Assembly; \u2022 the Legislature is free to address the ambiguity within this statute if it perceives that the statute as it currently reads will cause a financial loss to the local taxing authorities \u2014 that the Legislature desires to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In addition, this decision is limited to its unique facts. Here, the Tax Court found that the respondent restaurants had competitive prices, did not raise those prices during performances, charged no cover charge or other express charge, and had no minimum purchase requirement imposed on patrons in order for them to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the Tax Court correctly found that taxing gross receipts of refreshments, where the restaurant did not charge patrons to enter the facility or increase the price of refreshments during the live entertainment, did not require a minimum charge to be present for the entertainment and did not require refreshments to be bought in order for a person to be present, was too attenuated a connection with the entertainment under the statute. The phrase \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d is inherently ambiguous where the statute is silent as to the extent of the nexus necessary between refreshment sales and entertainment. After a careful review of the case law and legislative history, we hold that \u00a7 4 \u2014 101(b)(1)(v) requires a direct financial nexus beyond mere overhead expenses for the music between the \u201cmerchandise, refreshments or a service sold\u201d and entertainment provided by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">.

Prior versions of the admissions and amusement tax appeared to allow for taxation by both the State and the local taxing authorities. At one point the State was permitted to retain as much as eight-ninths of the tax collected. Chapter 429 of the Laws of Maryland of 1971 amended the admissions and amusement tax, thus eliminating the State\u2019s right to retain a fraction of the tax\u2019s proceeds above and beyond the cost of the collection of the tax. It stated that, \"THE COMPTROLLER SHALL DEDUCT THE amount expended by the admission tax division to defray the cost of administration and collection of the admissions and amusement tax collected under this subtitle.

This version of the statute was similar to the version interpreted by the Court of Special Appeals in its <em>Burn Brae </em>case, discussed <em>infra. </em>The specific text of the statute in question in the <em>Burn Brae </em>case was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\" \u00a7 402.

Under petitioner\u2019s rationale, merchandise, such as t-shirts, sweatshirts and the like, sold by a restaurant providing live entertainment are subject to this tax. Thus, in a restaurant with a two-floor layout similar to the Clyde\u2019s in Chevy Chase, the gross receipts from the sale of t-shirts in an upstairs gift shop to a patron later eating in the upstairs restaurant would be subject to the same tax as would the sale of the same shirt by vendors to patrons during live entertainment in the downstairs bar.

The Restaurant Association of Maryland, in its letter to the House and Ways Committee opposing the legislation, stated that the \"reason this legislation is before the House Ways and Means Committee today is because of assessments imposed by the Comptroller on Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase and Clyde's of Columbia, Inc. in 1999,\u201d and then proceeded to outline the history of this case.

In <em>Wallace, </em>where the purported legislative inaction was in response to a case of the Court of Special Appeals, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\"It is conceivable that the Legislature believed this Court would correct any misinterpretation of [the statute] when the opportunity presented itself.

While this type of judicial action is less indicative of legislative intent as inaction in regard to a decision by this Court might be, in light of the Legislature's over 50 years history of omitting language akin to that of HB 982, we do find the amendment-rejection theory to be a supporting factor in this case for our upholding the determinations of the Tax Court and the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\">.

While the General Assembly amended the statute after the <em>Burn Brae </em>decision, the substantive meaning of the phrase \"in connection with\u201d has not been changed.

Keeler, </em>362 Md. 198, 209, 764 A.2d 821, 827 (2001) (citations omitted); <em>see also Comptroller v. Digi-Data Corp., </em>317 Md. 212, 231, 562 A.2d 1259, 1269 (1989). Indeed, \u201c[e]ven with regard to some <em>legal issues, </em>a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Division of Labor v. Triangle, </em>366 Md. 407, 416, 784 A.2d 534, 539 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I am also persuaded that where a tax statute\u2019s applicability, as opposed to a tax exemption, is ambiguous on its face, the ambiguity should be read in favor of the taxpayer. <em>See Comptroller v. Mandel Re-Election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 584, 374 A.2d 1130, 1135 (1977). The phrase \u201cin connection with entertainment\u201d is inherently ambiguous and \u2014 under the circumstances presented in the instant case and due to the deference owed to the agency\u2019s decision \u2014 must be read in favor of Clyde\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">I do not join that part of the Court\u2019s opinion that relies upon the \u201camendment-rejection\u201d theory of statutory interpretation. The inaction of the General Assembly with respect to a proposed amendment that may have clarified the meaning of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) of the Tax-General Article does not aid courts who must discover the intentions of the Legislature with respect to enacted provisions of the tax code. The reason for this is that the Legislature\u2019s intentions by not acting on a proposed amendment are almost impossible to divine. Perhaps the General Assembly, knowing that this Court had granted certiorari for this case and would soon be answering the statutory question, decided to wait on the proposed amendment until after our decision; perhaps the General Assembly considered the tax code sufficiently clear; perhaps the General Assembly believed the proposed amendment in need of additional language to achieve its purpose; perhaps the General Assembly simply decided to save the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>amendment for a more convenient time or for further study and deliberation. The point is, the rejection of an amendment tells this Court very little, and perhaps nothing, about the intentions of the General Assembly when it passed \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v), and it could just as easily indicate an intent contrary to the one divined by the Court. Such inferences from the legislative history are therefore unhelpful to the interpretive enterprise, and I would not rely on it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">I do not join the rest of the Court\u2019s opinion because I find the standard enunciated therein does not clarify the meaning of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) of the Tax-General Article. \u201cDirect financial nexus\u201d is just as ambiguous as \u201cin connection with,\u201d and I do not agree that the admissions tax will apply only where there is a specific charge for the performance or if the performers are conditionally paid in relation to the refreshments sold. Yet I am confident that should the General Assembly seek to impose Maryland\u2019s admissions and amusement tax upon establishments like Clyde\u2019s, it is fully capable of doing so by following the example of Congress in response to the federal district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Deshler Hotel Co. v. Busey, </em>36 F.Supp. 392 (S.D.Ohio 1941), <em>aff'd, </em>130 F.2d 187 (6th Cir.1942), and, like Congress in 1942, can enact a statute that clarifies the meaning of \u00a7 4-101(b)(1)(v) of the Tax-General Article.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
