He presently does not maintain a law office in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">On March 19, 2002 and April 17, 2002, the Attorney Grievance Commission, acting through Bar Counsel, and pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-712(b)(5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed two petitions with this Court for disciplinary action against Tinsky, Respondent, alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (hereinafter \u201cMRPC\u201d). In its petition filed on March 19, 2002, the Commission charged Respondent with violations of MRPC 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4(a) and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(Communication)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 8.4(d) (Misconduct)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in Tinsky\u2019s representation of Behrooz Irani in connection with his bankruptcy case. In its petition filed on April 17, 2002, the Commission charged Respondent with violations of MRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation), and 8.4(d) (Misconduct) in Tinsky\u2019s representation of Robert Alonzo Taylor in connection with two criminal matters. Pursuant to Rule 16-757,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this Court referred the two petitions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Judge Richard H. Sothoron of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">On July 16, 2002, Petitioner served Respondent with process on both petitions through the Client Protection Fund, after attempts to serve Tinsky personally were unsuccessful. On March 7, 2003, an Order of Default was entered as to both petitions and notice of that Order was sent to Respondent at his last known address. The order allowed Respondent 30 days within which to move to vacate the order. No motion to vacate was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Judge Sothoron held a hearing on the Irani and Taylor matters on April 25, 2003 but Respondent neither attended nor participated. Respondent did not appear for oral argument before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">I. <em>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In a memorandum opinion addressing both matters, dated May 1, 2003, the hearing judge entered the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">\u201cThe Petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals of Maryland in Misc. Docket AG No. 7, September Term 2002, on March 19, 2002. On March 26, 2002, the Court of Appeals assigned the case to this Court for a hearing in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757. After attempts to serve the Respondent personally were unsuccessful, Petitioner served Respondent with process through the Client Protection Fund on July 16, 2002. This Court entered an Order of Default on March 7, 2003, and the Clerk of the Circuit Court sent notice of that Order to Respondent\u2019s last known address. A hearing on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>matter was held on April 25, 2003. Respondent did not appear at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d) in his representation of Behrooz Irani in connection with his bankruptcy case. Petitioner produced at the hearing an affidavit of the Complainant, Shernaz Irani, and the pertinent documents from the bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Behrooz Irani retained Respondent in September 1997 and was paid a total of $925.00 for his fee and expenses. Although Mr. Irani cooperated with Respondent and provided him all the information and documentation he requested, Respondent did not file his Chapter 7 petition for discharge until February 10, 2000. Respondent failed to attach to the petition the required schedules and statement of financial affairs. The Bankruptcy Court notified Respondent of the deficiencies, but Respondent failed to amend the petition. The Bankruptcy Court dismissed Mr. Irani\u2019s bankruptcy petition on February 29, 2000. Respondent filed a Motion to Strike the dismissal order on March 14, 2000. The Bankruptcy Court subsequently denied the Motion to Strike on June 13, 2000. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Strike was not timely filed, contained no legal basis, and failed to include the additional financial information required by the Court. Throughout the course of the representation, Respondent failed to return telephone calls from his client and he did not keep him informed of developments in the case. Respondent never refunded his fee, although the services rendered to Mr. Irani were of no value to him. Respondent closed his office in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that by his conduct, Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Respondent acted incompetently in violation of Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to submit the required schedules and statement of financial affairs along with Mr. Irani\u2019s bankruptcy petition, by failing to provide these materials when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>requested by the Court, and by failing to file a timely and appropriate opposition to the dismissal of Mr. Irani\u2019s petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">\u201cRespondent did not act with reasonable diligence in his representation of Mr. Irani, in violation of Rule 1.3 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, by delaying over two years after he was retained before filing the bankruptcy petition, then not filing additional materials requested by the Court in a timely manner, and by failing to file the Motion to Strike the dismissal order within the time permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">\u201cRespondent failed to keep his client informed of the status of the case and did not respond to his inquires regarding the case in violation of Rule 1.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">\u201cRespondent violated Rule 1.16(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by not refunding his unearned fee and by abandoning his practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s lack of any effective action on behalf of his client in connection with the bankruptcy case, particularly in failing to supply information requested by the Court and his untimely filing of the Motion to Strike, was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">\u201cPetitioner filed a Petition for Disciplinary Action in the Court of Appeals on April 17, 2002, in Misc. Docket AG No. 20, September Term 2002. That case was assigned to this Court on April 22, 2002. Respondent was served by service on the Client Protection Fund. He filed no answer to the Petition for Disciplinary Action. An Order of Default was entered on March 7, 2003, and the Clerk sent a notice to Respondent\u2019s last known address. A hearing was held on March 25, 2003.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Respondent did not appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201cPetitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in this matter. Petitioner introduced at the hearing an affidavit from the Honorable Steven I. Platt and a certified copy of the Circuit Court file for the case of <em>State of Maryland v. Robert Alonzo Taylor, </em>Case No. CA00-4636J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was retained by Robert Alonzo Taylor to represent him in two criminal matters pending in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Respondent received a fee and entered his appearance in those two cases. He failed to appear at trials scheduled for February 5 and April 2, 2001. Without notice to the Court or his client, Respondent closed his law office in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to appear at his client\u2019s criminal trial on two occasions was incompetent representation and showed lack of diligence, in violation of Rules 1.1 and 1.3 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. His failure to notify his client of his closing of his office, his taking a fee without appearing at trial, and his disappearance while his client\u2019s criminal cases were pending violated Rule 1.16 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, pertaining to termination of representation. His failure to appear in court and abandonment of his client, who was facing criminal charges in two cases, was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule 1.6 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">This Court exercises \u201c \u2018original and complete jurisdiction for attorney disciplinary proceedings in Maryland,\u2019 and conducts \u2018an independent review of the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 293, 818 A.2d 219, 230 (2003) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 492, 813 A.2d 1145, 1160 (2002) (citations omitted)). \u201cIn conducting that review, we accept the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>judge\u2019s findings of fact as <em>prima facie </em>correct unless shown to be \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 and we give due regard to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 288, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002)). \u201cAs to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law,\u201d however, \u201c \u2018our consideration is essentially <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, </em>368 Md. 419, 428, 795 A.2d 706, 710-11 (2002) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 322, 786 A.2d 763, 768 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 562, 745 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2000)))). This is true even where default orders have been entered by the hearing judge. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 49, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267-68 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Neither party has filed any exceptions to the findings, and Respondent did not appear at the oral argument in this Court. On the record before us, we sustain Judge Sothoron\u2019s findings and hold that his conclusions of law are supported by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Bar Counsel has recommended that Respondent be disbarred for his violations of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d). Specifically, Bar Counsel has identified Respondent\u2019s \u201ccomplete and unexplained abandonment of his law practice and his failure to return unearned fees\u201d as justification for his disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In a case similar to the present case, that of <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 289-90, 793 A.2d at 542-43, in which we disbarred Wallace, we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">[i]t is well-settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 446-47, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 364, 624 A.2d 503, 513 (1993); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. 252, 262-63, 619 A.2d 100, 105 (1993); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>302 Md. 571, 580, 490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>A.2d 231, 236 (1985); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. 450, 459, 483 A.2d 354, 359 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 119, 460 A.2d 597, 600 (1983). The public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 382, 420 A.2d 940, 959 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 970, 101 S.Ct. 1492, 67 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). By imposing such a sanction, this Court fulfills its responsibility \u2018to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the Bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute.\u2019 <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 549, 318 A.2d 811, 814 (1974). Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates the disciplinary rules. <em>See Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. at 262-63, 619 A.2d at 105; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 355, 587 A.2d 511, 521 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 540-41, 565 A.2d 660, 668 (1989). Of course, what the appropriate sanction for the particular misconduct is, in the public interest, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>300 Md. 637, 642, 479 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1984) (the facts and circumstances of a case will determine how severe the sanction should be); <em>Montgomery, </em>296 Md. at 120, 460 A.2d at 600; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, </em>289 Md. 603, 609, 425 A.2d 1352, 1355 (1981). The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well as facts in mitigation, constitutes part of those facts and circumstances. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN0\"><em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 793 A.2d at 542-43 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 760-61, 736 A.2d 339, 343-44 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">After exploring other cases involving client neglect and failure to return client funds, we directed that Wallace be disbarred in language equally applicable to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The record in the case at bar does not indicate that respondent has received any previous reprimands or sanctions from this Court; nevertheless, the volume and severity of the complaints against respondent lead us to conclude that the appropriate sanction against respondent is disbarment. Respondent has engaged in a pattern of conduct that only the most severe sanction of disbarment will provide the protection to the public that this procedure is supposed to provide. Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence, his lack of preparation, his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations, and his failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests all lead to the most severe sanction of disbarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 293, 793 A.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Faber, </em>373 Md. 173, 817 A.2d 205 (2003), we also disbarred another attorney for violations of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.16, even without a finding of a violation of Rule 8.4(d), in language relevant to the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ark\">This Court consistently has regarded neglect of client needs and failure to communicate with clients to be violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 703, 569 A.2d 1250, 1253 (1990) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>306 Md. 107, 115, 507 A.2d 625, 629 (1986)). We previously have found disbarment to be appropriate when attorneys repeatedly neglect client affairs. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 290, 293, 793 A.2d 535, 543, 545 (2002); <em>Manning, </em>318 Md. at 705, 569 A.2d at 1254; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
