Approximately two months later, Montgomery was reassigned by the newly appointed Warden, Robert Kupec, to an administrative assistant position, at the same pay and classification, in the ECI\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Maintenance Department. Montgomery, a few months after that event, filed a \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint with the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Budget and Management (\u201cthe Department\u201d) that Montgomery contends comes within the ambit of subtitle 3 of section 5 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article of the Maryland Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), entitled \u201cMaryland Whistleblower Law in the Executive Branch of State Government\u201d (\u201cWhistleblower Law\u201d). In sum, Montgomery there complained that her reassignment was in retaliation for having filed the initial personnel grievance against Kaloroumakis. The Department found no merit in Montgomery\u2019s \u2018Whistleblower\u201d complaint. Montgomery then appealed that action to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the OAH, relying on federal precedent interpreting the federal Whistleblower Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d) upon which the Maryland statute was based, ruled that the information contained in Montgomery\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint \u201cchallenging the actions of a supervisor towards an employee is not a protected disclosure\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Whistleblower Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ ruled further that Montgomery\u2019s complaint did not allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>facts sufficient to show that she had made disclosures that were protected by Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Montgomery filed a petition for judicial review of the AL J\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. After a hearing, the judge concluded that Montgomery\u2019s complaint about the behavior of her supervisor is not a protected disclosure under Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law and affirmed the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Regarding Montgomery\u2019s direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed. We granted Montgomery\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Montgomery v. Eastern Correctional, </em>374 Md. 358, 822 A.2d 1224 (2003), to consider the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">1. Has a State employee who has filed a grievance about the behavior of her supervisor, complaining that he has created a hostile work environment that is detrimental to her career, made a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under Maryland-Code section 5-305 of the Maryland Whistle-blower Act, in the State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Sheila Montgomery, prior to 8 November 1999, was for a number of years an administrative aide in the Warden\u2019s Office at the ECI. She served as a personnel liaison between the Warden and staff members at the ECI and was responsible for maintaining the Warden\u2019s calendar and drafting letters for his signature. In June 1999, Warden Ralph Logan left the ECI and was replaced, on a temporary basis, by Acting Warden George Kaloroumakis. Between June and September 1999, Montgomery served as an administrative aide to Acting Warden Kaloroumakis.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">On 9 September 1999, Montgomery filed a grievance with the State Personnel Management System complaining about the Acting Warden\u2019s behavior towards her. Under the section of the form asking Montgomery to state her grievance, she wrote: \u201cOngoing and continuing harassment by the Acting Warden (George Kaloroumakis) which constitutes a hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>work environment or places me in a hostile work environment.\u201d Under the heading \u201cThe issues of fact and law that support the employee\u2019s appeal,\u201d she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-5\">The derogatory demeanor and belittling comments of the Acting Warden ... in my opinion create a hostile work environment which is detrimental to my career with the State of Maryland and creates a hostile work place. I feel his behavior violates Executive Order 01.01.1995.19 Code of Fair Employment Practices.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The remedy sought in Montgomery\u2019s grievance was that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apv-dedup-0\">wish[ed] to be able to be given the opportunity to perform [the] functions of [her] classification and that the State provide meaningful conflict resolution which would be agreeable to both parties of the grievance and that proper and adequate sensitivity training be provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>As previously related, the newly appointed Warden Rupee transferred Montgomery on 9 November 1999 from her administrative assistant\u2019s position in the Warden\u2019s Office to one in the ECI\u2019s Maintenance Department. In addition to the physical surroundings of her new workplace not being as nice as in the Warden\u2019s Office, Montgomery observed that her secretarial duties became less challenging and fulfilling and generally that the prestige of her new position was less. Nevertheless, she suffered no decrease in classification or pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Consequently, about six months after filing the personnel grievance and four months\u2019 service in her new position, Montgomery wrote a letter (the \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint), dated 20 March 2000, to Frederick W. Puddester, the Secretary of the State Department of Budget and Management. In the \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint, she alleged that the November 1999 transfer was a reprisal for filing her grievance against Acting Warden Kaloroumakis.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In her \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint, Montgomery explained that Kaloroumakis referred to office workers as \u201cpeons\u201d and \u201cmade disparaging remarks about our income and social standing.\u201d When she and a co-employee attempted to bring to his attention their objections regarding his behavior, Kalo-roumakis reportedly acknowledged making \u201cthe discourteous remarks attributed to him\u201d and also admitted that he \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>press[ed] himself in a manner \u2018locals\u2019 might consider sarcastic or even abrasive.\u201d Kaloroumakis summarily rejected their complaints by saying that \u201csuch behavior was the norm in his native New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Montgomery\u2019s \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint letter was referred by Secretary Puddester to the Office of the Statewide Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) Coordinator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On 2 June 2000, the Acting Statewide EEO Coordinator wrote a letter to Montgomery advising her that the evidence of record did not support her allegations that she had made a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Law and that, accordingly, no violation of that Act was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Montgomery noted an appeal to the OAH, pursuant to Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-310 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ECI responded by filing a \u201cMotion for Summary Decision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that motion, the ECI contended that the information contained in Montgomery\u2019s grievance did not constitute a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under the Whistleblower Law. The ALJ treated the ECI\u2019s \u201cmotion for summary decision\u201d as a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause' of action upon which relief could be granted. Accordingly, the ALJ treated all allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>tions in Montgomery\u2019s complaint as true. Relying on federal precedent interpreting and applying the WPA, upon which the Maryland statute was based, the ALJ ruled that \u201cchallenging the actions of a supervisor towards an employee is not a protected disclosure\u201d under the Maryland Whistleblower Law. Alternatively, the ALJ ruled that the type of information disclosed by Montgomery in her complaint was not protected by the Act because (1) the disclosure was \u201cnot a matter of interest to the greater public\u201d and (2) the \u201cdisclosure in the grievance in no way addressed the fiscal, health, or safety concerns of the public at large, which is an essential element of a\u201d claim under the State Whistleblower Law. On those grounds, the ALJ ruled that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show that Montgomery had made disclosures that were protected by the Whistleblower Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">On 30 November 2000, Montgomery filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. Following a hearing on 24 July 2001, the judge opined in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201c[T]his court agrees [with the ALJ] ... that under the federal Whistleblower Act, which is ... similar to Maryland\u2019s Act, [an] employee[\u2019]s complain[t] about the behavior of a supervisor is not a protected disclosure. The court is not persuaded that a hostile work environment is a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Act. And it appears to this court that the Whistleblower statute does not cover the type of conduct that Ms. Montgomery was alleging. The court finds no error as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">\u201cAn administrative agency\u2019s decision must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the agency since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity. Therefore the court will affirm the decision of the administrative law judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN1\">After the hearing, by written order, dated 27 July 2001, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued that an allegation of a \u201chostile work environment\u201d affecting co-workers as well as herself is not the type of personal grievance that is prohibited under federal law from being pursued as a whistleblower complaint. Petitioner also maintained that the Maryland state employee personnel law affords employees who are retaliated against for filing a grievance the option of filing a whistleblower complaint. In addition, Petitioner argued that the ALJ may not dismiss summarily a whistleblower complaint \u2014 on the grounds that a \u201chostile work environment\u201d complaint does not allege an \u201cabuse of authority\u201d as a matter of law \u2014 without making factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion filed on 23 August 2002, affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. The intermediate appellate court noted that the purpose of Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law is the same as the federal WPA from which it derives, that is, to protect government employees who disclose serious government illegality, waste, and corruption. On the issue of whether the subject matter of a personal grievance also can be the subject of a whistleblower complaint, the court found that \u201c[federal cases appear to uniformly hold that only disclosures made outside the grievance procedures are protected disclosures under the federal WPA, and our research has uncovered no authority to the contrary.\u201d As such, the court concluded that reprisals based upon a right to complain are not entitled to whistleblower protection. Regarding Petitioner\u2019s claim of a right to an election of remedies to file under the Whistleblower Law or the employee grievance procedure, the court held that \u201ca state employee has no such election when, as here, the employee failed to allege facts showing that he or she made a disclosure that was protected under the Whistleblower Act.\u201d Finally, the court found Petitioner\u2019s contention that further factual determinations by the ALJ were needed, to be unwarranted. The court concluded that there was no dispute as to what Montgomery had disclosed in writing and, therefore, there was no need for a hearing to \u201cdevelop facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law, Maryland Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 thru 5-313 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, prohibits a reprisal against a State employee who makes a protected disclosure of \u201cinformation that the employee reasonably believes evidences: (i) an abuse of authority, gross mismanagement, or gross waste of money; (ii) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or (iii) a violation of law....\u201d Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-305(1) of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article. The Department, the OAH, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Special Appeals all applied the same legal principles in the present case to conclude that Montgomery\u2019s grievance complaining of Acting Warden Kaloroumakis\u2019 \u201cderogatory\u201d and \u201cbelittling\u201d behavior did not amount to a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under the Whistleblower Law. As this conclusion is supported by the language of the relevant Maryland statutes and regulations, persuasive federal precedents, and the assertions of Montgomery\u2019s grievance itself, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">It is well settled that our role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230. <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Gov\u2019t Article. \u201cEven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999). We, therefore, ordinarily give considerable weight to the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute that the agency administers. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>681, 696-97, 684 A.2d 804, 811-12 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v.

Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field of endeavor is entitled to judicial respect. <em>Fogle v.

The preamble to H.B. 616 stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cThe General Assembly finds that the interests of the citizens of Maryland demand a government which operates in accordance with the law and in avoidance of mismanagement, monetary waste, abuse of authority, and danger to public health and safety. In furtherance of these goals, it is essential that classified State employees be free to disclose impropriety in exercise of their constitutional right of free speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">\u201cThe purpose of this subtitle is to prohibit any State appointing authority from using a personnel action as a retaliatory measure against an employee or applicant for State employment who has made a disclosure of illegality or impropriety.\u201d[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The parties to this appeal agree that Maryland\u2019s Whistle-blower Law is patterned after the whistleblower provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d). Federal protection of government employees who made certain types of disclosures, most of which were embarrassing to the government, was first provided in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The CSRA, in addition \u201cto setting up an exclusive framework of merit principles and personnel procedures,\u201d also \u201cdetailed a host of \u2018prohibited practices,\u2019 actions which are prohibited to be taken against employees.\u201d <em>Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>978 F.2d 679, 682 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">In 1989 Congress passed the WPA, Pub.L. Nos. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), under which federal employees gained additional protection from retaliatory action due to whistleblowing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whistleblowers are now protected by provisions set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) (2003). The WPA was enacted \u201cfor the purpose of protecting federal employees who disclose government illegality, waste, and corruption.\u201d <em>Ellison v.

The report recommended, among other things, numerous changes to the Maryland Whistleblower Law, but \u00a7 5-305 remained essentially the same. The General Assembly adopted the task force\u2019s suggestions without substantial change.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The language used in \u00a7 5-305 of the current Maryland Whistleblower Law is similar to that found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). In language nearly identical to that of the Maryland statute, the federal WPA defines a protected disclosure as \u201cany disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences \u2014 (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8) (2003); <em>see also Ford v.

In such circumstances, it seems appropriate to apply the well settled principle that \u201cwhere the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive.\u201d <em>Fioretti v.

Almost a year after the EEOC complaint was filed, the DVA suspended the employee for abuse of sick leave. Spruill complained to the Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d), contending that the sick leave abuse suspension was made in retaliation for his having filed the EEOC complaint. The OSC declined to investigate on the grounds that complaints alleging discrimination and reprisal for filing an EEOC Complaint\u2014 like that filed by Spruill \u2014 were \u201cmore appropriately resolved through the EEOC process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. Spruill then appealed to the federal Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) for review of his three-day suspension, alleging that filing the EEOC complaint was \u201cprotected whistleblowing activity\u201d under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). <em>Id. </em>Spruill\u2019s appeal was dismissed by an ALJ who found that the MSPB was without jurisdiction. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, one of the issues presented was whether the filing of an EEOC complaint (the act that triggered the alleged reprisal) was a prohibited act described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). The <em>Spruill </em>Court held that it was not. <em>Id. </em>at 690. The court said that, in enacting sections 2302(b)(8) and (9)(A), Congress chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>to differentiate between reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain. Only the former \u2014 described in \u00a7 2302(b)(8) \u2014 was termed \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d in the debates, although that term was neither employed nor defined in the original statute itself. This understanding of the term was subsequently formalized in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Congress in the Findings and Purpose section of the Act noted that one of the functions of the CSRA and the OSC was \u201cto protect whistleblowers (those individuals who make disclosures described in such section 2302(b)(8)) from reprisal.\u201d 103 Stat. 16, \u00a7 2(a)(3) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, note (Supp. II 1990) (emphasis added)). <em>See also </em>135 Cong.

Ford claimed she was terminated from employment at the ECI, in violation of Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law, in retaliation for filing charges against her supervisor. 149 Md.App. at 501, 817 A.2d at 272. Ford argued that federal authorities have been loath to permit federal employees who were retaliated against for filing grievances to proceed with a federal WPA complaint because, unlike Maryland, there is a separate statutory remedy under federal law addressing such retaliation. 149 Md. App. at 502, 817 A.2d at 272-73. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court and ALJ, finding that Ford\u2019s argument ignored the fact that Maryland law also provides remedies specifically for addressing employee complaints alleging violations of employment rights and reprisals for making such complaints. <em>Id. See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-103 of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article (providing exclusive remedy by which employee may pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>claim of reprisal); Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 16(f) (prohibiting discrimination against employee for making charge of discrimination to Maryland Human Relations Commission or testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding of the commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In the present case, Petitioner adopts the argument that was rejected by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Ford </em>and contends there are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">[significant differences between the two statutory schemes \u2014 state and federal \u2014 which militate against imposing a federally derived exception upon the Maryland Whistleblower Law. The WPA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), is merely a part of a broad-based statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302) prohibiting various discriminatory or unfair management practices. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), Title VII \u2014 style discrimination (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)) and grievance-generated reprisals (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9)), are identified separately, proscribed separately and addressed separately. By contrast, the Maryland Whistleblower Law is a \u201cstand-alone\u201d statute and does not draw any of the distinctions made in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b). Thus, while it arguably makes sense to require [flederal employees who have been retaliated against for filing grievances to pursue claims under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9), and not under the Whistleblower provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), there is no logical or pragmatic basis for imposing such an exception upon the Maryland Whistle-blower Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">It is true, as Petitioner argues, that the federal statutes separately address and prohibit different specific types of discriminatory management practices, but it is also true, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, that Maryland statutes do the same in parallel fashion. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-302 of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article (identifying, addressing, and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age, race, religion, or sex); Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-210 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article (providing specific remedial procedures for complaints of discrimination); Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-305 of the State Pers. &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Pens. Article (identifying, addressing, and prohibiting reprisals against State employees for grievances or complaints); Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.VoL), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Pers. <em>&amp; </em>Pens. Article (providing specific and exclusive remedial procedures for grievances and complaints of reprisal for filing grievances). Thus, the remedial Maryland statutory scheme that is available to aggrieved State employees is similar to the statutory protection afforded to their federal counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Maryland\u2019s version of the federal WPA is not, as Petitioner contends, \u201ca stand-alone statute.\u201d It must be read in conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 2-302 and 12-103 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. Section 12-103 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Right to bring grievance; exclusiveness of remedy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">(a) <em>Right to bring grievance. </em>\u2014 An employee with a grievance or the grievant\u2019s representative may present the grievance free from coercion, discrimination, interference, <em>reprisal, or restraint.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">(b) <em>Remedy exclusive. </em>\u2014 Unless another procedure is provided for by this article, <em>the grievance procedure is the exclusive remedy </em>through which a nontemporary employee in the State Personnel Management System may seek an administrative remedy for violations of the provisions of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Section 2-302 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Discrimination, harassment prohibited.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">(a) <em>Purpose. </em>\u2014 The State recognizes and honors the value and dignity of every person and understands the importance of providing employees and applicants for employment with a fair opportunity to pursue their careers in an environment free of discrimination or harassment prohibited by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-13\">(b) <em>Personnel actions. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection or by other law, all personnel actions concerning a State employee or applicant for em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ployment in State government shall be made -without regard to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">(i) age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">(ii) ancestry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">(iii) color;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">(iv) creed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">(v) marital status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">(vi) mental or physical disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">(vii) national origin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">(viii) race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">(ix) religious affiliation, belief, or opinion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">(x) sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">(2) A personnel action may be taken with regard to age, sex, or disability to the extent that age, sex, or physical or mental qualification is required by law or is a bona fide occupational qualification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-16\">(c) <em>Responsibilities of employees, managers and supervisors; penalties for violation of subtitle. </em>\u2014 (1) Each State employee is expected to assume personal responsibility and leadership in ensuring fair employment practices and equal employment opportunity in Maryland State government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-17\">(2) Employment discrimination and harassment by State managers, supervisors, or other employees is prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-18\">(3) A State employee who violates this subtitle is subject to disciplinary action by the employee\u2019s appointing authority, including the termination of State employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-19\">Persons who file grievances in which they complain about \u201charassment\u201d are protected from retaliation, by virtue of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2-302 and 12-103(a), for any disclosure they make to their supervisors during the grievance procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The rights accorded to grievants under Maryland law are closely analogous to the rights granted to federal employees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9)(A). Thus, the ALJ, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Special Appeals in the present case were correct to be persuaded by federal precedent and to hold that an alleged reprisal by a supervisor against an employee for filing a personnel grievance about that supervisor is not protected under Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Even though we disagree with Montgomery\u2019s arguments in the present case, we appreciate the practical objectives that animate them. There is a significant distinction between the two remedies. Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Law provides for a potential award of statutory attorney\u2019s fees. Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-310(d)(2) of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article (award of attorney\u2019s fees available after proceedings before OAH); Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-311 of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article (award of attorney\u2019s fees available after proceedings for judicial review). The State employee grievance procedure, however, does not provide for statutory attorney\u2019s fees. Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 thru 12-205 of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article. The availability of an award of statutory attorney\u2019s fees (\u201cfee-shifting\u201d) is a deviation from the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that attorney\u2019s fees are to be borne by the party that incurs them, irrespective of the outcome of the case. <em>See Caffrey v. Dep\u2019t of Liquor Control, </em>370 Md. 272, 292, 805 A.2d 268, 280 (2002) (pursuant to the American Rule, as a matter of substantive law, damages do not include counsel fees); <em>Megonnell v.

The lack of any provision for an award of attorney fees to a prevailing employee under the State personnel grievance procedures is some evidence of a lack of a public interest prerequisite in that statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">It is not the case, as argued by Petitioner in her brief here, that the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cno personnel grievance could qualify for protection under the Maryland Whistleblower Law,\u201d or that the intermediate appellate court \u201cadopted a sweeping new standard by which it would exclude grievances from whistleblower protection.\u201d Rather, the court held, on the facts of this case, that Montgomery\u2019s personnel grievance \u201cdid not allege mismanagement of the warden\u2019s office \u2014 gross or otherwise,\u201d or \u201creveal facts that show he [either Acting Warden Kaloroumakis or Warden Kupec] was guilty of an abuse of authority.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Montgomery contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that her \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>disclose facts revealing that Acting Warden Kaloroumakis, pursuant to \u00a7 5-305(1) of the Maryland Whistleblower Law, was guilty of both \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d and \u201can abuse of authority.\u201d Montgomery augments the argument she made in the intermediate appellate and circuit courts by now also claiming that \u201cit is clear she has asserted a \u201cviolation of law\u201d ...

Examples of abuse of authority provided in <em>D\u2019Elia, </em>above, included misuse of government equipment or knowing approval of falsified time sheets. <em>See D\u2019Elia, </em>60 M.S.P.R. at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Measured against the definition of \u201cabuse of authority\u201d from <em>McCollum, </em>Montgomery\u2019s disclosures in her personnel grievance concerning Kaloroumakis\u2019s behavior, if true, do not reveal facts that support an abuse of authority conclusion. When Kaloroumakis allegedly spoke and acted discourteously, he was not \u201cexercising power\u201d in the sense meant by the Maryland (or federal) Whistleblower statutes. Montgomery\u2019s complaint, at best, can be characterized as allegations that the Acting Warden was guilty of harassment of Montgomery. Protection against harassment by supervisors (and against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>retaliation for making disclosures of harassment) is provided for in Maryland Code \u00a7\u00a7 12-101, <em>et seq </em>of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. In addition, revelations of rude behavior and the like were not the type of disclosure that the Whistleblower Law was intended to remedy, as evidenced by the language used in the Whistleblower Law\u2019s preamble evincing that the Maryland Act\u2019s purpose was to protect employees who disclose \u201cillegality or impropriety.\u201d The types of illegality and impropriety that the Whistleblower Law was designed to protect against were of the public sort, <em>see n. 7, above, </em>not the type of individual or idiosyncratic harassment disclosed in Montgomery\u2019s grievance. Like the federal WPA, the Maryland Whistleblower Law was \u201cintended to root out real wrongdoing\u201d and not the relatively minor misconduct of persons who happen to be cloaked with management authority. <em>See Herman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Concerning the \u201cviolation of law\u201d disclosure protected by the federal WPA, the MSPB requires that an employee have a reasonable belief that he or she is disclosing such a violation. <em>Ramos v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>72 M.S.P.R. 235 (1996); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(A) (2003). \u201cThe test for whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that his disclosure evidenced a violation is an objective one, and he must prove that a reasonable person in his position would believe the disclosure evidences a violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In the present case, Montgomery\u2019s allegations essentially evidence a conflict between two parties: Kaloroumakis and herself. The allegations of wrongdoing set forth in the grievance and \u201cWhistleblower\u201d complaint are fundamentally a government employee complaining about, or grieving, how she was treated by her supervisor and how he may have violated the Code of Fair Employment Practices in relation to her. Montgomery\u2019s concern about Kaloroumakis\u2019 behavior apparently was not moved by a concern for the public well being, but understandably for herself and her career. Any alleged \u201cviolation of law\u201d in this context is not whistleblowing. <em>See Ford, </em>149 Md.App. at 502, 817 A.2d at 272 (an employee\u2019s grievance about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>supervisor\u2019s behavior towards that employee is not a protected disclosure). Were it otherwise, almost any personnel grievance might qualify as an \u201cabuse of authority\u201d or a \u201cviolation of law\u201d under the Whistleblower Law. To read the Whistleblower Law as including all activities encompassed by Maryland Code \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 thru 12-205 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article would render Maryland\u2019s grievance procedures largely irrelevant, if not totally superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Petitioner argues that \u201c[o]ther states have afforded grievances Whistle Blower Protection under their statutory schemes.\u201d Petitioner cites only one state case for this broad assertion and we have found no other cases that afford Whistleblower protection to cases filed as personnel grievances by employees against their supervisors. Petitioner cites <em>Appeal of Leonard, </em>147 N.H. 590, 809 A.2d 762 (2002), but offers no elaboration of why the <em>Leonard </em>case is relevant and makes no attempt to apply <em>Leonard </em>to the facts before us. It is not at all clear to us that the <em>Leonard </em>case is on point or offers any pertinent guidance in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The <em>Leonard </em>court construed the New Hampshire whistle-blower statute, a statute applicable to all employers in the State, public and private. The New Hampshire statute does not appear to have been patterned after its federal counterpart. Section two of the New Hampshire Whistleblower Protection Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">I. No employer shall discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against any employee regarding such employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">(a) The employee, in good faith, reports or causes to be reported, verbally or in writing, what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of any law or rule adopted under the laws of this state, political subdivision of this state, or the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>(b) The employee, in good faith, participates, verbally or in writing, in an investigation, hearing, or inquiry conducted by any governmental entity, including a court action, which concerns allegations that the employer has violated any law or rule adopted under the laws of this state, a political subdivision of this state, or the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">II. Paragraph I of this section shall not apply to any employee unless the employee first brought the alleged violation to the attention of a person having supervisory authority with the employer, and then allowed the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct that violation, unless the employee had specific reason to believe that reporting such a violation to his employer would not result in promptly remedying the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">RSA 275-E:2 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">In the <em>Leonard </em>case, Barry Leonard, a fuel oil delivery truck driver, refused to work on Sunday and complained to the president of the oil company. 809 A.2d at 764. The oil company told Leonard that if he refused to work Sunday he should return the truck and he would be fired. In response, Leonard dropped off his truck and never returned to work. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Leonard </em>court concluded that Leonard had \u201cblown the whistle\u201d by reporting to the oil company\u2019s president the company\u2019s alleged violation of the New Hampshire \u201cday of rest\u201d statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 809 A.2d at 767. In effect, the court concluded the employee \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on an irresponsible and hazardous requirement of his employer by reporting that commercial truck drivers were being forced to drive seven days a week while too tired, in violation of a New Hampshire employment statute mandating a day of rest. 809 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>764-67. Although in <em>Leonard </em>there is a public interest in addressing the dangers attributable to driver drowsiness or fatigue, there is no such public interest in Montgomery\u2019s case which involves an employee complaining about the allegedly discriminatory behavior towards her by her supervisor. In addition, we are not persuaded that the New Hampshire Whistleblower Act, the purpose of which is to \u201cpromote the informal resolution of such reports within the workplace\u201d and is applicable to every employer in New Hampshire, is any way analogous to Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Act for state employees. 809 A.2d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Montgomery penultimately argues also that she should be able to avail herself of the Whistleblower statute because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">[t]he efficacy of the grievance procedure in redressing wrongs whose infliction was prompted by the filing of another grievance is dubious: the three steps of the grievance procedure are entirely intra-agency, where there is a substantial risk that the supervisors who retaliated against the original grievance would simply do it again; although the grievant may then appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings, (see SPPA \u00a7 12-205), that appeal only follows a decision by the Secretary of the grievant\u2019s agency. While administrative law judges do on occasion reverse the decisions of cabinet-level officials, the usual inclination is simply to extend deference to the decision of the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Montgomery provides no factual, statistical, or legal basis for this argument. Montgomery\u2019s argument ignores the fact that the State employee grievance procedures are the procedures specified by the General Assembly as a state employee\u2019s exclusive remedy under the circumstances of this case. Md. Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-103(b) of the State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article. Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s unsubstantiated skepticism as to \u201cthe usual inclination\u201d of the OAH\u2019s ALJ\u2019s fails to acknowledge the oversight of independent judicial review available for the final decision of an ALJ (or the agency). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Gov\u2019t Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Finally, Montgomery argues that she had a right to an election of remedies to proceed either under the Whistleblower Law, \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq., </em>or to file an employee grievance procedure under \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While it is true that a whistleblower who complains of reprisal for a protected disclosure can elect to proceed either under the Whistleblower Law or the State employee grievance procedures, a State employee complaining of harassment by a supervisor has no such election of remedies available. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-103(b) of the State Pers. &amp; Pens Article (providing that State employee grievance procedures are the exclusive remedy for a claim of reprisal for filing a grievance). Montgomery filed a grievance complaining of alleged discriminatory behavior and harassment by her supervisor that affected her and was a grievance within the ambit of the \u201cGrievance Procedures in the State Personnel Management System.\u201d Md.Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Pers. &amp; Pens Article.

In a separate action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Montgomery claimed that her transfer constituted retaliation under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\u201d) for taking an extended leave. This claim was twice rejected by the District Court and, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the dismissal of the suit was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit held that the position to which, she had been transferred was an \"equivalent position,\u201d virtually identical to her former position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites and status. <em>Montgomery v.

Thus it is not clear that Montgomery could prove that she suffered a reprisal for filing the grievance against Kaloroumakis.
