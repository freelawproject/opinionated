The District Court ordered a competency evaluation of Petitioner, which evaluation was conducted at Crownsville Hospital Center from 14 September 2001 until 19 November 2001. The written report prepared by the Hospital staff regarding Gregg\u2019s mental health status was submitted to the District Court. It concluded that Gregg had \u201cDelusion Disorder, Persecutory Type\u201d and \u201cSchizoid, Avoidant and Dependant Personality Disorder.\u201d Although acknowledging that Gregg was able \u201cto understand the roles of courtroom personnel and courtroom procedures\u201d and that he had been able to \u201cdiscuss his charges, possible pleas and possible penalties with his evaluators,\u201d the report nonetheless ultimately opined that Gregg was not competent to stand trial because he was \u201cnot able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him and to assist in [his] own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Gregg appeared in the District Court for a competency hearing on 19 November 2001. The hearing judge questioned Gregg as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">COURT: Okay. And what are you charged with; do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">GREGG: Second-degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">COURT: All right. And why are you charged with that? What do they say you did. You don\u2019t have to admit to anything, but what do they say you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">GREGG: They claim I swung an object at a 10-year old girl on a bicycle and raised a welt on her, and that there were witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">COURT: All right. And do you understand what could happen, if you were found guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">GREGG: Up to ten years, but I don\u2019t know the exact sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">COURT: And where were you living prior to being arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">GREGG: 177 Sillery Bay Road, Pasadena, Maryland. COURT: Do you live by yourself or did have friends\u2014 GREGG: By myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">COURT: Okay. And do you have a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">GREGG: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-15\">COURT: Were you receiving some kind of assistance? GREGG: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-16\">COURT: How were you surviving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">GREGG: Interest on savings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-18\">COURT: Are you supposed to be taking any kind of medication on a regular basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-19\">GREGG: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-20\">COURT: Do you have any idea what day of the year it is or what month it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-21\">GREGG: It\u2019s Monday, November 19th, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-22\">COURT: Do you know what the purpose of a lawyer is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOH\">GREGG: Of a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">GREGG: Well, a defense lawyer helps me speak and advises me, and the prosecutor presents the State\u2019s case against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">COURT: Are there times when you feel that you don\u2019t have a good grasp on what\u2019s going on around you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">GREGG: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Dr. Mohammed Ajanah, Director of Forensic Psychiatry at Crownsville Hospital Center and one of Gregg\u2019s evaluators, then testified regarding the conclusions of the competency report. Dr. Ajanah initially reasserted that Gregg was not competent to stand trial because the doctor believed the defendant did not have a \u201crational understanding\u201d of the charges against him. Dr. Ajanah related to the court that Gregg had told his evaluators at Crownsville that he believed the charges against him were fabricated and that they resulted from a conspiracy between the judicial system and his neighbors. Dr. Ajanah further described Gregg\u2019s conspiracy theory, relating that Gregg believed the judicial system was \u201cout to get him\u201d and was responsible for instigating the neighborhood children into harassing him. When asked whether it was his belief that Gregg would be able to assist with his defense, Dr. Ajanah testified that he did not believe so, but temporized that opinion by stating \u201cI have to qualify that, because competency is a day-to-day issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The judge then questioned Dr. Ajanah about his impressions regarding Gregg\u2019s testimony that day before the court while Dr. Ajanah was present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">COURT: Now, I\u2019ve obviously had a very brief interaction with Mr. Gregg here this morning and observed. Do you think what I saw here today and what I heard here today is typical of the mental process or not typical?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">DR. AJANAH: It\u2019s not typical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">COURT: How do you explain what I saw and heard today with the observations that you made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">DR. AJANAH: I think what we saw today \u2014 again, he has the ability to define what the various courtroom personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>do. Our concern is the framework he based his judgments on, for example, about the charges. And he has told us if he, you know, were in the same situation that he was in, he was going to do the same thing. He still firmly believes that the children in his neighborhood have been set up, essentially, to harass him by the system, by the government, by the judicial system. And we believe that if Mr. Gregg were back in his neighborhood, he\u2019s going to incur the same type of charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">COURT: So it\u2019s my understanding that your concern is about what he might do under certain similar circumstances outside of the facility. In other words, you\u2019re concerned that he\u2019s not stable on a long-term basis and that he might violate again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">DR. AJANAH: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">COURT: Although, for the moment, it appears that he is, at least stable, to assist the defense and able to understand the nature of the ongoing proceedings; is that \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I have put words in your mouth\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">DR. AJANAH: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">COURT: \u2014 but I don\u2019t want you to (unintelligible) if you disagree with me. Am I understanding correctly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">DR. AJANAH: Yeah. For the moment, because of the structure, I think, yeah, he could \u2014 you know, he could go to the competency hearing and be competent today. But I don\u2019t believe that, you know, he\u2019s not a danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">COURT: Okay. He could be competent and still dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">DR. AJANAH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">COURT: That\u2019s one of the parameters that exist, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-14\">DR. AJANAH: Yeah. Usually, in competencies, you address dangerousness when you find somebody to be not competent, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-15\">COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-16\">DR. AJANAH: And most of the time, when you are competent, you assume they are not dangerous. You\u2019re not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>required to address dangerousness, if somebody is competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">COURT: Although somebody who is perfectly competent can still be dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">DR. AJANAH: Yeah, sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Based on the court\u2019s assessment of Gregg\u2019s behavior before the court, the Crownsville report, and Dr. Ajanah\u2019s testimony, the District Court judge concluded that Gregg was competent to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">I think, as Dr. Ajanah stated, competency is a day-to-day question, and I can\u2019t say what it was like a month ago, but I, certainly, don\u2019t have any feeling today that Mr. Gregg is not competent. He may be suffering from a variety of mental illnesses, and it may cause a problem in the future, and it may have caused a problem in the past, but the function I have here today is very limited; it\u2019s to determine whether he can stand trial or not. And I believe, at least, that at this point in time, he can stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">Now, what happens as a result of that trial, what happens if he\u2019s found guilty or he\u2019s found not guilty is a separate question that has to be resolved another time. It may be that, for any number of reasons that are not necessarily within the confines of my hearing today, that he needs some assistance and he needs some hospitalization, but I\u2019m not sure that the competency question is (unintelligible) so I do find the Defendant is competent at the moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">And I\u2019d like to know, at this point, \u2014 well, he was held on this CR-51<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (unintelligible) now, I can say this; that he has been evaluated, and so the purpose of the CR 51 has been satisfied, and at this moment, I do believe the Defendant is competent. If there is a reason to feel that he needs to be hospitalized further, then there are other processes that are available, and I\u2019m not making any decisions on those pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>cesses; that I believe at this time, with respect to the criminal case and with respect to the competency case, that the Defendant is competent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Gregg subsequently prayed a jury trial and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. No transcript of the competency hearing in the District Court accompanied the case when transferred to the Circuit Court. Although the CR 51 order was included in the District Court documents forwarded to the Circuit Court, the Crownsville competency report was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Circuit Court conducted a hearing on 5 December 2001 with respect to Gregg\u2019s proposed waiver of his right to counsel. Gregg explained to the court that he wanted to waive his right to counsel because he did not want to pay for an attorney. Further, Gregg did not want to risk having to pay for the services of the Public Defender\u2019s Office in the event that he was determined later not to qualify for free representation by that office. Gregg stated that he perceived the case to be \u201cstraightforward\u201d and that he wanted to handle it himself. The court advised Gregg of his right to counsel, referred him to the Public Defender\u2019s Office nonetheless, and set the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">On 10 January 2002, the court accepted Gregg\u2019s waiver of counsel as knowing and voluntary. He was convicted by a jury of second-degree assault. The court imposed a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment and suspended all but six months in favor of five years\u2019 probation. Additional facts from the appellate record will be supplied later as relevant to our analysis of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">The Court of Special Appeals considered in Gregg\u2019s appeal, where he was represented by the State Public Defender\u2019s Office (as he is in this Court), the following issues<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>whether the circuit court erred in failing to inquire into his competency to stand trial; (2) whether the circuit court erred in failing to inquire into his competency to waive counsel; and (3) whether the circuit court followed the procedures set forth in Maryland Rule 4-215 regarding Gregg\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Gregg argued that his \u201cbizarre\u201d behavior at trial, combined with his \u201chistory\u201d of mental illness, should have triggered the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to conduct a hearing on his competency to stand trial. He also asserted that the trial court had a further <em>sua sponte </em>duty, under the circumstances, to inquire more extensively into his competency to waive counsel. In addition, Gregg claimed that Maryland Rule 4-215<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires that the record show full compliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Rule every time a defendant requests to discharge defense counsel or elects to proceed without counsel. Gregg noted that the advisements were given to him piecemeal, in direct contradiction to Rule 4-215 and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>355 Md. 420, 735 A.2d 1003 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The intermediate appellate court, relying on <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727, 730 (1993), held that, although Gregg had engaged in certain \u201cstrange\u201d behavior, the record supported the conclusion that he (1) understood the proceedings to which he was a party and (2) was able to assert \u201chis rights as they arose throughout the proceedings.\u201d The court further concluded that Gregg was competent to, and did, affect a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. In reply to Gregg\u2019s third contention, that he was not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>advised of his right to counsel, the intermediate appellate court rejected Gregg\u2019s challenge because the circuit court judge, under the circumstances, cumulatively gave him each and every on-the-record advisement required by Rule 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We granted Gregg\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Gregg v. State, </em>372 Md. 684, 814 A.2d 570 (2003), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s competence to- stand trial is determinative of the issue of competence to waive counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Whether the Circuit Court had a duty to make an inquiry into Gregg\u2019s competence to stand trial and to waive counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that piecemeal compliance by two different judges of the Circuit Court over the course of two separate hearings satisfied the dictates of Rule 4-215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Gregg begins with this Court by making the point that competence to stand trial is the \u201cfoundational right for the effective exercise of a defendant\u2019s other rights in a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 457, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2574, 120 L.Ed.2d 353, 371 (1992). The Fourteenth Amendment to our federal Constitution \u201cprohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial,\u201d <em>Roberts v. State, </em>361 Md. 346, 359, 761 A.2d 885, 892 (2000), and the Legislature has placed the duty to determine competence to stand trial on the trial court. <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 357, 363-67, 761 A.2d at 894. Maryland Code (2001), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 3-104 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If, before or during trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on the evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(b) <em>Court action if defendant found competent. </em>\u2014 If, after receiving evidence, the court finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the trial shall begin as soon as practicable or, if already begun, shall continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">(c) <em>Reconsideration. </em>\u2014 At any time during the trial and before verdict, the court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Section 3 \u2014 101(f) defines \u201cincompetent to stand trial\u201d to mean \u201cnot able (1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Gregg argues that the Maryland test tracks the federal standard of competency, that being \u201cwhether [the accused] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 298, 372 A.2d 1069, 1073 (1977) (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam)). He asserts that Maryland prescribes two prerequisites to a finding of competency: \u201cthe accused must have \u2018a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him, [and] must at the trial have \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u2019\u201d <em>Raithel, </em>280 Md. at 299-300, 372 A.2d at 1073-74 (quoting <em>Dusky, </em>362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. at 789, 4 L.Ed.2d at 825). Gregg enumerates that the trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused may be triggered in any of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>inquiry by the court triggered by the court\u2019s concern as to the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. <em>Thanos, </em>330 Md. at 85, 622 A.2d at 730. Once the duty is triggered by any of these means, \u00a7 3-104(a) mandates that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>determine whether the defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d Competency thereafter is to be determined according to the proof quantum of beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 366, 761 A.2d at 896; <em>Raithel, </em>280 Md. at 297, 372 A.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Gregg insists that the Circuit Court should have conducted an inquiry into his competency based on his mental health history, the Crownsville report generated for the District Court proceeding, and his behavior at trial in the Circuit Court. For legal support, he directs our attention to passages from at least two United States Supreme Court cases, <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), and <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant had not waived the issue of competency by failing to request a competency hearing and stated that \u201c[w]here the evidence raises a \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 as to a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, the judge on his own motion must impanel a jury and conduct a sanity hearing pursuant to [the Illinois statute].\u201d <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. at 385-86, 86 S.Ct. at 842, 15 L.Ed.2d at 822. The Supreme Court wrote that although the defendant displayed a degree of \u201cmental awareness\u201d in his \u201ccolloquies with the trial judge,\u201d \u201cthis reasoning offers no justification for ignoring the uncontradicted testimony of Robinson\u2019s history of pronounced irrational behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \u201c[w]hile Robinson\u2019s demeanor at trial might be relevant to the ultimate decision as to his sanity, it cannot be relied upon to dispense with a hearing on that very issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>the Supreme Court revisited its reasoning in <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>explaining that \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some circumstances, be sufficient.\u201d <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 908, 43 L.Ed.2d at 118. Petitioner interprets these decisions to mean that a trial judge\u2019s obligation to inquire into the lack of competency may be triggered by either the defendant\u2019s mental health history or his conduct in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Gregg extends his criticism to the District Court for not acknowledging the State\u2019s burden of proof to establish compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>tency beyond a reasonable doubt and concomitantly criticizes the Circuit Court for relying on the District Court finding of his competency without conducting a new competency hearing. Petitioner contends that his behavior at trial should have engaged the trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to examine Gregg\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">For example, Gregg characterizes as \u201cbizarre\u201d his dialogue with the trial judge about why he could not stand for long while addressing the court. He suggests that this dialogue should have been viewed as an indication to the trial judge of Gregg\u2019s possible incompetence to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">COURT: Okay, wait one second. Yes, sir, you may stand sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">GREGG: Standing is a problem for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">COURT: Are you able to stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">GREGG: Not for long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">COURT: Well, let\u2019s do the best you can, let\u2019s see if you can stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">GREGG: I stood when you \u2014 okay, I\u2019ll stand for a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGk\">COURT: Yeah, see if you can\u2019t stand. Are you John Leon Gregg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">GREGG: Yes, sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">COURT: Okay, you can stand anymore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-14\">GREGG: I can, but then I won\u2019t be able to stand later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxP\">COURT: Well, I would like you to stand now, let\u2019s see if you can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">GREGG: Can we get the handcuffs in front?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-16\">COURT: I tell you what, you can take them off of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJK\">GREGG: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-17\">COURT: You just stand and then we\u2019re going to talk turkey here. (Pause). What \u2014 does it hurt you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-18\">GREGG: The handcuffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-19\">COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-20\">GREGG: The last time I was here it got to be too long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>COURT: Was it too long? All right, sir, you want to-you want to stand now? Can you stand up now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">GREGG: Not for long, I need\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">COURT: Well, do the best you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">GREGG: But then I won\u2019t be able to stand to leave your court, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">COURT: That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll let you stand when you want to leave.

Petitioner argues that, given his <em>pro se </em>status, when the prosecutor mentioned the earlier competency hearing in the District Court, the trial judge, at a bare minimum, should have secured a copy of and reviewed the Crownsville report and conducted a new inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Petitioner\u2019s next bundle of arguments center around his contention that he was not competent to waive his right to counsel and that the trial judge erred by not so finding. Gregg argues that the standard by which a court is to assess competency to stand trial and competency to waive counsel are not necessarily the same in every case or even at different times in the same case. <em>See Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 129 n. 5, 406 A.2d 98, 102 n. 5 (1976); <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 267 n. 3, 347 A.2d 219, 225 n. 3 (1975). Petitioner advocates that we should adopt a higher standard for assessing competency to waive counsel than that required by the federal Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause. Gregg desires a standard that includes consideration of both decisional and functional elements relating both to a defendant\u2019s capacity to waive counsel and to represent himself \u2014 the inquiry should be broadened to include assessment of whether a defendant has the mental capacity to proceed in making his defense without a lawyer. <em>See </em>J.W. Corinis, <em>A Reasoned Standard for Competency to Waive Counsel After </em>Godinez v. Moran, 80 Boston U.L.Rev. 265 (2000). At oral argument before this Court, Petitioner conceded that such a review would not be appropriate for <em>all </em>defendants seeking to waive counsel, but only for those defendants whose competency to stand trial was already at issue. In this matter, Petitioner argues that because his competence to stand trial was at issue in the District Court and because it <em>should </em>have been an issue in the circuit court, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>higher standard needed to be satisfied before the circuit court concluded he had waived counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Petitioner lastly complains that neither the District Court nor the Circuit Court complied with the requirements of Rule 4-215 and the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that piecemeal compliance in the course of the two circuit court hearings satisfied the full dictates of the rule. Even if the intermediate appellate court correctly found that piecemeal compliance satisfies Rule 4-215, Gregg asserts that the combined advisements sanctioned by the Court of Special Appeals were deficient nonetheless. Petitioner contends that at no time during the course of either the District Court proceedings or Circuit Court hearings was he advised as required by section (a)(5), that if he appeared for trial without counsel he could be deemed to have waived counsel. Gregg also disputes the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s view of <em>Johnson v. State, </em>355 Md. at 461, 735 A.2d at 1025, which forbade piecemeal compliance by the concerted actions of district and circuit courts in a case. Petitioner reads <em>Johnson </em>as mandating that \u201cthe subsection (a) advisements [] be given in strict accordance with Md. Rule 4-215, by the correct court and not piecemeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner concludes that, in violation of the dictates of Rule 4-215, the advisements were never given by any one judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Respondent retorts that there was no basis for the Circuit Court to reconsider Gregg\u2019s competency and therefore the Court of Special Appeals properly determined that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by not conducting a new, <em>sua sponte </em>competency hearing. The State asserts that where a defendant is adjudged competent after a thorough pre-trial hearing, even if in a different tier of the court system than in the one he or she is tried ultimately, the decision to reconsider competency lies within the sound discretion of the ultimate trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The State contends that the proceedings in the present case comported with the standards outlined by \u00a7 3-104 and explained further by this Court in <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Roberts, </em>we explained the predecessor to \u00a7 3-104<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">The language of [the predecessor statute] mandates actions to be undertaken by a trial court, if an accused\u2019s competency is properly called into question. These actions can be broken down into three distinct simple steps: (1) First, a determination of competency may be made at any time before or during trial; (2) Second, such a determination must be made if the defendant in a criminal case appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial; and (3) Finally, the court must make its determination on the evidence presented in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">361 Md. at 364, 761 A.2d at 895. Respondent finds the requirements elucidated in <em>Roberts </em>to have been satisfied in the proceedings below. Gregg\u2019s competency determination was made by the District Court after a full hearing and he did not challenge the competency determination made by the District Court on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The State argues that the record indicates that the District Court concluded that Gregg was competent beyond a reasonable doubt because he understood the nature and the object of the proceedings against him and was capable of assisting in his defense. Respondent dismisses Gregg\u2019s assertion that \u201cit was entirely inappropriate for the circuit court to rely on a different court\u2019s competency determination made almost two months before trial,\u201d and states that the statute was satisfied because the District Court made a competency determination on the record as soon as Gregg\u2019s competency was called into question. The Circuit Court therefore had no reason to reconsider Gregg\u2019s competency because he did not request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>another determination and because he demonstrated that he was competent throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The State further proffers that had there been no prior competency determination in this case, it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court not to hold competency hearings <em>sua sponte. </em>Respondent analogizes the present matter to <em>Thanos v. State. </em>In that case, in support of his contention that the trial court had a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to inquire into his competency, Thanos cited various instances of strange behavior: (1) his \u201cunusual request to absent himself from the trial\u201d and his announcement that he would be disruptive during the proceedings; (2) his \u201cwhimsical\u201d decision to waive his right to a jury for trial and sentencing, and his decision to not absent himself from the proceedings; (3) \u201cseveral strange remarks he made to the trial judge\u201d; and, (4) \u201chis general history of mental illness, borderline personality disorder, and self-destructive tendencies.\u201d 330 Md. at 85, 622 A.2d at 731. We found that Thanos met the two-pronged test for competency to stand trial and observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">While Thanos did make some peculiar remarks to the trial judge, his words on the whole were very lucid. He appeared to grasp all of his rights as they arose throughout the proceedings. He explained very clearly why he preferred conditions in the Super Max facility in Baltimore to those of the St. Mary\u2019s County Detention Center. And he understood and insightfully articulated his tendency to become disruptive under stress, which reasonably justified his initial desire to absent himself from the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Id. </em>The State suggests that, like Thanos, Gregg displayed at worst \u201cmere eccentricities\u201d at the hearings and at trial, but, also like Thanos, those \u201ceccentricities did not prevent him from understanding the proceedings or presenting his own defense.\u201d Gregg exhibited a complete recollection of the relevant events and appropriately conducted himself before the court and the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Respondent also challenges Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>and <em>Pate v. Robinson. </em>In each of those cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>United States Supreme Court condemned the failure of the state trial courts to hold any competency hearings in light of significant evidence of the respective defendants\u2019 potential incompetence. In the present matter, a determination with regard to Gregg\u2019s competency was made after a relatively thorough pre-trial hearing in the District Court. There was no indication that his circumstances had changed since that competency determination had been made. For these reasons, the State concludes, the Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that the Circuit Court did not err in not conducting further <em>sua sponte </em>competency hearings and by perhaps implicitly relying on the competency determination made by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The State continues its riposte by asserting that the argument that a defendant\u2019s competency to waive counsel should be judged by a higher standard than a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial was not preserved for review as it was not raised in the trial court or in the Court of Special Appeals. In the alternative, Respondent asks us to find that Gregg\u2019s contention also fails on the merits. The waiver inquiry required by Rule 4-215 must demonstrate sufficiently that \u201cdefendant is competent to waive the right to counsel, and that he knowingly and intelligently has done so after being made aware of the advantages and disadvantages of self-representation.\u201d <em>Renshaw, </em>276 Md. at 267, 347 A.2d at 225. The State notes that the criminal defendant in <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), also argued that the competency standard for waiving counsel must be higher that the standard for standing trial \u201cbecause a defendant who represents himself \u2018must have greater powers of comprehension, judgment, and reason than would be necessary to stand trial with the aid of an attorney.\u2019 \u201d 509 U.S. at 399, 113 S.Ct. at 2686, 125 L.Ed.2d at 332. The Supreme Court was unpersuaded by this argument, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">But this argument has a flawed premise; the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <em>waive the right, </em>not the competence to represent himself. In <em>Faretta v. Califor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>nia[422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975)] we held that a defendant choosing self-representation must do so \u201ccompetently and intelligently,\u201d and we emphasized that although the defendant \u201cmay conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored.\u201d Thus, while \u201c[i]t is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts,\u201d a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to <em>choose </em>representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">509 U.S. at 399-400, 113 S.Ct. at 2686-87, 125 L.Ed.2d at 332-33 (internal citations omitted). The State claims that we adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in our decision in <em>Thanos </em>and' concludes that consideration and acceptance of Gregg\u2019s waiver of counsel was conducted pursuant to the standard outlined in <em>Godinez </em>and <em>Thanos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The State finally argues that the Court of Special Appeals properly held that Gregg was fully advised under Maryland Rule 4-215 before being permitted to waive his right to counsel. The trial court examined Gregg and made certain that his decision to waive counsel was knowing and voluntary. The court informed Gregg that he was charged with second degree assault and that the maximum penalty was ten years in prison. The court explained to Gregg that if he could not afford a lawyer, he would be provided with one and told him that a lawyer would be helpful in presenting his case to the jury. Gregg nonetheless insisted that he wanted to represent himself. Regarding Gregg\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in not advising him, pursuant to section (a)(5), that if he appeared for trial without counsel the court could determine that he waived counsel and he could go to trial unrepresented by counsel, Respondent contends that because Gregg was being tried the same day the waiver was accepted, section (a)(5) was not applicable. Furthermore, Gregg was given a copy of the charging document on 5 December 2001, in compliance with section (a)(1) of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">A competency hearing and determination must meet the due process requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Medina, </em>505 U.S. at 439, 112 S.Ct. at 2574, 120 L.Ed.2d at 359 (stating that \u201cit is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial\u201d); <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 171, 95 S.Ct. at 903, 43 L.Ed.2d at 113 (noting the long-standing belief that a person who lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him may not stand trial); <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. at 378, 86 S.Ct. at 838, 15 L.Ed.2d at 818 (concluding that \u201cthe conviction of an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process\u201d); <em>Trimble v.

The Court of Special Appeals has observed that \u201c[e]ven when a defendant is competent at the commencement of his trial, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 108, 369 A.2d 98, 104 (1977) (quoting <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 181-82, 95 S.Ct. at 908, 43 L.Ed.2d at 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">As iterated by the parties in their arguments, a criminal defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial may be made an issue when the defendant or defense counsel alleges that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial or when the defendant \u201cappears to the court\u201d potentially to be incompetent. \u00a7 3-104. A criminal defendant is presumed to be competent until it is alleged that he or she is incompetent to stand trial. Once an allegation of incompetence is made, however, the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial then must be determined based on evidence meeting the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 368, 761 A.2d at 897. Maryland Code (2001), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 3-101 defines \u201cincompetent to stand trial\u201d to mean \u201cnot able (1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d We stated in <em>Raithel v. State </em>that an accused must have \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him,\u201d and \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d 280 Md. at 300, 372 A.2d at 1074 (quoting <em>Dusky, </em>362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. at 789, 4 L.Ed.2d at 825).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In <em>Roberts v. State, </em>defense counsel filed with the circuit court a motion requesting a mental examination of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>dant, which motion was denied without a hearing. 361 Md. at 356, 761 A.2d at 890. This Court held that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing to provide an opportunity for the defendant to present evidence whether to refer her for a competency evaluation to be used in making a competency determination. 361 Md. at 356, 761 A.2d at 891. We reasoned that when competence is put in question a trial court is required to make a competency determination based on the evidence on the record, and although a formal hearing is not required in all circumstances, where the allegation of incompetency is unsupported by any evidence on the record to that time, the accused must be given an opportunity to present evidence upon which a determination may be made. <em>Id. </em>We observed in <em>Roberts </em>that the language of the statute \u201cindicates that the Legislature intended for every accused, whose competency was called into question, to have at least one guaranteed review of his or her competency status.\u201d 361 Md. at 365-66, 761 A.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Thus, it is clear that \u00a7 3-104 requires a competency determination to be made based on the evidence on the record when the competence of a criminal defendant is called into question by the defendant or defense counsel. What is less clear is what circumstances require a court to exercise <em>sua sponte </em>it\u2019s duty to evaluate a defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 347, 507 A.2d 1134 (1986), the Court of Special Appeals addressed whether the trial court erred by not conducting a <em>sua sponte </em>competency hearing when neither the accused nor his counsel raised the issue at trial. Johnson was determined by the court to be competent to stand trial before his first trial commenced. 67 Md.App. at 353, 507 A.2d at 1137. The first trial resulted in a mistrial after the defendant repeatedly interrupted the trial and was evaluated to be incompetent to stand trial. Johnson was allowed to enter a plea of guilty by reason of insanity. 67 Md.App. at 354, 507 A.2d at 1138. At no time before or during Johnson\u2019s second trial was the competency issue raised by the defendant or by defense counsel. 67 Md.App. at 359, 507 A.2d at 1140. The Court of Special Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>that the record indicated no basis requiring the judge in the second trial to conduct a <em>sua sponte </em>evidentiary hearing to determine Johnson\u2019s competency to stand trial. 67 Md.App. at 360, 507 A.2d at 1141. The intermediate appellate court noted that Johnson stated that he was not mentally ill; his counsel told the court he thought Johnson was competent to stand trial; he answered all of the judge\u2019s questions in a rational and coherent manner; he \u201cdisplayed a marked degree of sophistication about the law\u201d; and \u201cthere is every indication in the record that appellant met the standard of competency to stand trial.\u201d 67 Md.App. at 359-60, 507 A.2d at 1140-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We addressed a court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to consider a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial in <em>Thanos v. State. </em>At no point prior to or during his trial did Thanos or his counsel move the court to consider defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. On appeal, however, Thanos asserted that the trial court committed reversible error by not inquiring into his competency to stand trial. 330 Md. at 83, 622 A.2d at 730. He referred to several instances of his behavior at trial which he claimed should have suggested his incompetence to the court. <em>See supra </em>at 534. We concluded, however, that the trial court did not have a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to conduct a competency hearing on the facts of that case. 330 Md. at 86, 622 A.2d at 731. We reached our conclusion based on the facts that Thanos opposed the State\u2019s request at trial to evaluate his competency to stand trial<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; none of his defense attorneys subsequently alleged that he was incompetent despite their explicit assertion that \u201cDefendant now has counsel who can keep the Court appraised should a competency issue arise in the future\u201d; none of Thanos\u2019s four expert witnesses at sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tencing ever suggested that he was incompetent; and the record of the trial proceedings indicated that Thanos \u201cexhibited both \u2018present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and ... a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d 330 Md. at 86-87, 622 A.2d at 731-32 (quoting <em>Dusky, </em>362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. at 789, 4 L.Ed.2d at 825).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">We also considered the type of behavior that might trigger a trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to determine a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial in <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 759 A.2d 764 (2000). Similar to the facts of <em>Thanos, </em>Ware\u2019s competency was never raised by the defense before the trial court and, when questioned by the court, defense counsel explicitly stated that he was not suggesting that Ware was incompetent. 360 Md. at 705, 759 A.2d at 793. Ware contended on appeal, however, that his \u201celeventh hour\u201d decision electing a jury sentencing, despite counsel\u2019s advice to the contrary, should have triggered the court\u2019s obligation to conduct a competency examination. 360 Md. at 704, 759 A.2d at 792. We explained that the trial court did not err in failing to conduct, <em>sua sponte, </em>a competency evaluation because there was \u201cnothing in the record to indicate that Appellant lacked the present ability to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or factual understanding of the proceedings.\u201d 360 Md. at 705-06, 759 A.2d at 793. We found that the sudden shift in trial strategy was not a sufficient demonstration to trigger a competency evaluation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We first consider whether the circuit court was required to evaluate Gregg\u2019s competency <em>sua sponte. </em>We evaluate what was before the trial judge to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s failure to make further inquiry into Petitioner\u2019s competence to stand trial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Gregg criticizes the Circuit Court for relying on the District Court\u2019s determination that he was competent to stand trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and contends that, instead, the Circuit Court was required to conduct its own evaluation. The underpinnings of Gregg\u2019s argument are unsupported. First, it does not appear from the record that the Circuit Court simply relied on the District Court\u2019s finding of competency and, second, there is nothing in the record that reasonably may be interpreted as a clear indicium of potential incompetence sufficient to trigger the trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to evaluate defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">When a criminal defendant prior to trial in the District Court requests a jury trial, the District Court is divested of its jurisdiction and jurisdiction is then conferred on the circuit court. Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings, \u00a7 4-302(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On 4 December 2001, after making his prayer for jury trial, Gregg was served with a Notice to Appear in Circuit Court the following day, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-301(b)(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The District Court proceedings conducted to that point were not binding on the circuit court. When a case is removed to the circuit court, the proceeding begins anew and generally the rulings of the District Court on pre-trial matters are not preclusive or binding. Section 3-104 places a burden on the \u201ccourt\u201d to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>defendant is incompetent to stand trial. The \u201ccourt\u201d is defined as \u201ca court that has criminal jurisdiction.\u201d Maryland Code (2001), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 3-101(c). While it had jurisdiction in the present matter, the District Court considered and ruled on Gregg\u2019s competency as it appeared to that court. When the Circuit Court obtained jurisdiction over Gregg it was not bound by the prior determination of competency made by the District Court and the proceedings properly began anew without any competency determination on the Circuit Court record. <em>See Johnson, </em>355 Md. at 457, 735 A.2d at 1023 (noting that the circuit court has exclusive original jurisdiction). The mere facts that (1) there was a competency evaluation in the District Court resulting in a finding of competency, and (2) there may exist a report generated in the District Court proceeding assessing Gregg\u2019s competency are not alone sufficient indicia of incompetency to trigger the Circuit Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to make a new competence determination. The Circuit Court below never ruled on the issue of competency because that issue was not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In the Circuit Court, the only references to Gregg\u2019s competency to stand trial and to the District Court finding of competency are found in a brief dialogue between the prosecutor, Gregg, and the judge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">STATE: Your Honor, before we get started on this matter, and if I can call the case, the matter of State versus John Gregg, K-2001-2434, Kimberly DiPietro, on behalf of the State. There was a request back when this case was in District Court for a competency evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">What I have in my file is a letter dated September 8, 2001 which indicates that they attempted to examine him for competency and that letter dated September 8 requested a 30-day extension to enable Crownsville to complete their evaluation. I don\u2019t have any subsequent report and I don\u2019t know if the Court file has it either. Just in looking through this file, I thought this was the competency evaluation, but it appears it is not. It was just their letter requesting some additional time to complete it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>COURT: Well, there was a hearing before Judge Hackner November 19. Sir, was there a competency hearing in the District Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">GREGG: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">COURT: What did they find?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">GREGG: Competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">COURT: Found you competent? It says here, hearing on competency before Judge Hackner and, let me see, there was a trial hearing notice, all parties \u2014 hearing on competency on November 19.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> GREGG: Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">GREGG: I was in Crownsville for 66 days ending November 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">COURT: And what was the result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">GREGG: I don\u2019t know, but they had 66 days to evaluate me \u25a0with pretty good consideration from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">COURT: Then he got sent back, so let\u2019s see, after eviden-tiary hearing, Defendant is found competent, set for trial, and it is signed \u2014 I don\u2019t know who signed it, I guess it\u2019s Judge Hackner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-14\">STATE: Okay, thank you very much for clarifying that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">It is clear from the transcript that the judge, Gregg, and the prosecutor reviewed very fundamentally what had occurred in the District Court without putting the issue of Gregg\u2019s competency properly before the Circuit Court. They discussed that Gregg\u2019s competency had been called into question in the District Court; that he had been evaluated at Crownsville; and that the District Court judge had determined him to be competent on 19 November 2001 to stand trial in that court. That discussion alone did not put Gregg\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>competency to stand trial at issue in the <em>Circuit Court. </em>Because the impending trial in the Circuit Court was a proceeding separate and distinct from the proceedings in the District Court, the competency issue as it arose in the District Court was not also transferred automatically to the Circuit Court for additional or new pretrial proceedings. The defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial must be raised anew in the Circuit Court proceedings \u2014 by motion of the defendant or defense counsel, or by conduct by the defendant sufficient to trigger <em>sua sponte </em>consideration by the trial judge \u2014 in order to compel the need for a competency determination. Respondent incorrectly analyzes this as an issue of the trial judge\u2019s discretion to reconsider an initial competency determination. As the record contains no motion to evaluate Gregg\u2019s competency, the only way in which competency would be before the Circuit Court was if the defendant \u201cappear[ed] to the court to be incompetent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The passages indicated by Petitioner as examples of \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cerratic\u201d behavior in the pre-trial and trial proceedings in the circuit court fall short of crossing the threshold triggering the judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to evaluate Gregg\u2019s competency to stand trial. The Supreme Court aptly observed in <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>that \u201cthe question [whether the evidence at trial suggests that the defendant\u2019s competence is suspect] is often a difficult one in which a \"wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are implicated.\u201d 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 908, 43 L.Ed.2d at 119. The behavior indicated in this record is significantly less egregious than that found by us in other cases <em>not </em>to trigger the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The most apposite case is <em>Thanos v. State. </em>As discussed <em>supra, </em>Thanos argued on appeal to this Court that the trial court erred by not inquiring at trial into his competency to stand trial. As indicated <em>supra </em>at 534, Thanos proffered several examples of behavior at trial or indications of a troubled mental history that he suggested should have triggered the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to inquire into his possible incompetency. In addition to those examples, he noted he remarked to the trial judge \u201cin dog years ... I would be like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>200 and some years old,\u201d and asking whether his death sentence was \u201cdeath by gas, or death by roo-roo?\u201d 330 Md. at 85, 622 A.2d at 731. We found in that case that the defendant, despite his odd behavior, had both \u201cpresent ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,\u201d and \u201ca rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d 330 Md. at 87, 622 A.2d at 731. The behavior in that case was markedly more \u201codd\u201d than the pre-trial and trial behavior to which Gregg draws our attention in the circuit court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">There is nothing in the record of the circuit court proceedings in this case indicating that Gregg lacked the \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or factual understanding of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>360 Md. at 706, 759 A.2d at 793. On the contrary, Gregg\u2019s participation at trial was rational and coherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As observed <em>supra, </em>a criminal defendant initially is presumed to be competent to stand trial. <em>Ware, </em>360 Md. at 703, 759 A.2d at 792. That presumption may be rebutted if the defendant appears to the trial court to be incompetent, at which point the court has an obligation to determine the defendant\u2019s competency to begin trial, or if it has already commenced, to resume trial. <em>Id. </em>Gregg insists that the Circuit Court should have conducted an inquiry into his competency based on his mental health history, the Crownsville report, and his behavior at trial in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">There is but a single reference in the Circuit Court record to Petitioner\u2019s \u201chistory\u201d of mental health issues. During Gregg\u2019s 5 December 2001 appearance before the Circuit Court, the judge asked him whether he had spent time in a mental institution and Gregg responded that he had been at Crownsville for 66 days for competency evaluation and ten days at North Anne Arundel Hospital for evaluation. This is not so substantial a history of mental illness as to compel the court to inquire further into a defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Gregg\u2019s behavior at trial may be described as stubborn and argumentative at most. He responded appropriately to the judge\u2019s questions and his defense was in no way aberrant for a <em>pro se </em>defendant. He demonstrated both a rational understanding of the proceedings in which he was involved and of the relevant facts. Gregg\u2019s present reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>that although the defendant displayed a degree of \u201cmental awareness\u201d in his \u201ccolloquies with the trial judge,\u201d \u201cthis reasoning offers no justification for ignoring the uncontradicted testimony of Robinson\u2019s history of pronounced irrational behavior,\u201d 383 U.S. at 385-86, 86 S.Ct. at 842, 15 L.Ed.2d at 822, is misplaced because there is no body of evidence on the record in the Circuit Court of any history of incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">His behavior at sentencing may have been more suggestive of a potential problem than that at trial, but neither raised a doubt as to his ability to understand the object and nature of the proceedings or to assist in, or mount, his own defense. Furthermore, the mere mention that there was a report generated as a result of a competency evaluation in the District Court, against which the District Court concluded that Gregg nonetheless was competent to stand trial, does not call into question Gregg\u2019s competency to stand trial in the Circuit Court. Considered as a whole, there was no adequate basis in the record before the trial judge necessitating a <em>sua sponte </em>competency evaluation by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Because we find that Petitioner\u2019s competency was never at issue before the Circuit Court, his argument fails that there should be a heightened standard applied to the assessment of his competency to waive counsel \u2014 one which evaluates mental capability \u2014 when a defendant\u2019s general competency to stand trial is before the court. Maryland law requires that waiver of counsel be made knowingly and voluntarily, but does not require an assessment of how effectively Gregg was able to represent himself at trial. <em>Renshaw, </em>276 Md. at 267, 347 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Faretta </em>is applicable to this matter. Faretta was charged with grand theft and requested that he be permitted to represent himself in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. 422 U.S. at 807, 95 S.Ct. at 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d at 566. The trial judge, after vacillating back and forth on the subject and after conducting a <em>sua sponte </em>hearing to inquire into Faretta\u2019s ability to represent himself,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ruled that a criminal defendant did not have a constitutional right to conduct his own defense and appointed the public defender to represent Faretta. 422 U.S. at 808-09, 95 S.Ct. at 2528, 45 L.Ed.2d at 567-68. The Supreme Court reasoned that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> grants the accused not only the right.to be represented by counsel, but also the right to make his own defense <em>without </em>the assistance of counsel. 422 U.S. at 819, 95 S.Ct. at 2533, 45 L.Ed.2d at 572. The Court reiterated that an accused must \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waive counsel in order to represent himself, and stated that \u201ca defendant need not have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently to choose self-representation.\u201d 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581. The Supreme Court disagreed with the trial court\u2019s ruling that Faretta had not demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the law to represent himself and found that \u201chow well or poorly Faretta had mastered the intricacies of the hearsay rule and the California code provisions that govern challenges of potential jurors on <em>voir dire </em>\u201d was \u201cnot relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.\u201d 422 U.S. at 835-36, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Although the Supreme Court has found that the states are free to adopt a higher standard for assessing competency to waive counsel than required by the federal Due Process Clause, <em>Godinez, </em>509 U.S. 389, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, Maryland has not done so and Petitioner presents no compelling reason to increase the protections provided by Rule 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We conclude that the Circuit Court properly advised Petitioner of his right to counsel. The initial proceedings in the Circuit Court relating to Gregg\u2019s waiver of counsel occurred on 5 December 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">COURT: You have a constitutional right to have an attorney.

State. </em>He posits that <em>Johnson </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cadvice of rights from a District Court judge\u201d does not satisfy the advisements requirement of Rule 4-215, 355 Md. at 456, 735 A.2d at 1023, and that the only way we could conclude that he properly received his advice of rights is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>if we combine advisements from his District Court hearing and his circuit courts appearances. Because <em>Johnson </em>would not countenance such a patchwork of advisements, Gregg argues that he was not properly advised of his rights pursuant to Rule 4-215. There is no need to decide whether the combined District Court advisements and the circuit court advisements were sufficient to satisfy Rule 4-215 because the Circuit Court fully advised Petitioner of his rights under 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We observed in <em>Johnson </em>that the trial court must comply with Rule 4-215 in order for defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel to be effective, 355 Md. at 444, 735 A.2d at 1016. We further stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">Maryland Rule 4-215 exists as a safeguard to the constitutional right to counsel, providing a precise \u201cchecklist\u201d that a judge must complete before a defendant\u2019s waiver can be considered valid; as such, it mandates strict compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">355 Md. at 426, 735 A.2d at 1006. Compliance requires that the criminal defendant receive his or her advisements from a circuit court judge because the circuit court has exclusive original jurisdiction, or from the district court when a defendant appears there without counsel and demands a jury trial. 355 Md. at 457, 735 A.2d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The record indicates that the Circuit Court complied with all parts of Rule 4-215(a) except for part (5). Part (5) stipulates that <em>\u201c[i]f trial is to be conducted on a subsequent date, </em>advise the defendant that if the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added). Gregg was found effectively to have waived his right to counsel on the same day that he was tried, thereby eliminating the need for the part (5) advisement. Because Petitioner received from a circuit court judge each and every on-the-record advisement required by Rule 4-215, he effectively waived counsel and is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">\n<em>COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">BELL, C.J. and ELDRIDGE, J., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">.

To this point we, the majority and I, are not in disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Our disagreement concerns whether, on this record, the trial court should have, <em>sua sponte, </em>conducted an inquiry into the competence of John Leon Gregg, the petitioner, to stand trial. In other words, it is whether the record reflected a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>sufficient basis for a \u201cbona fide doubt,\u201d <em>Pate, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 385, 86 S.Ct. at 842, 15 L.Ed.2d at 822, as to that issue. In my opinion, there is plenty in the record to support an inquiry into the petitioner\u2019s competency, namely: his history of mental illness; the finding of incompetence by the staff at Crownsville Hospital Center (\u201cCrownsville\u201d), where the petitioner had been sent for just such an evaluation;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the petitioner\u2019s conduct during his two appearances in the Circuit Court; the information from the victim, her mother and community members detailing the petitioner\u2019s bizarre behavior and urging that the court order evaluation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The petitioner\u2019s history of mental illness consisted, at least, of an admission to North Arundel Hospital for ten days for evaluation two years before his appearance before the Circuit Court and a sixty-six day admission to Crownsville for a competency evaluation, of both of which the petitioner informed the court. As the Supreme Court in <em>Pate, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 385-86, 86 S.Ct. at 842, 15 L.Ed.2d at 822, pointed out, evidence of the mental alertness and understanding displayed by a defendant in \u201ccolloquies\u201d with the trial judge \u201coffers no justification for ignoring the uncontradieted testimony of [the defendant\u2019s] history of pronounced irrational behavior. While [the defendant\u2019s] demeanor at trial might be relevant to the ultimate decision as to his sanity, it cannot be relied upon to dispense with a hearing on that very issue.\u201d In fact, the Supreme Court has made clear \u201cthat evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some circumstances, be sufficient.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>supra, 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 908, 43 L.Ed.2d at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In any event, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court\u2019s inquiry on this issue was less than adequate, as the following colloquy on the subject demonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\u201cCOURT: ... Have you ever been a patient in a mental institution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201cCOURT: When[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Briefly at Crownsville for 66 days for competency. Two years ago, North Arundel Hospital for ten days evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">\u201cCOURT: At Crownsville, did the doctors determine your competency? Did they write a report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Yes. I was competent when I went in. \u201cCOURT: Did they make a report[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">\u201cCOURT: What did they recommend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">\u201c[The Defendant:] I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">\u201cCOURT: Oh, I see. And where are you detained now? In the Anne Arundel County Detention Center?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">Merely asking the right questions and getting an answer, particularly an incomplete one or one that is less than satisfactory, as occurred here on more than one occasion, is not enough. To be meaningful and to justify the conclusion the court draws from the answers given, that the petitioner was competent to stand trial, the inquiry must be seriously pursued and the information elicited, followed up and considered. That was not done here. Certainly, it is relevant what the Crownsville finding was and it should have been pursued more fully. It is also relevant what occurred and what was found by the staff at North Arundel Hospital, a matter that was not pursued at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">After their evaluation of the petitioner\u2019s competence to stand trial, the staff of Crownsville Hospital Center concluded that the petitioner was not so competent, although they also acknowledged that \u201ccompetency is a day-to day issue. So, you know, on a day-to-day basis that could change.\u201d The Crowns-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ville report stated that the petitioner suffered from Delusion-ary Disorder, Persecutory Type, Schizoid, Avoidant and Dependent Personality Disorder, as a result of which he \u201cdoes not have a rational understanding of his charges [and] appears to not have the capacity to relate to an attorney and to participate in the courtroom process with appropriate courtroom demeanor ... [he] is not able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense.... \u201d In addition, it recounted some of the bizarre behavior in which the petitioner engaged while at the Hospital: crawling about on his knees, rapidly pacing the hallway, shaving his beard kneeling on the floor, yelling and cursing when redirected, being isolative, guarded and secretive. The report also indicated that the petitioner was paranoid, believing that he was videotaped, his food poisoned by the government, which also harassed him, and his house was bugged.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The petitioner\u2019s conduct when appearing before the Circuit Court was by no means the model of rationality. On his first appearance in that court, he appeared to have difficulty understanding his entitlement to public defender representation, if indigent. Moreover, it is not at all clear that the petitioner was being responsive. Note the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201cCOURT: Do you want an attorney? Do you want to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">\u201c[The Defendant:] I\u2019m not going to pay the Public Defender, so I better just represent myself. My case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201cCOURT: You don\u2019t have to pay a Public Defender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201c[The Defendant:] My case is straightforward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">\u201cCOURT: Wait a minute. Who told you had to pay the Public Defender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-11\">\u201c[The Defendant:] The paperwork says if you can afford it, there could be charges. I will just represent myself. My case is straightforward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-12\">\u201cCOURT: ... If you want a lawyer and can\u2019t afford to hire one, the Public Defender will represent you at no cost to you. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201c[The Defendant:] Well it is not clear to me that [the] Public Defender \u2014 to be free. But I am going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cCOURT: Well I am telling you, it will be, if you qualify. [The Defendant:] I \u2014 . If I qualify, that is a big if. I spoke to the Public Defender \u2014 me and he gave me a couple brief ideas about how it could go. So, I am willing to go by myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">As already indicated, the petitioner displayed a poor knowledge of the status of the competency evaluation. In fact, his responses did not seem to be directed to the questions asked, or even to acknowledge that he considered them particularly relevant: in response to the two questions concerning the Crownsville report, the petitioner answered, \u201cyes,\u2019\u2019adding \u201cI was competent when I went in.\u201d And, as also already mentioned, although he acknowledged that a competency report was prepared, he professed not to know what the conclusion was, a point on which he was not pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Furthermore, the petitioner confirmed, explicitly, I would suggest, one of the observations the Crownsville report made, that the petitioner displayed paranoia, believing that his food was poisoned by the government. The court inquired whether the petitioner was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, medications or pills. When the petitioner responded, \u201c[n]ot to speak of,\u201d the court delved deeper, insisting on knowing what that meant. The petitioner stated: \u201cThere is a slight drugging of my food in jail, but it is not relevant.\u201d Strangely, there was no further follow-up by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">After the court advised the petitioner of the advantages of having counsel and determined to have him consult the Public Defender, the petitioner indicated that he had been refused bail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This prompted the following rather curious discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agt\">\u201cCOURT: Well, have you had a bail review hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201c[The Defendant:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cCOURT: When? In District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201c[The Defendant:] While I was in Crownsville. I wasn\u2019t granted bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cCOURT: Well, we are going to set this in for a bail review hearing. We will do that tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">\u201c[The Defendant:] I probably won\u2019t pay any bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">\u201cCOURT: I didn\u2019t hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">\u201c[The Defendant:] I am sure that I probably won\u2019t pay any bail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">\u201cCOURT: Well, look, if you want to be stubborn, that is all right. There is nothing wrong with that. It is your privilege to be stubborn. All I am saying is I want to give you a hearing where it will be determined whether or not you get bail. There is home detention. There are a lot of different ways in which a person can be released without putting up money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">On the date of trial, the prosecutor informed the court that the petitioner \u201cindicated to me ... that he intended on representing himself although he also indicated to me that he didn\u2019t know that today was his trial date. He said he hadn\u2019t been notified about that, but since he was here he was going to go ahead and get it over with and that he wanted to proceed by way of having a jury.\u201d This prompted the court to address the petitioner and the following rather extraordinary discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-13\">\u201cCOURT: Okay, wait one second. Yes, sir, you may stand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-14\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Standing is a problem for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-15\">\u201cCOURT: Are you able to stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-16\">\u201c[The Defendant:] Not for long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-17\">\u201cCOURT: Well, let\u2019s do the best you can, let\u2019s see if you can stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-18\">\u201c[The Defendant:] I stood when you \u2014 okay, I\u2019ll stand for a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201cCOURT: Yeah, see if you can\u2019t stand.

When he elected a jury trial, the court proceeded to inquire about his educational background and waiver of counsel. Once again, as to the latter, the petitioner seemed to misunderstand that if he qualified, he would not have to pay the Public Defender. Curiously, when asked whether he was aware of any mental condition that he had or physical disability which would prevent his understanding what he was doing, the petitioner replied \u201cJust the walking restriction is all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">Putting aside the petitioner\u2019s performance, or, more accurately, ineptitude, at trial, considerable information concerning the petitioner\u2019s bizarre behavior, over time, and more recently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>as exemplified by the very crime of which he stood accused, was presented to the trial judge. That evidence revealed a number of instances in which the petitioner displayed erratic and strange behavior, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the petitioner appearing naked at the community beach with a bag over his head, crawling through his house on his hands and knees, knocking other children, besides the victim, off their bicycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">It is true that the petitioner appeared before two different judges in the Circuit Court and, therefore, that neither observed all of the petitioner\u2019s aberrant behavior. The trial judge, for example, was the only one to be witness to, and in reality, was an essential part of the lengthy discussion of the petitioner\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to stand and the reasons therefor. Nevertheless, albeit the court missed, or ignored, its significance, there was a sufficient basis provided by the petitioner\u2019s behavior, at each appearance, which the court observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">During the first appearance, the court was told of the petitioner\u2019s mental history, especially that he had been referred for a competency evaluation. Although the petitioner, apparently as well as everyone else, did not know what the report said, that referral resulted in a report being prepared and, we now know, that report determined that the petitioner was not competent. So far as the record reflects, the court did not further inquire into the Crownsville report; it certainly did not read the report, the least that one could have expected. In addition to the difficulty the petitioner displayed in understanding, or accepting, the role of the Public Defender, the petitioner stated that his food was being drugged a little, and that was the only substance whose influence he was under at that time. As indicated, the court let that comment pass without any follow-up questions at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The trial court, too, was aware of the petitioner\u2019s mental health history. Although the knew that he had been referred to Crownsville for a competency evaluation, it appears that the trial court had no more idea of the contents of the report that evaluation generated than did the prior judge. The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>point was emphasized by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, who, before the commencement of trial, inquired of the court as to whether the evaluation was in the court file. Although the State\u2019s inquiry came subsequent to the \u201cability to stand\u201d debate, it certainly gave it a context and should have served to focus the court\u2019s attention to the fact that it was, to say the least, extraordinary conduct. The record does not reflect that the trial court reviewed a copy of the Crownsville report. What it does reflect is that the trial court was satisfied with the fact that a District Court judge had held a hearing and determined that the petitioner was competent. And that was true despite the petitioner\u2019s behavior, note the \u201cability to stand\u201d colloquy, on the day of trial. Moreover, while initially not informed of the petitioner\u2019s contention, made on his initial appearance in the Circuit Court, that the jail was drugging the petitioner\u2019s food, the trial court was apprised of that contention by the petitioner just prior to trial. Amazingly, when the petitioner advised the court that he had \u201creceived involuntarily some minor amount of drugs in [his] food, but it is not affecting [his] perception,\u201d the court\u2019s only response was \u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful, that\u2019s great, then we are ready to proceed then, aren\u2019t we?\u201d And proceed, they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The majority takes the view that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that reasonably may be interpreted as a clear indicia of potential incompetence sufficient to trigger the trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to evaluate.\u201d <em>Gregg v. State, </em>at 542. I do not agree. To be sure, as the majority submits, the \u201cfact that (1) there was a competency evaluation in the District Court resulting in a finding of competency, and (2) there may exist a report generated in the District Court proceeding assessing Gregg\u2019s competency are not alone sufficient indicia of incompetency to trigger a <em>sua sponte </em>duty.\u201d Id. at 543. I agree. When evaluating the trial court\u2019s duty, we should view the totality of the circumstances, rather than merely base our decision on narrow facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">As I have demonstrated, when properly viewed with other germane facts, justice demanded that the trial court order, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the petitioner be evaluated to determine his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>competence to stand; such a duty is imposed on the court as a matter of justice. <em>Inter alia, </em>there was the fact that the petitioner had a mental history, there was a transcript of a Constitutionally mandated competency hearing missing, the \u201cnon-sequitur\u201d dialogue with the court concerning the petitioner\u2019s ability to stand, the petitioner\u2019s statement about his food being drugged, the petitioner\u2019s difficulty understanding the role of the Public Defender and his cost and the fact that the petitioner was proceeding without counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These facts raise a reasonable uncertainty as to the competency of the petitioner to stand trial. Trial courts may not ignore common sense nor turn a blind eye to the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The duty of the trial court to monitor the competency of a defendant to stand trial is a continuing one. Neither Circuit Court judge was bound by the determination of the District Court judge and the trial judge was not bound by the tacit determination made by the court on the petitioner\u2019s first appearance in Circuit Court. Nor may the court rely on one factor relevant to, and affecting, competence to the exclusion of others. I submit that in this case, there are an abundance of factors, considering the totality of the circumstances, that required the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>action to determine the petitioner\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Judge ELDRIDGE has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">. Maryland Code (2001) \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\"(f) Incompetent to stand trial. \"Incompetent to stand trial\u201d means not able:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\"(1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAv\">\"(2) to assist in one's defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKa\">Unless otherwise noted, all references are to the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A8D\">. In <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727, 730, citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>67 Md.App. 347, 358-359, 507 A.2d 1134, 1140 (1986), this Court construed Maryland Code (1982, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Health General Article, the predecessor to \u00a7 3-104, as triggering the court\u2019s duty to make a competency determination in three ways: \"(1) upon an allegation by the accused himself that he is incompetent; (2) upon an allegation of the defense counsel that the accused is incompetent; or (3) upon the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>decision that the accused appears to be incompetent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">. It is significant that, although the petitioner acknowledged being in Crownsville for a competency evaluation and that a competency report was generated as a result, the prosecutor also directed the court\u2019s attention to the existence of the competency report, thus emphasizing it, after the luncheon recess following the court\u2019s acceptance of the petitioner\u2019s present competence and waiver of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">. It is relevant that the staff at Crownsville was concerned about the petitioner\u2019s dangerousness and that most likely explains the bail decision. The information from the petitioner\u2019s neighbors, presented to the court after trial, was consistent on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">. Proceeding without counsel does not mitigate the petitioner\u2019s being held to the standard of a competent attorney. Refusing representation is but one factor the trial court should consider when considering a criminal defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
