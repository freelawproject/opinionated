Respondent filed the condemnation on October 3, 2000, and paid into court $234,000.00, which was the higher of two appraisals it had obtained, thereby \u201ctaking\u201d the property on that date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 10-12, 2001, more than fourteen months after the \u201ctaking,\u201d a jury trial was held in the Circuit \u2022Court for Baltimore City to determine the fair market value of the property. The jury found the value of the property to be $140,000.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the verdict, petitioner filed a motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>new trial, which was denied. Petitioner then filed an appeal of the final judgment and the denial of the motion for a new trial with the Court of Special Appeals. On December 3, 2002, that court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Bem-Shaw P\u2019Shp v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>148 Md.App. 313, 811 A.2d 869 (2002). Petitioner then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, and, on April 9, 2003, we granted the petition. <em>Bem-Shaw v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>374 Md. 82, 821 A.2d 369 (2003). Petitioner presents four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201c1. Is a remote sale of the condemned property, unadjusted to reflect current value, generally admissible to prove the property\u2019s fair market value as defined in Real Property Article Section 12-105?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c2. Where property is acquired by the quick take process, authorized by Article III, Section 40A of the Maryland Constitution, (a) does Rule 5-403 authorize a court to order that the view of the property provided for by Rule 12-207 not take place where prejudicial conditions exist? (b) Should the court have ordered that the view not take place in this case? (c) Should a new trial have been granted where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>during the course of the view, rats frightened jury members, causing the view to be aborted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201c3. Does the elaboration of a report by an expert witness at trial authorize the testimony by a rebuttal expert witness whose existence and report were not disclosed during discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Should a new trial have been ordered because the only exhibits that depicted the property prior to the date of condemnation were missing from the courtroom at the time of the owner\u2019s testimony?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">We answer in the negative the first of petitioner\u2019s questions and hold that the trial court was in error for allowing into evidence the price paid by petitioner in 1982 for the property in question. Absent an adjustment of the 1982 purchase price to reflect the current value, and considering that twelve comparable sales were entered into evidence by the parties to prove the property\u2019s value at the time of the taking, we hold that the evidence regarding the 1982 purchase price was not relevant to show the fair market value of the property as it existed in October of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We also hold that the trial court was in error for allowing a jury view of the property, over petitioner\u2019s objection, and that, in a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding, a jury view of the property is not mandatory under Maryland Rule 12-207(c) where the view would be unfairly prejudicial to the former owner. Under the specific facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the jury view of the property fourteen months after petitioner relinquished control over the premises was unfairly prejudicial. Given our holdings with respect to petitioner\u2019s first two questions necessitating a new trial, it is unnecessary to address petitioner\u2019s third and fourth questions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Petitioner owned property at 324 West Baltimore Street consisting of a five-story (with 20-foot ceilings) mixed commercial and residential use building that was more than 100 years old and contained 25,000 square feet of space. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>October 3, 2000, respondent instituted a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation action for immediate possession and title of the property. At the time of respondent\u2019s \u201cquick-take\u201d acquisition, the property was occupied by a photography studio on the first floor, an apartment on the second floor, storage on the third floor, and a sewing machine company on the fourth floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Shortly after taking possession of the five-story building, respondent proceeded to evict the tenants and to turn off the electricity to the building. In the process of moving out, the tenants apparently ripped fixtures from the walls and left trash scattered over the floors. At this point, title, possession, and responsibility for the premises was in respondent. At the time of trial fourteen months later, the building was full of trash and infested with rats. This was the building\u2019s condition at the time of the jury view on December 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The jury view appears to have been the cause of some concern at trial. Petitioner objected to the jury being allowed to view the building\u2019s interior, as it was at the time of trial filled with trash, adequate lighting would not be available because of the lack of electricity, the building was then infested by rats, and the jury would not be able to see all five floors. At trial, petitioner argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201c[Petitioner]: And the problem is really two fold. One is, it\u2019s a big five story building. I don\u2019t think we can really expect the jury to climb \u2014 the elevators are not working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">[Petitioner]: To climb to the top. Part of the back of the building, because there\u2019s been a whole [sic] in the roof, the ceiling\u2019s coming down. I don\u2019t think you want a jury back there. So they really can\u2019t see the whole building. And the other problem is ... as often happens and I\u2019m sure the City didn\u2019t intend this. There were tenants on the first floor and when they moved out the City took the building and you look at the first floor now and you say well, this has been trashed. It looks terrible. There\u2019s trash thrown around. I went in the building the other day and saw a dead rat. You know, I just think it will be hard and very prejudicial for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>jury to be in there and see this. It wasn\u2019t, this is not the way \u2014 it\u2019s been over a year since they took the property so it\u2019s really not, you really can\u2019t see what it was like when they took it. And I, I\u2019m just very concerned about them going in because they can\u2019t see it and because it\u2019s been trashed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Respondent asked that the jury be allowed to see the interior of the building. Over objection by petitioner, the trial court ordered that the jury view the first two floors of the budding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The resulting jury view was somewhat unusual. Due to the fact that there was no electric lighting in the building, flashlights were distributed to each of the jury members to illuminate the darkened interior. Because of the assorted refuse left behind \u2022 by the evicted tenants, the jurors had to use caution in watching where they stepped. Also, upon reaching the second-floor landing, it appears that some of the jurors came upon the unwelcome sight of several rats and quickly fled down the stairs, unwilling to continue their tour of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At the trial itself, respondent called two expert appraisal witnesses. The first expert testified that the value of the property was $225,000.00 while the second testified that the value was $234,000.00. Petitioner also called two expert appraisal witnesses. Petitioner\u2019s first expert appraisal witness testified that the value was $500,000.00 and the second testified that the value was $513,000.00. To determine these valuations, all four of the expert appraisal witnesses used comparable sales approximately within five years of October 3, 2000, the day of the \u201cquick-take\u201d acquisition. Several of these comparisons were of buildings within the same block, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of the expert appraisal witnesses adjusted the sales prices to account for the lapse of time between the date of the comparable sale and the date of the take. In all, twelve comparable sales were introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">A representative of petitioner, Harry Shapiro, was also called to testify as to the value of the building in question. It was during the cross-examination of Mr. Shapiro by respondent that Shapiro was asked how much had been paid for the property when petitioner acquired it in 1982, 18 years prior to the condemnation. Petitioner objected on the grounds that an 18 year old sale was too remote in time to be of value to the jury, <em>ie., </em>was irrelevant. The trial court overruled the objection, and Shapiro testified that the building had been purchased in 1982 for $85,000.00.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The deed of conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>showing this remote purchase price was then moved into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The jury returned a verdict of $140,000.00. This verdict was considerably lower than any of the valuations given by either petitioner\u2019s or respondent\u2019s \u00e9xpert appraisal witnesses. The only evidence of any value less than the appraisals was the testimony that the purchase price of the 18-year-old sale had been $85,000.00. Petitioner moved for a new trial, but the motion was denied. Petitioner then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. As previously mentioned, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment as to both the jury verdict and the denial of a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">A. Evidence Regarding the 1982 Sale Price of the Property</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">It is the jury\u2019s task to determine the fair market value of a condemned property, including determinations of value in \u201cquick-take\u201d contested proceedings. In <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 12 \u2014 105(b), \u2018fair market value\u2019 is defined as \u2018the price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use of the property which a vendor, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a purchaser, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay, excluding any increment.\u2019 In rendering its inquisition, the jury may consider a number of elements that \u2018influence market value,\u2019 including, \u2018improvements on the land,\u2019 the \u2018sales of compara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ble lands,\u2019 \u2018evidence of reasonable probability of rezoning,\u2019 and \u2018 \u201cany special features which may enhance [the property\u2019s] marketability</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>J.L. Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 88-89, 792 A.2d at 298 (quoting <em>Dodson v. Anne Arundel County, </em>294 Md. 490, 495, 451 A.2d 317, 320 (1982) (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Because real property is unique, the most common method of establishing the value of the property that has been acquired by condemnation is through appraisals of fair market value in which comparable sales are often utilized. The comparable sales method of valuation has long been accepted in Maryland. <em>Brinsfield v. City of Baltimore, </em>236 Md. 66, 202 A.2d 335 (1964). <em>See also State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>238 Md. 371, 378, 209 A.2d 247, 250 (1965) (\u201cIn Maryland it is well settled that evidence of the price for which similar property has been sold in the vicinity may legitimately be used in support of, and as background for, the opinion of an expert testifying as to the value of the property taken in condemnation proceedings.\u201d). It has been held by the intermediate appellate court that, in some unique instances, it may be proper to admit evidence of the prior sale of the property in question, even if the sale occurred several years prior to trial. <em>See Colonial Pipeline v. Gimbel, </em>54 Md.App. 32, 456 A.2d 946 (1983) (evidence concerning an 18-year-old sale of property in question admissible where property was unique and no comparable sales existed.) With this in mind, we turn now to the first issue: whether it was permissible for the trial court to allow the jury to hear evidence regarding the price that petitioner paid for the building in question, a sale that was 18 years old at the time of trial. We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, such a remote sale was not relevant to the fair market value of the property at the time of the take. We further hold that its improper admission unfairly prejudiced the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As a threshold matter, no evidence that is alleged to relate to the fair market value of a property involved in a condemnation proceeding is properly admissible at trial unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>it is actually relevant. As this Court stated as a general evidentiary principle in <em>Lai v. Sagle, </em>373 Md. 306, 818 A.2d 237 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201c\u2018Evidence, to be admissible, must be both relevant and material. Evidence is material if it tends to establish a proposition that has legal significance to the litigation; it is relevant if it is sufficiently probative of a proposition that, if established, would have legal significance to the litigation. Evidence is relevant, therefore, if it has any tendency to make the existence of a material fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence, and a fact is material if it is of legal consequence to the determination of the issues in the case, which are dependent upon the pleadings and the substantive law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">&gt;}: ^ ^ sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u2018The general rule in this State is that all evidence that is relevant to a material issue is admissible except as otherwise provided by statutes or by rules applicable in Maryland courts. Relevant evidence may be excluded if the trial court [] believes that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 319, 818 A.2d at 245 (quoting <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 454, 594 A.2d 1248, 1254 (1991), cert. denied, <em>Fibreboard Corp. v. Myers, </em>325 Md. 249, 600 A.2d 418 (1992)). <em>See also Smallwood v. Bradford, </em>352 Md. 8, 27, 720 A.2d 586, 595 (1998) (stating \u201cRule 5-401 defines relevant as \u2018evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u201d). The same has been held in criminal cases. <em>See, e.g., Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 19, 811 A.2d 282, 292 (2002) (stating that although relevant evidence is generally admissible, it \u201cshould be excluded by the trial court, if the probative value of such evidence is determined to be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997); <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 206, 670 A2d 398, 413 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996); <em>State v. Jaynes, </em>314 Md. 113, 119, 549 A.2d 380, 383 (1988); Md. Rules 5-401, 5-402, 5-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Appellate review of a trial court ruling on the admissibility of evidence often is said to be based on the standard that such a ruling is \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d so that \u201cabsent a showing of abuse of that discretion, its ruling[] will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 42, 733 A.2d 1014, 1018 (1999) (alteration added) (citing <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 636-37, 598 A.2d 187, 192 (1991)). Application of that standard, however, depends on whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law. When the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a weighing, we generally apply the more deferential abuse of discretion standard. On the other hand, when the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a pure legal question, we generally review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. See Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002) (\u201c[O]ur Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d) (alteration added) (citing <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 704-05, 782 A.2d 332, 342 (2001)); <em>Register of Wills for Balt. County v. Arrowsmith, </em>365 Md. 237, 249, 778 A.2d 364, 371 (2001) (\u201c[A]s is consistent with our review for all questions of law, we review the order and judgment <em>de novo.\u201d). See also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 704-05, 782 A.2d at 342 (finding that where a \u201ctrial court has committed an error of law, [it is] to be reviewed by appellate courts <em>de novo.\u201d) </em>(alteration added). Likewise, if a court\u2019s ruling constitutes a \u201c \u2018conclusion!] of law based upon the facts\u2019 \u201d of a case, <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Gannett Co., Inc., </em>356 Md. 699, 707, 741 A.2d 1130, 1134 (1999) (alteration added) (quoting <em>Cassell v. Pfaifer, </em>243 Md. 447, 453, 221 A.2d 668, 672 (1966)), the court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201c \u2018law enjoy[s] no presumption of correctness on review\u2019 \u201d and is \u201c \u2018not entitled to any deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gannett Co., Inc., </em>356 Md. at 707, 741 A.2d at 1134-35 (quoting <em>Rohrbaugh v. Estate of Stern, </em>305 Md. 443, 447 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>2, 505 A.2d 113, 115 n. 2 (1986) (citation omitted); <em>Oliver v. Hays, </em>121 Md.App. 292, 306, 708 A.2d 1140, 1147 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Here, we hold that the price that was paid in 1982 for the property located at 324 West Baltimore Street was not relevant for the jury, at trial in 2001, to consider in its valuation of the property as of the time of the taking, which was fourteen months earlier. There was ample evidence at trial of comparable sales. Moreover, the time period of the purchase was simply too remote. <em>See City of Baltimore v. Schreiber, </em>243 Md. 546, 551, 221 A.2d 663, 665 (1966) (\u201cThe general rule in this country and in this state is that \u2018evidence of the price paid for condemned real property on a sale prior to eminent domain proceedings is admissible in the proceedings at least where the sale is voluntary, is <em>not too remote in point of time, </em>or is not otherwise shown to have probative value.\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis in original) (quoting W.R. Habeeb, <em>Admissibility, in Eminent Domain Proceeding, of Evidence as to Price Paid for Condemned Real Property on Sale Prior to the Proceeding, </em>55 A.L.R.2d 791 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">While this Court has determined that there is \u201cconsiderable latitude in the exercise of discretion by the lower court in determining comparable sales,\u201d the 1982 sale was not properly admissible as evidence of a comparable sale. <em>Lustine v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>217 Md. 274, 280, 142 A.2d 566, 569 (1958) (citing <em>Patterson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>127 Md. 233, 241, 96 A. 458, 461 (1915); <em>Williams v. New York, P. &amp; N.R. Company, </em>153 Md. 102, 108, 137 A. 506, 508 (1927)). As this Court recently stated, \u201c[t]he comparable sales approach estimates market value by looking to <em>recent </em>voluntary sales transactions involving properties similar to the subject property, and adjusts for any differences between each comparable property sold and the subject property.\u201d <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Utilities, </em>365 Md. 1, 10 n. 5, 775 A.2d 1178, 1183 n. 5 (2001) (alteration added) (emphasis added). In regard to comparable sales, Maryland has adopted as a \u201crule of thumb\u201d the \u201cfive year\u2014 five mile\u201d rule, that is, sales concluded more than five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>prior to the date of the taking and those more than five miles from the property can be excluded. <em>See Taylor v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>224 Md. 92, 167 A.2d 127 (1961); <em>State Rds. Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>238 Md. 371, 209 A.2d 247 (1965); Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions, MPJI Cv 13:3(c)(3)(c) (4th ed.2002). Testimony based on remote in time sales adjusted for time by use of the consumer price index, however, in very limited circumstances, may sometimes be an acceptable method, absent the availability of alternative, preferable methods. <em>See Colonial Pipeline v. Gimbel, </em>54 Md.App. 32, 456 A.2d 946 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Property values can greatly appreciate (or depreciate) over time. In this instance, petitioner purchased the building in question in 1982 for $85,000.00. At the time of trial, the estimates by expert appraisal witnesses ranged from a low of $225,000.00 to a high of $513,000.00. The original 1982 purchase price, 18 years old at the time of the taking, was simply not, under the circumstances here present, relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of the fair market value of petitioner\u2019s property at the time of the taking. This conclusion is compelled also by the fact that no effort was made to adjust the 1982 purchase price to its 2001 present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We are not alone in our assessment of the relevance of \u201ctime\u201d in comparable sales. The leading treatise on condemnation also declares that the <em>time </em>of the previous sale is <em>always relevant </em>in determining whether the comparable sale is admissible as evidence. Nichols on Eminent Domain (hereinafter Nichols) states, \u201c[sjales of property must be <em>recent </em>enough in time to provide good evidence of fair market value of condemned land. This is true no matter how similar the properties are in all other respects.\u201d 5 Nichols on Eminent Domain \u00a7 21.02, at 21-55 (3d ed. Rev.2001) (alteration added) (emphasis added). Nichols further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cUnquestionably, the first issue to be resolved concerning the admissibility or exclusion of a sale or purchase of the property that is subject of a condemnation case is the date of the sale or purchase: is it relevant?

To the extent that the Court of Special Appeals held that the purchase price of a property is always relevant, it is expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Respondent argues that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Colonial Pipeline, </em>54 Md.App. 32, 456 A.2d 946 (1983), should determine the present case, because it also deals with the admission of an 18-year-old sale as evidence of a comparable sale and in that case the decision by the trial court to admit such evidence was upheld. We disagree. Whereas <em>Colonial Pipeline </em>dealt with the condemnation of a unique pipeline right-of-way, for which no expert was able to find a comparable sale, the property at issue here is not so unique in its nature. In fact, the four expert appraisal witnesses called at trial in this present case produced twelve comparable sales that were introduced into evidence. The intermediate appellate court in <em>Colonial Pipeline </em>opined that \u201cIt is, we think, significant that the sale here considered was unique in that neither expert was able to produce a comparable sale other than the one consummated in 1963.... Comparable sales of pipeline rights-of-way are scarce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 456 A.2d at 951-52. With twelve comparable sales introduced by both petitioner and respondent into evidence at trial in the case at bar, there was not a dearth of comparable sales. In this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Taylor v. State Roads Commission, </em>224 Md. 92, 167 A.2d 127 (1961), we did uphold a ruling admitting evidence of the five-and-a-half year old sale price of the small farm property there in question, but <em>only </em>where that prior sale was the sole sale of a small farm testified to by any of the appraisal experts. <em>Colonial Pipeline </em>and <em>Taylor </em>are limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>in application to their facts and therefore demonstrate, at most, that prior sales of the property at issue in a case, even though remote, can be used at trial <em>only </em>if it is shown that there is a considerable absence of comparable sales to be used as evidence of fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Even if there is a lack of comparable sales, a remote sale only becomes relevant evidence if the price is properly adjusted for time by a professional appraiser. <em>See Colonial Pipeline, </em>54 Md.App. at 43-44, 456 A.2d at 952-53 (18 year old sale adjusted by means of the consumer price index so that it could be argued that the prior 18-year-old sales price as adjusted, would reflect the then current value). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>not only were there ample comparable sales to support the appraisals thereby making the 18-year-old purchase price completely irrelevant, no attempt was made to adjust the 18-year-old sale to the property\u2019s value in October of 2000. The evidence concerning the 1982 sale was simply not properly admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">B. The Jury View of the Property</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Maryland Rule 12-207(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concerns jury views of condemned property and states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201c(c) View. Before the production of other evidence, the trier of fact shall view the property <em>sought to be condemned </em>unless the court accepts a written waiver filed by all parties. In a jury trial, each party shall inform the court, before the jury leaves for the view, of the name of the person to speak for that party at the view. Only one person shall represent all of the plaintiffs and only one person shall represent all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the defendants, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause. Only those persons shall be permitted to make any statement to the jury during the view, and the court shall so instruct the jury. These persons shall point out to the jury the property sought to be condemned, its boundaries, and any adjacent property of the owner claimed to be affected by the taking. They may also point out the physical features, before and after the taking, of the property taken and of any adjacent property of the owner claimed to be affected by the taking. The judge shall be present at and shall supervise the view unless the court accepts a written waiver filed by all parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201cThe parties, their attorneys, and other representatives may be present during a view. A jury shall be transported to and attend a view as a body under the charge of an officer of the court, and the expense of transporting the jury shall be assessed as costs.\u201d [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The first question that we have regarding the jury view of the property at 324 West Baltimore Street is not whether the view itself was unfairly prejudicial under Md. Rule 5-403 (which it was), but whether a jury view is even required by Maryland Rule 12-207(c) in a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation. We therefore commence our discussion of Maryland Rule 12-207(c) in respect to a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding by examining the proper standards for the interpretation of the Maryland Rules. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 757 A.2d 796 (2000), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cWith respect to the interpretation of the Maryland Rules, this Court has stated that, \u2018[t]he canons and principles which we follow in construing statutes apply equally to an interpretation of our rules.\u2019 <em>State v. Romulus, </em>315 Md. 526, 533, 555 A.2d 494, 497 (1989). In order to effectuate the purpose and objectives of the rule, we look to its plain text. <em>See Adamson v. Correctional Medical Serv., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 250-51, 753 A.2d 501, 507-08 (2000); <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088, 1091 (1999). To prevent <em>illogical or nonsensical interpretations of a rule, </em>we analyze the rule in its entirety, rather than independent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ly construing its subparts. <em>See Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of the Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000). If the words of the rule are plain and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 250-51, 753 A.2d at 507-08; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 402-03, 749 A.2d at 779; <em>Huffman, </em>356 Md. at 628, 741 A.2d at 1091.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 264-65, 757 A.2d at 804 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We hold that Maryland Rule 12-207(c) does not apply to a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The very nature of a \u201cquick-take\u201d action seems at odds with the language in the Rule. It would, in many instances, simply be illogical to apply the \u201cview\u201d language in \u201cquick-take\u201d situations. Moreover, the first sentence of Maryland Rule 12-207(c) states that \u201cthe trier of fact shall view the property <em>sought to be condemned </em>____\u201d (emphasis added). As we stated earlier, what distinguishes a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation from a regular condemnation is that, in a \u201cquick-take,\u201d the private property is immediately taken for public use and, therefore, at the instant of the taking, can be said to be \u201ccondemned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">This is not the case in a regular condemnation proceeding. In a regular condemnation proceeding, possession of the private property is taken after trial and can only then be said to be finally \u201ccondemned.\u201d <em>See J.L. Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 89-90, 792 A.2d at 299 (\u201c[W]hen an entity has \u2018regular\u2019 condemnation authority, the fair market value of the property is assessed by the jury \u2018as of the date of trial\u2019 because the taking does not occur prior to the trial.\u201d) (alteration added). While a condemning authority normally can abandon a regular condemnation, it cannot abandon a \u201cquick-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>take\u201d condemnation because a \u201ctaking\u201d has already occurred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, in a \u201cquick-take\u201d proceeding, the private owners no longer have control of the property once it is taken and, therefore, no longer have control over its condition after the taking. Because of this characteristic of a \u201cquick-take,\u201d it may become unfair (and often illogical) in a \u201cquick-take\u201d proceeding that a jury should be able, over the objection of the persons whose property has already been taken, to view the property, when in fact conditions of the property may have changed so drastically since the \u201cquick-take\u201d as to make the appearance of the property at the time of trial substantially different from what it was at the time of the taking.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was a 14-month gap between the time of the \u201cquick-take\u201d in October of 2000 and the time of the condemnation trial in December of 2001. The condition of the building appears to have changed substantially by the time it was inspected by the jury. The evidence indicates that its former tenants had left numerous quantities of trash behind while moving out after their eviction by respondent. Fixtures had been ripped off the walls. According to the owner\u2019s undisputed testimony, there was a hole in the rear of the building that did not exist at the date of the condemnation, but rather was caused by tenants creating a makeshift means to remove their property upon their eviction by respondent. The building itself was left vacant for months. Respondent had the electricity to the building disconnected. Trash, debris and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>dead and live rats were scattered throughout the building. Because respondent possessed the building, petitioner, during the fourteen months, was powerless to remedy its condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We hold that there was no legitimate probative value concerning the jury view in this case. The jurors, in their view of the property in December of 2001, did not see the property as it existed at the time of the taking in October of 2000. Whereas it may be of significant probative value for a jury to view a property in a regular condemnation proceeding due to the fact that the taking itself does not occur prior to the trial, we hold that in a \u201cquick-take\u201d proceeding a jury view is not mandatory under Maryland Rule 12-207(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">If both parties in a \u201cquick-take\u201d proceeding elected to have a jury view of the property, however, nothing in Maryland Rule 12-207(c) would prohibit it, but that was not the case here. Petitioner objected to the jury viewing the property in its dilapidated condition, but the trial court allowed for a partial view of the first two floors of the property. Because we hold that Maryland Rule 12-207(c) (the viewing provision) was not meant to apply to \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceedings, the trial court was in error for ordering the jury to view the property over petitioner\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Respondent argues that petitioner was not prejudiced during the view because a representative of petitioner accompanied the jury on the view to explain the property\u2019s condition prior to the taking. This reasoning is flawed. No explanation to the jury, under these circumstances, would have been sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact of viewing the property as it existed on December 11, 2001. In the Illinois case of <em>Illinois State Highway Authority v. Grand Mandarin Restaurant, Inc., </em>189 Ill.App.3d 355, 136 Ill.Dec. 370, 544 N.E.2d 1145 (1989), the court decided to exclude evidence depicting the condition of a building after it had been subject to a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation, stating that \u201cin a condemnation case the condition of the property is particularly material to its valuation,\u201d and \u201c[t]he condition of the property following its abandonment by defendants and the removal of equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and fixtures would only serve to mislead the jury and unnecessarily prejudice their valuation of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148 (alteration added). <em>See Department of Public Works &amp; Bldgs, v. Remmerie, </em>29 Ill.2d 40, 192 N.E.2d 877, 878 (1963), where that court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cThe Eminent Domain Act provides for a view of the premises by the jury upon motion of either party (Ill.Rev. Stat.1961, chap. 47, par. 9).... The situation has been changed by the enactment of the \u2018quick taking\u2019 statute, and under that procedure there may now be situations in which a requirement that the jury must view the premises would result in injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>See also Proctor v. Wolber, </em>2002 Ohio 2593, *P56-57 (Ohio App.2002)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (stating that where an Ohio statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 163.12 (Anderson 2003), provided that a \u201c \u2018view of the premises to be appropriated shall be ordered by the court when demanded by a party to the proceedings\u2019.... Denial of the view is appropriate where the only purpose it could serve would be to show the property in an unfair light ... and the benefits of the view are outweighed by the injustice to the property owner and would deprive him of compensation to which he is entitled.\u201d). In <em>Ajootian v. Director of Public Works, </em>90 R.I. 96, 155 A.2d 244, 247 (1959), after noting that \u201cGeneral Laws 1956, \u00a7 9-16-1, authorizes the trial court to order a view by the jury and this court has held that such an order is discretionary with the trial justice,\u201d the court held that the trial court\u2019s action of granting a jury view of the property \u201clong after it was taken by the state and after the condition of the premises had materially changed for the worse\u201d constituted an \u201cabuse of discretion which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>prejudicial to the petitioners\u2019 right to a fair hearing.\u201d Like our sister states, we hold that a jury view in such a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding, under circumstances such as existed here, is unfairly prejudicial to the condemnee and, in the present case, should not have been allowed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Furthermore, the owner is entitled to receive the exact same compensation under \u201cquick-take\u201d procedures as is available under a conventional condemnation. In this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>298 Md. 80, 467 A.2d 1032 (1983), albeit relating to interest on a jury award, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cAs earlier observed, the purpose of awarding interest in a quick take condemnation case is to put the property owner in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have occupied if his property had not been taken. If the property owner had been paid on the day of the taking when he was entitled to receive the full value of the property taken, he presumably would have invested his funds in a prudent manner. <em>United States v. 429.59 Acres of Land, </em>612 F.2d 459 (9th Cir.1980). Thus, when payment is delayed, the jury must fix interest on any deficiency award at the rate a reasonably prudent person investing funds so as to produce a reasonable return while maintaining safety of principle would receive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\"><em>King, </em>298 Md. at 91, 467 A.2d at 1038. One of the salient principles that we expressed in <em>King, </em>is that an owner cannot be made to suffer pecuniary loss as a result of the \u201cquick-take\u201d procedure as opposed to the regular condemnation procedure. It is clear to us that, in this instance, petitioner was unfairly prejudiced when a jury view was held in a building that respondent, who had already \u201ctaken\u201d the building, allowed to remain strewn with trash, infested with rats and without electric lighting. This prejudice may have denied to petitioner the full value of the property at issue. If this was a regular condemnation case, the property would not have been out of the petitioner\u2019s control for the fourteen months before trial. An owner has a constitutional right to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the fair market value for the property that is taken as of the time it is taken: the price a \u201cwilling\u201d seller would accept from a \u201cwilling\u201d buyer. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-105(b) of the Real Property Article. Because the jury viewed the taken property, property that petitioner had not been in control of for fourteen months, petitioner may not have received the fair market value of the property at the time it was taken by respondent in October 2000. We hold that the jury view of the property at 324 West Baltimore Street was unfairly prejudicial to petitioner and therefore should not have been allowed by the trial court over petitioner\u2019s objection to the view.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We hold that when there exists competent and relevant evidence of recent comparable sales in a condemnation proceeding, evidence as to the price paid for the property being condemned is not generally admissible in order to determine the fair market value of the property if such evidence is found to be too remote to be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We hold that in a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding, Maryland Rule 12-207(c) does not require a jury view of the property. Because Maryland Rule 12-207(c) states that it pertains to \u201cproperty sought to be condemned,\u201d the Rule does not apply to \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnations, which by their very nature involve property already \u201ctaken\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>condemned. Therefore, the trial court was in error to allow a jury view of the property located at 324 West Baltimore Street over petitioner\u2019s objection. We hold that the jury view as ordered by the trial court was unfairly prejudicial to petitioner, thereby also violating Maryland Rule 5-403 which in pertinent part provides: \u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

In its simplest terms, a \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation involves the \"immediate taking of private property for public use, whereby the estimated reasonable compensation is placed in escrow until the actual amount of compensation can be established.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 287 (7th ed.1999). This Court stated that a \"quick-take\u201d condemnation occurs where \u201cthe condemning authority takes possession of the property prior to trial upon payment into court of its estimate of the value of the property taken.\u201d <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, 298 </em>Md. 80, 85-86, 467 A.2d 1032, 1035 (1983). Unlike a \"regular\u201d condemnation proceeding, where the value of the property is assessed by the jury \"as of the date of the trial,\u201d a \"quick-take\u201d condemnation proceeding requires that a jury base its determination on the fair market value of the property <em>on the date of the taking.

Furthermore, Article III, Section 40A provides that any \"quick-take\u201d statute enacted pursuant to Section 40A is required to contain a provision that \"requires the payment of any further sum that may subsequently be added by a jury....\u201d The Maryland Constitution does not expressly authorize any reduction in the sum paid to the owner or into court if a jury later finds that the value of the property is less than that already paid or deposited in a \"quick-take\u201d condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"ae5-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In respect to condemnation proceedings by the State Roads Commission, a statute, Md.Code (1977, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-337 of the Transportation Article provides, in respect to moneys paid into court under the Commission\u2019s \"quick-take\u201d authority, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\"On written request ... the property owner is entitled to receive any amount paid into the court ... without prejudice to any of the property owner\u2019s rights, if the property owner agrees to repay to the Commission any excess of the amount over the final award that is allowed in the subsequent condemnation proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">As far as we can discern, the Maryland Code contains no similar provision in respect to other entities, such as respondent, specifically requiring the condemnee to remit excess sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">As we have indicated, the Maryland Constitution merely requires the condemnor to pay to the condemnee any sum a jury awards that is in excess of the sum initially paid to the condemnee. It does not require the opposite. The constitutionality of provisions requiring a con-demnee in \"quick-take\u201d proceedings to remit to the condemning authority sums paid to the condemnee in excess of the amount later determined by a jury to be the fair market value of the subject property has yet to be determined. The issue was not raised in the petition and briefs filed in this case and, thus, we need not now resolve it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">. During the hearing concerning petitioner's motion for a new trial, the trial judge did not recall petitioner objecting to the jury view, and instead believed that petitioner had in fact requested it. The trial judge went on further to state that if petitioner had objected to the jury view he would have sustained the objection. When the attorney for the respondent was questioned about whether petitioner had objected, he recalled petitioner objecting to the jury view. As can be seen, <em>supra, </em>a sufficient objection was made at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\">.

Maryland Rule 12-207(c) is derived, and remains virtually unchanged, from former Maryland Rule 2-515(a). Records of the Rules Committee meeting concerning implementation of Maryland Rule 12-207(c) show that the Rule was not modified before acceptance, and that it was transferred into Rule 12-207(c) from Rule 2-515 (a) in order to place it within the condemnation rules. No special mention is made in the Rules Committee history we have reviewed concerning \"quick-take\u201d condemnations and whether Maryland Rule 12-207(c) was meant to apply to such condemnations. Minutes of the Rules Committee, November 19, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\">. By this opinion, we bring this matter to the attention of the Rules Committee, for its proposal of a modification of Md. Rule 12-207(c)\u2019s jury view provision consistent with this opinion. The Rule as presently drafted may be inconsistent, in that it states \"sought to be condemned\u201d and also refers to \"before and after.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">. As previously indicated, in \"quick-take\u201d condemnations the property is deemed \"taken\" when payment is made to the condemnee or into court. Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-109(d) of the Real Property Article states: \"No condemnation proceeding may be abandoned: (1) After taking has occurred; ...\u201d Therefore, a condemnor in a \"quick-take\u201d proceeding is not at liberty, over the condemnee's objection, to abandon a condemnation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. One of the purposes of a \"quick-take\u201d condemnation is to permit the condemning authority to immediately alter the premises, or even to demolish the premises, in order that the public purpose for the condemnation may be more quickly realized. In many \"quick-take\u201d cases there would be little to view at the time of trial \u2014 or conversely a new structure, <em>i.e., </em>a stadium or the like, is all that could be \"viewed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. This citation is apparently a vendor neutral citation method that Ohio, along with approximately eight other states, now uses instead of the printed reporter citation method. It appears that Ohio no longer distinguishes between \u201cpublished\u201d and \u201cunpublished\u201d case opinions, but other states that use the vendor neutral citation method still only report and publish cases that the those courts decide should be reported in a printed reporter. The vendor neutral citation method uses a paragraph pinpoint citation method rather than a pinpoint page reference to identify text within the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
