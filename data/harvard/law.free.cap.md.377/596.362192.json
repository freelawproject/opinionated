Housing Opportunities Comm., </em>350 Md. 570, 714 A.2d 197 (1998), we pointed out that the Real Property Article of the Maryland Code contains three separate and distinct provisions under which a landlord may recover possession of leased premises. Section 8-401 provides for the recovery of possession when the tenant fails to pay rent that is currently due and payable. Section 8-402 \u2014 often referred to as the \u201ctenant holding over\u201d statute \u2014 permits recovery upon a finding that the tenant\u2019s lease has expired, that notice to quit was given, and that the tenant has refused to vacate. Section 8-402.1 \u2014 referred to as the \u201cbreach of lease\u201d statute \u2014 provides for recovery when the tenant has breached a covenant of the lease, other than the covenant to pay rent, and the court finds that the breach was substantial and warrants eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The principal issue now before us is whether a landlord who is participating in the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program provided for in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42 may use the tenant holding over statute to evict a tenant who qualifies for and is receiving low-income housing assistance under the voucher program provided for in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o). The tenant here, petitioner Carter, contends that (1) provisions in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B) and (E) preclude a participating landlord from terminating a lease except for good cause, (2) the effect of that Federal preclusion is to make the tenancy an indefinite one, without any fixed term, (3) the lease therefore does not expire, regardless of whether, on its face, it has an expiration date or provides for expiration, and (4) \u00e1s a result, the tenant holding over statute (\u00a7 8^402) is inapplicable. She thus avers that, in order to terminate her tenancy, other than for nonpayment of rent, the landlord must proceed under the breach of lease provision (\u00a7 8-402.1). Petitioner adds that, even if the preclusion does not convert a fixed tenancy into an indefinite one, the landlord failed to establish good cause in this case for terminating her lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The landlord \u2014 respondent Maryland Management Co. \u2014 argues that (1) except in one particular circumstance not applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ble here, the Federal law does <em>not </em>require \u201cgood cause\u201d for termination, (2) even if it does, that does not convert a fixed-term tenancy into one that is indefinite or perpetual, (3) if the requisites of \u00a7 8-402 are met, the landlord may therefore proceed, in accordance with State law, under the tenant holding over statute, and (4) if good cause is required by Federal law to be shown under the tenant holding over statute, respondent produced sufficient evidence in this case to establish such cause. The District Court concluded that good cause was required, that that requirement did not preclude use of the tenant holding over statute, and that the landlord had established good cause. It therefore entered a judgment of restitution. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed, and so shall we.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">On October 1, 1996, petitioner leased a townhouse in a project owned by respondent. By reason of its participation in the LIHTC program, respondent agreed to lease a certain percentage of the rental units in the project to persons, such as petitioner, who qualified for low-income rental assistance under 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 1437f. The initial lease, for 1996-97, is not in the record, but an addendum to it is in evidence The addendum, on a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development form for the \u201cSection 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Rental Voucher Program,\u201d notes that the lease ran from October 1, 1996 to October 1, 1997. It states that the \u201cterm of the lease\u201d would terminate if (1) the lease terminates, (2) the housing assistance payment contract between the public housing agency and the landlord terminates, or (3) the housing agency terminates program assistance for the tenant. The \u201clease\u201d would terminate upon termination by the landlord, the tenant, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Paragraph 10 of the addendum expressly limited the grounds upon which the landlord could terminate the tenancy to \u201c[sjerious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease; [vjiolation of Federal, State, or local law that imposes obligations on the tenant in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>occupancy or use of the contract unit and the premises; [certain] [c]riminal activity [ ]; or [o]ther good cause.\u201d The term \u201cother good cause\u201d was defined in \u00b6 10 c. as including, but not limited to, \u201cliving or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the unit or property.\u201d Paragraph 11 required the landlord, as a condition of its terminating the lease, to give written notice to the tenant of the grounds for termination at or before the commencement of any eviction action. Whether this addendum, or one like it, accompanied subsequent leases is unclear. The record contains a lease for the term October 1, 2000 to October 1, 2001, but there is no addendum to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">On September 4, 1998, a \u201cSection 8 inspector\u201d from the Baltimore City Housing Authority made an annual inspection of petitioner\u2019s home, in conformance with requirements of the program, and found seven violations. Petitioner was directed to patch and repaint a hole in the living room wall, clean a dirty kitchen floor and stove, clean stains in the bathtub, cover and repaint holes in two bedroom walls, clean walls or the floor in three bedrooms, and clean the carpet and floors throughout the unit. In June, 2000, respondent filed actions under both \u00a7 8-402 and \u00a7 8-402.1 to evict petitioner, but those cases were generally postponed pursuant to a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The agreement allowed petitioner to remain in the home, but provided that, if she breached the lease prior to December 13, 2000, the landlord would provide notice of the breach and, within 30 days, the cases would be rescheduled for trial. If there was no request to reschedule by December 13, the cases would be dismissed. Although the agreement did not specifically call for a new lease, one was entered into on January 5, 2001. As we shall see, the Federal regulations relating to leases with voucher program tenants changed considerably between 1996 and 2000, and the new lease reflected those changes. The term was one year, commencing October 1, 2000, at the end of which period the parties could renew on a month-to-month basis. In addition to the renewal provision, there was a paragraph captioned \u201cTenant Holding Over,\u201d which provided, in relevant part, that if the tenant continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>to occupy the unit \u201cafter expiration of this Lease Agreement, or any renewal or extension thereof\u201d and the landlord consented to such continued occupancy, the occupancy, unless agreed otherwise, would be on a month-to-month basis, at twice the rental payable under the lease, to continue until either party gave two months notice of termination. Included in the lease were certain rules and regulations, among which was a covenant by petitioner to \u201c[k]eep the Premises in a neat, clean, good and sanitary condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The next annual inspection occurred in September, 2000. This time, one violation was noted; petitioner was directed to replace broken glass in the living room. In June, 2001, respondent sent notice to petitioner of its intent to terminate the lease when it expired. In August, another annual inspection occurred and turned up seven violations. Petitioner was directed to repair or replace the bathroom door and a bedroom door, clean and paint a bedroom wall, replace inoperable smoke detectors, clean and paint the walls on the steps, replace missing screens, and clean or replace all rugs. The lease expired, by its terms, on September 30, 2001 and, when petitioner failed to vacate the premises at that time, respondent filed another tenant holding over action but did not specify in its complaint any cause for termination other than expiration of the lease. When that case came to trial, petitioner argued that respondent could not terminate her tenancy absent a showing of good cause \u2014 something more than just termination of the lease. The District Court agreed and, noting that the June, 2001 notice failed to specify any such good cause, dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On December 28, 2001, respondent sent a notice declaring that the lease would be terminated on February 28, 2002. The letter stated that the lease would not be renewed because petitioner had failed to maintain her unit in a neat, clean, sanitary, and safe condition. It referenced the violations noted in the September, 1998, and August, 2001 inspection reports and indicated a lack of any evidence that those deficiencies had been corrected. At the same time, respondent informed the Housing Authority that it was terminating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>housing assistance contract that it had with respect to petitioner. When petitioner failed to vacate in accordance with the notice, respondent filed new actions under both \u00a7 8-402 and \u00a7 8-402.1. At trial, the various notices were admitted into evidence, along with testimony by the Housing Authority inspector, who confirmed the violations and stated that those directed to the landlord had been corrected but not those directed at petitioner. Petitioner acknowledged most of the conditions reported by the inspector. She said that respondent had repaired some of them and that she had tried to remedy others.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">After listening to the evidence, the District Court found, from the various violations going back to 1998, that there was good cause for termination of the lease and that petitioner was a tenant holding over. Concluding that the tenant holding over statute was applicable, it entered judgment for restitution in favor of respondent under that statute and dismissed the action brought under the breach of lease statute. Petitioner appealed, arguing, as she does here, that (1) under Federal law, her lease was an indefinite one, without any fixed term, and that the tenant holding over statute was therefore inapplicable, and (2) respondent failed to establish good cause in any event. The Circuit Court found no merit to either argument and affirmed the District Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\n<em>The Good Cause Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The issues here depend entirely on the effect that the Federal statutes (and implementing Federal regulations) have on State landlord-tenant law. There is no substantial dispute that, if respondent had not subjected petitioner\u2019s townhouse to the Federal low-income housing program by qualifying for the Federal tax credit under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42, and the issue were thus governed solely by Maryland landlord-tenant law, petitioner would, indeed, be a tenant holding over, and respondent would be entitled to use \u00a7 8-402 to have her evicted. The one-year term of the last lease had expired, the lease had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>converted by its terms into a month-to-month tenancy, and respondent had given the requisite 60-day notice to quit. It is critical, therefore, to understand the nature and requirements of the Federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The statutory basis for the Federal low-income housing program is split between the tax code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42, and the general program for assisted housing, 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 1437 <em>et seq. </em>Section 42 sets forth the eligibility criteria for the tax credit. The provisions in <em>title </em>42 authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies in order to provide rental assistance payments to owners of certain dwelling units rented to approved low-income tenants. In conformance with statutory guidelines, the Secretary is to establish the maximum monthly rent the owner is entitled to receive for the units and the amount of rent that the tenants are required to pay, the latter being set as a percentage of the tenants\u2019 family income. The difference is made up by the government assistance payments. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437a and 1437f. For our purposes, the pertinent provision in title 42 is \u00a7 1437f \u2014 the current emanation of what began as Title I, \u00a7 8 of the National Housing Act of 1937 \u2014 and, in particular, \u00a7 1437f(o), the \u00a7 8 voucher program.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Both sets of provisions\u2014 \u00a7 42 and \u00a7 1437f \u2014 are exceedingly long, complex, and convoluted, as befitting Federal programs in general and Federal tax laws in particular. Section 1437f and the regulations adopted pursuant to it have undergone many changes in just the past 20 years, and keeping up with the shifts in policy and approach is not easy. We shall begin with the tax provision, known as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). It was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as an effort to encourage the private development of low income housing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial amendments, relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the issue before us, were made as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1989 and 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Section 42 of title 26, coupled with \u00a7 38 of that title, provides a tax credit, usable ordinarily over a ten-year period, for a \u201cqualified low-income housing project.\u201d Section 42(g)(1) defines such a project as one for residential rental property in which minimum enumerated percentages of the residential units are both rent-restricted and occupied by persons whose income does not exceed certain amounts. In its initial (1986) version, the law, through its definition of \u201cqualified low-income building,\u201d required the building to remain part of a \u201cqualified low-income housing project\u201d during a 15-year \u201ccompliance period.\u201d <em>See </em>P.L. 99-514, \u00a7 252, enacting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42(c)(2) and (i), 100 Stat. 2191, 2199 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The 1989 amendment added a new subsection (h)(6) to \u00a7 42, in which was imposed the requirement of a further 15-year \u201cextended use period.\u201d <em>See </em>P.L. 101-239, \u00a7 7108(c), 103 Stat. 2308-2311. With that amendment, \u00a7 42(h)(6)(A) makes clear that no credit is allowed with respect to a building unless an \u201cextended low-income housing commitment,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B), is in effect at the end of the taxable year. Thus, to qualify for the tax credit, the commitment must remain in effect for a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 15 taxable years, dating from the first taxable year of the credit period, and an \u201cextended use period,\u201d which, subject to \u00a7 42(h)(6)(E), may not end earlier than 15 years after the close of the \u201ccompliance period.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 42(i)(l) and (h)(6)(D). The effective commitment is thus, ordinarily, for 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Section 42(h)(6)(E) permits an early termination of the \u201cextended use period\u201d in two circumstances. If a mortgage on the building is foreclosed, the \u201cextended use period\u201d terminates on the date the building is acquired pursuant to the foreclosure. After the fourteenth year of the \u201ccompliance period,\u201d the owner may request the housing credit agency to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>find a buyer for the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the low-income portion of the building, and, if the agency is unable to present a qualified contract for the acquisition of that portion by a person who will continue to operate it as a low-income building, the \u201cextended use period\u201d ends on the last day of that one-year period. <em>See </em>\u00a7 42(h)(6)(E)(i) and (I). Subsection 42(h)(6)(E)(ii) provides, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1R\">\u201c[t]he termination of an extended use period under clause (i) shall not be construed to permit before the close of the 3-year period following such termination\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">(I) the eviction or the termination of tenancy (other than for good cause) of an existing tenant of any low-income unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">(II) any increase in the gross rent with respect to such unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">This provision, added as \u00a7 42(h)(6)(E)(ii) by the 1989 amendment, clearly applies only in the event of an early termination of the \u201cextended use period\u201d and is intended to protect existing low-income tenants, as to both their tenancy and the rent, for a three-year period. A new owner who acquires the building by virtue of a foreclosure or the existing owner who is allowed to terminate the commitment under \u00a7 42(h)(6)(E)(i)(II) may not evict or terminate the leases of low-income tenants, other than for good cause, or raise their gross rent beyond what is permitted during that three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The provision that lies at the heart of petitioner\u2019s indefinite tenancy argument is contained in \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B) which, as noted, defines the term \u201cextended low-income housing commitment\u201d \u2014 the commitment that must be in effect in order to entitle the owner to the tax credit. A brief explanation is required. Section 42(a) establishes the amount of the tax credit as \u201c(1) the applicable percentage of (2) the qualified basis of each qualified low-income building.\u201d Section 42(c), in turn, defines the \u201cqualified basis\u201d of a \u201cqualified low-income building\u201d as an amount equal to \u201cthe applicable fraction\u201d of \u201cthe eligible basis\u201d for the building. The \u201capplicable fraction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>is the smaller of the \u201cunit fraction\u201d or the \u201cfloor space fraction,\u201d each, itself, being a defined term. All of this relates to how the credit is to be calculated and, until the 1990 amendment to \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B) added by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. No. 101-508, \u00a7 11,701, 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-506 (1990)), would have been quite irrelevant to what is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">As budget reconciliation Acts tend to be, the 1990 Act was comprehensive in nature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Title XI, which carried its own name, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, dealt with a variety of revenue provisions. Subtitle G, captioned Tax Technical Corrections, made a number of amendments to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989, one of which effectively amended \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B)(i). That subparagraph stated one of the six criteria for an \u201cextended low-income housing commitment.\u201d The amendment added the language noted below in italics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201cFor purposes of this paragraph, the term \u2018extended low-income housing commitment\u2019 means any agreement between the taxpayer and the housing credit agency\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">(i) which requires that the applicable fraction (as defined in subsection (c)(1)) for the building for each taxable year in the extended use period will not be less than the applicable fraction specified in such agreement <em>and which prohibits the actions described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subpara-graph (E)(ii).\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Petitioner views that 1990 amendment as giving the restrictions in \u00a7 42(h)(6)(E)(ii) much broader effect and as mandating that an extended low-income housing commitment preclude, during both the compliance period and the extended use period, the eviction of a low-income tenant, other than for good cause. We believe that she is correct in her ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>conclusion, but not just because of the 1990 statutory amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">In order to qualify for the tax credit under \u00a7 42, a landlord must comply with statutory requirements and requirements imposed by authorized regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during both the initial compliance period and the extended use period. Section 1437f(d) and (o) require that contracts for assistance payments entered into by a public housing agency and the owner of existing housing units must provide, among other things, that \u201cduring the term of the lease, the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\u201d As we shall see, that requirement also appears in regulations of the Secretary. <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 247.3, applicable generally to subsidized projects, and \u00a7 982.310, applicable to the voucher program in which petitioner participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The statutes relied upon by petitioner concern only the extended use period, first imposed by the 1989 amendment. As we observed, the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for termination during the extended use period, as enacted in 1989, applied only in the event of early termination of that period, and was obviously intended to protect existing tenants for a minimum three-year period. The 1990 amendment broadened that requirement, however, and made it applicable throughout the entire extended use period, even if there was no early termination. That is clear both as a matter of ordinary statutory construction and from the legislative history of the 1990 provision. Respondent\u2019s view that the requirement remains applicable only to the three-year period following early termination makes no sense. The amendment would have been unnecessary for that purpose. The limited \u201cgrandfather\u201d requirement applicable to early termination was already in the law. Placing the requirement in \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B)(i), even though it had no relevance to the \u201capplicable fraction,\u201d which was the subject of \u00a7 42(h)(6)(B)(i), made it a condition of an \u201cextended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>low-income housing commitment\u201d and thus of the landlord\u2019s entitlement to the tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The legislative history of the 1990 amendment clearly supports that intent. Although the technical correction provisions of the 1990 Act were posited by the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, upon introduction of the legislation, as making \u201ctechnical and clerical corrections\u201d to the 1989 law in an effort \u201cto make the language of the law understandable and clear\u201d <em>(see </em>remarks of Congressman Rostenkowski, 136 Cong. Rec. H 7138, 101st Cong. 2nd Sess. Aug. 3, 1990), the Report of the House Ways and Means Committee notes that \u201c[t]he bill <em>also </em>clarifies that the extended low-income housing commitment <em>must </em>prohibit the eviction or termination of tenancy (other than for good cause) of an existing tenant of a low-income unit or any increase in the gross rent inconsistent with the rent restrictions on the unit.\u201d (Emphasis added). 101 H. Rpt. 894 (Oct. 17, 1990). <em>See also </em>summary of the provisions of H.R. 5454 placed in the Congressional Record by Representative Rostenkowski upon introduction of the bill (\u201cThe bill clarifies that the extended low-income housing commitment must prohibit the eviction or termination of tenancy (other than for good cause) of an existing tenant of a low-income unit or any increase in the gross rent inconsistent with the rent restrictions on the unit\u201d). 136 Cong. Rec. H 7138, <em>supra. </em>It is clear, therefore, that, both during the initial compliance period and during the extended use period, a landlord participating in the \u00a7 42 tax credit program may not terminate the tenancy of a low-income tenant other than for good cause. <em>See Cimarron Village v. Washington, </em>659 N.W.2d 811 (Minn.App.2003); <em>Templeton Arms v. Feins, </em>220 N.J.Super. 1, 531 A.2d 361 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">\n<em>Effect on Tenant Holding Over Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The requirement of good cause is but one prong of petitioner\u2019s argument. The other is that the requirement gives to petitioner a right or entitlement to continued occupancy and thus effectively converts a fixed-term lease into an indefinite one that continues in existence and does not expire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>until the end of the extended use period. This is based on the notion that, as good cause is required to terminate the tenancy, the tenancy cannot be terminated simply because the underlying lease expires. That second prong, indeed, is the linchpin of her argument that the tenant holding over statute is inapplicable because, until the expiration of the extended use period, she cannot be a tenant holding over. Consistently with our interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42, we agree with petitioner that her tenancy may not be terminated solely because of the expiration of her lease \u2014 that good cause is required to evict even as a tenant holding over \u2014 but we do not agree that she cannot be a tenant holding over, that the lease is one that continues indefinitely until the end of the extended use period.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">At one time, the law may have supported petitioner\u2019s view of an indefinite lease. Prior to the consolidation of the certificate and voucher programs in a new \u00a7 1437f(o) in 1998, the leasing provisions governing those programs were contained in \u00a7 1437f(d)(1)(B), which provided, in relevant part, that (1) the lease between owner and tenant had to be for at least one year \u201cand shall contain other terms and conditions specified by the Secretary,\u201d and (2) the owner could not \u201cterminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\u201d Section 1437f(d)(1)(B)(iii) through (v) listed certain conduct that would be cause for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In 1995, the Secretary adopted new regulations for the certificate and voucher programs. <em>See </em>60 FR 34660 (July 3, 1995) adopting new 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.309. Those regulations required the lease to be for an initial term of at least one year and to provide either \u201c[f|or automatic renewal for successive definite terms (e.g., month-to-month or year-to-year); or ... [f]or automatic indefinite extension of the lease term.\u201d \u00a7 982.309(b)(1) and (2). It provided that the term of the lease would terminate if the owner, the tenant, or the two together terminated the lease, but stated that, during the term of the lease, the owner could not terminate the lease except for good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>cause. \u00a7\u00a7 982.309(b)(3), 982.310(a). In proposing those regulations, the Department noted that they were intended merely to \u201cconfirm and clarify\u201d the existing principle that \u201cthe tenancy continues automatically after the end of the initial lease term\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no need or requirement for the parties to execute a new lease or lease extension\u201d as \u201c[t]he automatic extension is provided for in the lease originally executed by the landlord and family.\u201d 58 FR 11292 (Feb. 24, 1993). It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">\u201cThe difference between an automatic indefinite extension and an extension for pre-defined definite terms is only a difference of form. For all program tenancies, the owner may only terminate the tenancy for statutory good cause grounds, whether during the course of the initial or extended term, or at the end of the initial or any extended term. In this respect, tenancies in the Section 8 tenant-based programs differ from private unassisted tenancies, where the owner may typically evict the tenant without cause at the end of the lease term. <em>In the tenant-based Section 8 programs, simple expiration of the lease term is not grounds for termination of tenancy.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Under that regime, most of the few courts that considered the matter concluded that the requirement of good cause applied not only during the term of the lease but after the lease expired \u2014 that it governed as well the decision whether to renew or extend the lease. In <em>Swann v. Gastonia Housing Authority, </em>502 F.Supp. 362, 365 (W.D.N.C.1980), <em>aff'd in part, </em>675 F.2d 1342 (4th Cir.1982), the District Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2g\">\u201cThe purpose of the Act would be frustrated if a landlord were allowed to participate in and take advantage of the economic security provided to landlords under the Act, and yet the tenant were stripped of any reciprocal security by being vulnerable to eviction without good cause at the expiration of the lease term. Congress could not have intended such unfairness and insecurity in an area as critical for low-income families as is basic housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>That aspect of the decision was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court. <em>See </em>675 F.2d at 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">A Federal court in California reached a similar conclusion, on a somewhat more precise basis. In <em>Mitchell v. U.S. Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Develop., </em>569 F.Supp. 701, 707-08 (N.D.Cal.1983), the court noted that the limitation in \u00a7 1437f(d) was on a termination of \u201cthe tenancy,\u201d not termination of \u201cthe lease.\u201d It concluded that, \u201c[i]f Congress had intended the good cause requirement to be applicable only to mid-lease evictions, it could have easily selected the phrase \u2018terminate the lease.\u2019 \u201d Applying the good cause requirement to non-renewals following expiration, the court said, \u201cis not onerous, but merely fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709. <em>See also Templeton Arms v. Feins, supra, </em>220 N.J.Super. 1, 531 A.2d 361; <em>Cimarron Village v. Washington, supra, </em>659 N.W.2d 811; <em>Joy v. Daniels, </em>479 F.2d 1236 (4th Cir.1973). We intimated as much, although the issue was not directly before us, in <em>Carroll v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n, </em>306 Md. 515, 510 A.2d 540 (1986). The issue there was whether a \u00a7 8 tenant, who challenged a tenant-holding-over action, had sufficiently alleged a controversy involving more than $500 to entitle her to a jury trial. Noting the good cause requirement in the Federal regulations, we concluded that she \u201chas a right to remain in her townhouse indefinitely until the Commission can establish good cause for eviction\u201d and that that right of continued tenancy, coupled with the rent subsidy, caused the value of the controversy to exceed $500. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 510 A.2d at 545. <em>Compare Whitehall Manor Properties, Inc. v. Lamothe, </em>13 Mass.App.Ct. 917, 430 N.E.2d 852 (1982) (holding that the Federal procedures \u201capply only when the lease is in effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The statutory and regulatory regime changed significantly in 1998, however, when Congress consolidated the certificate and voucher programs in a new \u00a7 1437f(o). In place of the lease requirements of \u00a7 1437f(d), the new programs became subject to \u00a7 1437(o)(7) which, after requiring a one-year initial lease (unless the public housing agency approves a shorter term), provides that the lease shall (1) be \u201cin a standard form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>used in the locality by the dwelling unit owner,\u201d (2) \u201ccontain terms and conditions that \u2014 (I) are consistent with State and local law; and (II) apply generally to tenants in the property who are not assisted under this section,\u201d and (3) \u201cprovide that during the term of the lease, the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See </em>P.L. 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2599. Those are the current provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In conformance with that statutory change, the applicable regulations were also significantly rewritten. <em>See </em>64 FR 26632 (May 14, 1999). They continue to require an initial lease of one year, unless the public housing agency approves a shorter term, but gone are the provisions requiring automatic renewal. They are replaced by the new provisions in \u00a7 982.308 requiring the lease to conform with standard leases in the community and with State landlord-tenant law. As the Department advised in proposing these new regulations, \u201c[t]he lease form must be in the standard form used in the locality by the owner\u201d and \u201cmust contain terms that are consistent with State and local law, and that apply generally to unassisted tenants in the same property.\u201d 64 FR 26632, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The pre-1998 version of \u00a7 1437f, and the regulations implementing it, were far more consistent with the post-1990 structure of the tax credit provision in establishing that good cause was required to terminate the tenancy of a voucher program tenant, whether during the term of a lease or upon its expiration. Whether they would have gone further and supported the notion of an indefinite tenancy is a moot point now, as the provisions in the old law that may have supported that proposition have been deleted in favor of the requirement that voucher program leases be consistent with leases generally used in the community, leases, like the one in this case, that ordinarily carry fixed expiration dates and that permit eviction under the State tenant holding over law. The new, current, provisions clearly militate against the notion of an indefinite tenancy \u2014 a never-ending lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>We do not believe that the new provisions were intended, or effective, to delete the requirement that decisions not to renew or extend a lease upon its expiration require good cause, however. For one thing, that would place \u00a7 1437f(o) in conflict with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42 which, as we noted, precludes both the \u201ceviction\u201d and the \u201ctermination of tenancy\u201d of existing low-income tenants other than for good cause. The two sections are part of an integrated statutory scheme, and, as we have often said, \u201ca provision contained within an integrated statutory scheme must be understood in that context and harmonized to the extent possible with other provisions of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 157, 501 A.2d 1307, 1313 (1986), and cases cited there. <em>See also Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 129, 756 A.2d 987, 992 (2000); <em>Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond, </em>369 Md. 304, 327, 799 A.2d 1264, 1278 (2002); <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 115, 695 A.2d 143, 149 (1997), quoting from <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555 (1992) (\u201cWe presume that the legislature intends its enactments \u2018to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Such a construction is also more consonant with the Congressional intent. Although the changes to \u00a7 1437f were certainly intended to allow landlords more flexibility and to bring some aspects of the voucher program more in line with both private residential leasing practices and with State landlord-tenant law, we do not believe that they were intended to subject voucher tenants to the arbitrary whims of landlords who are reaping a significant tax advantage from the program. If we were to conclude that the good cause requirement applies only to mid-term evictions and not to renewal decisions, the program would lose substantial stability, as tenants could be evicted for no reason at the end of a one-year lease or at any time thereafter on 60 days notice. That would hardly be consistent with the declared Congressional purpose of \u201caiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing.\u201d \u00a7 1437f(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The two statutes can easily be read harmoniously, with each other and with the overall Congressional purpose. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that, whatever term may be stated in the lease, a voucher program tenant may not be evicted by a landlord who has qualified for a \u00a7 42 tax credit and is continuing to receive rent subsidies, either during the term of the lease or at the expiration of that term, except for conduct or circumstances that qualify under the Federal law as good cause. We hold further, however, that neither \u00a7 42 nor \u00a7 1437f(o), as currently worded, preclude use of the State tenant holding over statute as a procedural mechanism to remove a tenant who is, indeed, holding over after the expiration of the term of his/her lease. To succeed under that statute, the landlord must comply with its terms and conditions <em>and </em>establish good cause for refusing to renew the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">\n<em>Existence of Good Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We thus come to the final question of whether respondent established sufficient facts to constitute good cause for its decision to terminate petitioner\u2019s month-to-month lease. Under Maryland Rule 8-131(c), we review the case on both the law and the evidence but do not set aside the judgment on the evidence unless the judgment is clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the ability of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">As we have indicated, the HUD regulations, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310(d), provide a non-exclusive list of conduct or circumstances that might establish good cause for terminating a lease. Among them is \u201c[a] family history of ... destruction of property, or of living or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the unit or premises.\u201d In this case, the Housing Authority inspector found petitioner\u2019s residence to be plagued with various maintenance problems \u2014 foul odors, apparently from a cat, holes in several walls, apparently caused by petitioner\u2019s children, dirty floors, walls, and kitchen appliances, inoperable smoke detectors, missing or torn screens\u2014 some of which dated back to 1998, only two years after she commenced occupancy. Petitioner admitted to most of the problems, and the court found them to exist. We do not find its ruling to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>JUDGMENT OF CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. <em>See </em>Marc Jolin, <em>Good Cause Eviction and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, </em>67 U.
