Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726, 728-729 (2001), and cases there cited. Nevertheless, there do not appear to be any disputed factual issues which are material to our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">On August 16, 2000, the Green Party qualified as a statutorily-recognized \u201cpolitical party\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in Maryland, after satisfying all of the requirements of Article 33, \u00a7 4-102.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ments included, <em>inter alia, </em>submitting a petition supporting the recognition of the Green Party bearing at least 10,000 signatures. See \u00a7 4-102(b)(2)(i). Those who signed this party-forming petition were neither required to be affiliated as Green Party members nor obligated to support future Green Party candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The Green Party then sought to nominate David M. Gross as its candidate for the November 2000 election for the United States House of Representatives in Maryland\u2019s first congressional district. Although the Election Code sets forth three procedures for a political party to nominate its candidates,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Green Party was limited to nomination via a <em>second </em>petition signed by at least <em>1% </em>of the total number of registered voters in that congressional district. This limitation was essentially the product of two factors: first, the Green Party was not a \u201cprincipal political party,\u201d and, second, less than <em>1% </em>of Maryland\u2019s voters were registered as members of the Green Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">On August 7, 2000, the Dave Gross for Congress campaign submitted a timely nominating petition containing 4,214 signatures of voters purporting to be registered in Maryland\u2019s first congressional district. On August 23, 2000, however, the Board notified the Green Party that Mr. Gross\u2019s name would not be included on the general election ballot because the nominating petition requirements had not been satisfied. The Board claimed that it could verify only 3,081 valid signatures, fewer than the 3,411 required by Maryland\u2019s 1% nomination petition requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A number of reasons were set forth by the Board for subtracting more than 1,100 signatures. Among these reasons, the Board claimed that many signatures were by \u201cinactive\u201d voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On September 5, 2000, the Green Party filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County alleging that several of Maryland\u2019s ballot access restrictions are unconstitutional. The Party sought declaratory and injunctive relief, relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Specifically, the Green Party asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Board\u2019s actions deprived the Green Party, the plaintiff voters, and the plaintiff candidate, of their rights under the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under various provisions of the Maryland Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Party also argued that such requirements violate international law and treaties of the United States. In addition, the Green Party sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Maryland\u2019s ballot access restrictions on third-party candidates and an order requiring the Board to place Mr. Gross\u2019s name on the ballot for the November 2000 general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">After a hearing on September 8, 2000, the Circuit Court denied the Green Party\u2019s motions for interim relief. The election then proceeded, with this case being placed on the regular docket of the Circuit Court. After filing its answer, the Board then filed a Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, for Summary Judgment. The Board argued that the case should be dismissed as moot because the election had already been held. In the alternative, the Board claimed that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate because there were no genuine issues of material fact. The Board argued that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to a declaration that (a) the Board\u2019s petition-validation procedures and the Board\u2019s actions in refusing to place Mr. Gross\u2019 name on the ballot were fully consistent with Maryland\u2019s election laws and (b) that the Board\u2019s actions were not in violation of any rights granted to the Green Party under Maryland or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On February 28, 2001, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County held that the Green Party\u2019s request for declaratory relief was not moot since the issues were \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 737 n. 8, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 1282 n. 8, 39 L.Ed.2d 714, 727-728 n. 8 (1974). Accordingly, the Circuit Coiirt denied the motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the Circuit Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Board, declaring that the Green Party \u201chas not shown that Maryland\u2019s election laws are unconstitutional pursuant to the United States Constitution, Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>land Constitution, or various international treaties.... \u201d The Circuit Court stated that, \u201c[sjince requirements more stringent than Maryland\u2019s requirement have been upheld, as a matter of law, Maryland\u2019s 1% requirement is constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The Green Party appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court. <em>Green Party v. Board of Elections, </em>365 Md. 472, 781 A.2d 778 (2001). We shall reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to the Circuit Court for the entry of a declaratory judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Numerous issues under the federal and state constitutions have been debated by the parties both in the Circuit Court and in this Court. We need not and shall not decide any of the issues raised under the federal constitution or federal law. Our holdings in this case, that certain provisions in the Maryland Election Code and practices by the Board are invalid, shall be based entirely upon Article I of the Maryland Constitution and Articles 7 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 618 n. 6, 805 A.2d 1061, 1069-1070 n. 6 (2002) (\u201cAs pointed out in <em>Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 313-314 n. 3, 761 A.2d 324, 332 n. 3 (2000), by not reaching the federal constitutional issues \u201cwe do not suggest that the result in this case would be any different if the sole issue were whether the [statutes] violated the federal Constitution. We simply are making it clear that our decision is based exclusively upon the [Maryland Constitution] and is in no way dependent upon the federal [Constitution]\u2019). <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1041, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3476, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1214 (1983); <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 86 n. 11, 741 A.2d 1162, 1189 n. 11 (1999).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">An important issue raised in this case, but not covered by the Circuit Court\u2019s declaratory judgment, concerns the \u201cinac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tive\u201d voters whose signatures were not counted. The Board acknowledges that it invalidated numerous signatures by \u201cinactive\u201d voters, that is, formerly registered voters whose names had been placed on \u201cinactive voter registration\u201d lists. The precise number of these invalidations is not disclosed by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Board\u2019s purported authority for disqualifying the signatures stems from the Election Code and the Board\u2019s corresponding regulations in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR). These provisions create <em>two </em>voter registries for any particular area: one for active voters and another for \u201cinactive\u201d voters. They further provide that anyone whose name appears on the inactive voter registry will not have his or her signature counted if it appears on a petition. Moreover, Art. 33, \u00a7 1-101(gg), states that the term \u201cregistered voter\u201d in the Election Code \u201cdoes not include an individual whose name is on the list of inactive voters.\u201d Some of these provisions, and the Board\u2019s practices in applying them, are inconsistent with the voter qualifications and the right to vote set forth in Article I of the Maryland Constitution and Articles 7 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights^ Before addressing in detail the Election Code provisions and the Board\u2019s practices, we shall first review some of the state constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The Maryland Constitution prescribes the <em>exclusive </em>and <em>uniform </em>qualifications for being on the list of registered voters and being entitled to vote.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The right to vote is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>conferred upon any United States citizen, age eighteen or older, who is a Maryland resident, and who is not disqualified by a criminal conviction or mental disability. Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights emphasizes that \u201cevery citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution\u201d has \u201cthe right of suffrage.\u201d Furthermore, Article I, \u00a7 1, mandates that, once entitled to vote in the election district of his or her residence, a qualified voter <em>remains </em>entitled to vote in that district until he or she \u201cshall have acquired a residence in another election district....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Article I, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution and Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights underscore three significant points applicable to the instant case. First, the right to vote is not subject to expiration for voter inactivity or for any other non-constitutional qualification. Second, a qualified voter who moves from one residence to another within the same election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>district remains fully qualified. Third, a qualified voter who may be in the process of moving from one election district into another remains qualified to vote in his or her original district until the change in domicile is fully effective.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 242, 24 A. 606, 608 (1892) (Bryan, J. concurring) (\u201cA voter who has resided six months in a legislative district ... and then moves into another legislative district cannot vote in this second district until he has resided therein for the space of six months; but in the meantime he is a legal voter in the district from which he removed\u201d). <em>See also Oglesby v. Williams, </em>372 Md. 360, 812 A.2d 1061 (2002) (the constitutional requirement of residence for political or voting purposes is one of a place of fixed, present domicile, which, once established, is presumed to continue until superseded by a new domicile).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution requires the General Assembly to provide a system of \u201cuniform Registration\u201d of the names of all qualified voters. Specifically, \u00a7 2 imposes three important limitations on the creation and management of the voter registry. First, it commands the General Assembly to create the registry under the specific terms set forth in the section. Second, it requires a <em>uniform </em>registration of the names of all the voters possessing the qualifications set forth in \u00a7 1 and not disqualified under \u00a7 4. Finally, it states that such registration \u201cshall be conclusive evidence\u201d of the registered voter\u2019s right to vote. Thus, \u00a7 2 contemplates a <em>single </em>registry for a particular area, containing the names of <em>all </em>qualified voters, leaving the General Assembly no discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion to decide who may or may not be listed therein, no discretion to create a second registry for \u201cinactive\u201d voters, and no authority to decree that an \u201cinactive\u201d voter is not a \u201cregistered voter\u201d with all the rights of a registered voter. Furthermore, \u00a7 2 provides that, once registered, the registration shall be \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence of the right to vote. In other words, the Maryland Constitution does not require anything more from the voter on election day. If the Board later discovers that the voter has voted illegally, \u00a7 5 calls for criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Disqualification from the right to vote in Maryland is limited to voters who either are convicted of infamous or other serious crimes or who are under care or guardianship for a mental disability. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bixler, </em>62 Md. 354 (1884) (holding that this section refers to such crimes that were \u201cinfamous\u201d at common law). Nowhere in Article I does it state or suggest that voting rarely, sporadically, or infrequently, are grounds for being stricken from the uniform registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In <em>State Administrative Board of Election Laws v. Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City, </em>342 Md. 586, 679 A.2d 96 (1996) (hereinafter referred to as <em>\u201cSABEL </em>\u201d), this Court declared unequivocally that being a frequent or active voter is not a valid requirement for voting in Maryland. The <em>SABEL </em>case dealt with a change in Maryland\u2019s Election Code from the repealed Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, which had directed local boards to purge inactive voters annually,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to its replacement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00a7 3-17A, which limited removal from voter rolls to cases where the voter (a) requested to be removed, or (b) was ineligible under Article I, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution, or (c) had died, or (d) had moved away. <em>See SABEL, </em>342 Md. at 589-591, notes 1-2, 679 A.2d at 97-99 notes 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Referring to the qualifications listed in Article I, \u00a7 1, of the Maryland Constitution, and the limitations listed in Article I, \u00a7 4, the <em>SABEL </em>opinion stated (342 Md. at 599, 679 A.2d at 102):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThese prerequisites are the exclusive qualifications for voting in Maryland. <em>See </em>Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u2018every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage\u2019); <em>Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, 594, 195 A. 576, 584 (1937); <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 24 A. 606 (1892). <em>See also Board v. Goodsell, </em>284 Md. 279, 283, 396 A.2d 1033, 1035 (1978). Moreover, the General Assembly may neither expand nor curtail the qualifications necessary to vote. <em>See, e.g., Langhammer v. Munter, </em>80 Md. 518, 527, 31 A. 300, 301-302 (1895) (\u2018But whatever may be done, no restrictions can be imposed that will require other or different qualifications for voting, than those prescribed by the first Article of the Constitution of the State\u2019); <em>Southerland v. Norris, </em>74 Md. 326, 328, 22 A. 137, 137 (1891) (\u2018These qualifications [for voting in Maryland], fixed by the organic law, can neither be enlarged nor curtailed by the General Assembly\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-b\">Accordingly, we continued, \u201chaving voted frequently in the past is not a qualification for voting and, under the Maryland Constitution, could not be a qualification.\u201d <em>SABEL, supra, </em>342 Md. at 599, 679 A.2d at 102. The <em>SABEL </em>opinion then emphasized that \u201cthe sole purpose of former \u00a7 3-20, as well as present \u00a7 3-17A, was to set forth a procedure or remedy by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>which election boards could remove from the voter registration rolls the names of persons who had died, moved away, or incurred a voting disability under Article I, \u00a7 4, of the [Maryland] Constitution.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We further stated that \u00a7 3-17A was a more narrowly tailored procedure than the one set forth in former \u00a7 3-20. <em>See </em>342 Md. at 599-600, 679 A.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">These conclusions were reiterated by this Court the following year, in <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, </em>345 Md. 477, 502-503, 693 A.2d 757, 770 (1997). In that case, a group of citizens filed a petition to bring a zoning ordinance to referendum, but the local election board determined that the petition lacked the requisite number of signatures. In a reversal of roles, it was the persons filing the petition, not the Board, who argued that inactive voters should be stricken from the rolls in order to lower the total number of registered voters, making it easier for their petition to meet the 20% signature requirement. The Court squarely rejected their argument, relying upon our earlier decision in <em>SABEL, supra, </em>342 Md. 586, 679 A.2d 96, and stating that, \u201c[i]n no event should [the inactive voters\u2019] names be removed from the voter registration list.\u201d <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, supra, </em>345 Md. at 504, 693 A.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Against this background, however, the Maryland Election Code provides for a separate inactive voter registration list and sanctions removal from that registry for voters whose names have remained on the inactive voter registration list for a specified period of time. As earlier mentioned, Title 1 of the Election Code, in \u00a7 1-101(gg), excludes an individual whose name appears on the inactive voter registry from the definition of \u201cregistered voter.\u201d Section 1-101(gg) is obviously inconsistent with Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, of the Maryland Constitution, and Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights, which set forth the qualifications for voters and provide for a single uniform voter registration list which is conclusive evidence of the right to vote. This is significant in the present case because \u00a7 6-203(b), addressing validation of petitions, states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that \u201c[t]he signature of an individual shall be validated and counted if ... [t]he individual is a registered voter in the county specified.\u201d Since persons on the \u201cinactive\u201d voter registry are not deemed registered voters, their signatures are not counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Title 3 of the Election Code, which addresses voter registration generally, states that registration is permanent unless it is cancelled pursuant to the provisions of Title 3. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-101(d)(2). Section 3-502 lists the circumstances under which an election official may remove a voter from the registry. Under that section, a voter may be removed only if the voter requests to be removed, is ineligible under the disqualifications enumerated in \u00a7 3-102(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has died, or has moved away.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The circumstances set forth in \u00a7 3-502 are constitutionally valid bases for removal from the voter registration list. Nonetheless, the Board\u2019s practice of creating a separate \u201cinactive voter\u201d registration for voters whom it suspects might have moved out of an election district, and the Board\u2019s subsequent removal of such \u201cinactive voters\u201d from that registration list without affirmative proof that the voter has, in fact, moved to a <em>different </em>election district, cannot be squared with the constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As was represented in oral arguments before us, the local boards customarily mail out a sample ballot to registered voters prior to an election. If the sample ballot is returned by the postal service, this prompts the local board to send the voter in question a \u201cconfirmation notice\u201d under \u00a7 3-504(c). In relevant part, \u00a7 3-504(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201c(c) <em>Change of address outside the county. </em>\u2014 If it appears from information provided by the postal service or an agency specified in \u00a7 3-505(b) ... that a voter has moved to a different address outside the county, the election director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>shall send the voter a confirmation notice informing the voter of his or her potential inactive status as described in subsection (f) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Although the above-quoted statute provides for the sending of a confirmation notice only when the postal service provides information that the voter has moved <em>outside the county, </em>at oral argument we were informed that, in practice, a confirmation notice may be sent whenever the sample ballot is returned by the postal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Under \u00a7 3 \u2014 504(f)(1), a voter\u2019s failure to respond to the confirmation notice triggers his or her placement on the \u201cinactive voter\u201d registration list. Once placed on the inactive voter registration list, the voter must then submit a written affirmation that he or she in fact remains a resident of the same county in order to be allowed to vote and in order to be restored to the regular voter registration list. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-504(f)(2). Without such a written affirmation, if the voter simply fails to vote in the next two elections, the now-inactive voter is removed from the inactive voter registration list. Regardless of such voter\u2019s constitutional qualifications under Article I, \u00a7 1, he or she is removed from both registration lists. Thus, \u00a7 3 \u2014 504(f)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201c(f) <em>Inactive </em>list.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201c(3) An inactive voter who fails to vote in an election in the period ending with the second general election shall be removed from the registry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">This language is reiterated in \u00a7 3-504(e)(2), addressing the local election director\u2019s discretion to remove a voter from the registry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201c(e) <em>Removal from registry. </em>\u2014 The election director may not remove a voter from the registry on the grounds of a change of address unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">(1) The voter confirms in writing that the voter has changed residence to a location outside the county in which the voter is registered; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">(2) (i)- The voter has failed to respond to the confirmation notice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">(ii) The voter has not voted or appeared to vote (and, if necessary, corrected the record of the voter\u2019s address) in an election during the period beginning with the date of the notice through the next two general elections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Nevertheless, under Title 3, subtitle 6 of the Election Code, which deals with the resolution of registration disputes and challenges, a presumption arises that a voter is properly registered unless there is <em>affirmative proof </em>to show otherwise. Section 3-602(e)(2) states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201c(e) <em>Hearing decision. </em>\u2014 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(2) An individual may not be removed from the registry unless the individual\u2019s ineligibility is <em>substantiated by affirmative proof. </em>In the absence of such proof, the presumption shall be that the individual is properly registered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">This presumption is reiterated in \u00a7 3-603(c), which addresses judicial review of a decision rendered in a hearing by a local board. That section provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">\u201c(c) <em>Determination of residency. </em>\u2014 In determining whether an individual is or is not a resident of an election district or precinct, the presumption shall be that an individual shown to have acquired a residence in one locality <em>retains </em>that residence until it is <em>affirmatively </em>shown that the individual has acquired a residence elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">These presumptions reflect the mandate in Article I, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution, that \u201c[a] person once entitled to vote in any election district, shall be entitled to vote there until he shall have acquired a residence in another election district or ward in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>There is an obvious conflict between the passive form of \u201cproof* that the local boards rely on, under \u00a7\u00a7 3-504(e) and (f), to place individuals on inactive voter registration lists and ultimately to remove them from any voter registration list, and the requirement for affirmative proof of the voter\u2019s change in residence set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 3 \u2014 602(e)(2) and 3-603(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">It is not difficult to think of situations where the present confirmation notice practice to \u201cprove\u201d that voters have moved out of an election district could go awry. Under the current practice, confirmation notices are sent whenever the postal service returns a sample ballot. But the sample ballot might be returned because the voter has moved to another residence in the same election district, or is on vacation, or refuses to accept the mailed material, or for other reasons. Similarly, the confirmation notices may go unanswered for any number of legitimate reasons, including the voter being elsewhere on vacation, mistaking the notice for election-related campaign literature or junk mail and not reading it, or simply forgetting to respond to it. Interestingly, \u00a7 3-504(e), discussed <em>supra, </em>limits an election director\u2019s discretion to remove a voter from the registry on the grounds of a change of address to two alternative scenarios. Under the first scenario, described in \u00a7 3-504(e)(1), the director may remove a voter who confirms in writing that he or she has changed his or her residence to a location outside the county in which he or she was originally registered. This would satisfy the requirement for affirmative proof of a change in domicile. The second scenario under \u00a7 3-504(e)(2), however, authorizes a voter\u2019s removal for inaction which might be caused by numerous factors other than moving to a different election district.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In addition to the threat of being wholly disenfranchised, an inactive voter will not be counted as part of the registry nor will his or her signature be counted for the purpose of verifying petition signatures. In addition to the previously mentioned effect of \u00a7 1-101(gg), \u00a7\u00a7 3 \u2014 504(f)(4) and (5) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201c(f) <em>Inactive </em>list.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201c(4) Individuals whose names have been placed on the inactive list may not be counted as part of the registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201c(5) Registrants placed on the inactive list shall be counted only for purposes of voting and not for official administrative purposes as petition signature verification____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Therefore, \u00a7\u00a7 1-101(gg) and 3 \u2014 504(f) creates a group of \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d comprised of persons who are \u201cinactive\u201d voters and thus not eligible to sign petitions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Not only does this scheme violate Article I of the Maryland Constitution, but it also seems flatly inconsistent with the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, which we discuss in some detail in Part IV of this opinion, <em>infra. </em>In addition, <em>see Board v. Goodsell, </em>284 Md. 279, 288-293, 396 A.2d 1033, 1038-1040 (1979); <em>O.C. Taxpayers v. Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 594-596, 375 A.2d 541, 547-548 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In addition, the dual registration system and the treatment of inactive voters are antithetical to the thrust of Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which safeguards \u201cthe right of the People to participate in the Legislature,\u201d the right of \u201cevery citizen having the qualifications\u201d of Article I also having \u201cthe right of suffrage,\u201d as well as ensuring that \u201celections ... be free and frequent.\u201d As the Green Party correctly points out, Article 7 has been held to be even more protective of rights of political participation than the provisions of the federal Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, 195 A. 576 (1937) (protecting the right to vote for the candidate of one\u2019s choice by requiring that there be a space on the ballot in which a voter may write the name of his choice). <em>See also Munsell v. Hennegan, </em>182 Md. 15, 22, 31 A.2d 640, 644 (1943) (\u201cThe weight of authority ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that electors should have the fullest opportunity to vote for candidates of any political party, and while this right, in cases where the public furnishes the ballots, may be restricted by the dictates of common sense, and by considerations of convenience in the size of the ballots, and by considerations of excessive costs, such restrictions will not be upheld when they are destructive of freedom of choice by the voters\u201d). It seems clear that, if the only method left open for the members of a political party to choose their candidates is via petition, then the right to have one\u2019s signature counted on a nominating petition is integral to that political party member\u2019s right of suffrage. There is no constitutional reason why a once-qualified registered voter, who chooses not to vote frequently, should find his or her right to take part in the nomination process curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Moreover, for the same reasons that we have held unconstitutional \u00a7\u00a7 1-101(gg), 3 \u2014 504(e)(2), 3-504(f)(1), 3-504(f)(3), 3 \u2014 504(f)(4), and 3-504(f)(5), we also invalidate CO-MAR 33.05.07.03(D) (2002). Section 6-207(b) of the Election Code authorizes the State Board to promulgate regulations to establish a process for verifying petition signatures. Under regulation .03(B), a voter who is rendered \u201cinactive\u201d by the Board\u2019s assumption that the voter moved out of his or her election district may become reinstated for voting purposes by listing the original address next to his or her signature on a nominating petition. <em>See </em>COMAR 33.05.07.03(B). Nevertheless, despite the voter\u2019s reinstatement into the \u201cactive\u201d registry, regulation .03(D) cautions that \u201c[i]n all events, the signature of the inactive voter may not be counted for purposes of the petition itself.\u201d COMAR 33.05.07.03(D). Hence, a constitutionally-qualified voter can, by signing a nominating petition, confirm that his or her address never changed, but cannot have his or her signature counted by reason of the Board\u2019s mistaken assumption that the address did change. As stated above, eliminating a qualified voter\u2019s only option to nominate a candidate is not consistent with state constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Furthermore, the practice of having a separate registry of inactive voters invites unnecessary confusion and the specter of statistical manipulation. If inactive voters are not counted for petition purposes, then consistency would demand that they cannot be counted among the total number of voters which the percentage signature requirement is based upon. <em>But cf. Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, supra, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757. For instance, if the total number of registered voters in an election district is 11,000, but 1000 of these voters are on the inactive registration list, then a one percent signature requirement would apparently direct a petition-circulator to obtain 100 signatures, or 1% of 10,000. On the other hand, if inactive voters\u2019 names are permitted to appear on petitions, then, in the example above, the circulator must collect 110 signatures to meet the requirement of 1% of 11,000. Moreover, since state election officials transmit voter turnout statistics in terms of a percentage of the <em>active </em>voter turnout only, this can lead to bizarre outcomes, such as having a voter turnout of more than 100%. <em>See </em>Larry Carson, <em>\u201cInactives\u201d Don\u2019t Figure in State\u2019s Voter Count, </em>Balt. Sun, Nov. 13, 2002, at 1B. This confusion would not arise if the Board maintained one uniform registry, as required by Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In conclusion, we stress that the Maryland Constitution sets forth the <em>exclusive </em>qualifications and restrictions on the right to vote in the State of Maryland. The Legislature may not impose additional qualifications or restrictions by requiring voters to cast their votes frequently. Nor may the Board regulate the registry to effect such unconstitutional ends. Additionally, insofar as a minor political party\u2019s only option to nominate a candidate is through the process of submitting nomination petitions, a scheme which improperly invalidates a registered voter\u2019s signature on a nominating petition unconstitutionally infringes on the right of suffrage guaranteed to all qualified voters by Article I of the Maryland Constitution and Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that any statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>provision or administrative regulation which treats \u201cinactive\u201d voters differently from \u201cactive\u201d voters is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Green Party does not contend that the 1% signature requirement for a candidate nominating petition <em>alone </em>is unconstitutional. Rather, the Green Party urges that the <em>combination </em>of requirements applicable to minor political parties does not pass constitutional muster. Among other things, the Green Party argues that, by requiring only minor political parties to make a double-showing of support, Maryland\u2019s Election Code creates a discriminatory classification in violation of equal protection principles under both the federal and Maryland constitutions. The Green Party asserts that, once a group has submitted the required 10,000 signatures to receive official recognition as a political party, it has demonstrated a \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and no further showing of support should be necessary for the name of a minor political party\u2019s candidate to be on. the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The Board asserts that the Green Party\u2019s challenge is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the challenge brought in <em>Jenness v. Fortson, </em>403 U.S. 431, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971) (upholding a 5% signature requirement on a candidate-nominating petition), and that \u201cthe Green Party has cited no case disputing the essential holding in that case \u2014 that a state may constitutionally require ... [a] minor party candidate to demonstrate a significant modicum of public support, in the form of a nominating petition bearing signatures of 5% of the relevant electorate, before placing the candidate\u2019s name on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ballot.\u201d (Respondents\u2019 brief at 16-17). The Board argues that this case is governed by <em>Jenness </em>and that, therefore, the Board is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The Board has not called to our attention any opinion by this Court which supports the result it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The Circuit Court in the case at bar applied the analysis set forth in <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 1569, 75 L.Ed.2d 547, 557 (1983), and relied on other United States Supreme Court precedents upholding nominating petition requirements. The requirements in those cases, however, are quite distinguishable from the scheme in the instant case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Circuit Court in this case reasoned as follows (some internal citations omitted, and parallel citations added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\"><em>\u201cAnderson </em>states that there must be some regulation of elections \u2018if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes.\u2019 <em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 1569, 75 L.Ed.2d 547, 557 (1983). Likewise, the state has a right to require candidates to make a preliminary showing of substantial support. <em>See Anderson, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 788 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. at 1570 n. 9, 75 L.Ed.2d at 557 n. 9. \u2018It is both wasteful and confusing to encumber the ballot with the names of frivolous candidates.\u2019 <em>Ibid. </em>The state\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory regulations. <em>See Anderson, supra, </em>460 U.S. at 788, 103 S.Ct. at 1570, 75 L.Ed.2d at 557.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cAdministrative convenience readily falls under the rubric of a state\u2019s \u2018regulatory interests,\u2019 the importance of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized. <em>Wood v. Meadows, </em>207 F.3d 708, 715 (4th Cir.2000). The Court has expressly approved a state\u2019s interest in limiting the number of candidates on the ballot. <em>Id. </em>The state\u2019s important interest in showing public support along with limiting confusion has been repeatedly held as legitimate and even compelling. These interests have supported nominating petition requirements similar to or more stringent than Maryland\u2019s 1% requirement. <em>See California Democratic Party v. Jones, </em>530 U.S. 567, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cMaryland\u2019s ballot access requirement of 1% is less stringent than what has already been upheld by the Supreme Court. <em>See American Party of Texas v. White, </em>415 U.S. 767, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974) (Demanding signatures equal in number to 3% or 5% of the vote in the last election is not invalid on its face). The Supreme Court, in <em>Jenness v. Fortson, </em>upheld Georgia\u2019s petition requirement of 5%. The Court stated that, while 5% may be somewhat higher than what is required in other states, when coupled with the fact that Georgia has imposed no arbitrary restrictions upon the eligibility of any registered voter to sign a petition, that number is constitutional. <em>Jenness, </em>403 U.S. at 438-439, 442, 91 S.Ct. at 1974, 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d at 560-561, 562. Plaintiffs have not alleged that any other provision of the Maryland election law is unconstitutional except for the 1% petition requirement. Since requirements more stringent than Maryland\u2019s requirement have been upheld, as a matter of law, Maryland\u2019s <em>1% </em>requirement is constitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Board claims that <em>Jenness </em>and its progeny are \u201cprecisely on point.\u201d We disagree. The statutory scheme challenged in <em>Jenness </em>is clearly distinguishable from Maryland\u2019s requirements for the nomination of minor political party candidates. Under Georgia\u2019s election statute, there was no need for a fledgling political group to submit an initial party-forming petition in order to become a recognized \u201cpolitical body.\u201d If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>political group had not garnered 20% or more of the vote in the previous state-wide election, it was automatically granted the status of being a recognized \u201cpolitical body\u201d and could choose its candidates by petition. As Justice Stewart explained in <em>Jenness, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 433, 91 S.Ct. at 1971-1972, 29 L.Ed.2d at 557-558 (emphasis supplied and footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201cThe basic structure of the pertinent provisions of the Georgia Election Code is relatively uncomplicated. Any political organization whose candidate received 20% or more of the vote at the most recent gubernatorial or presidential election is a \u2018political party.\u2019 <em>Any other political organization is a \u2018political body. \u2019 </em>\u2018Political parties\u2019 conduct primary elections, regulated in detail by state law, and only the name of the candidate for each office who wins this primary election is printed on the ballot at the subsequent general election, as his party\u2019s nominee for the office in question. <em>A nominee of a \u2018political body\u2019 ... on the other hand, may have his name printed on the ballot at the general election by filing a nominating petition. </em>This petition must be signed by \u2018a number of electors of not less than five per cent, of the total number of electors eligible to vote in the last election for the filling of the office the candidate is seeking....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">As pointed out above, the Green Party\u2019s challenge involves more than just an objection to the 1% nominating petition requirement alone. The Green Party challenges the <em>combination </em>of requirements applicable to minor political parties, maintaining that, even if the State has a legitimate interest in showing public support and limiting confusion on the ballot, these interests are satisfied by submitting the initial party-forming petition signed by 10,000 Maryland voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In our view, the Election Code\u2019s two-tiered petitioning requirement for minor parties discriminates against minor political parties in violation of the equal protection component <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. As earlier discussed, we shall not address the federal constitutional issues debated by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">\u201cThat no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or dis-seized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>Frankel v.

For instance, if a Democrat runs unopposed in the Democratic Party\u2019s primary election, he or she will become the Democratic candidate on the general election ballot even if that candidate receives only one vote at the primary. The Maryland statutes provide that candidate nomination by primary is only available to two political parties: the \u201cpolitical party whose candidate for Governor received the highest number of votes ... at the last preceding general election\u201d and to the \u201cpolitical party whose candidate for Governor received the second highest number of votes ... at the last preceding general election.\u201d <em>See supra </em>n. 5; \u00a7 8-202(a)(1)(i) and \u00a7\u00a7 1-101(ee), (w), and (dd). Therefore, the requisite \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d for a principal political party\u2019s candidate <em>is derivative of his or her party\u2019s support at the last preceding general election. </em>This is so even if the principal political party\u2019s current candidate is new to the political scene or did not run in the last preceding general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>election. The candidate of a \u201cprincipal party\u201d does not have to show any personal \u201cmodicum of support\u201d to be on the general election ballot; the \u201cmodicum of support\u201d is the prior support of the party itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">On the other hand, primary elections are completely closed to minor political parties,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and nomination by convention is limited to minor political parties who can establish that 1% of Maryland\u2019s registered voters are affiliated with the minor party.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the only option left for other minor political party candidates to be nominated is by petition signed by not less than 1% of the total number of registered voters who are eligible to vote for the office for which the nomination by petition is sought. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-703(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The requisite 1% showing of support is <em>in addition </em>to the initial showing of support which the minor political party has already demonstrated upon submitting its party-forming petition containing the signatures of 10,000 voters. Unlike the candidate of a principal political party whose \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d is based on his or her party\u2019s support at the last preceding gubernatorial election, the minor party\u2019s candidate may not derive the required quantum of support from his or her party\u2019s support in its party-formation petition. And, unlike the unaffiliated, independent candidate who must only submit <em>one </em>petition signed by 1% of the registered voters eligible to vote for the office in question, <em>see </em>\u00a7 5-701(2)(ii), a minor political party must submit <em>two </em>separate petitions before it can run a candidate for office in a general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The Board attempts to explain this discrepancy by stating (respondents\u2019 brief at 8, 22-23, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cEven though the Green Party submitted more than 10,000 valid signatures of Maryland voters who agreed to support the recognition of the Party, <em>this does not mean that ... any particular Green Party candidate mil have the support of a significant number of Maryland voters. </em>Those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>signed the party-forming petition were not required to ... pledge their support for future party candidates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cSurely the State of Maryland need not assume that, merely because a potential candidate is endorsed by a small, though recognized, political party, that candidate must necessarily have \u2018a significant modicum of support\u2019 among Maryland voters. * * * For these reasons, it is completely reasonable for the State to require a nominating petition to show that any particular candidate of a party with which fewer than 1% of the State\u2019s voters are affiliated has a \u2018significant modicum of support.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is, however, equally true that an unopposed Democratic or Republican primary nominee may not necessarily have the support of a significant number of Maryland voters merely because his or her party has chosen that particular candidate to run in his or her party\u2019s primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">As we noted in <em>Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Goodsell, supra, </em>284 Md. at 286, 396 A.2d at 1036, \u201c[t]he first step in dealing with a contention that a particular classification denies to members of one class the equal protection of the laws is to determine the appropriate standard for reviewing the classification.\u201d In <em>Hombeck v. Somerset County Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 640-641, 458 A.2d 758, 781 (1983), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cIt is well recognized that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law is afforded to all persons under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their civil and personal rights. <em>Leonardo v.

Goodsell, supra, </em>is particularly helpful in our analysis. That case dealt with a candidate, Vincent F. Goodsell, who desired to run for the office of County Executive of Prince George\u2019s County. The Board of Elections for Prince George\u2019s County refused to place his name on the ballot, claiming that the County Charter required a County Executive candidate to have been a \u2018qualified\u2019 voter of Prince George\u2019s County for at least five years immediately preceding his election and that Goodsell had not met this requirement. Although Goodsell had resided within the county for more than five years prior to filing for office, he had been registered to vote there for just over two years. He argued that if the County Charter required that a candidate be a <em>registered </em>voter for the five years immediately preceding the election, then such requirement would violate equal protection principles by discriminating against residents of Prince George\u2019s County who had not been registered to vote for five years. The Board argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pursuit of public office is not a fundamental right, that, therefore, the rational basis test should apply, and that there was a rational basis for the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Quoting from <em>Bullock v. Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 143, 92 S.Ct. 849, 856, 31 L.Ed.2d 92, 99-100 (1972), the <em>Goodsell </em>Court acknowledged (284 Md. at 287, 396 A.2d at 1037, internal quotations and citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201c \u2018[T]he rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation; laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters. Of course, not every limitation or incidental burden on the exercise of voting rights is subject to a stringent standard of review____ Texas does not place a condition on the exercise of the right to vote, nor does it quantitatively dilute votes that have been cast. Rather, the Texas system creates barriers to candidate access to the primary ballot, thereby tending to limit the field of candidates from which voters might choose. The existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>such barriers does not of itself compel close scrutiny ____ <em>In approaching candidate restrictions, it is essential to examine in a realistic light the extent and nature of their impact on voters.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cThe <em>[Bullock </em>] Court then stated that ... many potential office seekers would as a practical matter be precluded from running for office, that the effect on voters is neither incidental nor remote, and that the voters are substantially limited in their choice of candidates. Because of this impact upon voter choice, the Court concluded that the Texas filing requirements were subject to the same \u2018close scrutiny\u2019 test which is applicable to laws placing barriers upon the right to vote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\"><em>See also Hargrove v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>310 Md. at 426, 529 A.2d at 1382 (\u201c[T]he constitutional right to be a candidate for elective office is a corollary of the constitutional protection of the elective franchise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">As we noted in <em>Goodsell, supra, </em>284 Md. at 288, 396 A.2d at 1037-1038, \u201c \u2018the extent and nature of the impact on voters, examined in a realistic light, is the key to the\u2019 appropriate standard for judicial review,\u201d quoting <em>Henderson v. Fort Worth Independent Sch. Dist., </em>526 F.2d 286, 291 (5th Cir. 1976). It seems clear that, not unlike the exorbitant filing fees in <em>Bullock v. Carter, </em>or the five year registration requirement in <em>Goodsell, </em>the double petitioning requirement set forth by the Maryland Election Code denies ballot access to a significant number of minor political party candidates. On that basis, the challenged statutory provisions\u2019 impact on voters is substantial. Consequently, the provisions challenged in the instant case must withstand a higher degree of scrutiny than the so-called \u201crational basis test.\u201d It is incumbent upon the Board to show that the two-tiered petitioning requirement imposed upon minor political parties is \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of legitimate\u2019 governmental objectives, ... or \u2018necessary to promote a <em>compelling </em>governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goodsell, supra, </em>284 Md. at 289, 396 A.2d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The Board argues that it has \u201carticulated legitimate State interests to justify Maryland\u2019s 1% nominating petition requirement. * * * [T]he primary interest served by Maryland\u2019s nominating petition requirement is to show public support for the nominee.\u201d (Respondents\u2019 brief at 29-30). The Board also advances \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in limiting the number of candidates on the ballot so as to avoid confusion and avoiding a ballot overloaded with the names of \u2018frivolous\u2019 candidates having virtually no support among the voters.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 30).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">These interests, however, are satisfied by the initial party-forming petition requiring 10,000 signatures alone. In this case, the Board required the Green Party to submit an initial petition listing the signatures of 10,000 Maryland voters, followed by a second petition containing <em>less signatures, </em>namely 3,411, representing 1% of the registered voters in the first congressional district. If many of the 10,000 initial petition signers were from the first congressional district, nothing prevents the same voters from signing the second petition. It is difficult to comprehend how the second petitioning requirement adds very much more, in the way of showing public support, to the first petitioning requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Furthermore, an unaffiliated, independent candidate need only submit one petition bearing the signatures of 1% of the registered voters in the district for the office sought, and that single petitioning requirement is deemed to show a sufficient modicum of support. The additional burden of two petitioning requirements for a minor party candidate, and the requirement that a greater modicum of support be shown, is not justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The 10,000 signature petitioning requirement initially imposed upon minor political parties sufficiently prevents the ballot from being overloaded with \u201cfrivolous\u201d candidates. \u201cRegardless, in a democracy, the appropriate judges of which candidates are frivolous, and which candidates have the greater commitment ... are the voters on election day.\u201d <em>Goodsell, supra, </em>284 Md. at 290, 396 A.2d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>For the reasons stated above, we hold that the second petitioning requirement applicable to minor political parties\u2019 candidates discriminates against those parties and candidates in violation of the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">.

I disagree, however, with Part IV of the opinion, where the Majority concludes that the State\u2019s double petition requirement for minor political parties and their candidates violates the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Requiring a <em>political organization </em>to petition statewide to achieve status as a minor political party and then requiring a <em>candidate of that minor political party </em>to petition to obtain at least the signatures of 1% of the registered voters in the geographical district from which he or she intends to run for office in order to appear on the ballot is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">When the State\u2019s classification is asserted to infringe on a fundamental right or interest, the Court should analyze the matter according to a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard. <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 705-06, 426 A.2d 929, 941-42 (1981). In order for a statute or regulation to withstand equal protection scrutiny under the strict scrutiny standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the State must show that the law is \u201cnecessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 706, 426 A.2d at 941 <em>(quoting Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 634, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1331, 22 L.Ed.2d 600, 615). If a fundamental right is not at issue, then the standard of review is the \u201crational basis\u201d test, a notably less strict standard. As the Majority points out, when a court is dealing with political candidate restrictions, it must examine the extent and nature of the impact on the voters to determine the appropriate standard of review. Majority op. 377 Md. at 162-63, 832 A.2d at 235. Although it is debatable whether the Majority is correct in concluding that the petition requirement has a substantial impact on voters, under either test Maryland\u2019s double petition requirement should be found constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Because the equal protection guarantees found in the federal constitution and Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights are considered \u201cin pari materia,\u201d federal case law which interprets the federal equal protection clause is instructive here. <em>See Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 714, 426 A.2d at 946. Although the Majority is correct in noting that Article 24 and the federal Equal Protection Clause are independent provisions which are capable of differing interpretations (Majority, op. 377 Md. at 158, 832 A.2d at 232), in actual application this Court has interpreted Article 24 to apply \u201cin like manner and to the same extent as the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 704, 426 A.2d at 941 <em>(quoting United States Mortgage Co. v. Matthews, </em>167 Md. 383, 395, 173 A. 903, 909 (1934)). In fact, in <em>Bureau of Mines v. George\u2019s Creek, </em>this Court explained that it is well established that \u201cthe decisions of the Supreme Court on the Fourteenth Amendment are practically direct authorities\u201d for this purpose. 272 Md. 143, 156, 321 A.2d 748, 755 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In its analysis, the Majority does not seem to dispute the fact that the State has a legitimate interest in regulating the quantity and quality of the candidates who appear on its ballots. Majority op. 377 Md. at 144-45, 832 A.2d 224. This is in line with the reasoning of the Supreme Court, which has held repeatedly that states have a compelling interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>preventing ballots from being overrun with candidates, the effects of which include voter confusion and frivolous candidacies. <em>See Lubin v. Panish, </em>415 U.S. 709, 715, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 1319, 39 L.Ed.2d 702, 708 (1974) (describing the State\u2019s interest in managing its ballot as one of the highest order). To this end, the Supreme Court has declared that a state is permitted to require candidates to demonstrate \u201ca significant modicum of support\u201d before being placed on the ballot. <em>See Jenness v. Fortson, </em>403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 554, 562; <em>see also American Party v. White, </em>415 U.S. 767, 783, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 1307, 39 L.Ed.2d 744, 761 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Just as the Majority does not dispute a state\u2019s right to require a showing of a \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d in order to gain ballot access, it also does not contest that the 1% of registered voters signature requirement in a given geographical district for a nomination petition is itself unconstitutional. Instead, what the Majority rejects is the combination of the petition requirements because it feels that the double petition requirement subjects minor political party candidates to two showings of support, where the same is not true of independent candidates or candidates of the two current and long standing major political parties. Majority op. 377 Md. at 164-65, 832 A.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Majority\u2019s analysis of the State\u2019s election laws and the purpose behind each petition requirement, however, is incomplete. The first petition requirement, which is a <em>state-wide </em>petition for a political group to gain recognition as a political party, is <em>not </em>designed to demonstrate a \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d for a minor political party candidate in the district from which he or she may wish to run for office. Voters who sign the party-recognition petition neither are pledging their loyalty to the party nor promising to support a particular candidate in a future election. Rather, these sig-nators simply are indicating their view that the named party should be recognized as a political party in the State of Maryland. Maryland Code (2003), Election Law Article, \u00a7 4-102. Once the potential candidate\u2019s party is recognized as a political party statewide, the potential candidate must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>petition to get the signatures of 1% of the voters from the political subdivision he or she wishes to represent. It is this latter requirement, in contrast to the <em>former, </em>that demonstrates the \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d that the Majority seems to acknowledge is a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In <em>Mathers v. Morris, </em>the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland considered a challenge to Maryland\u2019s election laws similar to that mounted here. 515 F.Supp. 931 (1981). There the plaintiffs were challenging the constitutionality of Maryland\u2019s two-part design for determining political party status, which included a political organization filing petitions signed by 10,000 voters in order to achieve recognition as a political party followed by attaining at least three percent of the vote in a Presidential or Gubernatorial election in order to maintain its status as a political party. <em>Mathers, </em>515 F.Supp. at 937. In rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge, the court explained that, given that the 10,000 statewide signature requirement for recognition as a political party is a relatively low threshold requirement, the more burdensome requirement of polling a 3% popular vote to maintain party status is not on its face unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court stressed that the State\u2019s interest in requiring a significant modicum of support \u201cdoes not disappear once an organization has complied with some initial threshold requirement.\u201d <em>Mathers, </em>515 F.Supp. at 938. This is analogous to the argument that the Green Party mounts in the present case. The 10,000 signature statewide petition, which measures a political entity\u2019s popular support to be recognized as a political party, does not impinge on Maryland\u2019s independent, legitimate interest in having that party\u2019s candidates demonstrate a \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d in a specific district before being allowed to appear on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Like Maryland, Pennsylvania also conditions ballot access for minor political party candidates on a modest showing of popular support. Although the election laws of the respective states differ somewhat, there are sufficient similarities between the two systems to make persuasive here case law analyzing the constitutionality of Pennsylvania\u2019s election laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>with respect to minor political parties recognition requirements persuasive here. As explained in <em>The Patriot Party v. Mitchell, </em>in Pennsylvania, if a political body\u2019s candidates received at least 2% of the largest vote cast in the most recent general election, then it is recognized as a political party in the Commonwealth. 826 F.Supp. 926, 929 (E.D.Pa.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>9 F.3d 1540 (3d Cir.1993). Pennsylvania law then classifies a political party as \u201cmajor\u201d if its membership consists of at least 15% of registered voters in the State and as minor if its registration is less than 15% of registered voters statewide. <em>Id. </em>While major political parties use the primary to determine who will represent them on the ballot, minor political parties must use nomination petitions to gain access to the general election ballot. <em>Id. </em>For a nonstatewide elective office, a minor political party candidate must garner the signatures of at least 2% \u201cof the largest entire vote case for any officer ... elected at the last preceding election in said electoral district for which said nomination papers are to be filed.\u201d 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2911(b) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In <em>The Patriot Party </em>case, the Patriot Party of Pennsylvania, an offshoot of Pennsylvanians for Ross Perot, was certified as a minor political party, but Surrick, a candidate for the party, was unable to appear on the ballot because he failed to obtain the requisite number of signatures on his petition. 826 F.Supp. at 930. Like the petitioners in the case before this Court, the plaintiffs in <em>The Patriot Party </em>argued that the state\u2019s election laws were unconstitutional because it was unfair to require minor political party candidates continually to meet the signature requirement to gain access to the ballot because they already demonstrated the \u201csignificant modicum of support\u201d when Pennsylvania recognized their political organization as a minor political party. <em>The Patriot Party, </em>826 F.Supp. at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Finding their rationale unpersuasive, the Pennsylvania federal court soundly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, holding that is not unconstitutional to require minor political party candidates to undergo a petition requirement in order to appear on the ballot. <em>The Patriot Party, </em>826 F.Supp. at 935. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The court upheld the constitutionality of Pennsylvania\u2019s election scheme, in part because the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that there are differences between historically established political parties and small, newly-founded political parties and that it is not inappropriate for a state to recognize these differences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. (cited in Jenness, </em>403 U.S. at 441-42, 91 S.Ct. at 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d at 562). While Ross Perot received over 902, 000 votes in Pennsylvania in the 1992 Presidential election, the Patriot Party was unsuccessful in its efforts to solicit members. <em>The Patriot Party, </em>826 F.Supp., at 935. Because the Patriot Party \u201chas not historically demonstrated broad support in Pennsylvania,\u201d the court reasoned that the Commonwealth constitutionally can require minor political parties to use the nomination process, which would demonstrate such support, so that Pennsylvania may achieve its interest of managing the number of candidates on the ballot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Like the Patriot Party, the Green Party also lacks established support on the record of this case. While the Green Party was able to garner the 10,000 signatures statewide to be recognized as a political party, according to the record there are only 229 voters statewide who have registered as Green Party members or otherwise expressed a desire to be associated with the group. Employing the rationale of <em>The Patriot Party </em>case, the lack of established support for the Green Party serves to justify Maryland\u2019s double petition requirement. It is the second petition requirement, and not the party-recognition petition, which ensures that a minor political party candidate actually has a significant modicum of support in the geographical district from which he or she wishes to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s double petition requirement violates Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<author id=\"b393-5\">ELDRIDGE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-605, the defendant Maryland Board of Elections has filed a motion for reconsideration, asserting that this Court\u2019s opinion \u201cprevents the State Board of Elections ... from following the mandates of federal law in a federal election\u201d and \u201cplaces [the Board] in the position of having to violate two federal statutes, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, and Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d (Motion for Reconsideration at 1.) Specifically, the Board asks this Court to review Part III of the opinion holding that certain statutory provisions and administrative regulations which treat \u201cinactive\u201d voters differently from \u201cactive\u201d voters, and which provide for a separate inactive voter registration list, are invalid under the Maryland Constitution. The Board argues that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973gg <em>et seq., </em>and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15301 <em>et seq., </em>\u201ccompel[3 states to establish a process for removing the names of certain ineligible voters from voter registration lists used in federal elections\u201d and that \u201c[a]t least for federal elections, [the] ... voter registration list must contain an \u2018inactive\u2019 category.... \u201d (Motion for Reconsideration at 2.) Correctly noting that this Court\u2019s decision prohibits the creation of a separate inactive voter registry, the Board claims that \u201cfederal law ... compels creation of such a category.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In sum, the Board states, \u201cthere is no way that Maryland election officials can comply with both federal law and this Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">For the reasons outlined below, we disagree with the arguments advanced by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (\u201cNVRA\u201d) was enacted, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office,\u201d as well as \u201cto ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1973gg(b)(1) and (b)(4). Under \u00a7 1973gg-6(a)(4), a State is required to implement a program which removes from the official voter registry the names of voters who have died or have changed their residence. In pertinent part, \u00a7 1973gg-6(a)(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201c(a) In general. \u201cIn the administration of voter registration for elections for Federal office, each State shall -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201c(4) conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">(A) the death of the registrant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">(B) a change in the residence of the registrant, in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) [of this section].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Section 1973gg-6(b) requires that the program implemented to remove voters under subsection (a)(4) must be a nondiscriminatory program and that the program \u201cshall not result in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person\u2019s failure to vote.\u201d Subsection (b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201c(b) Confirmation of voter registration.

We stress that a State is not required to implement the program described in (c)(1); the statute merely provides an illustrative example, which, so long as it does not offend the State\u2019s Constitution and election laws, <em>may </em>be used by a State in complying with the requirements of subsection (a)(4). Subsection (c)(1) provides in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c(c) Voter removal programs. (1) A State <em>may </em>meet the requirement of subsection (a)(4) by establishing a program under which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">(A) change-of-address information supplied by the Postal Service ... is used to identify registrants whose addresses may have changed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">(B) if it appears from information provided by the Postal Service that \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">(i) a registrant has moved to a different residence address in the same registrar\u2019s jurisdiction in which the registrant is currently registered, the registrar changes the registration records to show the new address and sends the registrant a notice of the change ... by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>which the registrant may verify ... the address information; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">(ii) the registrant has moved to a[n] ... address not in the same registrar\u2019s jurisdiction, the registrar uses the notice procedure described in subsection (d)(2) to confirm the change of address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Finally, \u00a7 1973gg-6(d) addresses the removal of names from the official registry. Subsection (d)(1) sets forth a prohibition with two exceptions. The statute prohibits the States from removing the name of a registrant on the grounds of a change of residence unless one of two situations exists: First, where the registrant confirms in writing that he or she has moved out of the registrar\u2019s jurisdiction. Second, where the registrant fails to respond to a specific type of notice sent by the registrar in conformity with paragraph (d)(2) and the registrant has not voted in the previous two general elections following the transmission of the notice to the registrant. Subsection (d)(1) provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c(d) Removal of names from voting rolls. (1) A State. <em>shall not remove </em>the name of a registrant from the official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office on the ground that the registrant has changed residence unless the registrant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">(A) confirms in writing that the registrant has changed residence to a place outside the registrar\u2019s jurisdiction in which the registrant is registered; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">(B) (i) has failed to respond to <em>a notice described in paragraph (2); </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(ii) has not voted ... in an election during the period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for Federal office that occurs after the date of the notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApK\">Paragraph (2) prescribes the detailed requirements of the notice which the Board must send to a registrant before the Board may remove the registrant\u2019s name from the official list. The notice must (1) be a postage prepaid and pre-addressed card, (2) be sent by forwardable mail, (3) provide the registrant with the opportunity to state his or her current address, (4) notify the registrant of the date when he or she must return the card, and (5) state the consequences of not returning the card timely. In relevant part, \u00a7 1973gg-6(d)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201c(2) A notice is ... a postage prepaid and pre-addressed return card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the registrant may state his or her current address, together with a notice to the following effect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(A) If the registrant did not change ... residence, or changed residence but remained in the registrar\u2019s jurisdiction, the registrant should return the card not later than the time provided for mail registration under subsection (a)(1)(B). If the card is not returned, affirmation or confirmation of the registrant\u2019s address may be required before the registrant is permitted to vote ... during the period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for Federal office that occurs after the date of the notice, and if the registrant does not vote in an election during that period the registrant\u2019s name will be removed from the list of eligible voters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">(B) If the registrant has changed residence to a place outside the registrar\u2019s jurisdiction ..., information concerning how the registrant can continue to be eligible to vote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Finally, \u00a7 1973gg-6(d)(3) requires a registrar to correct the official list to reflect the change of address information which the registrar receives from a voter responding to the confir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>mation notice sent pursuant to (d)(2). A corresponding provision appeared in \u00a7 3-504(d) of the Maryland election laws, which we did not invalidate in our opinion in this case. Subsection (d)(3) simply provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201c(3) A voting registrar shall correct an official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office in accordance with change of residence information obtained in conformance with this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Before addressing the specific federal statutory provisions which the Board relies upon, we emphasize that Part III of our opinion conforms with the fundamental thrust of the federal statutes. For instance, in our opinion we held that Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution contemplates one uniform registry as opposed to two separate registries, one for \u201cactive\u201d voters and another for \u201cinactive\u201d voters. Nothing in the above-cited federal statutes suggests that a state <em>must </em>create a separate inactive voter registry. Indeed, \u00a7 15483(a)(1)(A) of the Help America Vote Act provides that \u201ceach State ... shall implement, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, a single, uniform, official, ... computerized statewide voter registration list ... that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the State ....\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 15483(a)(1)(A)(viii) states that \u201c[t]he computerized list shall serve as the official voter registration list for the conduct of all elections for Federal office in the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Our opinion repeatedly underscored that being a frequent or active voter was not an eligibility requirement under Article I of the Maryland Constitution. The federal statutes cited by the Board are entirely consistent with this. As the Board concedes, \u00a7 1973gg-6(b)(2) of the National Voter Registration Act directs that a State\u2019s program \u201cshall not result in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person\u2019s failure to vote ....\u201d Even more emphatic is the mandate contained in \u00a7 15483(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Help America Vote Act, which requires that \u201c[t]he list maintenance performed ... shall be conducted in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that ensures that * * * only voters who are not registered or who are not eligible to vote are removed from the computerized list.\u201d Additionally, \u00a7 15483(a)(4)(B) provides that \u201c[t]he State election system shall include provisions to ensure that voter registration records are accurate and are updated regularly, including * * * [safeguards to ensue that eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible voters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Finally, our opinion made clear that the second-class status conferred upon \u201cinactive\u201d voters, and the corresponding inferi- or set of rights affixed to that status insofar as petitions are concerned, violates the Maryland Constitution. Once again, we find nothing in the federal statutes relied upon by the Board which supports the notion that an election board may refuse to count signatures on a petition because the persons signing were \u201cinactive\u201d voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As to the federal statutory provisions relied upon by the Board, we believe that subsections (b), (c), and (d) of \u00a7 1973gg-6 of the National Voter Registration Act should be construed in harmony with the general intent of the Act, which, <em>inter alia, </em>is to establish procedures that will <em>increase </em>the number of registered voters and ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1973gg(b)(1) and (b)(4). Subsection (b) of \u00a7 1973gg-6 is consistent with our opinion. That provision requires a uniform and non-discriminatory program to maintain accurate and current voter registration records and rejects a program that results in the removal of a registrant\u2019s name from the official list by reason of the registrant\u2019s failure to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Likewise, subsection (c) does not mandate any procedure that is inconsistent with our opinion. On the contrary, that provision suggests a permissive sample program \u2014 a guideline. It explicitly provides that a State <em>may </em>meet the federal statute\u2019s requirement in \u00a7 1973gg-6(a)(4) by establishing a program under which change-of-address information supplied by the Post Office is used to identify registrants whose addresses may have changed. It neither requires the states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>to implement the specific program illustrated, nor does it state that the guideline described therein is the exclusive method to be used by the states in order to maintain accurate and current registration rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Moreover subsection (d) does not appear to be a <em>mandate </em>which is irreconcilable with our opinion in this case. To begin with, (d)(1) prohibits the states from removing the name of a registrant from the official list of eligible voters on the ground that the registrant has changed residence, except in the event of two alternative situations. The remainder of subsection (d) sets forth exceptions to this prohibition. An exception to a prohibition is not normally construed to be an affirmative mandate. Consonant with our opinion, \u00a7 1973gg-6(d)(1)(A) allows a state to remove from the official list the names of registrants who affirmatively confirm that they have moved out of their original district. Similarly, \u00a7 1973gg-6(d)(1)(B) allows a state to remove the name of a registrant who fails to respond to the registrar\u2019s confirmation notice and has not voted for a prescribed period of time. Consistent with the well-settled principle that a statute should be construed so that all of its parts harmonize with each other and are consistent with the statute\u2019s general intent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we read subsections (c) and (d) together as suggesting a particular program for meeting the requirement of \u00a7 1973gg-6(a)(4) that ineligible voters be removed from the registration list. Subsection (e)(1) clearly states that a state \u201cmay\u201d adopt the program described in subsection (c)(1)(A) and (B), and (B)(ii) then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>refers to the notice procedure \u201cdescribed in subsection (d)(2) to confirm the change of address.\u201d Thus, the procedure in (d)(2) seems to be part of the program which a state \u201cmay,\u201d but is not required to, adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">As our opinion in this case held, under Article I of the Maryland Constitution, the boards of elections may not maintain separate registries of \u201cinactive\u201d voters based on \u201cpassive proof\u2019 that a voter may no longer be eligible to vote in the district in question. Our opinion stated that \u201cthe Board\u2019s practice of creating a separate \u2018inactive voter\u2019 registry] for voters whom it suspects might have moved out of an election district, and the Board\u2019s subsequent removal of such \u2018inactive voters\u2019 from that registration list without affirmative proof that the voter has, in fact, moved to a different election district, cannot be squared with the constitutional provisions [set forth in Article I of the Maryland Constitution].\u201d In its motion, the State Board of Elections asserts that \u201c[w]hether maintaining a separate list of these [inactive] voters violates the requirement that there be a single official list of eligible voters would seem to be a semantic, rather than a meaningful, argument.\u201d (Motion for Reconsideration at 9 n.8). We disagree. Under \u00a7 3-504(5) of the Maryland Election Code, \u201c[registrants placed on the inactive list shall be counted only for purposes of voting and not for such official administrative purposes including petition signature verification, establishing precincts, and reporting official statistics.\u201d In the case at bar, the Board\u2019s practice of striking the names of \u201cinactive\u201d voters from the Green Party\u2019s nominating petitions presented a very meaningful problem for Mr. Gross; he was kept off the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The provisions of the Help America Vote Act cited by the Board do not appear to help its position. As the Board points out, \u00a7 15483(a) of the Help America Vote Act provides for the implementation and maintenance of statewide computerized voter registration lists. Subsection (a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c(2) Computerized list maintenance. (A) In general. The appropriate State or local election official shall perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(i) If an individual is to be removed from the computerized list, such individual shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Insofar as removal from the voter registry is concerned, the Act merely seems to embody the National Voter Registration Act\u2019s requirements. Likewise, \u00a7 15483(a)(4) of the Help America Vote Act provides that \u201c[t]he State election system shall include provisions to ensure that voter registration records in the State are accurate and are updated regularly, including ... [a] system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters.\u201d Section 15483(a)(4)(A) explicitly requires that such a system be \u201cconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Additionally, in its motion, the Board asserts (Motion for Reconsideration at 8) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201c[I]f a specimen ballot or other election mailing to the old address is returned by the post office with a forwarding address, election officials determine whether the new address is inside or outside the county and inside or outside Maryland. If the new address is in-county, the registrant\u2019s record is updated and a confirmation notice is mailed. <em>Whether or not election officials receive a response, the voter\u2019s name remains on county rolls. </em>If the new address is in another Maryland county, the registrant\u2019s voter registration record is updated and transferred to the new county and a confirmation notice is mailed. <em>Whether or not election officials receive a response, the voter\u2019s name remains on the voter registry in the new county. </em>On the other hand, if the new address is outside Maryland, election officials place the voter\u2019s name on the [inactive] list and send a confirmation notice .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">But a plain reading of \u00a7 3-504(f) of the Maryland Election Code indicates that, \u201c[i]f a voter fails to respond to a confirmation notice sent based on information that the voter moved to a different residence outside the local board\u2019s jurisdiction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>voter\u2019s name shall be placed on a list of inactive voters.\u201d The Maryland Election Code does not differentiate between the voters whose new address is in-county as opposed to those whose new address is in a new county or outside of Maryland. It simply relegates <em>all </em>voters who do not reply to the confirmation notice to the inactive list and, <em>inter alia, </em>strips them of their ability to be counted as petition-signers.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The Maryland Constitution, as interpreted in our opinion does not countenance a program in which a voter is labeled \u201cinactive,\u201d and eventually removed from the registry, without affirmative proof that the voter has been rendered ineligible to vote in the district in question by his or her change in residence to another district. Our opinion rejects a program which authorizes removal from the registration rolls by reason of a voter\u2019s inaction which, as we pointed out, \u201cmight be caused by numerous factors other than moving to a different election district.\u201d Section 3-504(e)(1) allows an election official to remove a voter who confirms in writing that he or she has changed his or her residence to a location outside the county in which he or she was originally registered. We held that this satisfies the requirement for affirmative proof of a change in domicile. The option presented in \u00a7 3-504(e)(2), which allows an election official to remove a voter who does not respond to the confirmation notice and fails to vote in the prescribed period, does not satisfy the requirement for affirmative proof of a voter\u2019s change in domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The State Board of Elections asserts that \u201cthe holdings in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion ... appear to make it impossible for election officials to comply with the mandates in the [National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act].\u201d (Motion for Reconsideration at 3.) The Board further states that \u201cthere is no way that Maryland election officials can comply with both federal law and this Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>As discussed above, however, there appears to be no <em>mandatory </em>procedure in the National Voter Registration Act or the Help America Vote Act that is inconsistent with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>opinion. On the contrary, many of the provisions of the federal statutes cited by the Board dovetail with Part III of our opinion. Indeed, the Board seems to concede in its motion that placing voters who do hot respond to confirmation notices on an inactive list is not required by the federal statutes and that \u201cshould this Court find [that practice] inconsistent with the State Constitution, Maryland election officials could stop the practice without violating clear mandates of federal law.\u201d (Motion for Reconsideration at 12 n.10). There would seem to be many ways to establish a program that complies with the requirements in the federal statutes and with the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Nevertheless, we have remanded this case for further proceedings, and specifically a new declaratory judgment to be crafted and filed by the Circuit Court. In the interests of justice, upon remand to the Circuit Court, and prior to the entry of a new declaratory judgment, the State Board of Elections should be given the opportunity to demonstrate, if it can, any circumstances where there is an irreconcilable conflict between Maryland Constitutional requirements and <em>man-, dates </em>of federal law. If, in the judgment of the Circuit Court, the Board makes such a showing, obviously, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, the federal statutes should prevail and the new declaratory judgment should so reflect.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION GRANTED TO THE EXTENT INDICATED ABOVE, AND OTHERWISE DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">.

This decision also helps to explain why Maryland allows candidates representing the major political parties to use the primary process to access the ballot instead of using nomination petitions.
