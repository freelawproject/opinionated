Following a hearing, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s combined motion to suppress evidence, quash arrest, and rescind his statutory summary suspension. The State appeals. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b22-4\" pgmap=\"22\">The bystander\u2019s report indicates that the defendant\u2019s automobile was stopped at a planned, staged, safety-check roadblock administered by the Romeoville police department. The roadblock channelled every tenth vehicle through the roadside safety check. That car would then be checked for safety violations. If the vehicle had no equipment violations or other obvious problems, it was allowed to proceed. However, if any equipment or other violations were observed, a police officer would direct the vehicle to another staging area where the vehicle would be inspected more closely.</p> <p id=\"b22-5\" pgmap=\"22\">Romeoville police officer Michael Ramaglia testified that on May 26,1995, at approximately 8 p.m., the defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped because it was the tenth vehicle traveling through the roadblock. Another officer noticed that the defendant was not wearing a seat belt. Based on this violation, the defendant was directed to the second staging area. Ramaglia stated that at this area, the defendant was asked for proof of a valid driver\u2019s license and insurance. While in the second area, Ramaglia obtained evidence that the defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. The defendant was then arrested for that offense.</p> <p id=\"b22-6\" pgmap=\"22\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s combined motion. It later denied the State\u2019s motion to reconsider and found that the defendant was detained because of his failure to wear a seat belt, in violation of Illinois law. 625 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 603.1 (West 1994).</p> <p id=\"b22-7\" pgmap=\"22\">On appeal, the State argues that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion. Specifically, it contends that the defendant was initially stopped at a constitutionally proper roadblock and therefore was not stopped solely on the basis of a violation of the seat belt law. We agree.</p> <p id=\"b22-8\" pgmap=\"22\">In Illinois, the seat belt law provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b22-9\" pgmap=\"22\">\"No motor vehicle, or driver or passenger of such vehicle, shall be stopped or searched *** solely on the basis of a violation or suspected violation of this Section.\u201d 625 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 603.1(e) (West 1992).</blockquote> <p id=\"b22-10\" pgmap=\"22(46) 23(62)\">It is well settled that a fourth amendment \"seizure\u201d occurs when an automobile is stopped at a roadblock or checkpoint. United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (1976). Nevertheless, a roadblock stop of vehicles is permissible under the fourth amendment because the State\u2019s interest in highway safety outweighs the minimal privacy intrusion on motorists. Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481 (1990). We have followed this reasoning in upholding stops to check for safety violations. People v. Wells, 241 Ill. App. 3d 141, 608 N.E.2d 578 (1993).</p> <p id=\"b23-4\" pgmap=\"23\">Here, the defendant was \"seized\u201d when his vehicle was stopped at the initial checkpoint. At that point, the police were stopping every tenth vehicle on the roadway regardless of whether the driver had violated any statutes. The defendant was stopped pursuant to a proper roadblock rather than the seat belt violation. The defendant\u2019s dispatch to the second staging area because of the seat belt violation was an extension of the original seizure. The defendant was not stopped \"solely on the basis of a violation\u201d of the seat belt law (see 625 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 603.1(e) (West 1994)). Thus, he was properly detained.</p> <p id=\"b23-5\" pgmap=\"23\">Additionally, we note that our interpretation is consistent with the legislative history of section 12 \u2014 603.1(e). The legislative debates on this statute indicate that the primary purpose of adding section 12 \u2014 603.1(e) was to curtail what legislators saw as officers harassing motorists for not wearing a seat belt, particularly when trying to generate additional revenue for the community. 85th Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, June 24, 1987, at 230, 231 (statements of Representatives Weaver and Rea). The amendment was not intended to prevent a police officer from further detaining a motorist who was not wearing a seat belt after an otherwise lawful stop.</p> <p id=\"b23-6\" pgmap=\"23\">The judgment of the circuit court of Will County is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b23-7\" pgmap=\"23\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b23-8\" pgmap=\"23\">MICHELA, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b23-9\" pgmap=\"23\">PRESIDING JUSTICE HOLDRIDGE,</author> <p id=\"AY\" pgmap=\"23\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b23-10\" pgmap=\"23\">I respectfully dissent. The issue in this cause is not whether sending the defendant to the second staging area was part of a valid fourth amendment \"seizure,\u201d as the majority holds. Rather, the issue is whether sending the defendant to the second staging area solely because he was not wearing his seat belt violated section 12 \u2014 603.1 of the Illinois vehicle equipment law (the statute). 625 ILCS 5/12\u2014 603.1 (West 1992). I believe that by doing so the police violated the clear and unambiguous intent of the statute, and I would affirm the trial court on that basis.</p> <p id=\"b23-11\" pgmap=\"23(10) 24(44)\">While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was stopped pursuant to a proper road block rather than a seat belt violation and that, therefore, he was not stopped \"solely on the basis of a violation of the seat belt law,\u201d the analysis cannot end there. The statute provides in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b24-4\" pgmap=\"24\">\"No motor vehicle, or driver or passenger of such vehicle, shall be stopped or searched *** solely on the basis of a violation or suspected violation of this Section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 625 ILCS 5/12 \u2014 603.1 (West 1992).</blockquote> <p id=\"b24-5\" pgmap=\"24\">The statute does not permit an individual to be \"stopped or searched\u201d based upon a violation of this statute, thus clearly using the verbs in the disjunctive. While disjunctive words (such as \"or\u201d) and conjunctive words (such as \"and\u201d) are sometimes misused by legislators, \"the literal meaning of these terms should be followed unless it renders the statute inoperable or the meaning becomes questionable.\u201d 1A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 21.14, at 9 (5th ed. Supp. 1995); Advincula v. United Blood Services, 274 Ill. App. 3d 573, 581 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b24-6\" pgmap=\"24\">Section 12 \u2014 603.1 does not become inoperable or of questionable meaning by interpreting it literally to mean that an individual cannot be stopped or searched based upon the failure to wear a seat belt. In this matter, it is uncontroverted that the defendant was dispatched to the second staging area and searched because of the seat belt violation. Thus, although he was not stopped based upon his failure to wear his seat belt, he was certainly searched based upon that violation.</p> <p id=\"b24-7\" pgmap=\"24\">Because I would find that the defendant was searched based upon his failure to wear his seat belt, a search which was in violation of section 12 \u2014 603.1 of the statute, I would affirm the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b24-8\" pgmap=\"24\">For the reasons discussed, I respectfully dissent.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
