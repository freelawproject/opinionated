After the note had become due the bank applied thereon the sum of one hundred nine dollars and seventy cents which Flint \u201chad on deposit in the defendant bank in a commercial or check account.\u201d At that time the bank had information that Flint was about to file a petition in bankruptcy. Beyond all question the bank had a right to make this application if the sum applied was a general deposit. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>192 U. S. 138, 48 L. ed. 380, 24 Sup.

However, the agreed facts show no feature of a special deposit, but only that the deposit was general, subject to check in the usual course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The plaintiff does not claim that the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings in any way affect the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
