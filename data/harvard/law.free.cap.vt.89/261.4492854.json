But this depends upon the force of the word <em>permanent, </em>as used therein. It is said in <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>101 Va. 161, 43 S. E. 345, that this word does not always embrace the idea of absolute perpetuity, or lasting forever. And in <em>Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Marshall, </em>136 U. S. 393, 34 L. ed. 385, 10 Sup. Ct. 846, the Court said it does not mean \u201cforever,\u201d or \u201clasting forever,\u201d or \u201cexisting forever\u201d; and that the language used is to be considered according to. the subject-matter of the contract. Applying the same rule here in considering the decree under view, we think the word <em>permanent </em>is to be construed with reference to the terms of the grant of the right of way, and that, when so construed, the deeree means the same as though it read, the temporary injunction \u201cis made permanent within the life of the easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Defendant says that during the pendency of the injunction, the orator has suffered his team to stand on land of defendant when being loaded and when waiting to be loaded, and that in these circumstances the orator should be decreed to pay a reasonable rental therefor. But the findings show that the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>upon defendant\u2019s right has not been increased by anything the orator has done in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed as of the date of the appeal, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
