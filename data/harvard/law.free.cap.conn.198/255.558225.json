J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af7\">The principal issue on this appeal is whether the alleged illegality of the defendant\u2019s arrest compels dismissal of the charges against him. After a trial to a jury, the defendant, Luther Fleming, was convicted of felony murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>BSa-\u00f3\u00e1c,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty-five years to life. He appeals from the judgment of this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of June 10, 1980, the defendant and an associate, Alphonzie Perry, drove to the Star Package Store in Bridgeport with the intention of robbing it. Arriving shortly before the 8 p.m. closing time, the two men parked the car on the street near the liquor store. While Perry remained in the car, the defendant entered the store with a loaded gun. He robbed the proprietor at gunpoint and, during a strug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>gle for the gun, shot him in the abdomen. The victim died a short time later. Both the defendant and Perry were later arrested for this crime and were tried separately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On appeal from his conviction, the defendant raises three claims of error. He claims that: (1) his motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted because the indictment stemmed from an illegal arrest; (2) his motions for mistrial should have been granted because information which came before the jury was so prejudicial that it deprived him of a fair trial; and (3) the trial court erred in instructing the jury both on the elements of felony murder and on accessorial liability. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In his initial claim of error, the defendant claims that the trial court should have dismissed the indictment charging him with felony murder. This claim has two components: first, that his arrest was illegal because the probable cause which supported it was the product of a series of intertwining illegalities; and second, that, because this arrest was illegal, the subsequent prosecution which stemmed from it should have been barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">At a pretrial hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the testimony revealed the following facts. A day or two after the incident at the Star Package Store, the defendant voluntarily went to police headquarters to discuss another unrelated incident which he had witnessed. At that time, he initiated conversation with the police about the package store incident. Subsequently, on June 20,1980, during the course of their investigation into the robbery and murder at the package store, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the police brought the defendant to police headquarters and questioned him there. He was not then placed under arrest or informed of his <em>Miranda? </em>rights. In response to police questions, the defendant gave a statement exculpating himself but implicating Alphonzie Perry in the crime. Later that day, the police arrested Perry and confronted him with the defendant\u2019s accusatory statement. Perry responded by implicating the defendant. As a result of this statement, the police arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The defendant argues that his initial statement to police, made in the absence <em>o\u00ed Miranda </em>warnings, was a violation of his fifth amendment rights and that his subsequent arrest was a direct product of that illegality. Thus, the defendant claims, the arrest itself was illegal and the charges against him should have been dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the trial court granted a defense motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statements, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>denied the motion to dismiss, finding that the arrest was legal and based on probable cause. The defendant now asks us to reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling and to order the charges against him dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The legality of the defendant\u2019s conviction could be sustained either by upholding the trial court\u2019s findings about the legality of the defendant\u2019s arrest or by determining that illegality of an arrest does not per se invalidate a subsequent conviction. In order to put to rest the controversy that has long surrounded the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900 (1965), we have decided to take the latter route in finding no error on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The relationship between an illegal arrest and a subsequent prosecution under federal constitutional law is well settled. In an unbroken line of cases dating back to 1886, the federal rule has been that an illegal arrest will not bar a subsequent prosecution or void a resulting conviction. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 474, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1980); <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 119, 95 S. Ct. 854, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255, 86 S. Ct. 1416, 16 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1966); <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S. Ct. 509, 96 L. Ed. 541 (1952); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 440, 7 S. Ct. 225, 30 L. Ed. 421 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">If the defendant\u2019s claim of necessary linkage between the legality of arrest and legality of prosecution is to be sustained, therefore, that claim must find its predicate in state law. Such a state-based claim arguably arises from <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>supra, where this court ordered dismissal of criminal charges because the defendant had been arrested under a bench warrant insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Our holding, in <em>Licari, </em>that an illegal arrest deprives the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s person, was, however, expressly derived from a misunderstanding of the federal cases, and this fragility in the <em>Licari </em>jurisdictional underpinnings has repeatedly been noted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>193 Conn. 612, 629, 480 A.2d 452 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>191 Conn. 433, 438, 465 A.2d 323 (1983); Borden &amp; Jaffe, \u201cThe Trouble with <em>Licari; </em>Irony and Anomaly,\u201d 55 Conn. B.J. 463, 465-69 (1981). As an interpretation of federal law, <em>Licari </em>can no longer stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Acknowledging this weakness in the relevant precedents, the defendant does not base his appeal on the federal constitution. Instead, he argues that provisions of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, of the Connecticut constitution affording protection from unreasonable searches and seizures and defining the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> create a broad rule invalidating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>any prosecution which arises from an illegal arrest. There is no question, of course, that this court has the authority to determine what meaning to attribute to provisions contained in the constitution of this state. In this process of interpretation, we will often look to federal precedents when they are analytically persuasive. We are, however, free, in appropriate circumstances, to follow a different route and thus to recognize that the Connecticut constitution may provide for the people of this state greater rights and liberties than they are afforded under the federal constitution. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1038-39, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 234-35, 496 A.2d 498 (1985); <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984); see Howard, \u201cIntroduction: A Frequent Recurrence to Fundamental Principles,\u201d in Developments in State Constitutional Law (1985) pp. xi, xvii-xxiii; Mosk, \u201cState Constitutionalism after Warren: Avoiding the Potomac\u2019s Ebb and Flow,\u201d in Developments in State Constitutional Law (1985) p. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In support of the position that we should relocate and revalidate <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari </em>in the law of our state constitution, the defendant relies principally on our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>179 Conn. 46, 425 A.2d 916 (1979). In that case, the defendant was illegally arrested without probable cause, and evidence obtained as a result of that arrest was admitted against him in his subsequent trial. We held that the use of the illegally obtained evidence had tainted his subsequent prosecution, compromising his right to a fair trial. Consequently, citing the same Connecticut constitutional provisions herein invoked, as well as article first, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we ordered dismissal of the charges against him. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>defendant suggests that this holding militates toward a similar result in his case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The issue presented by the rule of <em>Licari </em>and the facts of this case are entirely distinguishable from the holding of <em>Federici. </em>Here, the defendant has failed to allege, much less to show, how his allegedly illegal arrest tainted his trial. <em>No </em>evidence obtained as a result of the defendant\u2019s arrest was used to obtain his conviction. Further, the defendant has never challenged, either at trial or on this appeal, the admissibility of Alphonzie Perry\u2019s testimony at trial. In short, unlike the trial in <em>Federici, </em>the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial was in no way compromised by the circumstances of his arrest. <em>Federici, </em>therefore, fails to supply state constitutional support for the continued viability of the rule of <em>Licari. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The defendant has provided no other state constitutional basis for continuation of the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari. </em>Nothing in the language of the constitutional provisions themselves sheds any light on the proper relationship between an illegal arrest and a subsequent conviction. Nothing in the constitutional history of this state, so far as we know, illuminates the issue. Courts in other jurisdictions, in decisions that are persuasive even though they are not binding, have followed the federal rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>arrest imposes no jurisdictional barrier to a defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution and overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari </em>to the extent that it holds to the contrary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Where the fairness of a subsequent prosecution has not been impaired by an illegal arrest, neither the federal nor the Connecticut constitution requires dismissal of the charges or a voiding of the resulting conviction. \u201c[D]ue process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.\u201d Frisbie <em>v. Collins, </em>supra, 522; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>99 Idaho 694, 697, 587 P.2d 835 (1978); see 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 1.7 (b), p. 152. We are satisfied that the defendant was given a fair trial untainted by any prior illegalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial on two separate occasions during the trial so prejudiced him that he was deprived of a fair trial and due process of law under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Established principles of law govern the granting of a motion for a mistrial. The general rule in this state is that a mistrial should be granted only when it is apparent to the court that some occurrence during the trial has so prejudiced a party that he can no longer receive a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 25, 438 A.2d 867 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 143, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980). The trial court enjoys wide discretion in deciding whether a mistrial is warranted; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowakowski, </em>188 Conn. 620, 624, 452 A.2d 938 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>supra; and its decision will be reversed on appeal only if it is established that this discretion has been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The defendant\u2019s first motion for a mistrial occurred during the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of its principal witness, Alphonzie Perry. In response to a question relating to the evening of the murder, Perry testified that the defendant had \u201ctalked about getting down in robbery again.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The jury was immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>excused, and the defendant moved for \u201ca mistrial or in the alternative that Mr. Perry\u2019s answer be stricken.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court denied the motion for a mistrial but granted the alternative motion to strike the answer. The defendant did not take exception to the denial of his motion for mistrial, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 288. Ordinarily the failure to take exception to a ruling of the trial court would render that ruling unreviewable on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3063, 288;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 580, 500 A.2d 539 (1985). However, because the defendant asserts that the failure to declare a mistrial has deprived him of a fundamental constitutional right implicating the fairness of his trial, we will review it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion. As soon as the challenged statement was made, the trial court excused the jury and granted the alternative defense motion to strike. In fact, not only did the court strike the challenged portion of the witness\u2019s statement, it struck the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>answer \u201cto avoid the necessity of going over that particular portion and reinforcing that particular portion that is objectionable.\u201d The court then extensively admonished the witness,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and carefully cautioned the jury to disregard the entire previous answer. Later, during its final charge to the jury, the court again instructed the jury not to consider any evidence which had been stricken during the trial. We are convinced that any prejudice the defendant may initially have suffered was eliminated by the trial court\u2019s prompt and thorough action. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendant\u2019s second motion for a mistrial<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was made during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, whose car the defendant had borrowed on the night of the crime. The witness had previously testified that she had never lent the defendant her car overnight. In attempting to impeach her, the prosecutor asked: \u201cWould those occasions [when you lent the defendant your car] have included his driving your car on April 8th of that year at or about 4:00 in the morning?\u201d The defendant immediately objected and moved for a mistrial. He argued that the state\u2019s question implied that \u201csomething specific had occurred\u201d at that time, which, coupled with Perry\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>earlier references to robberies, might have led the jury to draw prejudicial inferences. The trial court sustained the objection on relevancy grounds, but denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The defendant excepted to this latter ruling but did not request a cautionary instruction to the jury, and none was given. The defendant suggests on appeal that this question was an attempt by the prosecutor to place inadmissible prior misconduct evidence before the jury and was so prejudicial to the defendant that a mistrial was the only appropriate remedy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Where a motion for mistrial is made in response to a prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper question, the burden is on the defendant to establish that, in the context of the proceedings as a whole, the question was so prejudicial that it deprived him of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 628, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra. \u201cMerely asking an improper question . . . does not necessarily mandate a mistrial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 452, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. , 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Our review of the entire proceeding convinces us that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion. The question posed, although arguably improper, did not of itself imply misconduct by the defendant. The cross-examination which preceded the disputed question had focused on the time periods in which the witness had lent the defendant her car. In this context, the state\u2019s reference to a particular date did not necessarily imply misconduct by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s swift objection coupled with the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented any further reference to the subject. In fact, after the objection was sustained, the state ended its cross-examination altogether. Because the defendant has not sustained his burden of establishing that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>deprived of a fair trial, the trial court has not been shown to have abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In his final claim, the defendant maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because errors in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury created an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d that he was convicted on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each essential element of the crimes with which he was charged. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court misinstructed the jury on the elements of felony murder and on the intent necessary to establish accessorial liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree that portions of the charge were erroneous but conclude that, taken as a whole, the charge adequately instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Our review of challenged jury instructions takes place within carefully defined parameters. In the absence of a specific request to charge, we neither dissect a charge nor do we consider the challenged portion in isolation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>supra, 451; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). Rather, we review the entire charge to determine if, taken as a whole, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>charge adequately guided the jury to a correct verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra. An error in the charge requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 581; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The defendant first challenges the court\u2019s misuse of the disjunctive in instructing the jury on the elements of felony murder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, the statute under which the defendant was charged, provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, <em>he commits </em>or attempts to commit robbery . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) In discussing this element, the trial court twice incorrectly stated that the defendant could be convicted of felony murder if the underlying robbery was committed \u201cby this accused <em>or </em>by another participant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant argues in this appeal that this misstatement improperly permitted the jury to find him guilty of felony murder without first finding that he had committed the underlying felony, an essential element of the crime. At trial, the defendant neither requested a particular charge on the elements of felony murder nor took exception to the portions of the charge he now challenges. We will review his claim, however, because the failure adequately to instruct the jury on each essential element of the crime charged might result in a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>defendant\u2019s due process rights implicating the fairness of his trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 580; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">After reviewing the entire charge, we are convinced that the jury was adequately instructed on the elements of felony murder. There is no question that the trial court\u2019s use of the disjunctive in its discussion of the first element of the crime was erroneous. However, in the course of the entire charge, the trial court correctly explained that element on four separate occasions. At the start of the instruction on felony murder, the court twice correctly read the statute itself. Then, in discussing each element separately, the court twice correctly informed the jury that, to be convicted under this statute, the defendant himself must have committed the underlying robbery. The court also carefully instructed that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of every element of the crime with which he was charged. In addition, in its discussion of robbery in the first degree as a lesser included offense of felony murder, the court clearly stated that \u201c[i]f, of course, you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed robbery in the first degree then you will find the accused not guilty.\u201d In the context of this extensive charge, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the court\u2019s two isolated misstatements, although clearly incorrect, misled the jury. \u201cJury instructions are calculated to give the jurors a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and to afford them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 581; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 219, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). We are satisfied that the charge as given adequately fulfilled this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant\u2019s next challenge to the jury instructions concerns that portion of the charge that dealt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>accessorial liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who . . . intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct . . . as if he were the principal offender.\u201d Conviction under this statute requires proof of a dual intent: \u201cthat the accessory have the intent to <em>aid </em>the principal <em>and </em>that in so aiding he intend to <em>commit </em>the offense with which he is charged.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 694, 425 A.2d 111 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 531, 447 A.2d 396 (1982). To convict this defendant on an accessorial theory, the jury had to find that the defendant was an accessory to the underlying crime of robbery. Accordingly, the jury had to find that he intended both to aid the principal <em>and </em>to commit the underlying felony of robbery. The defendant concedes that in instructing the jury, the trial court tracked the language of \u00a7 53a-8.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>However, the defendant points out that the trial court failed to explain clearly in this portion of the charge that the underlying crime which the defendant must have intended to commit was robbery. Consequently, the defendant argues, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted him without finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he specifically intended to commit robbery. Since proof of such intent was essential to his conviction as an accessory to robbery under \u00a7 53a-8, the defendant contends that his conviction is constitutionally infirm.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We conclude that, taken as a whole, the court\u2019s charge correctly instructed the jury on the degree of intent necessary to justify conviction under \u00a7 53a-8. The court began this portion of the charge by reading the statute verbatim. It carefully instructed that \u201c[ujnless there is a quantum of intent or unlawful circumstances in common with the actual perpetrator [the defendant] is not guilty under the statute.\u201d The court then explained that merely aiding the principal in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>mission of the crime was insufficient to justify conviction, unless the defendant did so \u201cwith the criminal intent and common intent\u201d of the principal. Earlier in the charge, the court had emphasized that robbery, as the underlying felony, was an essential element of felony murder, and had explained, carefully and at length, the mental element required to commit it. Although it would have been better for the court to have mentioned robbery specifically during the accessory portion of its charge, we are convinced that its failure to do so did not mislead the jury. Taken as a whole, then, the instruction adequately informed the jury of the necessary mental element for accessorial liability. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Gasparro, </em>194 Conn. 96, 112, 480 A.2d 509 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>185 Conn. 260, 274, 440 A.2d 927 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cSec. 53a-54c. felony murder.

Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the privilege, and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the following measures are required. He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation. After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> During the proceedings below, the defendant premised his motion to dismiss on the claimed illegality of his arrest.

It is unclear from the transcript whether this reference was to the Star Package Store robbery, for which the defendant was on trial, or for a separate one. Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant asked that Perry\u2019s remarks be stricken, and added \u201cI renew my motion on that basis.\u201d In his brief, the defendant claims that this was a renewal of his motion for a mistrial. However, the defendant concedes that the court never ruled on this motion. Since the defendant failed to pursue the matter further either at trial or on appeal, there is no need for us to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> The jury was instructed that the defendant could be convicted of felony murder if he was found to have committed the underlying robbery under either of two alternative theories of liability: that of a principal or that of an accessory. The defendant had been charged by indictment as a principal perpetrator. The state later requested, and the court gave, an instruction allowing the jury to convict the defendant in the alternative as an accessory under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8. The defendant took exception to this charge on the ground that he had had no notice of that theory of liability. Under Connecticut law, a defendant may be convicted as an accessory even though he was charged only as a principal as long as the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to establish accessorial conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 502 A.2d 880 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>176 Conn. 508, 513 n.2, 408 A.2d 265 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>174 Conn. 500, 508, 391 A.2d 148 (1978). Acknowledging this, the defendant expressly declines to pursue this claim of lack of notice on appeal. Consequently, we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> The court\u2019s first misstatement was: \u201c[I]f you find on the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of Edmund Kish occurred as a result of the commission of a robbery by this accused <em>or </em>by another participant then the death of Edmund Kish becomes murder under our law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The court\u2019s second misstatement was: \u201cSo, to recapitulate, in order to find the accused guilty of the charge of murder as set forth in the indictment you must find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused and others <em>committed\u2014or </em>anothei\u2014committed the crime of robbery.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides: criminal liability for acts of another. A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The instruction on accessorial liability was given at the request of the state. We do not decide whether such an instruction was necessary. The text of the court\u2019s accessorial liability charge is: \u201cNow, as I have at times used the word other participants we have a statute in this case called an accessory statute. A person acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. If the accused did any of these things specified in the statute he\u2019s in the eyes of the law just as guilty of the crime charged as though he directly committed it or deliberately participated in its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201cNow, I want to particularly emphasize to you the statute does not connect the various things it specifies by the word and but instead separates them by the word or, therefore, the accused is guilty of the crime charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>if he solicited, if he requested, if he commanded, if he importuned or if he intentionally aided another person in the commission of the crime. To find him guilty under this statute you must however decide that he was more than inactively present at the commission of the crime, that he did something more than passively acquiesce in the crime or he did something more [than] innocently performing certain acts which in fact did aid in the commission of the offense. Unless there is a quantum of intent or unlawful circumstances in common with the actual perpetrator he is not guilty under the statute but if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did any of these things specified in the statute with the criminal intent and common intent he is just as guilty of the crime as though he had committed it himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> After the court had finished instructing the jury, the defendant took exception to numerous portions of the charge. It is unclear from the transcript whether, in his exception to the accessory instruction, he raised the same ground he now argues. However, \u201c[bjecause it appears that a question of constitutional dimension is raised by the court\u2019s alleged failure properly to explain the \u2018intent\u2019 element required by \u00a7 53a-8 we will accord this claim appellate review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine, </em>190 Conn. 822, 831, 463 A.2d 545 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
