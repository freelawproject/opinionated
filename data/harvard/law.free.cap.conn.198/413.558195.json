The sole issue on appeal is whether the Appellate Court erred when it sustained the judgment of the trial court which held that the plaintiff was not liable for the sales and use tax assessed by the defendant on certain services and rentals. That decision was based on a conclusion that the services and rentals in question were resold to the state and therefore exempt from the Connecticut sales and use tax. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>2 Conn. App. 165, 166, 476 A.2d 639 (1984); see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-411 (9), (10), (12), 12-410 (1), (2), (4). We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts: From March 1,1976, through February 28, 1979, the plaintiff contracted with the state department of transportation (hereinafter DOT) to construct various highways and bridges. Under the terms of each of the contracts, the plaintiff was obligated to provide watchmen, trafficmen and flagmen at such locations and for such periods as ordered by the state engineer, who was an employee of the DOT. The plaintiff, pursuant to these contracts, purchased the services of watchmen, trafficmen and flagmen from various private agencies and police departments, for which it paid a total of $280,020.13. When it purchased these services it issued resale certificates to the private agencies and the police departments. The DOT paid the plaintiff $272,468.58 for these services, an amount in accord with the schedule of prices provided in each contract. Also pursuant to its various contractual obligations, the plaintiff rented highway flashers for a total of $27,383.17, for which it issued resale certificates. In accordance with contract provisions, the DOT paid the plaintiff $21,355.50 for these rentals. The issuance of a resale certificate by the plaintiff relieved its suppliers of liability for the sales and use tax and imposed liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the tax on the plaintiff only if it made use of the service or property. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-411 (9), (10), (12), 12-410 (1), (2), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The defendant assessed a tax deficiency of $13,735.11 on the plaintiff based on the purchase price of the services of the watchmen, trafficmen and flagmen and on the rental price of the highway flashers. The plaintiff petitioned for an oral hearing under General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 12-418 (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 25, 1980, a conference was held relative to the plaintiffs petition for a reassessment of the sales and use tax deficiency. On March 11,1980, the defendant confirmed its assessment for the following reasons: \u201cThe services of watch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>men service, trafficmen and flagmen are taxable in full. The services are rendered in performance of the contract provision and do not constitute a resale of [sic] a governmental agency. . . . The tax on the rental of the flasher [sic] was properly assessed. The transaction does not constitute a resale to a governmental agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed the defendant\u2019s assessment of a tax deficiency to the Superior Court. The parties submitted a stipulation of facts to <em>Hon. Howard W. Alcorn, </em>state trial referee, acting as atrial court, who rendered judgment for the plaintiff. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 234, 475 A.2d 343 (1982). He concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the services of watchmen and traffic officers and the rental of lighting equipment was not a \u2018use\u2019 of those items by the plaintiff but rather it was a sale of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>items to the state, a tax exempt agency. General Statutes \u00a7 12-421 (a). Consequently, the plaintiff is not liable for a sales and use tax on those items.\u201d Id., 239. The defendant then appealed to the Appellate Court. In a per curiam opinion the Appellate Court, relying upon the opinion of the trial court, found that there was no error committed below. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>2 Conn. App. 165, 476 A.2d 639 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We therefore must decide whether the Appellate Court was correct when it upheld the decision of the trial court. That court identified the issue before it to be \u201cwhether the trial court erred in finding that the services in question and the rental of equipment were resold to the state and were therefore exempt from the use tax.\u201d Id., 166. In an appeal, after certification from the judgment of the Appellate Court, \u201cthe focus of our review is not the actions of the trial court, but the actions of the Appellate Court. We do not hear the appeal de novo.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985). We will only consider those issues which have been raised by the petition for certification. In the present case, therefore, we need to determine only whether the Appellate Court erred in upholding the decision of the trial court that the services and rentals in question were sold by the plaintiff to the DOT rather than being used by the plaintiff. If the Appellate Court is correct in its conclusion, the plaintiff is exempt from tax because the sales and use tax is not imposed on tangible personal property or services held for resale or subsequently sold to the state of Connecticut. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-410, 12-411, 12-412 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 12-408 (1), a sales tax is \u201cimposed on all retailers at the rate of seven per cent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property . . . sold at retail or . . . from . . . [t]he rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of any service described in any of the subparagraphs (A) to (M), inclusive, under subdivision (j) of said subsection (2) of section 12-407 . . . The terms \u201csale\u201d and \u201cselling\u201d under these statutes are defined, in pertinent part, to mean and include \u201c(j) the rendering of certain services for a consideration . . .\u2019\u2019among which are \u201c(C) . . . agencies providing personnel services\u201d and \u201c(E) . . . patrol work, watchmen and armored car services\u201d and \u201c(k) the leasing or rental of tangible personal property of any kind whatsoever . . . .\u2019\u2019General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 12-407 (2). Also, General Statutes \u00a7 12-411 (1) imposes a use tax on the \u201cstorage, acceptance, consumption or any other use in this state of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer for storage, acceptance, consumption or any other use in this state or the acceptance or receipt of any services constituting a sale . . . .\u201d The liability for this use tax is on \u201c[e]very person storing, accepting, consuming or otherwise using in this state services or tangible personal property purchased from a retailer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-411 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The difference between a sales and a use tax is that generally a sales tax is imposed on items acquired within the state and a use tax is imposed on items acquired outside the state for use within this state. <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 600, 362 A.2d 847 (1975). Although the record does not disclose the source of the services and property acquired by the plaintiff, on the stipulated facts it is not necessary to distinguish between a sales and a use tax in order to determine the plaintiff\u2019s tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 12-411 (9),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is presumed, for the purposes of the use tax, that any tangible per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>sonal property or service sold for delivery in this state is for use in this state and therefore subject to tax unless the person making the sale proves the contrary. There is also a presumption, for the purpose of the sales tax, that all gross receipts are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. General Statutes \u00a7 12-410 (1). The seller is relieved of his burden of proving nontaxability in either instance if the purchaser gives him a certificate that the service or tangible personal property is held for resale. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-411 (9), (10), 12-410 (1), (2). It is clear that the plaintiff held a valid sales and use tax permit under \u00a7 12-409 and was authorized to issue resale certificates. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-410 (2), 12-411 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The plaintiff claims that it is exempt from the sales and use tax because the services of the watchmen, trafficmen and flagmen were purchased and the highway flashers were rented with the intent to resell them to the state, as evidenced by the issuance of the resale certificates, and were, in fact, resold to the state, a tax exempt entity. Under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-411 (12) and 12-410 (4), however, a purchaser who gives a resale certificate is subject to a tax if he makes any use of the service or property \u201cother than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business.\u201d Therefore, if the plaintiff used the services or property rather than reselling them to the state, the plaintiff would be liable for the use or sales tax. The basic issue addressed by the Appellate Court was whether the items involved became, under the contracts between the parties, contracts for services or contracts to sell the items to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Generally, taxing statutes are strictly construed. <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 571, 440 A.2d 767 (1981); <em>Naylor </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>166 Conn. 581, 587, 353 A.2d 709 (1974). \u201cAny statute creating a tax exemption must likewise be strictly construed against the party claiming an exemption.\u201d <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra; see <em>Connecticut Theater Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>179 Conn. 672, 677, 427 A.2d 863 (1980); <em>Crescent Beach Assn. </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>170 Conn. 66, 71, 363 A.2d 1045 (1976). Therefore, in the present case we must strictly construe this sale for resale exemption against the plaintiff. The law allows the plaintiff to use this exemption only if the services and rentals were clearly for resale rather than being \u201cused\u201d by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We do not agree with the Appellate Court that the degree of control given the DOT by contract over the services and rentals in question supports a determination that those services and rentals were resold by the plaintiff to the state. Although the DOT did exercise a substantial degree of control over the deployment of those services and rentals, the purpose of retaining such control was to ensure the safety of the public. The commissioner of transportation by statute has the duty of maintaining the safety of the highways. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 13a-110, 13a-116, 13a-144. The commissioner of transportation, in order to fulfill his statutory obligation, required the plaintiff to have safety personnel and warning devices and exercised control over those services and devices in order to ensure the safety of the public while the plaintiff was engaged in the construction of highways and bridges. This control, however, is not the major factor in the determination of whether there was a resale to the state. The fact that the DOT exercised control over the manner in which certain services and rentals were to be used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>plaintiff in the execution of its construction contracts does not make the state a purchaser of those services and rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The court must look to the intention of the parties to the contract to determine whether the items in a contract are held for resale or were purchased for a different purpose. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>141 Conn. 530, 537-38, 107 A.2d 398 (1954). This court held in <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 601, that a contractor who purchased materials for the construction of a building had used the materials. That conclusion was reached because the contractor was \u201cnot in the business of selling materials. He [was] in the business of using them to build houses. . . .\u201d Id., quoting <em>G. S. Lyon &amp; Sons Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>23 Ill. 2d 180, 185, 177 N.E.2d 316 (1961). The plaintiff in the present case is in the business of constructing highways and bridges rather than in the business of reselling the services of watchmen, flagmen and trafficmen or flasher rentals. The services and rentals were used by the plaintiff, as were the materials in <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co., </em>because they were a necessary part of the process of constructing the bridges and highways. Even if the contract had not required that the plaintiff obtain these services and rentals, the plaintiff would have had to obtain similar services and rentals in order to ensure the safety of the public during the process of construction. Under these circumstances, therefore, the intention of the parties was for the plaintiff to use the services and rentals in the construction process rather than to resell them to the DOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Where the transaction is only incidental to a service performed for the purchaser, it is not considered a sale for tax purposes. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 539. In the present situation, the services and rentals provided by the plaintiff to the DOT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>under the contracts were merely incidental to the plaintiff s primary business of constructing highways and bridges. Under its various contracts for the construction of highways and bridges, the plaintiff was obligated to provide the personnel and warning devices for safety and security purposes. The plaintiff provided them even though their cost to the plaintiff was greater than the amount it charged the DOT pursuant to those contracts. The plaintiffs sole purpose in providing those items was to obtain and perform contracts to build highways and bridges. The plaintiff was not in the business of providing security services or warning devices. Those items were simply necessary for the plaintiff to fulfill the terms of its construction contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the services and rentals in question were incidental to the plaintiffs performance of the construction contracts. The plaintiff did not hold them for resale. Even though the DOT exercised control over the services and rentals in question, the intent of the parties and the incidental nature of the services and rentals compels a conclusion that the plaintiff \u201cused\u201d them to fulfill its contracts. Thus, when we strictly construe the exemption contained in that statute, the plaintiff does not qualify for the sale for resale exemption. The Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion, therefore, that the plaintiff was exempt from the sales and use tax because it resold the services and rentals to the state was incorrect. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-411 (12), 12-410 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded with direction that the judgment of the trial court is to be set aside with judgment to be directed in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] Sec. 12-418. reassessments.
