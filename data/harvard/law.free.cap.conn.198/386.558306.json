After several competency hearings, where he was found incompetent to stand trial, the defendant eventually was found competent. At the ensuing trial he was convicted by a jury of felony murder on October 5, 1977. This court, however, subsequently set aside the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>182 Conn. 580, 438 A.2d 778 (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a second trial, the defendant was again convicted of felony murder after a trial to a jury. From this judgment the defendant appeals, claiming that the trial court erred (1) in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for another murder, and, (2) in charging the jury concerning the definition of insanity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>On November 4, 1974, at approximately 6:20 p.m., the defendant registered as a guest at a Holiday Inn in New Haven. Later that evening, the defendant was seen in the lobby and the hotel bar adjacent to it. At about the same time the victim, Robert Roth, was seen in the hotel dining room. The victim had been residing at the hotel for several years. Because the dining room was closed by the time the victim had finished eating, he was required to exit through the hotel bar. There was no testimony that anyone had seen the defendant and the victim together. Some time after 10 p.m. that evening, Roth was robbed and murdered. Several items of jewelry and other personal possessions were taken from him, including a University of New Haven class ring bearing his initials. Although the victim did not smoke, a \u201cKool\u201d cigarette was found in his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Later the same evening, the defendant illegally entered an apartment in close proximity to the Holiday Inn, where he attacked and sexually assaulted its female occupant. The defendant then fell asleep, whereupon the woman left the apartment and called the police. The police apprehended the defendant, still asleep, at the apartment. When the defendant was arrested, he had in his possession a package of \u201cKool\u201d cigarettes, a class ring engraved with the initials \u201cR.I.R.\u201d and other items belonging to Roth. The defendant was then transported to police headquarters, where, the following day, he consented to the search of his hotel room. A search of the room uncovered only a single, unsmoked \u201cKool\u201d cigarette. Blood stains on the clothing worn by the defendant at the time of his arrest were found to be of the same blood type as that of Roth.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The police conducted a routine computer check which revealed that the defendant had been charged with a homicide in Richmond, Virginia, and had fled that state with the charge still pending. Subsequent to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ant\u2019s first conviction for the murder of Roth, he was extradited to Virginia where he was convicted of the murder in Richmond and sentenced accordingly. The defendant returned to Connecticut pursuant to a judicial order in order to be present at his second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The defendant did not testify at trial, nor did he concede that he had murdered Roth. Most of the defendant\u2019s case consisted of psychiatric testimony concerning his mental illness. Two expert witnesses testified that, at the time of the murder, the defendant was suffering from acute schizophrenia that seriously affected his ability to function and substantially limited his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. In rebuttal, the state offered one expert who was unable to state conclusively whether or not the defendant was legally sane at the time the murder was committed. The jury was instructed correctly that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only the essential elements of the felony murder charge, but also the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior conviction for a murder in Virginia. Prior to trial, the state had disclosed that it intended to introduce various instances of prior misconduct of the defendant, including his Virginia murder conviction. Before the defendant called his first expert witness on insanity, he requested an advance ruling barring the state from cross-examining his witnesses concerning his prior convictions, including the Virginia murder conviction. The court did not rule on the matter at that time, postponing a resolution until the substance of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony had been heard. After the defendant concluded his direct exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>nation of the expert witness, he renewed his motion to bar evidence of the prior convictions, claiming irrelevance and undue prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ruled that the state could inquire into the Virginia murder, stating that \u201cwhen one gets into the question of insanity his entire life opens up, so to speak . ...\u201d On cross-examination the prosecutor attempted to elicit from the psychiatrist the effect the Virginia murder would have upon his conclusion that the defendant was criminally insane at the time of the murder of Roth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s mention of the detailed circumstances of the Virginia murder because there was no evidence of those facts. On the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s improper reference to these facts, the defendant made a motion for a mistrial. The court denied the motion but did instruct the prosecutor to limit his questions to the defendant\u2019s conviction for the robbery and murder of a guest at a Holiday Inn in Virginia and to refrain from discussing the facts underlying that conviction. The jury was then instructed to disregard any references to the circumstances of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>crime previously made by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor resumed cross-examination and the witness testified that the existence of a conviction for a prior similar act was not inconsistent with his conclusion that the defendant was a schizophrenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court should not have admitted evidence of the Virginia murder conviction because its prejudicial effect greatly exceeded its probative value. The basis for the trial court\u2019s admission of the defendant\u2019s prior murder conviction was that evidence of other crimes, especially those similar to the charged offense, is admissible because <em>\u201ca </em>plea of insanity opens wide the door to all evidence relating to the defendant and his environment.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>247 Ind. 454, 461, 217 N.E.2d 147 (1966). Recognizing that a plea of insanity triggers a broad inquiry into the defendant\u2019s entire life, courts have admitted evidence of prior misconduct because of its significance in showing the mental condition of the defendant, when such evidence would ordinarily be excluded. See <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Ala. App. 10, 237 So. 2d 121 (1970); <em>Burgunder </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>55 Ariz. 411, 103 P.2d 256 (1940); <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanda, </em>111 Ill.

Ct. 648, 17 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 143-44, 374 A.2d 150 (1976). There are, however, several exceptions to this general rule. \u201cEvidence of other misconduct, although not ordinarily admissible to prove the bad character or criminal tendencies of the accused, may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as intent, identity, malice, motive or a system of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>nal activity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 353, 446 A.2d 382 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 156-57, 502 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 701, 364 A.2d 186 (1975). Where insanity has been raised as a defense to a crime, other misconduct bearing upon that issue is similarly admitted as an exception to the general prohibition against such evidence. Once the insanity defense is asserted by a defendant the state is entitled to use relevant evidence of prior crimes to rebut it. This rule, of course, is subject to the constraint that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 134, 486 A.2d 637 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 676, 469 A.2d 760 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>159 Conn. 169, 173, 268 A.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The trial court concluded that evidence of the Virginia murder was relevant after the testimony of the psychiatrist who based his conclusions, in part, on the significance of the sexual assault which resulted in the defendant\u2019s arrest and on evidence of a subsequent bribe he offered to a police officer when in custody at the police station. The psychiatrist testified that it would be extremely significant and diagnostic of schizophrenic behavior to commit rape immediately after brutally murdering another person because \u201conly a schizophrenic could . . . commit a murder of this magnitude . . . and then [commit] some form of sexual act.\u201d He also testified that falling asleep after the rape is highly indicative of insane conduct as it clearly evinces an individual\u2019s inability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. Further, the offering of a bribe, he contended, would be consistent with schizophrenic behavior. Since the psychiatrist had referred to two other crimes as having significance in buttressing his opinion, the court properly concluded that evidence of a prior murder conviction, especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>where the crime occurred only four months before the present incident and under similar factual circumstances, would also be relevant on the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We are required also to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>supra. Although the defendant here did not admit that he had killed the victim, the focus of the defendant\u2019s case was clearly his insanity at the time of the murder. It is difficult to perceive, therefore, how the evidence of the Virginia murder was so prejudicial as to outweigh its probative value on the issue of insanity. The danger of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is that a jury may use the information not for the limited purpose of its admission, but to establish the guilt of the perpetrator of the crime by assuming that \u201c \u2018if he did it before, he probably did so this time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 F.2d 936, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1029, 88 S. Ct. 1421, 20 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1968). In bringing before the jury evidence of the crimes of sexual assault and bribery as a basis for the opinion of the psychiatrist upon the insanity issue, the defendant must have been aware of the risk that the persuasiveness of the state\u2019s evidence that he was the killer would be enhanced. He recognized, nevertheless, the significant probative value of such evidence upon his principal defense to the crime, insanity at the time of its commission. Although it must be conceded that the Virginia murder had a greater potential for prejudice because of its similarity to the crime charged, its relevance upon the insanity issue was clearer than that of the other crimes for the same reason. In fact, one of the psychiatrists testified, after the court had allowed the inquiries related to the Virginia murder, that \u201conly someone who is schizophrenic can really . . . commit the same horrendous crime twice in so short a period of time.\u201d This evidence, therefore, provided an addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tional basis for the defendant\u2019s defense of insanity. The state did not attempt to use evidence of the Virginia murder solely to establish his propensity to commit a violent murder. The state referred to the Virginia conviction only to refute the expert\u2019s conclusions regarding the defendant\u2019s insanity. Finally, the court instructed the jury to consider the evidence only on the issue of insanity and not as proof that he had committed the crime in question. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>682 F.2d 493, 500 (5th Cir. 1982). In light of these factors, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the evidence was admissible on the issue of insanity because its probative value on the issue outweighed any possible prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the issue of insanity were erroneous because they included not only the appropriate statutory definition of insanity found in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13, but also previously accepted common law definitions. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 424 A.2d 293 (1979); <em>M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, </em>8 Eng. Rep. 718, 722 (1843). We decline to review this claim because the defendant failed properly to except to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The defendant filed a written request to charge on the insanity issue, urging the court to charge the jury upon the statutory definition of insanity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During its charge to the jury, the court on four occasions correctly recited the statutory definition. After the second recitation of the statutory standard, however, the court further defined insanity by providing the jury with two outdated common law definitions. At the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the charge, the defendant did except to the trial court\u2019s definition of insanity but only to the extent that it failed \u201cto actually define the terms disease and defect\u201d and \u201cto provide a standard by which the jury can, in fact, decide whether a disease or defect was present.\u201d The defendant did not raise any exception with respect to the use of the common law definitions. The requirement that the claim be raised \u201cdistinctly\u201d means that it must be \u201cso stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Woodruff v. Butler, </em>75 Conn. 679, 682, 55 A. 167 (1903). The exception to the charge was inadequate to alert the trial court to the specific deficiency now claimed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The failure of the defendant to state distinctly the matter being objected to immediately after the conclusion of the charge ordinarily renders the claim of error unreviewable on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 854, 3063. In the absence of a specific timely exception, a claim of error is \u201creviewable as an exceptional circumstance within the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), only when the defendant can demonstrate that he has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or under Practice Book \u00a7 3063 as plain error.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 196-97, 502 A.2d 858 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As we recently have held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87, 502 A.2d 388 (1985), and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 134, 502 A.2d 381 (1985), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>failure properly to object to a court\u2019s charge on insanity renders the claim of error unreviewable by this court even under the exceptional circumstances doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, because the trial court is under no <em>constitutional </em>obligation to charge the jury with a definition of insanity that is \u201cbeyond criticism in every particular.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>supra. In each of those cases, because the defendants took no exception to the trial court\u2019s charge on insanity their respective claims of error were not reviewed by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>198 Conn. 314, 502 A.2d 865 (1986). The fact that the defendant here did except to the court\u2019s insanity charge does not alter the analysis, because he failed to identify specifically in his exception the inclusion of the outdated definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In this case, the court charged the jury four times with the proper statutory definition of insanity. The mere fact that the court once interjected additional common law definitions of insanity does not raise any fundamental constitutional right that would warrant review. Nor has the presence of the additional insanity definitions \u201cconstituted a manifest injustice to the defendant so as to impair the effectiveness or integrity of his trial,\u201d as is necessary to establish plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> The defendant\u2019s original conviction was reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury to draw \u201cno adverse inferences\u201d from the failure of the defendant to testify as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 582, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 333-34, 438 A.2d 93 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"> During argument of this appeal the defendant withdrew his claim, which had been briefed, that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that the offense of manslaughter is a lesser included offense of felony murder. On the basis of principles articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 441 (1980), we recently rejected such a contention in <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 429, 493 A.2d 223 (1985). <em>See State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>188 Conn. 542, 547-49, 450 A.2d 374 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-5\"> On appeal the defendant also challenges the authenticity of the Virginia conviction because a certified copy of the judgment was not produced. See <em>State </em>v. <em>English, </em>132 Conn. 573, 581-82, 46 A.2d 121 (1946). The defendant, however, waived his right to object on that ground, because, at trial, he objected only on the basis of relevancy and undue prejudice. In fact, the defendant told the court that he did not contest his conviction for the murder in Virginia but objected only to the particular facts underlying it, because there was no evidence of those facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\"> \u201cLet me take you back to August 8, 1974, to the Holiday Inn in Richmond, Virginia..

He has been convicted of that. Now, don\u2019t you think there is some similarity to that murder and what he is charged with here today? He is in a Holiday Inn in Richmond, Virginia.
