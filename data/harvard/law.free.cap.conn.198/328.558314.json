The robbers absconded with $8282 in a 1973 rust colored Ford Torino automobile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the robbers were driving away, bank employees were able to write down the Connecticut license plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The jury could reasonably have found these additional facts: At approximately 10:10 a.m. on the day of the bank robbery, a farmer, Robert Rumovicz, was driving a tractor towing a hay bind, with an overall length of 22-24 feet, north along Second Hill Road in Bridge-water. Second Hill Road borders Rumovicz\u2019 dairy farm. A small yellow or cream colored car with a woman, later identified as the defendant, in the driver\u2019s seat was parked on the right hand side of the road. The farmer expected the woman to move the car because the road was particularly narrow at that point and he knew he would have some difficulty in moving the hay bind past her car. It took Rumovicz approximately forty to sixty seconds to pass the car, and, as he did so, he stared at the driver in an attempt to display his irritation and annoyance with her for not moving her car. About ten minutes after Rumovicz passed the defendant\u2019s car, he returned on the same road back to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>farm. The car was no longer parked on the road but a rust colored Ford Torino, later identified as the one used by the robbers to flee from the bank and as having been stolen, was parked in the same area. Police officers were already examining the Ford when Rumovicz arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">A second witness, Alice Borodenko, testified that she was driving south on Second Hill Road at approximately 10:20 a.m. on the day of the robbery when she saw a small new cream colored car parked on the opposite side of the road with a woman in the driver\u2019s seat. At this same time, Borodenko saw a reddish-brown or \u201croot beer colored\u201d car approaching from the opposite direction and she stopped her car to allow it to pass the cream colored car. The reddish car, however, parked behind the cream colored car and two men got out of the car. The passenger grabbed a package from the back seat of the car. Borodenko continued driving, and while looking in her rearview mirror, she saw both men run to the other car and she saw one man open a door of the cream colored car. At this point her car had negotiated either a dip in the road or a curve and she was then unable to view the men further. A few minutes later, when the police arrived on the scene, only the Ford, identified as the same car Borodenko had seen, was still parked on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Rumovicz was able to give a description of the car and its driver to the police within minutes after seeing them. He described the car to the police as a beige/tan/ yellow Dodge because he recognized its emblem and because he saw a red and white Dodge dealer vanity plate on the front of the car after he had passed it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later in the day of the robbery, Rumovicz accompanied police officers to a Dodge dealership where he iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tified the model of the car as an Omni. At a second Dodge dealership, Rumovicz identified a Bosco Dodge dealer\u2019s plate as the plate that he had observed was on the front of the defendant\u2019s car. It was undisputed that the defendant was driving a rented yellow 1981 Dodge Omni with a Bosco Dodge vanity or dealer front plate on the day of the robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant, a grant administrator for the town of Beacon Falls, reported late to work on Friday, July 31, arriving sometime between 11:08 and 11:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On the day of the robbery, Rumovicz also described the woman driver of the Dodge as heavy set\u2014\u201cheavier at the bottom than at the top.\u201d She was approximately 30 years old and she was wearing tinted eyeglasses, with large frames rounded at the bottom. He testified that she was wearing a white dress with black prints or circles spaced evenly over the dress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rumovicz\u2019 initial description to the police also included a description of the woman\u2019s hair as a \u201cShirley Temple hairdo,\u201d greasy looking and oily, with an \u201cunnatural\u201d appearance. He later testified at trial that she had a \u201cbirthmark, a mole or something\u201d on her face. At trial, a little more than two months after the robbery, Rumovicz positively identified the defendant as the driver once she had put on her glasses at defense counsel\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On the basis of Rumovicz\u2019 initial description of the woman driver of the Omni, Detective Robert Connor of the Connecticut state police had a suspect in mind\u2014 the defendant Marguerite Findlay. On the afternoon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of the robbery, Connor asked Rumovicz to accompany him to the Beacon Falls town hall parking lot to view an automobile. While in the parking lot, and after Rumovicz identified the defendant\u2019s car as the one he had seen earlier on Second Hill Road, the defendant left the town hall and walked to her car. Rumovicz identified the defendant as resembling or \u201cstrongly\u201d resembling the woman he had seen earlier that day in the Omni, except for her hair. Rumovicz also testified that a photograph of the defendant shown to him by Connor several days after the robbery \u201clooked\u201d like the woman he had seen in the Omni.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cWhen a verdict is challenged because of insufficient evidence, the issue is whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>161 Conn. 404, 407, 288 A.2d 411 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>182 Conn. 403, 410, 438 A.2d 120 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>196 Conn. 36, 44, 490 A.2d 1000 (1985). \u201cThe evidence must be given a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant was the driver of the Dodge Omni Rumovicz had seen on the morning of the robbery. Rumovicz positively identified her at trial, including testifying to a corroborating birthmark or mole which he did not see in either the parking lot identification or in the side-view photograph shown to him by Connor. While Rumovicz had not told the police about this birthmark or mole, he testified at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>trial that he repeatedly recalled that he \u201ckept looking back at the [defendant\u2019s] face\u201d on Second Hill Road and \u201cI kept seeing a birthmark or a mole.\u201d There was evidence at the trial that the defendant has \u201ca birthmark or brownish mark over the left side of her upper lip.\u201d Although her hair did not match his initial description, the jury could reasonably have inferred that she had somehow altered her hair style in order to avoid recognition, as Rumovicz had described the hair as unnatural looking.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Borodenko corroborated the description of the car and she also saw two men running from the Ford Torino towards the Dodge Omni and opening one of the doors. Although Borodenko did not see the men enter the car, the jury could reasonably have inferred that the sequence of events explained how, within minutes of the robbery, the Dodge Omni was gone, the two robbers had abandoned the Ford and were able to flee the area. The defendant\u2019s alibi defense of purchasing gasoline at a certain Mobil gas station could not be confirmed. The attendant working at the gas station on July 31, 1981, from 6:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. testified that he did not remember seeing a subcompact car fitting the description of the getaway car that he had heard broadcast over a police scanner come into the station that morning. Nor did he remember seeing the defendant come into the station that morning. In addition, the defendant was absent from work for most of the morning of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The jury, as the trier of fact, determines the credibility of witnesses, and it is not the province of this court to retry the facts or to determine the weight which should have been accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony. Viewing the evidence as a whole and in a light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict, we cannot say that there was insufficient evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>contrary, the facts proved, and the reasonable and logical inferences that the jury could draw from them, strongly support the verdict finding the defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree by aiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error is that the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress identification. The defendant filed a motion to suppress any testimony of Robert Rumovicz \u201cregarding any possible identification of [the defendant] subsequent to the morning of July 31,1981, as there was an impermissibly suggestive identification procedure utilized by the state which fatally taints any subsequent in Court or out of Court identifications.\u201d A hearing on the motion to suppress was held in the absence of the jury and before there was an in-court identification of the defendant by Rumovicz.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The motion was denied by the trial court and a proper exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The two out-of-court identification procedures at issue occurred on July 31, 1981, and approximately a week to ten days later. The first identification procedure occurred on the afternoon of the robbery at the Beacon Falls town hall parking lot. Connor, who accompanied Rumovicz to the lot, testified that the \u201cprimary reason\u201d for the trip was to view an automobile. Connor had some information that the defendant would be leaving work at approximately 4 p.m. The viewing of the automobile took place at approximately 3:30 p.m., and, \u201cwithin moments\u201d of the identification of the car by Rumovicz, the defendant walked from the town hall to the Dodge Omni. The distance between the car in which Connor and Rumovicz were seated and the Dodge Omni was approximately 75 to 100 feet. The detective did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>not expect the defendant to be in the parking lot at that particular time as the trial court found at the hearing on the motion to suppress. Rumovicz indicated to the detective that the defendant \u201cstrongly resembled\u201d the woman in the Omni that morning, \u201conly the hair was different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The second identification procedure occurred at Rumovicz\u2019 farm approximately ten days after the robbery. Connor was questioning an employee of Rumovicz, who was a witness to another incident under investigation, and was showing him several photographs. When Rumovicz approached Connor, who was seated in his car, he briefly showed Rumovicz a single photograph of the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The detective held the picture while Rumovicz viewed it from outside the car. Rumovicz said the photograph resembled the woman in the car but that the hair was not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The state did not offer evidence of either out-of-court procedure. The defense, however, did elicit evidence of the two out-of-court identification procedures for impeachment purposes after the court denied the motion to suppress and permitted the in-court identification of the defendant by Rumovicz.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The defendant claims that both out-of-court identification procedures were impermissibly and unnecessarily suggestive and that, therefore, the in-court identification was erroneously admitted. We do not agree. As this court has repeatedly stated, the required inquiry in determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights is \u201cmade on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the 'totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The first identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive. The defendant, in making her claim, argues that the viewing of the defendant in the town hall parking lot was akin to a \u201cshow-up\u201d\u2014the presentation of a single suspect to an eyewitness for possible identification. Unlike many cases in which a suspect in the custody of the police is presented to a witness for identification; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>170 Conn. 601, 368 A.2d 66 (1976); the defendant was not under arrest at the time of the viewing, she was not in custody, and most significantly, the viewing was unplanned, as the trial court found. The primary purpose of the detective and Rumovicz was to view the defendant\u2019s car before she left that day from work. The fact that she left work approximately one-half hour early could not be attributed to any arrangement by Connor. There is no support to the defendant\u2019s claim that the town hall parking lot viewing was unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The second identification procedure involved a single photograph of the defendant shown to Rumovicz by Connor. Upon a \u201cmotion to suppress evidence based upon photographic identifications, the defendant as the moving party must bear the initial burden of proving that the photographic identification was unconstitutional in some manner.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 570, 469 A.2d 397 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 608, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 235, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1975). As the defendant notes, the \u201ctest of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure depends on the facts and cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>cumstances of each case.\u201d See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 383, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Soriano, 2 </em>Conn. App. 127, 130-31, 476 A.2d 633 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The defendant argues that the viewing of the single photograph by Rumovicz was unnecessarily and impermissibly suggestive. Absent exigent circumstances that require police officers \u201cpromptly [to establish] either the defendant\u2019s complicity or his innocence\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>198 Conn. 68, 74, 502 A.2d 368 (1985); the showing of a single photograph of a defendant is almost always unnecessarily and impermissibly suggestive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 667, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. , 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1985). As there were no exigent circumstances or other compelling reason present to justify the showing of the photo, we agree with the defendant that the second identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Although the viewing of the photo was unnecessarily suggestive, the defendant still cannot prevail because the in-court identification itself was nevertheless reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. \u201c[Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>189 Conn. 183, 192, 455 A.2d 843 (1983); <em>see Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 250-51, 476 A.2d 550 (1984). The factors to be considered in a reliability analysis are well established.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra; <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972). The defendant has failed to sustain her burden of proving that the viewing of the photograph in this case was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The reliability of the identification is disclosed by the circumstances set out below. The facts surrounding the display of the photo indicate that it was unplanned and unarranged. Connor was present at Rumovicz\u2019 farm investigating an unrelated incident in which a white Dodge Omni was stuck in a ditch on that same portion of Second Hill Road in which the defendant was seen in a Dodge Omni. The detective was speaking to one of Rumovicz\u2019 farm employees who had helped the woman involved in that incident. Of the photographs he was showing the employee, one was a photograph of the defendant taken after her arrest. The viewing of the photo by Rumovicz, after he had voluntarily approached the detective, was brief. At trial, Rumovicz testified that the photo he saw was of the defendant at a party or surrounded by other people.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, at trial, Rumovicz did not \u201creally remember the photo that much.\u201d There is little evidence, if any, that the photograph so briefly viewed by Rumovicz figured into his in-court identification of the defendant. Rumovicz had an ample opportunity to view the defendant through her open car window on a clear day. He focused carefully on her face in order to express his annoyance with her. He made a positive in-court identification of the defendant. Included in his in-court identification of the defendant was the description of a mole or birthmark which Rumovicz had not previously mentioned and which could not have been observed in either pretrial identification procedure. This corroborating evidence as well as his detailed initial description and his observations on the morning of July 31,1981, form the entire basis for his in-court identification. Thus, neither procedure tainted his in-court identification. We particularly note that the trial court said: \u201c[I] find that his [in-court] identification is based entirely upon his obser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>vations made on the morning of July 31st [the date of the robbery], and it\u2019s not tainted at all by any subsequent view in the Beacon Falls parking lot or having seen a snapshot for a matter of seconds, some week or ten days later.\u201d We also point out that \u201c[t]he credibility of the witnesses in a challenge to identification evidence is a question for the trial court to determine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>supra, 610; <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>supra, 571-72.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra, 246. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The defendant raised two claims arising out of the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial. We discuss those claims seriatim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The first claim is that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that the defendant was with two men in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>a Dodge Omni on July 29,1981. The state claims that the evidence was properly admissible as relevant to a demonstration that the defendant was associated with two men in a car matching the description of the automobile seen by Robert Rumovicz on Second Hill Road the morning of the robbery. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The state introduced evidence at trial, through two witnesses, that the defendant was seen in Naugatuck with two men in a Dodge Omni with a Bosco Dodge vanity plate. The first witness, an acquaintance of the defendant\u2019s from high school, testified that he saw Marguerite Findlay seated in a car two days before the robbery, on July 29,1981, around 4 or 5 p.m. The witness testified, after defense counsel objected, that the other occupants of the car were two men. The first witness was unable to describe the car in which the defendant was seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The second witness for the state testified that he owned the laundromat in front of which the Dodge Omni was parked on July 29, 1981. The first witness had been visiting him in his store on the afternoon of July 29,1981. The second witness noticed a beige subcompact car with a Bosco Dodge plate pull up in front of his store and testified, over defense objection, that there were two men in the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The defendant, upon cross-examination by the state, admitted being at the laundromat in Naugatuck on July 29,1981, in the afternoon, with two men in a yellow Dodge Omni. Defense counsel objected on relevancy grounds to the state\u2019s question to the defendant: \u201cAnd who were you with?\u201d The defendant named two individuals, John Paul Reid and Rodney Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u201cRulings on relevancy are within the wide discretion of the trial court and will only be reversed for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>194 Conn. 392, 399, 480 A.2d 547 (1984). \u201cEvidence is admissible when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>155 Conn. 516, 523, 235 A.2d 639 (1967); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>168 Conn. 309, 317, 362 A.2d 893 (1975). This challenged evidence placed the defendant in the type of car observed by Rumovicz on Second Hill Road on the morning of the robbery and again that afternoon in the town hall parking lot. In addition, Alice Borodenko testified that on the morning of the robbery she observed two men, one with a package, running to that type of car after they had alighted from a Ford car which the Bridgewater bank robbers had used. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this evidence. The state\u2019s proffer of evidence of the actions of the defendant two days before the robbery does have a tendency to prove the defendant committed the crime with which she was charged. The evidence was relevant and admissible and, as such, the jury was free to weigh the testimony as it would any other piece of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial under Practice Book \u00a7 902, she assigns as constitutional error, and as error which was materially injurious to her, the \u201cstate\u2019s references in direct and cross-examination to Rodney Johnson and John Paul Reid.\u201d The motion was denied by the trial court. \u201cOn a motion for a new trial . . . the court has discretion to weigh the evidence and to consider the credibility of witnesses to determine whether \u2018the interests of justice\u2019 require the granting of relief.\u201d <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 520 n.12, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984); see Practice Book \u00a7 902. The granting of such a motion is within the court\u2019s discretion. At no time did the state claim that the two men who had been in the Omni on July 29, 1981, were also the robbers who were seen abandoning their Ford Torino and running toward the Omni in which the defendant was seated. Any inferences that could be drawn from such evidence were left to the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of fact. The trial court which is in a better position than this court to \u201cconsider the credibility of witnesses\u201d determined that these circumstances did not require a new trial in the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d The defendant has failed to sustain her burden of proving that the elicitation of the two men\u2019s names was \u201cmaterially injurious\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim in her motion for a new trial is that she was deprived of a fair trial and of her right to due process under the federal and state constitutions by certain remarks made by the prosecutor in closing argument. She also claims that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In closing argument, defense counsel referred to the defendant\u2019s background, including her schooling, and her daughter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor made the following remarks to the jury: \u201cNow, Mr. Gill told you to consider one last thing; that was the background of this woman. And he told you\u2014he listed the stuff, the background education stuff that he first delivered through testimony when Mrs. Findlay first got on the stand. His Honor will tell you that sympathy should not play a part in your deliberations. The fact that she\u2019s a mother, living alone with her child, has nothing to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>with what you do in this courtroom. We can turn around and look at the kind of people she was hanging around with at the Bounce, as she referred to it. And certainly you can tell from some of the goings on that maybe a different picture could be painted, if we were allowed to. But His Honor will tell you that that\u2019s not something that you can consider in sitting there and deliberating in that room. What she\u2019s done before has no bearing on what she has done now.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to these remarks. In fact, he \u201cintentionally refrained from making a contemporaneous objection or requesting a cautionary instruction.\u201d The objection was therefore waived. Practice Book \u00a7 3063.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">This issue was raised in a motion for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion, stating that there was nothing in the argument which was prejudicial. The remarks at issue are considered by the state to be fair rebuttal to statements made in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. At the trial, the defendant made no objection and did not seek any other relief. On appeal, the defendant argues that this claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Because he claims the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial, we will review this claim under the \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d prong of <em>Evans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The defense counsel attempted to paint a favorable portrait of the defendant in order to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury that \u201cMarguerite Findlay is a getaway driver.\u201d In attempting to brush one more stroke onto the defense counsel\u2019s portrait in order to make it provide some contrast, the prosecutor warned the jury that \u201csympathy should not play a part in the deliberations.\u201d In contrast to the defendant\u2019s status as a single parent at home with her child, raised by defense counsel, the prosecutor questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>her status as a woman who also frequented the Bounce In and questioned the \u201ckind of people she was hanging around with [there].\u201d The prosecutor remarked that perhaps defense counsel\u2019s portrait was not the only one that could be painted, but she then specifically warned the jury that speculation should play no part in its role.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The remarks at issue in this case were not at all egregious. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). Moreover, in our examination of this claim, the action of the trial court, because of its unique vantage point, is certainly entitled to great weight in determining the propriety of remarks of counsel and their harmfulness under all the circumstances at the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 493, 496, 481 A.2d 741 (1984). We cannot agree with the defendant that the state\u2019s comments deprived her of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt impermissibly lowered the burden of proof required for conviction, in violation of her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Although this claim was not raised in the trial court by a written request to charge or an exception, the defendant\u2019s claim warrants review under the exceptional circumstance exception of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>189 Conn. 364, 456 A.2d 274 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The defendant claims that the instructions on reasonable doubt were erroneous in two respects. The first claimed error is that the court, in a portion of its definition of reasonable doubt, stated that it was a \u201cdoubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for which a valid reason can be assigned.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant, citing a dissent from a denial of certification in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>459 U.S. 932, 103 S. Ct. 242, 74 L. Ed. 2d 191 (1982) (Marshall, J.), states that the \u201cinherent defect\u201d of such an instruction is that the ability to assign a valid reason for a doubt is an ability \u201cnot given to many men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We have upheld a similar charge in the face of a constitutional challenge in <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). As we said in <em>Derrico, </em>the \u201cinstruction essentially defined a reasonable doubt as a doubt founded on reason as contrasted with a purely speculative doubt.\u201d Id., 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201c\u2018It is well established . . . that individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 746, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). \u201c[T]he test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will be done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra, 170. The court provided additional guidance to the jury on the definition of reasonable doubt. The statement challenged by the defendant was not the only definition provided. The state argues that the challenged definition was merely one in which the jurors could test the reasonableness of a doubt and that therefore the charge, taken as a whole, provided sufficient guidance for the jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The second claimed error in the court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt is in the following statement: \u201cIf you can, in reason, reconcile all the facts proven with any reasonable theory consistent with innocence, of course, you cannot find the defendant guilty. The conclusion of guilt requires proof which precludes every reasonable theory except that which tends to support and is consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. If the existence of all the facts and circumstances which you believe existed can be explained reasonably on some basis other than that the accused committed the crime charged, then the State has not made out a case. But if you find certain facts to be proven and if the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the existence of those facts is that the accused committed the crime charged, then you should not slink from drawing that inference and finding her guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant claims that this statement did not \u201cclearly instruct\u201d the jury on the doctrine of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant also claims that the instruction was constitutionally infirm because it effectively told the jury that it \u201cwould have to be able\u201d to reconcile all the facts to reach a verdict of not guilty. The instruction merely states that \u201c[i]f you, [the jury], can, in reason, reconcile all the facts . . . .\u201d This instruction by the trial court is but one method which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the jury was told it could use to help it reach a verdict. The statement is a correct statement of the law. Immediately preceding the instruction on the doctrine of proof beyond a reasonable doubt the jury was given a detailed instruction on the state\u2019s requirement that it prove every element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We cannot say that, in view of the charge read as a whole, the portions now claimed as error on appeal can be considered a basis for finding harmful error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>supra; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 464 A.2d 813 (1983). The instructions were therefore not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) provides: \u201crobbery in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ... (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, robbery in the second degree, robbery in the third degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides: \u201ccriminal liability for acts of another. A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> The appeal form, filed by trial counsel, stated that the appeal was being taken \u201cfrom a jury verdict of guilty . . .\u201d rather than from the judgment as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-263. As this defect in form is not jurisdictional in nature, it may be disregarded. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 556 n.1, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> The record does not indicate that anyone other than the defendant was arrested in connection with the robbery or that any of the money was ever recovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> The farmer used three different eolors to describe the car to the police. A Dodge dealer told the police that Omnis are not available in tan but are available in two different shades of yellow. The witnesses at the trial who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>testified about the Omni gave varying descriptions of its color, but all were able to identify it as the car claimed by the state to have been used by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> The 1981 Dodge Omni the defendant was driving on July 81,1981, had been borrowed from a friend who had rented it for several days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> A police officer testified that Rumovicz\u2019 initial description was of a white dress with a red, repetitive design.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> An in-court identification of the defendant, outside of the presence of the jury, was made by Rumovicz one day before the hearing on the motion was held. That identification was withdrawn by the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> Connor testified that the photograph was taken at the state police barracks the day the defendant was arrested. It was a Polaroid instant photograph with a profile of the right side of the defendant\u2019s face and hair. There were no marks on the photograph indicating when, where, or for what purpose, it was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The factors include a consideration of: the witness\u2019 opportunity to view; his degree of attention; the accuracy of his description; his level of certainty; and the time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114-15, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\"> The photo admitted into evidence was only of the right side of the defendant\u2019s face and hair. There was no other person in the photograph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> The defendant also claims, while admitting \u201cprecedent is squarely against her,\u201d that the photo displayed to Robert Rumovicz, in the absence of her counsel, violated her federal and state constitutional rights. The defendant did not raise this issue below; Practice Book \u00a7 3063; and seeks to raise it on appeal under State v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The question of when this photographic display actually took place, and hence, whether the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached, is unanswered. The arrest by warrant itself does not start the initiation of adversary criminal proceedings. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 232, 460 A.2d 961 (1983). As no fundamental constitutional right has been implicated, this claim does not present an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d reviewable under <em>Evans. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>413 U.S. 300, 321, 93 S. Ct. 2568, 37 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1973) (the sixth amendment does not grant the right to counsel, even if it has attached, at photographic displays conducted by the government for the purpose of allowing a witness to attempt an identification of the offender); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 357, 446 A.2d 382 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\"> Our finding of no error on the trial court\u2019s action on the motion to suppress makes unnecessary any discussion of the third claim in the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial that challenged the out-of-court identification procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> The defense counsel had previously made the following remarks about the defendant\u2019s background on closing argument: \u201cNow, if the unfair identification procedure, if the alibi defense, if the time question together do not give you a reasonable doubt about whether Marguerite Findlay is a getaway driver, then how about looking at what you know about Marguerite Findlay. She\u2019s 27 years old. She has a six-year old daughter who lives [with] and is cared for by her. She\u2019s a high school graduate. She had a scholarship to UConn, where she went for two years. She was going to college full time at night. She\u2019s been a volunteer worker with handicapped kids. She\u2019s on the PTA; no criminal record whatsoever and a lousy driver, to boot. Now, this is hardly the profile of a getaway driver. Her mother doesn\u2019t even want to drive in a car. It\u2019s hard to believe that those two bank robbers are going to want her to be the driver of the car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\"> The portion of the court's instruction on the definition of reasonable doubt was as follows: \u201cThe phrase \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 has no technical or unusual meaning. You can arrive at the real meaning of it by emphasizing the word \u2018reasonable.\u2019 A reasonable doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned; it is a doubt which is something more than a guess or a surmise. It is not a conjecture or a fanciful or a captious doubt. A reasonable doubt is not a doubt which is raised by someone simply for the sake of raising a doubt; nor is it a doubt suggested by ingenuity of counsel or of a juror which is not warranted by the evidence. A reasonable doubt, in other words, is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or in the lack of evidence. It is such a doubt as in the series of affairs of your everyday life, you would pay heed to. Absolute certainty in the affairs of life is almost never attainable. And the law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty. The law does not require proof beyond all doubt. But the law does require that after hearing all the evidence, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence which leaves in the minds of the jurors, as reasonable men and women, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt and acquitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
