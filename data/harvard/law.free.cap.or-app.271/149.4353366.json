Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">L, defendant\u2019s longtime domestic partner and the mother of his children, obtained a FAPA restraining order against defendant. The restraining order awarded temporary custody of the couple\u2019s four children to L, but provided defendant with parenting time three days a week, allowing defendant to go to the curb at L\u2019s residence on those days to pick up and return the children. Otherwise, the order prohibited defendant from, among other things, \u201cintimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing\u201d L and the couple\u2019s children (or attempting to do so); being within 100 yards of L\u2019s residence or workplace; \u201cknowingly be[ing] or stay[ing] within *** 100 yards\u201d of L; and \u201c[contacting, or attempting to contact, [L] by telephone, including cell phone or text messaging directly or through third parties.\u201d At the top of the order, a box entitled \u201cNOTICE TO RESPONDENT\u201d explained that the recipient of the order \u201cmust obey all of the provisions of this Restraining Order, even if the Petitioner contacts you or gives you permission to contact him/her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Washington County Sheriffs Corporal Clifford Lascink served the order on defendant. Although defendant\u2019s primary language is Spanish, and defendant cannot read English, the order was written in English. Lascink explained, in English, \u201ccertain parts\u201d of the order to defendant, \u201cincluding that he couldn\u2019t be within 100 yards of the victim\u201d and the portions of the order discussing parenting time. Lascink also discussed \u201cthe work aspect of it, and the no contact by third parties and the cell phone * * * [a]nd also not being allowed by the residence.\u201d Lascink was aware that defendant could not read the restraining order and told defendant \u201cthat basically he could go to the courthouse.\u201d Lascink also told defendant that it was defendant\u2019s responsibility to know the contents of the order. Defendant told Lascink that he had friends who could translate it for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A few months after Lascink served the order on defendant, L was stopped for a traffic violation. L called defendant and \u201ctold him I got pulled over and if he could, you know, just swing by.\u201d Upon receiving L\u2019s phone call, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>defendant drove to L\u2019s location to provide her with assistance, but was unable to assist her \u201c[b]ecause as soon as he got out of the car, the officers asked him for his name, and that\u2019s how that went about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Based on that set of events, the state filed a \u201cComplaint for Imposition of Punitive Sanctions Contempt Violation of Restraining Order\u201d against defendant. The complaint alleged two counts of punitive contempt under ORS 33.015 and ORS 33.065:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u201cCount 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cThe defendant, on or about June 7, 2013, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and willfully disobey an order of the Washington County Circuit Court, by entering or staying within 100 yards of [L].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cCount 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">\u201cThe defendant, on or about June 7, 2013, in Washington County, Oregon did unlawfully and willfully disobey an order of the Washington County Circuit Court, by contacting [L] by telephone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The state sought the imposition of punitive sanctions in connection with the alleged violations, including a term of incarceration not to exceed six months, a fine, probation, and community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">At trial, the parties stipulated that, on June 7, 2013, [L] \u201cwas stopped for a traffic violation, called the defendant, the defendant showed up and they had personal contact at that point.\u201d The prosecutor explained that the primary issue was \u201cabout the content of the restraining order and knowing what was in [it]\u201d and \u201cwhether [defendant] understood that he was not allowed to have [the] contact\u201d that occurred on that date. The state then called Lascink and L to testify in support of its case. Both Lascink and L acknowledged that defendant could not read English. Lascink testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t remember having any problems understanding\u201d defendant\u2019s spoken English, although L stated that she and defendant communicated primarily in Spanish, and that she spoke \u201cSpanglish\u201d to defendant. Lascink described the conversation that he had with defendant at the time Lascink served the order. L described calling defendant on the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>that she was stopped for a traffic violation and seeing defendant come to the scene. L further testified that, at the time that L made the call to defendant, defendant knew about the restraining order, that the two \u201cwere not supposed to be together,\u201d and that the two were not supposed to be talking to each other on the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">After the state rested, defendant\u2019s lawyer called defendant to the stand. Before defendant could take the stand, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let\u2019s see. Having proven several violations, his girlfriend, who\u2019s very credible, has no reason to lie, has said he understood the restraining order. The officer said he understood the restraining order. And he can get on the stand and lie, and we might have a different result than if he doesn\u2019t get on the stand and lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t anticipate his lying, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m just taking,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I should put it this way. If a middle class person with 35 years of legal experience thinks he\u2019s lying, you may have a different result than if he exercises his right to remain silent. And that\u2019s true in most cases in America, on most dates. Now he has an ICE hold, so I\u2019m going to hold him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Following that exchange, defendant\u2019s lawyer conferred with defendant and then informed the court that the defense would rest. When asked if she wished to make an argument, defendant\u2019s lawyer responded, \u201cYour Honor, you heard the facts.\u201d The court immediately found defendant \u201cin contempt with each count\u201d and sanctioned defendant with one day of jail on the first count. The court suspended imposition of sanction on the second count and placed defendant on bench probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">On appeal, defendant argues that the colloquy delivered by the trial court violated defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In particular, defendant asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the trial court\u2019s remarks regarding the likely outcome if defendant had testified effectively drove defendant from the stand, depriving him of the right to testify. Defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the trial court\u2019s colloquy or otherwise preserve the assigned error, but asserts that we should review the error as \u201cplain error\u201d or, in the alternative, excuse defendant from the requirements of preservation in this case. In response, the state argues that any error by the trial court is not \u201cplain\u201d and that, even if it is, we should not exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Even assuming that defendant was required to preserve the assigned error, we agree with him that the trial court\u2019s remarks amounted to plain legal error in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 US 95, 98, 93 S Ct 351, 34 L Ed 2d 330 (1972), that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a trial court from administering overly coercive warnings regarding the risks of testifying falsely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355-56, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (setting out the requirements for error apparent on the record). The compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment secures to a criminal defendant the right to call himself or herself to the witness stand to testify in his or her own defense: \u201cLogically included in the accused\u2019s right to call witnesses whose testimony is material and favorable to his defense * * * is a right to testify himself, should he decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>it is in his favor to do so.\u201d <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 US 44, 52, 107 S Ct 2704, 97 L Ed 2d 37 (1987) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the Court has observed, \u201cthe most important witness for the defense in many criminal cases is the defendant himself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Since at least 1972, which is when the Supreme Court decided <em>Webb, </em>it has been clear that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process precludes a trial court from infringing on a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present defense witnesses by delivering admonitions regarding the risks of testifying falsely in \u201cunnecessarily strong terms.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>409 US at 98.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>process bars a trial court from delivering such warnings because they risk \u201cexert [ing] such duress on the witnesses] mind so as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, when threatening warnings have the effect of driving a material witness for the defense from the stand, and the defendant is convicted, reversal is required \u201cto repair the infringement of the [defendant\u2019s] due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although <em>Webb </em>addressed admonitions to a defense witness<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who was not the defendant himself, it appears to us that all courts to have considered the question have concluded that its reasoning plainly precludes a trial court intimidating a defendant himself or herself from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>testifying,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the reasoning in <em>Webb </em>persuades us that that is the only possible conclusion to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The line separating permissible cautionary advice about the dangers of perjury from impermissible coercion is not a clear one. Nonetheless, it is plain to us that the trial court\u2019s remarks here crossed that line. Although we appreciate that the trial court\u2019s remarks may have been motivated by a concern for defendant, and the desire to prevent defendant from making what the trial court perceived to be a mistake, the remarks went far beyond what was needed or appropriate to allow defendant to make an informed choice about whether to testify. Rather, the trial court\u2019s statement that it had already found the state\u2019s witnesses to be credible in their testimony about defendant\u2019s understanding of the restraining order would suggest to a person in defendant\u2019s position that the court had abandoned its role as a neutral factfinder and had already decided that if defendant testified, he would lie. <em>See Webb, </em>409 US at 97 (trial court\u2019s admonitions violated due process when they communicated to defense witness that \u201cthe [court] expected [the witness] to lie\u201d); <em>see also Arthur v. United States, </em>986 A2d 398, 411 (DC 2009) (in cautioning a defendant, court must be careful not to create appearance of departing from role as neutral magistrate).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The court\u2019s subsequent statements would suggest further to a person in defendant\u2019s position that it would be better for defendant not to testify, in the light of the fact that the court had already determined that the state\u2019s witnesses were credible. The fact that the court reiterated that point after defendant\u2019s lawyer affirmatively informed the court that she did not expect defendant to lie would only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>serve to emphasize to defendant that the court had already made up its mind that defendant\u2019s testimony would not be truthful, and that defendant faced a significant risk of being penalized if he elected to testify. The court\u2019s reference to the immigration hold, and the court\u2019s statement that it would hold defendant, would also tend to indicate to someone in defendant\u2019s position that testifying would only make matters worse for defendant, regardless of whether defendant testified truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s remark about the risk to defendant of having \u201ca middle class person with 35 years of legal experience think [] he\u2019s lying\u201d would also have conveyed to someone in defendant\u2019s position the message that the particular trial judge presiding over his case had already determined that defendant would lie, especially if the judge appeared to be a \u201cmiddle class person with 35 years of legal experience\u201d \u2014 a message that would certainly drive someone in defendant\u2019s position from the stand. The court\u2019s reference to the class status of the decision maker \u2014 something that is irrelevant both to the determination of whether or not a witness is lying and to the determination of the appropriate sanctions for lying<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 only enhanced the coercive tone of the remarks under the circumstances present here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We further conclude that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admonitions were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the error therefore amounts to reversible error under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 24, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 135 P3d 260 (2006) <em>(Chapman </em>standard governs determination whether federal constitutional error is harmless). It is clear from the record that the trial court\u2019s colloquy caused defendant to elect not to testify, even though defendant had planned to testify. It is also apparent from the transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that defendant\u2019s defense \u2014 which turned on his understanding of whether the conduct forming the basis of the two contempt counts violated the restraining order \u2014 is one in which defendant\u2019s own testimony would be highly probative. And we are not persuaded that there is no possibility that defendant could have testified truthfully about his understanding of the contents of the order in a way that would undercut the state\u2019s case. It was undisputed that defendant could not read the restraining order and had to rely on others to translate it for him; it is not implausible to think that defendant may have come to an understanding of the order \u2014 perhaps even a reasonable one under the circumstances \u2014 that would cause him to believe that he was permitted to receive phone calls from L or to have contact with her when police were present, as they would be at a traffic stop.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the trial court\u2019s admonitions \u201ceffectively drove [defendant] off the stand,\u201d precluding him from testifying to his own understanding of the contents of the restraining order and, consequently, precluding him from presenting a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We have determined that the trial court\u2019s colloquy plainly violated the Fourteenth Amendment in view <em>of Webb, </em>and that that constitutional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman. </em>Considering the gravity of the error, we exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-5\"> Although we have held that \u201c[a] criminal contempt proceeding is not a criminal prosecution within the meaning of [Article I, section 11 of] the constitution,\u201d <em>Bachman v. Bachman, </em>171 Or App 665, 674, 16 P3d 1185 (2000) (citing Pyle <em>and Pyle, </em>111 Or App 184, 186, 826 P2d 640 (1992)), generally the Oregon legislature has made the protections of Article I, section 11, applicable to punitive contempt proceedings, except for the jury trial right: \u201cExcept for the right to a jury trial, the defendant is entitled to the constitutional and statutory protections, including the right to appointed counsel, that a defendant would be entitled to in a criminal proceeding in which the fine or term of imprisonment that could be imposed is equivalent to the punitive sanctions sought in the contempt proceeding.\u201d ORS 33.065(6); <em>see also State v. Copeland, </em>353 Or 816, 819 n 1, 306 P3d 610 (2013) (observing that, under ORS 33.065(6), \u201c[d]efendants in punitive contempt proceedings are generally entitled to the same constitutional protections afforded defendants in criminal proceedings, except for the right to a jury trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The United States Supreme Court long has held that the criminal procedural rights in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments apply directly to proceedings for \u201ccriminal contempt,\u201d that is, contempt proceedings in which the sanctions are punitive in nature. <em>See generally Mine Workers v. Bagwell, </em>512 US 821, 114 S Ct 2552, 129 L Ed 2d 642 (1994) (discussing difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt). The Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201c\u2018Criminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense,\u2019 <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 US 194, 201[, 88 S Ct 1477, 20 L Ed 2d 522] (1968), and \u2018criminal penalties may not be imposed on someone who has not been afforded the protections that the Constitution requires of such criminal proceedings,\u2019 <em>Hicks v. Feiock, </em>485 US 624, 632[, 108 S Ct 1423, 99 L Ed 2d 721] (1988). See <em>In re Bradley, </em>318 US 50 [, 63 S Ct 470, 87 L Ed 608] (1943) (double jeopardy); <em>Cooke v. United States, </em>267 US 517, 537 [, 45 S Ct 390, 69 L Ed 767] (1925) (rights to notice of charges, assistance of counsel, summary process, and to present a defense); <em>Gompers v.

For \u2018serious\u2019 criminal contempts involving imprisonment of more than six months, these protections include the right to jury trial. <em>Bloom, </em>391 US at 199, see also <em>Taylor v.

For that reason, we are unable to conclude that the trial court\u2019s remarks amounted to <em>plain </em>error under the Oregon Constitution, and we turn to the federal constitutional standards which have long been plain. Although we ordinarily have an obligation to resolve state constitutional issues before federal constitutional issues under Oregon\u2019s \u201cfirst things first\u201d doctrine, it is an open question whether and to what extent that doctrine supplants our ordinary process for reviewing unpreserved claims of error in cases involving constitutional questions. <em>State v.

Most courts have concluded that a trial court\u2019s erroneously aggressive warnings about the consequences of testifying falsely are reviewed under the harmless error standard applicable to constitutional errors articulated in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). <em>See Woolfolk, </em>339 SW 3d at 418-19.

It is the Court\u2019s duty to admonish you that you don\u2019t have to testify, that anything you say can and will be used against you. If you take the witness stand and lie under oath, the Court will personally see that your case goes to the grand jury and you will be indicted for perjury and the [likelihood] is that you would get convicted of perjury and that it would be stacked onto what you have already got, so that is the matter you have got to make up your mind on. If you get on the witness stand and lie, it is probably going to mean several years and at least more time that you are going to have to serve. It will also be held against you in the penitentiary when you\u2019re up for parole and the Court wants you to thoroughly understand the chances you\u2019re taking by getting on that witness stand under oath. You may tell the truth and if you do, that is all right, but if you lie you can get into real trouble. The court wants you to know that. You don\u2019t owe anybody anything to testify and it must be done freely and voluntarily and with the thorough understanding that you know the hazard you are taking.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">409 US at 95-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\"> <em>See United States v.
