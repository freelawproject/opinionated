We conclude that the record does not support a finding that, in the totality of the circumstances, defendant understood his right to counsel; therefore, defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was not \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently made.\u201d <em>State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 132, 831 P2d 666 (1992). The trial court erred in accepting defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel and, because that error was not harmless, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant was charged with assault in the fourth degree, ORS 163.160, strangulation, ORS 163.187, stalking, ORS 163.732, violating a court\u2019s stalking protective order, ORS 163.750, and contempt of court, arising from incidents involving a female acquaintance. At the time of those incidents, defendant was 25 years old and a student at the University of Oregon. Defendant, who is from Korea, does not speak English as his native language; however, the record shows that he is capable of understanding written and spoken English and that he often addressed the trial court in English. In addition, a Korean-speaking interpreter provided interpretation services at all court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On November 9, 2012, defendant, at his request, was assigned a court-appointed public defender. However, on December 11, the public defender moved to withdraw as counsel, because defendant had informed him that defendant \u201cno longer wished [him] to be his attorney\u201d and \u201cwould not speak with [him] further about the issue or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>[defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d During a hearing on the motion, the trial court granted the public defender\u2019s motion to withdraw and appointed another attorney, Johnson, to represent defendant. Also during that hearing, defendant told Johnson, off the record, that he wanted to represent himself. On the record, defendant told the court, \u201cI pretty sure I am not guilty,\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cso if you think that you\u2019re not guilty * * * you think that a good plan, then, would be to represent yourself?\u201d Defendant then stated, \u201cI am lawyer by myself. I can be attorney for me.\u201d The court told defendant, \u201cI need you to talk with [Johnson] about what your options are.\u201d The court decided to \u201cleave things set as they [were],\u201d informing defendant that they would all talk again at the next scheduled court date two days later. After the hearing, Johnson spoke further with defendant, off the record and in the presence of an interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Two days later, on December 13, Johnson moved to withdraw as counsel. In an accompanying affidavit, Johnson stated that, after the previous hearing, he had spoken with defendant and \u201cexplained the role of an attorney and the types of things an attorney could do to assist him.\u201d According to Johnson\u2019s affidavit, defendant \u201ccontinued to take the position that he desired to represent himself\u2019 and had declined Johnson\u2019s subsequent attempts to meet with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">At a court appearance that same day, Johnson told the court that he had not requested new counsel to be appointed for defendant because defendant wanted to represent himself. The court then asked defendant about the statements that defendant had made at the previous hearing, in which he had told the court, \u201cI am lawyer by myself. I can be attorney for me.\u201d When the court asked defendant whether he was an attorney in Oregon or in his home country, defendant stated that he was not. The court asked why he had told the court that he was an attorney, and defendant stated that he had wanted a chance to speak to the court and that it was his \u201cpersonal belief\u2019 that he was an attorney. The colloquy continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: So you\u2019d like to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoQ\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: (In English.)

I believe (indiscernible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0K\">The court told defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m concerned that people who think they know how to try cases rarely know how to try cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-22\">\u201cEvery defendant in our system is presumed innocent. That goes for you. That goes for all the folks who are out of custody. That goes for the fellow here sitting in the back row who\u2019s in custody. And the State has certain obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>about how to proceed, but the Court rules and the Rules of Evidence apply to everybody. And they apply to everyone equally. And to get a fair trial it\u2019s important that you understand that and that you understand how to use those rules to your advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone who\u2019s not a lawyer do a jury trial successfully, representing themselves, in either a criminal or a civil case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cAre you sure \u2014 are you sure you want to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (In English.) I\u2019m sure. And I can (indiscernible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, would you say that again for me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201cYou\u2019re sure and?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: (In English.) I\u2019m sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: (In English.) And I will accept every penalty and every (indiscernible) of my decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. So you\u2019re willing to accept all the consequences of deciding to proceed on your own?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (In English.) Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">The court asked the state whether it wished him to inquire further, to which the state responded: \u201cYour Honor, this case does represent a significant immigration consequence to this defendant that I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s consulted with an attorney about.\u201d The court addressed defendant again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Conviction could result in deportation or refusal of naturalization. Does that change your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-16\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (In English.) I accept everything (indiscernible) of my decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. You accept any consequence of your decision to proceed on your own. Is that what you\u2019re saying to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201c [DEFENDANT): (In English.) Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">At that point, the court granted Johnson\u2019s motion to withdraw as attorney of record and informed defendant that he would be allowed to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The court then informed defendant that he would require an attorney to act as \u201cback-bench consultant,\u201d at which point Johnson addressed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cMR. JOHNSON: Your Honor, whoever represents him * * * will probably not be able to give him any advice about immigration consequences [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think that\u2019s a fair note to make on the record so that the defendant understands that fully. So that lawyer will not be representing you. That lawyer will not be able to give you advice about consequences. That lawyer will not * * * help you prepare a defense, subpoena witnesses, et cetera. And you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (In English.) Yes, I understand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">After discussing various pretrial matters, the court asked defendant if he had any questions, reminding him that \u201cwhat we\u2019re talking about today are just procedural decisions about trial, lawyers, translation, et cetera. It\u2019s not about the case. That\u2019s for trial next week.\u201d Defendant then raised some questions about the translation of certain written evidence and attempted to discuss some of the evidence that would be presented at trial. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cThis is why I suggest to you that maybe you want a lawyer, and I\u2019m not going to reconsider that unless you ask me to. But you\u2019re trying to tell me now why \u2014 why you\u2019re innocent. That\u2019s what a trial is for. That\u2019s not today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The state then noted, for the record, that there had been some concerns about defendant\u2019s mental health during discovery, but that it did not seem to be a concern that day. The court agreed that it had had concerns about defendant\u2019s mental health two days prior, but no longer had such concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Later on December 13, after the court appearance, defendant appeared before a different judge for a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>conference hearing. The settlement judge noted that she had met defendant during a previous appearance regarding a separate, but related, matter. The settlement judge briefly explained the charges that had been brought against defendant, discussed the penalties for those charges, and notified defendant that he had a right to a jury trial. She also told defendant that \u201c[fit\u2019s generally to the advantage to both sides to at least talk about\u201d a possible settlement agreement. The settlement judge then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cNow, I know that you have had an attorney appointed to represent you *** [a]nd you asked him to stop being your attorney, so he requested the judge to let him no longer be your attorney, and the judge agreed to that. And then another attorney was assigned to represent you, and I understand you do not wish him to represent you either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cIt\u2019s important for you to know that anything you say about your case in the presence of anyone other than your attorney can be used against you at trial. And you have a right not to make statements that could hurt your case at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cYou have \u2014 and I\u2019m sure the judge has gone over this with you, the one that you were just in front of \u2014 the right to be represented by an attorney here, and one that is paid for by the state. So it\u2019s at no cost to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m a little bit worried for you as far as your ability to get through this process if you are not yourself an attorney and not familiar with the way the legal process here works. You may be at a real disadvantage if you don\u2019t have an attorney representing you. And you don\u2019t have to have a court-appointed attorney if you can afford to hire one. You could choose whoever that attorney might be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m just kind of worried that if \u2014 if you\u2019re not a lawyer, you\u2019re in over your head. These are serious charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Defendant responded, in English, \u201cIn Korea I\u2019m involved in lawyer. I paid. I hired. (Indiscernible) do I have.\u201d The court asked him where the attorneys were, and defendant answered, \u201cJust I lost them. And just I have returned (indiscernible). I am represent by myself.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd just I don\u2019t want to talk about that now. And just I need to (indiscernible) my case. But just to be real clear, I\u2019m very afraid to talk about case now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The court told defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201c[J]ust so you know, one of the things that sounds like is very important to your case is that you\u2019ve got evidence that you want to be able to have the Court or the jury hear. And you need to know what the procedures are for getting that evidence before the Court. So, you know, that\u2019s one of my concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The court then explained the settlement process, including a defense attorney\u2019s usual role in the process, and asked defendant if he would consider allowing his attorney adviser to participate in discussing settlement with the state, or at least to be present during the settlement discussions. Defendant responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not fine to me.\u201d The court then addressed Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: So Mr. Johnson, did he waive his right to counsel and get his full explanation of the advantages of having an attorney, disadvantages of representing himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cMR. JOHNSON: Yes. I went over that with him on Tuesday. [The trial judge] explored that with him today at 2:30 [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I just want to make sure he\u2019s been properly informed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">According to a journal entry by the settlement judge, defendant ultimately \u201cagreed to allow Mr. Johnson to sit at counsel table as his legal advisor, but was clear that Mr. Johnson was not his attorney.\u201d Defendant did not accept the settlement offered by the state, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Trial was held on December 18, during which defendant represented himself and Johnson served as his attorney advisor. Defendant was found guilty by a jury and convicted of assault in the fourth degree, stalking, and violating a court\u2019s protective order,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the court found defendant in contempt of court for having violated a court order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Defendant now appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of his waiver of his right to counsel. Defendant contends that he did not knowingly waive his right to counsel, arguing that \u201c[n] either defendant\u2019s conversations with the trial court, nor the representations made by his attorney!,] were sufficient to permit the court to allow him to waive counsel.\u201d Specifically, defendant argues that the court\u2019s conversations with defendant before trial \u201cshould have raised red flags concerning defendant\u2019s mental health, lack of English language skills, and lack of understanding about the benefits of an attorney and the risks of proceeding without one,\u201d and that, even assuming that defendant represented to the court that he knew how to perform the tasks of an attorney, \u201cthe court did not ensure that he actually had any such knowledge.\u201d Defendant further argues that the court merely gave \u201cabstract\u201d warnings to defendant and that \u201c[a]n abstract warning that there may be risks or disadvantages of self-representation, without any information establishing that defendant had an appreciation of what those might be, is insufficient to establish a knowing waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The state responds that the colloquies between the court and defendant established that defendant knowingly waived his right to counsel, because the court sufficiently explained the risks of self-representation and expressly cautioned defendant against representing himself, and defendant\u2019s statements to the court demonstrated that he understood the court. Moreover, the state contends that the totality of the circumstances establish that defendant knowingly waived his right to counsel, because defendant could express himself to the court, the court was able to observe and assess defendant\u2019s competency and demeanor, Johnson had spoken to defendant about waiving his right to counsel, and defendant had at least some previous experience with the court system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The validity of a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel is a question of law that we review for errors of law in light of the circumstances of the particular case. , 256 Or App 416, 420, 300 P3d 270 (2013). Article I, section 11, provides, in part, that a criminal defendant has the right \u201cto be heard by himself and counsel [.]\u201d The Article I, section 11, right to counsel \u201cmay be waived,\u201d but \u201ca trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s proffered waiver of counsel only if it finds that the defendant knows of his or her right to counsel and, if indigent, of his or her right to court-appointed counsel, and that the defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons that right.\u201d <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 131-33. In other words, waiver of counsel \u201cmust be voluntarily and intelligently made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. As we explained in <em>Erb, </em>\u201c\u2018[v]oluntarily\u2019 refers to the fact that the waiver is an intentional act that is not coerced,\u201d and \u201c \u2018 [i] ntelligently\u2019 \u2018refers to a defendant\u2019s <em>knowledge and understanding </em>of the right to counsel.\u2019\u201d 256 Or App at 421 (quoting <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 132 n 8) (emphasis in <em>Erb).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In this case, defendant does not argue that his waiver of counsel was involuntary; thus, the sole issue on appeal is whether the record establishes that defendant\u2019s waiver was \u201cknowingly\u201d made \u2014 that is, whether defendant both knew of and understood his right to counsel. <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 132 n 8. Because defendant does not dispute that he <em>knew, </em>at least in a general sense, of his right to counsel, we address only whether the record establishes that defendant <em>understood </em>that right. <em>See Erb, </em>256 Or App at 421 (\u201c [B]ecause there is no dispute that defendant <em>knew, </em>at least in a general sense, of her right to counsel, we address whether the record establishes that defendant <em>understood </em>that right.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cA defendant is said to understand his or her right to counsel if, considering the \u2018totality of the circumstances,\u2019 the record reflects that he or she \u2018substantially appreciates the material risks of self-representation in his or her case.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422 (quoting , 172 Or App 414, 423, 19 P3d 925 (2001)). \u201c[I]t is not required that a defendant \u2018know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and completely appreciate every potential risk ***,\u2019 but \u2018a defendant\u2019s abstract knowledge that there may be risks or disadvantages of self-representation, without any appreciation of what those risks might be, is insufficient.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson, </em>172 Or App at 423).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In <em>Meyrick, </em>the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201c[a] colloquy on the record between the court and the defendant wherein the court, in some fashion, explains the risks of self-representation is the preferred means of assuring that the defendant understand the risks of self-representation. The more relevant information that a trial court provides to a defendant about the right to counsel and about the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, the more likely it will be that a defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege and that the record will so demonstrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">313 Or at 133. However, \u201cArticle I, section 11, does not require a catechism by the trial court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 134, and, \u201c[w]here the preferred colloquy did not occur on the record or, alternatively, was insufficient to explain the risks of self-representation to the defendant, the court may nevertheless infer, if the totality of circumstances so demonstrate, that the defendant knew the risks of self-representation,\u201d , 172 Or App 546, 553-54, 19 P3d 369, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 305 (2001). A defendant\u2019s \u201cknowledge and understanding of the right to counsel * * * may turn on things other than on what the court tells the defendant, such as the defendant\u2019s age, education, and experience and the complexity of the charges and possible defenses,\u201d <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 132 n 8, as well as \u201cobvious cultural differences or lack of English language skills,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">We now apply those principles to the circumstances of this case. As noted, at defendant\u2019s December 13 court appearance, the trial court asked defendant whether he knew how to pick a jury, to which he responded \u201cI think it\u2019s just random.\u201d Next, the court asked defendant if he knew how to place evidence into evidence, to which defendant responded, \u201cI have basic knowledge about that.\u201d Then, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>court asked whether defendant knew the rules of evidence and how to make an objection, and the record does not indicate a clear response on the part of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The court then told defendant that it was \u201cconcerned that people who think they know how to try cases rarely know how to try cases,\u201d and it warned defendant that \u201cthe Court rules and the Rules of Evidence apply to everybody equally.\u201d The court told defendant that \u201cto get a fair trial it\u2019s important that you understand that and that you understand how to use those rules to your advantage,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone who\u2019s not a lawyer do a jury trial successfully, representing themselves, in either a criminal or a civil case.\u201d The court then asked defendant if he was sure he wanted to represent himself, to which defendant responded \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d and told the court, \u201cI will accept every penalty * * * of my decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">After that exchange, the trial court decided to allow Johnson to withdraw as defendant\u2019s attorney. The court informed defendant that he would be allowed to represent himself, but that it would require an attorney to act as a \u201cback-bench consultant,\u201d or attorney advisor. It explained that the attorney advisor would not represent him, pick a jury for him, advise him about consequences, prepare a defense for him, or subpoena witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As noted, the Supreme Court, in <em>Meyrick, </em>stated that \u201c[a] colloquy on the record between the court and the defendant wherein the court, in some fashion, explains the risks of self-representation is the preferred means of assuring that the defendant understand the risks of self-representation.\u201d 313 Or at 133. The court also noted that \u201c[heading questions put to a defendant may be answered in the affirmative without actual understanding,\u201d and stated that \u201ccourts should strive to demonstrate on the record that a defendant understands the implications of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133 n 9. In our view, that principle is especially important where, as here, a defendant exhibits questionable English language skills. Although a Korean-speaking interpreter was present during the court\u2019s colloquy with defendant, defendant often addressed the court in English, and the record shows that, at times, there was some confusion between the court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The colloquy also indicates that, at times, defendant\u2019s answers were nonresponsive to the questions asked by the trial court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and thus belies the state\u2019s contention that defendant understood that he was waving his right to counsel or, more importantly, that he understood the significance of his answers in the context of Oregon\u2019s legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Even assuming that defendant\u2019s responses to the trial court during the above exchange were generally affirmative, those responses, especially in light of defendant\u2019s English language ability, could very well have been \u201canswered in the affirmative without actual understanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133 n 9. As defendant now argues on appeal, the conversation \u201cshould have raised red flags\u201d regarding defendant\u2019s ability to understand the risks of self-representation, and the court should have striven to demonstrate on the record that defendant actually understood the court\u2019s warnings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>, 203 Or App 222, 229, 125 P3d 33 (2005) (noting that the court\u2019s warnings were \u201ccursory in nature and lacking in detail,\u201d and stating that, \u201cfurther, more detailed warnings were required of the trial court based on the circumstances of [the] case,\u201d including that the defendant had never participated as a party in a trial, he was not warned by the attorney who represented him up until the morning of trial of the risks of self-representation, he did not speak English as his first language, he had only a ninth-grade education, and his appointed attorney had expressed concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>about his mental health). For the reasons described above, we conclude that the colloquy between the trial court and defendant, before the court accepted defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel, was not sufficient to allow the court to conclude that defendant substantially appreciated the risks of self-representation. <em>See </em>271 Or App at 198-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">To the extent' that the state references subsequent events as showing that defendant understood the risks of self-representation, we disagree. The conversation between defendant and the settlement judge, during the settlement conference later the same day on December 13, does not provide any further evidence that defendant understood the risks of self-representation. <em>See </em>271 Or App at 201-03. After expressing concern about defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself, and specifically warning defendant that he \u201cmay be at a real disadvantage\u201d without an attorney, the settlement judge did not attempt to determine whether defendant actually understood that warning. Instead, the settlement judge asked Johnson whether defendant had gotten a \u201cfull explanation of the advantages of having an attorney\u201d; after Johnson stated that both he and the trial judge had discussed that with defendant, the settlement judge replied, \u201cOkay. I just want to make sure he\u2019s been properly informed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Moreover, the totality of the circumstances does not otherwise demonstrate that defendant understood the risks of self-representation. <em>See Howard, </em>172 Or App at 553-54 (\u201cWhere the preferred colloquy did not occur on the record or, alternatively, was insufficient to explain the risks of self-representation to the defendant, the court may nevertheless infer, if the totality of circumstances so demonstrate, that the defendant knew the risks of self-representation.\u201d). As noted, a defendant\u2019s understanding of the right to counsel may turn on factors such as the defendant\u2019s \u201cage, education, and experience and the complexity of the charges and possible defenses,\u201d <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 132 n 8, as well as \u201cobvious cultural differences or lack of English language skills,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132 n 6. Defendant was at least 25 years old at the time of trial, and he was a student at the University of Oregon at the time of the events leading up to his arrest. However, he had never participated in a jury trial, and there was little, if any, evidence of previous experience in the criminal justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>system.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although defendant initially requested, and was assigned, a public defender, defendant stopped talking to that attorney only one month later, and he chose to have limited contact with Johnson throughout the pretrial proceedings, before he had waived his right to counsel. Finally, defendant demonstrated questionable English-language skills, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The record does not support a finding that, in the totality of the circumstances, defendant understood his right to counsel; therefore, defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was not \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently made,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132, and under Article I, section 11, the trial court erred in accepting defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel. We further conclude that the court\u2019s error was not harmless, because we are unable to tell what the outcome of defendant\u2019s case would have been if he had been represented by counsel. <em>See State v. Cole, </em>323 Or 30, 36, 912 P2d 907 (1996) (\u201cError is harmless if there is little likelihood that it affected the outcome in this case.\u201d); , 235 Or App 646, 656, 234 P3d 1030, , 236 Or App 465, 236 P3d 789 (2010) (\u201cWhere we are unable to determine what the outcome of a case would have been if the defendant had been represented by counsel instead of proceeding without counsel, the error is not harmless.\u201d); <em>Erb, </em>256 Or App at 427 (noting that, \u201cbecause we are unable to tell what the outcome of defendant\u2019s case would have been if she had been represented by counsel, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in allowing defendant to proceed without counsel was not harmless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> Although Judge Zennach\u00e9 ultimately presided over the trial in this case, Judge Rasmussen served as the judge during the pretrial hearings held on December 11 and 13, 2012, including the hearing in which defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was accepted. For simplicity, we refer to Judge Rasmussen as the \u201ctrial court\u201d throughout this opinion.
