As relevant here, the first-degree burglary statute requires the state to establish that a defendant unlawfully entered a \u201cdwelling,\u201d as defined in ORS 164.205(2). In this case, defendant entered a mostly enclosed, roofed area between and connected to a house and a garage. Defendant contends that, because the area that he entered was a separate area outside the house, the state failed to establish that he entered a dwelling. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the state and review those facts to determine whether a rational factfinder could find that the state proved the required elements beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Forrester, </em>203 Or App 151, 153, 125 P3d 47 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 141 (2006). The state charged defendant with two counts of first-degree burglary in connection with his entry into an area of a residence on North Seward Avenue in Portland that the homeowners refer to as their \u201cgarden room\u201d or \u201cbreezeway.\u201d For ease of reference, we refer to the area into which defendant entered as the \u201cbreezeway.\u201d We note, however, that the area in this case does not comport with the common understanding of the term \u201cbreezeway,\u201d which is \u201ca roofed open-air passage or porch connecting two buildings (as a house and garage) or forming a corridor between two halves of a building (as of a cabin).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>274 (unabridged ed 2002). The breezeway in this case, as the facts indicate below, is more enclosed than that dictionary definition suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The breezeway connects a two-story house with a two-story, two-car garage, and shares a wall with both the house and garage. The roof of the garage dips down to form the roof of the breezeway and extends to meet the side of the house. There is a wall at the back end of the breezeway with windows and a door that leads to a backyard. The front wall of the garage extends to the side of the house to create a front wall for the breezeway. The front wall of the breezeway contains a doorless archway. Photographs of the breezeway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>in the record indicate that the archway is not much wider than the size of a doorway. Thus, as the trial court indicated, the breezeway has \u201cthree sides enclosed with a fourth side with an archway that is not closed off[,] so to speak[,] to the elements.\u201d From inside the breezeway, there is a door to the garage that locks, but no door to the house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stated another way, there is no direct access to the house from inside the breezeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Instead, just outside the front wall of the breezeway, there is a landing next to the side door to the house. The landing is not enclosed by walls, but is surrounded by some low fencing, potted plants, and a metal trellis with a gate that leads to a driveway in front of the garage. The landing is mostly covered by roofing that extends from the side of the house. As such, a person can walk from the side door of the house and into the breezeway, and then into the garage, while remaining under cover of the roof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The homeowners use the breezeway to store various things, including nonperishable food items in a large cabinet, empty pop cans in a barrel, tools and equipment, as well as some furniture. They also use the breezeway as a dog run. Additionally, the homeowners use the breezeway to gain access to their garage and backyard. One of the homeowners testified that he views the area as part of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">One night, the homeowners noticed that some items in the breezeway had been moved while the homeowners had been inside the house. Later that night, one of the homeowners heard a noise coming from the breezeway. In response, he grabbed his shotgun (loaded with nonlethal rounds) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>walked out of the house through the side door and onto the covered landing. As he was turning left to walk through the archway and into the breezeway, the homeowner saw defendant inside the breezeway. Defendant ran toward the homeowner, who shot defendant in the shoulder. Defendant was able to run past the homeowner and rode away on a bicycle, but he was later found and arrested by police. Defendant was charged with one count of first-degree burglary with intent to commit theft (Count 1) in connection with his attempt to steal pop cans from inside the breezeway and one count of first-degree burglary with intent to commit criminal mischief (Count 2) for moving the homeowners\u2019 table saw in the breezeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and the case was tried to the court. A central issue at trial was whether the breezeway was part of the dwelling, such that defendant\u2019s entry into that part of the residence constituted first-degree burglary. The trial court found that the breezeway was part of the dwelling and, accordingly, found defendant guilty of Count 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On appeal, in a single assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it failed to acquit him of Count 1 because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he had entered a dwelling as required for first-degree burglary. The state\u2019s response is two-fold: first, it argues that defendant failed to preserve his argument below, and second, it contends that defendant\u2019s argument fails on the merits because the record demonstrates that the breezeway was part of a building (the house) that was a dwelling. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that defendant preserved his argument, but we also conclude that there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant entered a \u201cdwelling\u201d when he entered the homeowner\u2019s breezeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We begin with the state\u2019s preservation argument. Generally, we will not review a claim of error that was not raised in the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *.\u201d). \u201cTo preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>a claim of error concerning the legal sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence, a defendant must \u2014 even in a case tried to the court \u2014 challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Forrester, </em>203 Or App at 155. In a bench trial, a defendant can preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence if the \u201cdefendant clearly raises the issue in closing argument.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Here, defendant raised the issue of whether the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the breezeway was a dwelling for purposes of first-degree burglary in his closing argument to the court. In its rebuttal argument, the state reiterated why it thought that the evidence established that the breezeway was part of the dwelling. And, in making its ruling, the trial court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that this case turned on the definition of a dwelling.\u201d We conclude \u201cthat the policies underlying the rule have been sufficiently served,\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that defendant\u2019s argument was sufficiently preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">On the merits, the issue on appeal is whether sufficient evidence supported defendant\u2019s first-degree burglary conviction \u2014 specifically, whether a reasonable factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant had entered part of a dwelling when he entered the breezeway. That determination turns, in large part, on whether the trial court applied a proper understanding of the statutory definition of a dwelling, a matter over which the parties disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">As relevant here, a person commits first-degree burglary if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and the building is a dwelling. ORS 164.215; ORS 164.225.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>at issue is whether defendant entered a dwelling when he entered the breezeway of the home. The term \u201cdwelling,\u201d as it is used in ORS 164.225, is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">\u201ca building which regularly or intermittently is occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">ORS 164.205(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As mentioned above, defendant contends that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish that he entered a dwelling within the meaning of the first-degree burglary statute. Defendant does not dispute that the house itself was a dwelling under that statute. However, he argues that the breezeway was a \u201cseparate area <em>outside </em>the dwelling\u201d and that the context and legislative history of the dwelling definition indicates that the legislature intended to exclude from that definition areas that are outside of, but attached to, the main house. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The state responds that, because the house in this case is a dwelling for purposes of the first-degree burglary statute, and because there was evidence that the breezeway was part of that house, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant entered a dwelling when he entered the breezeway. In particular, the state points to evidence that the homeowner\u2019s residence is organized as a single structure \u2014 the primary living quarters, breezeway, and garage are all connected and share a common roofline and walls. In the state\u2019s view, \u201c[essentially, the individual parts of the home are connected as a single home,\u201d and, therefore, we \u201cshould conclude that every part of the home is a part of the \u2018dwelling.\u2019\u201d The state further contends that the context and legislative history of the statute upon which defendant relies do not indicate a legislative intent to exclude from the definition of dwelling an area like the breezeway in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>On an issue of statutory interpretation, we review for legal error. <em>State v. Paniagua-Montes, </em>264 Or App 216, 221, 330 P3d 1250, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 510 (2014). We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court applied a correct understanding of the term \u201cdwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">When interpreting a statute, we apply the methodology set out in State <em>v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Under that methodology, we begin by examining \u201cthe text of the statute in its context, along with relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, canons of construction.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 75, 261 P3d 1234 (2011). When a term is defined by statute, we look to the statutory definition to ascertain the plain meaning of the term, but when a term is not statutorily defined, we look to dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of the statutory terms. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Starting with the text, under the definition in ORS 164.205(2), a \u201cdwelling\u201d is a type of building \u201cregularly or intermittently * * * occupied by a person lodging therein at night [.]\u201d <em>See State v. McKoon, </em>127 Or App 64, 67, 871 P2d 127 (1994) (stating that, under the definitions in ORS 164.205, \u201cdwellings are a subset of the larger category, buildings\u201d). A \u201cbuilding,\u201d in turn, is defined by statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201c\u2018Building,\u2019 in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes any booth, vehicle, boat, aircraft or other structure adapted for overnight accommodation of persons or for carrying on business therein. Where a building consists of separate units, including, but not limited to, separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, each unit is, in addition to being part of such building, a separate building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">ORS 164.205(1). Thus, in part, a \u201cbuilding\u201d is defined as having \u201cits ordinary meaning.\u201d The ordinary meaning of \u201cbuilding\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201c1: a thing built: a: a constructed edifice designed to stand more or less permanently, covering a space of land, usu. covered by a roof and <em>more or less completely enclosed by walls, </em>and serving as a dwelling, storehouse, factory, shelter for animals, or other useful structure \u2014 distinguished from structures not designed for occupancy (as fences or monuments) and from structures not intended for use in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>one place (as boats or trailers) even though subject to occupancy b: a portion of a house occupied as a separate dwelling: APARTMENT, TENEMENT \u2014 used only in some legal statutes * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>292 (unabridged ed 1971) (boldface in original; emphasis added). And, as used in the statutory definition of dwelling, the dictionary definition of the verb \u201clodging\u201d includes \u201cla: to occupy a place temporarily : stay overnight: SLEEP * * * b (1): to have a residence : DWELL, STAY * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (boldface in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Under those definitions, the plain meaning of a dwelling, as relevant here, is a roofed structure that is more or less completely enclosed by walls and is regularly or intermittently occupied by a person who resides in the structure at night.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Barker/Phelps, </em>86 Or App 394, 397, 739 P2d 1045 (1987) (stating that the ordinary meaning of \u201cbuilding\u201d is \u201cany roofed and walled structure constructed for permanent use\u201d) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 292). Given that understanding of the term \u201cdwelling,\u201d entry into any part of a building in which people reside at night qualifies as entry into a dwelling. In other words, \u2018[t]he term \u2018dwelling\u2019 is not limited to the sleeping areas within a structure.\u201d <em>McKoon, </em>127 Or App at 67 (holding that the defendant\u2019s entry into the foyer of a fraternity house was an entry into a \u201cdwelling\u201d); <em>see also State v. Haas, </em>13 Or App 368, 510 P2d 852, <em>aff'd, 267 </em>Or 489, 517 P2d 671 (1973), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>420 US 714, 95 S Ct 1215, 43 L Ed 2d 570 (1975) (entry into a garage attached to a home constituted entry into a \u201cdwelling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Defendant, however, urges a different understanding, primarily based on his view of the context of ORS 164.205(2). In overview, defendant points to the statutory scheme for burglary crimes that existed before the legislature adopted ORS 164.205(2) in 1971 as part of its overhaul of Oregon\u2019s criminal statutes and argues that a dwelling does not include a structure that is attached to, but lies outside of, the walls of the house where the sleeping quarters are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>In 1967, the legislature created the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission (Commission) to revise Oregon\u2019s criminal statutes. <em>State v. Lonergan, </em>344 Or 15, 25 n 3, 176 P3d 374 (2008) (Kistler, J., dissenting). \u201cThe Commission divided responsibility for drafting the revised criminal code among three subcommittees,\u201d which \u201cproduced drafts of the code and submitted those drafts, together with commentaries on them, to the Commission [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission then created a final draft of the proposed code, along with commentaries, which it presented to the legislature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Before the 1971 overhaul, Oregon\u2019s burglary statutes were codified at <em>former </em>ORS 164.210 to 164.260 (1969), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 432. Similar to the first- and second-degree burglary statutes that the legislature enacted in 1971, the former burglary statutes punished burglary of a dwelling more severely than burglary of any other kind of building. <em>Compare former </em>ORS 164.230 (providing for up to a 15-year sentence for burglary of a \u201cdwelling house\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>with former </em>ORS 164.240 (providing that the maximum sentence for burglary of a building other than a \u201cdwelling house\u201d was 10 years).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In other respects, though, the older statutory scheme for burglary differed from that in the 1971 revision. Before 1971, the burglary statutes did not contain a definition of the term \u201cbuilding.\u201d They did, however, include a definition of the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201c\u2018Dwelling house\u2019 includes any building <em>of which any part </em>has usually been occupied by any person lodging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>therein at night, and any structure joined to and immediately connected with such building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><em>Former </em>ORS 164.210(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In its preliminary draft of the code, the subcommittee assigned to drafting the burglary statutes added a definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d and replaced the \u201cdwelling house\u201d definition with a definition of a \u201cdwelling.\u201d Criminal Law Revision Commission, Article 15, Preliminary Draft No 1, May 1968, 1. Under the first preliminary draft, a \u201cdwelling\u201d was defined as \u201ca building which is usually occupied by a person, other than the actor, lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A later draft of that definition omitted the \u201cother than the actor\u201d wording. Criminal Law Revision Commission, Article 15, Preliminary Draft No 2, June 1968, 1. The Commission retained those definitions in the final draft of the code that it presented to the legislature. Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report, \u00a7 135, 143 (July 1970). Ultimately, the legislature, with minor changes, adopted those definitions through its enactment of ORS 165.205(1) and (2) in 1971.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Defendant contrasts the streamlined reference to a \u201cbuilding\u201d in the \u201cdwelling\u201d definition with the more descriptive reference in the \u201cdwelling house\u201d definition. <em>See </em>ORS 164.205(2) (stating that a dwelling means \u201ca building which regularly or intermittently is occupied by a person lodging therein at night\u201d). Defendant argues that the legislature\u2019s omission of the phrases \u201cof which any part\u201d and \u201cand any structure joined to and immediately connected with such building\u201d from the definition of dwelling in ORS 164.205(2) suggests that \u201cstructures or areas that are connected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the dwelling, but outside of it, do not fit the definition of a dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Defendant correctly acknowledges that the Commission did not \u201cdirectly discuss why [it] decided to exclude the quoted language.\u201d The commentary to the Commission\u2019s final draft of the proposed criminal code explains that the current dwelling definition is based on a New York statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cSubsection (2). \u2018Dwelling.\u2019 This definition is based on the New York Statute, \u00a7 140.00, <em>and is much the same as the definition of \u2018dwelling house\u2019 in ORS 164.210(2): </em>\u2018any building of which any part has usually been occupied by any person lodging therein at night, and any structure joined to and immediately connected with such building.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 135(2), 143 (July 1970) (emphasis added). Beyond that \u201cmuch the same\u201d statement of comparison, there is no further commentary about the change in the dwelling definition or its relationship to the old definition of \u201cdwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Defendant does not point to any direct discussion by the subcommittee, the Commission, or the legislature itself, regarding that change. Nor are we aware of any legislative history directly addressing that change in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Defendant instead cites legislative history that, in his view, suggests that the legislature omitted that language because it considered areas outside of the house, but within the curtilage, to fall outside the definition of a dwelling. <em>See </em>Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No 1, May 27, 1968, 8 (discussing how, under the draft code, the burglary of a chicken house would be charged, and concluding that it would be second-degree burglary).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have considered that legislative history and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>disagree, concluding that it is not useful to our analysis of the dwelling definition in this case. <em>See </em>ORS 174.020(1)(b), (3) (stating that parties may offer legislative history to aid the court in its construction of a statute, but that the court \u201cshall give the weight to the legislative history that the court considers to be appropriate\u201d); <em>see also Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172 (\u201c[A] party is free to proffer legislative history to the court, and the court will consult it after examining the text and context, even if the court does not perceive an ambiguity in the statute\u2019s text, where that legislative history appears useful to the court\u2019s analysis.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The absence of legislative history on the difference between the definitions of dwelling house and dwelling at issue here is not for lack of opportunity. As mentioned above, the subcommittee drafting the burglary sections made changes to the proposed dwelling definition. <em>See </em>271 Or App at 301. At a hearing on the first preliminary draft, the subcommittee considered the dwelling definition, and Donald Paillette, the Project Director of the Commission, read through the proposed definition and commentary. <em>See </em>Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No 1, May 27, 1968, 7. At that time, the proposed definition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201c(3) \u2018Dwelling\u2019 means a building which is usually occupied by a person, other than the actor, lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Criminal Law Revision Commission, Article 15, Preliminary Draft No 1, May 1968, 1. The members of the subcommittee discussed whether the phrase \u201cother than the actor,\u201d which did not appear in the then-current definition of dwelling house, was necessary. Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee No 1, May 27, 1968, 7. Ultimately, the subcommittee decided to remove that phrase. <em>Id.; see </em>Criminal Law Revision Commission, Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>15, Preliminary Draft No 2, June 1968, 1 (defining \u201cdwelling\u201d as \u201ca building which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present\u201d). No similar discussion was had regarding the omission of the language that is the subject of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Ultimately, then, defendant\u2019s contention that the legislature intended to exclude areas like the breezeway in this case from the dwelling definition is based solely on the legislature\u2019s adoption of a definition of dwelling that did not include the specific language from the former dwelling house definition. We are not persuaded by that argument. \u201cAs we have noted on a number of occasions, arguments based on what the legislature did <em>not </em>say, either in the text of a statute or in its legislative history, are always tricky.\u201d <em>Waggoner v. City of Woodburn, </em>196 Or App 715, 721, 103 P3d 648 (2004) (emphasis in original) (citing <em>State v. Young, </em>196 Or App 708, 713, 103 P3d 1180 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 583 (2005) (\u201cThe committee\u2019s silence is notable only if what it <em>did </em>say purported to be a complete statement of its intentions.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)), and <em>Kerr v.

We have also cautioned that \u201c[t]he fact that the legislature altered the wording of a statute does not always mean that it intended to alter the substantive effect of the statute.\u201d <em>Pete\u2019s Mountain Homeowners v. Ore. Water Resources, </em>236 Or App 507, 521, 238 P3d 395 (2010) (citing, as an example, <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 420, 939 P2d 608 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In this case, we think it more likely than not that the legislature adopted the dwelling definition without the specific language from the dwelling house definition because the new definition was broad enough to render such specific language unnecessary. We arrive at that conclusion based on the broad language of the dwelling and building definitions, as well as the Commission\u2019s indication that the dwelling definition is \u201cmuch the same as\u201d the pre-1971 definition of \u201cdwelling house.\u201d The legislature adopted a definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d that includes any \u201cbuilding which regularly or intermittently is occupied by a person lodging therein at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>night, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d ORS 164.205(2). In turn, it created a broad definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d that includes the ordinary meaning of that term, <em>i.e., </em>a roofed structure that is more or less completely enclosed by walls. Those definitions, in combination, are broad enough to encompass the concept in the former dwelling house definition, namely that a \u201cdwelling\u201d is a building \u201cof which any part has usually been occupied by any person lodging therein at night, and any structure joined to and immediately connected with such building.\u201d <em>Former </em>ORS 164.210(1). Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate that the subcommittee, the Commission, or the legislature meant anything by the difference in language between the dwelling house definition and the new dwelling definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In conclusion, under ORS 164.205(2), for purposes of a single-family house, a \u201cdwelling\u201d is a roofed structure that is more or less completely enclosed by walls and is regularly or intermittently occupied by a person who resides in the structure at night. Entry into any part of a building in which people reside at night is entry into a dwelling under ORS 164.205(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">With that understanding, we turn to the evidence at trial, including photographs of the residence submitted as exhibits. That evidence demonstrated that the house, breezeway, and garage are all immediately contiguous to one another and are organized as a single structure. That is, the house, breezeway, and garage are physically attached to one another by virtue of shared walls; there are no gaps between the walls of the house, the walls of the breezeway, and the walls of the garage. Though access to the breezeway from the front of the property is through an open archway, the ordinary meaning of a building indicates that the structure need only be <em>mostly </em>enclosed by walls. Here, walls mostly enclose the structure. Furthermore, though there is no direct access to the house from inside the breezeway, the homeowners could enter the breezeway from the house by going out the side door of the house, walking on the covered landing, and through the archway. That walk to and from the house and breezeway occurs in a fenced and gated area of the property. A factfinder reasonably could find that the overall residence, including the breezeway, was a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Additionally, there was sufficient evidence from which a factfinder reasonably could find that the homeowners regularly occupied that building, including the breezeway portion. One of the homeowners testified that he and his wife regularly used the breezeway for access to the backyard and garage and that they used it to store food and other items. Finally, there was evidence from which a factfinder reasonably could find that the homeowners resided in the building at night. That they did not reside in the breezeway portion of the building is of no legal consequence. <em>See McKoon, </em>127 Or App at 67. In all, the evidence presented was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s entry into the breezeway was an entry into a dwelling under the first-degree burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> There are windows into a bedroom on the wall that the breezeway shares with the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> The trial court found that \u201csomeone [could] get from the garage into the house without having to be outside under the elements, because the roofline clearly goes *** across the breezeway and onto the *** [landing] and that\u2019s all covered in a way that keeps you out of the elements essentially.\u201d Defendant argues that the court\u2019s finding that a person can get from the garage into the house without having to be \u201coutside\u201d is not supported by evidence in the record and, therefore, does not bind this court under <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968). We understand the court\u2019s finding to be that a person could walk from the house to the breezeway while staying on the covered landing, thus protecting them, to some extent, from the elements. We state the facts consistently with our understanding of the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> The court acquitted defendant of Count 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> ORS 164.215 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7\">\u201c(1) * * * [A] person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJn\">\u201c(2) Burglary in the second degree is a Class C felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axp\">In turn, ORS 164.225 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIq\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree if the person violates ORS 164.215 and the building is a dwelling, or if in effecting entry or while in a building or in immediate flight therefrom the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201c(a) Is armed with a burglary tool or theft device as defined in ORS 164.235 or a deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXM\">\u201c(b) Causes or attempts to cause physical injury to any person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIR\">\u201c(c) Uses or threatens to use a dangerous weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYt\">\u201c(2) Burglary in the first degree is a Class A felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> We emphasize that the statutory definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d is more expansive than the dictionary definition.

Similarly, the only change that the legislature made to the proposed draft of the building definition was the addition of the term \u201cbooth\u201d among the kinds of structures included in the meaning of a \u201cbuilding.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 135(1), 143 (July 1970), <em>with </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 135(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> During that discussion, Donald Paillette, the Project Director for the Commission, explained that the burglary of a chicken house within the curtilage would constitute second-degree burglary under the draft code, a charge that was consistent with <em>former </em>ORS 164.240 (burglary of a building \u201cwithin the curtilage of any dwelling house, but not forming a part thereof,\u201d is a less severe crime than burglary of a dwelling house).

Defendant asserts that Paillette\u2019s conclusion in that regard \u201csuggests that the legislature intended areas outside of the house, but within the curtilage, to fall outside the definition of dwelling.\u201d In doing so, defendant passes over the fact that the hypothetical burglary of the chicken house involved a building that was not attached to the house. The hypothetical adds nothing to an understanding of the legislature\u2019s intention with regard to structures attached to the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
