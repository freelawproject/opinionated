The trial court concluded that it was and, accordingly, granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of plaintiff because, in the absence of the tolling provision, plaintiffs claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitation. Plaintiff appeals the resulting judgment for defendant, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s JNOV ruling. Defendant cross-assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for leave to file an amended answer. As explained below, we agree with plaintiff that the trial court erred in entering judgment for defendant. We reject defendant\u2019s cross-assignment of error without discussion. Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions to enter judgment for plaintiff on the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">On appeal after a JNOV, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed before the jury, here, plaintiff. <em>Bennett v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>332 Or 138, 142, 26 P3d 785 (2001). In this case, however, the facts relevant to the issues presented on appeal are essentially undisputed. In December 2009, plaintiff filed an action against defendant seeking to recover unpaid legal fees that defendant, a former client, allegedly owed him. Plaintiff asserted claims for \u201caccount stated\u201d and <em>quantum meruit. </em>In his answer, defendant raised several affirmative defenses, including that plaintiffs claims were barred because they had not been commenced within the six-year limitation period provided in ORS 12.080 and ORS 12.090.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The case was tried to a jury. At the close of evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict on the statute-of-limitation defense. They agreed to stipulate to the following facts: that plaintiffs action was filed in December 2009; that plaintiffs claims had accrued, at the latest, on July 25, 2002; that a six-year limitation period applied; and that defendant had moved from Oregon to Washington in November 2003 and has lived in the Vancouver-Battleground area since then. Given those facts, plaintiff contended that defendant\u2019s statute-of-limitation defense failed because, under ORS 12.150,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the limitation period was tolled when defendant moved out of state in November 2003, and, consequently, plaintiffs action had been commenced well within the six-year limitation period. Defendant, for his part, argued that ORS 12.150 does not apply to toll the statute of limitation because he was subject to service and personal jurisdiction under ORCP 4 E notwithstanding his move to Washington and, even if the statute were otherwise applicable, applying it in this case would be unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, citing <em>Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, </em>486 US 888, 108 S Ct 2218, 100 L Ed 2d 896 (1988) <em>(Bendix). </em>Consequently, according to defendant, plaintiffs claims were time barred under ORS 12.080(1) because they had not been commenced within six years of their accrual, and he was entitled to a directed verdict in his favor on the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The trial court summarized the competing motions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\u201cAnd so it\u2019s the plaintiffs position that under the statute cited in the written material \u2014 I think it\u2019s [ORS] 12.150, that the Statute of Limitations is tolled and that as a matter of law the case \u2014 the claims are not time-barred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the defense position that the statute as applied in this case would be unconstitutional and therefore the claims are time-barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">With the parties\u2019 agreement, the trial court reserved ruling on the directed-verdict motions pursuant to ORCP 63 B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff on each of his claims in the amount of $58,722.97. The parties then agreed to have the trial court treat defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as a JNOV motion, without further briefing. The court subsequently issued an opinion concluding, first, that ORS 12.150 \u201cunambiguously applies\u201d to plaintiffs claims and, second, that it \u201ccannot be applied to toll the statute of limitations in this case because doing so violates the Commerce Clause.\u201d On the constitutional question, the court ultimately agreed with the reasoning of courts from other jurisdictions, especially <em>Heritage Marketing and Ins. Services, Inc. v. Chrustawka, </em>160 Cal App 4th 754, 73 Cal Rptr 3d 126 (2008) <em>(Heritage Marketing), </em>and <em>State ex rel Bloomquist v. Schneider, </em>244 SW3d 139 (Mo 2008), that \u201cdenying a defendant the benefit of the statute of limitations due to this type of tolling statute burdens the defendant\u2019s ability to move from state to state, and that alone is a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to implicate the Commerce Clause.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s JNOV motion and entered a general judgment for defendant, awarding him costs and disbursements; Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">II. PARTIES\u2019ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Plaintiff assigns error to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s JNOV motion. He contends that the court erred \u201cbecause there was no evidence in the trial court record regarding any interference with, let alone burden on [i]nterstate [c]ommerce.\u201d And, plaintiff contends, any inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that can be drawn from the record must be resolved in his favor. According to plaintiff, defendant therefore did not satisfy his burden of proving that the statute discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce, and the cases relied on by the trial court to conclude otherwise are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Defendant responds, first, that plaintiffs argument on appeal is unpreserved, \u201cas [plaintiffs] argument relates <em>not only to </em>the scope and meaning of the statutory language of ORS 12.150 and the U. S. Constitution, but, <em>even more so, </em>it relies upon the premise that particular proof was deficient, and such reasons and arguments were never timely or properly urged to the trial court\u201d (emphasis added), nor are they reviewable as plain error. He also contends that, because plaintiff did not provide a complete transcript of the evidence presented at trial, his arguments regarding the adequacy of the evidence are not reviewable. As to the merits, defendant contends that the trial court correctly ruled that ORS 12.150 \u2014 like the tolling statutes at issue in cases from other jurisdictions, which toll the limitation period based solely on a defendant\u2019s out-of-state residence\u2014 \u201cburdens [defendant\u2019s] ability to move from state to state, which is an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, particularly when balanced against the ability to obtain jurisdiction over [defendant] under the Oregon long [-] arm statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">A. <em>Applicability of ORS 12.150</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Although, as noted, plaintiffs assignment of error focuses on the trial court\u2019s ruling that ORS 12.150 is unconstitutional as applied, we turn first to the predicate ruling of the court that ORS 12.150 would otherwise apply in this case. <em>See Leo v. Keisling, </em>327 Or 556, 562, 964 P2d 1023 (1998) (\u201c[I]t is well established that this court ordinarily does not decide constitutional issues if there is an adequate subconstitutional basis for decision.\u201d); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>267 Or App 621, 624, 341 P3d 787 (2014) (explaining that when we might resolve a case on either constitutional or subconstitutional gounds, \u201cwe will not review the constitutional question unless we have resolved the subconstitutional question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and that resolution does not end the inquiry\u201d). We agree with the trial court that the statute is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Again, ORS 12.150 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201cIf, when a cause of action accrues against any person, the person is out of the state and service cannot be made within the state or the person is concealed therein, such action may be commenced within the applicable period of limitation in this chapter after the return of the person into the state, or after the termination of the concealment of the person; and if, after a cause of action has accrued against a person, the person shall depart from and reside out of this state, or if the person is concealed therein, the time of the absence or concealment of the person shall not be deemed or taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of such action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Thus, the tolling statute addresses both the circumstance where a person is out of the state (or concealed within the state) when the cause of action accrues against the person, and where the person departs from and resides out of the state (or is concealed within the state) after the cause of action accrues. Here, it is undisputed that defendant left the state after plaintiffs claims had accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In <em>Whittington v. Davis, </em>221 Or 209, 350 P2d 913 (1960), the Supreme Court considered the effect of the 1959 version of ORS 12.150 in the context of an action for personal injuries sustained in a car accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff contended that, because the defendant had \u201ceither secreted herself within this state or had absented herself therefrom,\u201d ORS 12.150 (1959) applied to toll the running of the statute of limitation during the period of the defendant\u2019s absence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>concealment. <em>Whittington, </em>221 Or at 210. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the tolling statute was inapplicable because <em>former </em>ORS 15.190 (1959), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1979, ch 284, \u00a7 199, gave the plaintiff the ability to serve the defendant in Oregon through a statutorily designated agent. <em>Former </em>ORS 15.190 provided that the Secretary of State was an agent for the purpose of serving any motorist on a claim arising from an accident or collision while using an Oregon highway. <em>Whittington, </em>221 Or at 210. The court rejected the plaintiffs contention that the court was implicitly amending ORS 12.150 (1959) to add a qualification not otherwise expressed in the <em>statute </em>\u2014 viz., that tolling under the statute does not apply when the defendant is a motorist. <em>Whittington, </em>221 Or at 212. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">\u201cThe effect of our holding is merely to say that a motorist using the highways of Oregon, within ORS 15.190, <em>makes himself available for the service of summons upon him by the designation of a lawful agent for that purpose. </em>The availability of the right to compel the attendance of the defendant or to obtain and enforce a valid judgment against him is all that a plaintiff is entitled to. When such a right is present there is no cause to apply the tolling statute at all.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Winters v. Jacobson, </em>221 Or 214, 215, 350 P2d 1078 (1960) (memorandum opinion holding that <em>Whittington </em>controlled under similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">At the time of <em>Whittington, </em>the words \u201cand service cannot be made within the state\u201d did not appear in ORS 12.150. <em>See </em>271 Or App at 20 n 5 (setting out text of ORS 12.150 (1959)). That wording was added to the first part of the statute in 1973. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1973, ch 206, \u00a7 1 (\u201cIf, when a cause of action accrues against any person, he is out of the state <em>and service cannot be made within the state </em>***.\u201d (Emphasis added.)) As we later observed in <em>Santos v. The Flxible Co. Inc., </em>41 Or App 89, 93 n 5, 597 P2d 373 (1979), that addition \u201cindicate [d] legislative approval of the <em>Whittington </em>rule.\u201d We went on to apply the <em>Whittington </em>rule in <em>Santos, </em>concluding that, because substituted service (on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the Corporation Commissioner) of the nonresident corporation was available under <em>former </em>ORS 57.700(2)(b) (1979), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1987, ch 52, \u00a7 181, ORS 12.150 did not apply to toll the applicable statute of limitation. <em>Santos, </em>41 Or App at 92-93.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Ten years later, we decided <em>Gary M. Buford and Associates, Inc. v. Guillory, </em>98 Or App 691, 780 P2d 783, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 660 (1989) <em>(Guillory). </em>There, the plaintiff contended that the six-year statute of limitation on his action for recovery of amounts due on two promissory notes was tolled under ORS 12.150 when the defendant left the state <em>after </em>the right of action had accrued. <em>Id. </em>at 693. Thus, it was the second part of ORS 12.150 that was implicated in Guillory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Agreeing with the plaintiff, we concluded that the \u201cplain language\u201d of ORS 12.150 applied to toll the limitation period when the defendant left the state. <em>Guillory, </em>98 Or App at 694. The defendant argued that \u2014 -just as in <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Santos </em>\u2014 the tolling statute did not apply \u201cbecause alternative methods of service, specifically mailing and publication, were available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected that argument, distinguishing <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Santos </em>on the ground that neither involved \u201ca situation where a resident defendant left the state <em>after </em>a claim accrued,\u201d and held that \u201cORS 12.150 does not provide such an exception to tolling when a defendant leaves the state <em>after </em>a claim has accrued.\u201d <em>Guillory, </em>98 Or App at 694 (emphases added). Thus, without reference to the words of the statute, we appeared to discern a distinction between the two parts of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">However, we later (and, as explained below, correctly) disavowed that reasoning in <em>Wright v. Osborne, </em>151 Or App 466, 469 n 1, 949 P2d 321 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 448 (1998). In <em>Wright, </em>the question was whether ORCP 7 D(4), which had replaced <em>former </em>ORS 15.190, affected the vitality of the exception to tolling announced in <em>Whittington. </em>We concluded that it did not, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201cthe two provisions are similar in the critical respect on which the <em>Whittington </em>decision turned: <em>ultimately, </em>regardless of where the defendant might be or how successfully the defendant may have obscured his whereabouts, ORCP 7 D(4) gives the plaintiff the same ability as ORS 15.190 did \u2018to compel the attendance of the defendant or to obtain and enforce a valid judgment against him,\u2019 <em>by consummating service on the state </em>agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><em>Wright, </em>151 Or App at 470 (first emphasis in original; second emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We also explained in a footnote that, although our earlier conclusion in <em>Guillory </em>was correct, our explanation was not. Specifically, the feature distinguishing <em>Guillory </em>from <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Santos </em>was not, as we had said, that <em>Guillory </em>\u2014 unlike the earlier cases \u2014 involved a situation in which the defendant had left the state <em>after </em>the claim had accrued. <em>Wright, </em>151 Or App at 469 n 1. Rather, the reason <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Santos </em>did not assist the defendant in <em>Guillory </em>was because, in the earlier cases, the relevant statutes permitted a form of substituted service <em>instead of </em>personal service on the defendant, whereas \u201cthe general mailing and publication methods on which the defendant relied in <em>Guillory </em>are simply alternative (and less satisfactory) methods of constructively serving the <em>defendant himself.\u201d Wright, </em>151 Or App at 469 n 1 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Herzberg v. Moseley Aviation, Inc., </em>156 Or App 1, 4-5, 964 P2d 1137 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 275 (1999), we \u201cadhered\u201d to our statement in <em>Wright, </em>which we understood to mean that the statute of limitation is tolled under ORS 12.150 \u201cas to a defendant who is absent from the state and can be served only by mail or other indirect means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. We explained that, under the statute, the key inquiry is \u201cthe possibility of service <em>within the state, </em>not service in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (emphasis in original). To conclude otherwise, we reasoned, would read the phrase \u201cwithin the state\u201d out of the statute, <em>see </em>ORS 12.150 (\u201c[i]f, when a cause of action accrues against any person, the person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>out of the state and service cannot be made within the state * * *\u201d), and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201ceffectively make ORS 12.150 inoperable in the case of any defendant who could be served anywhere and by any means. Because that would include all defendants over whom the Oregon courts <em>could </em>obtain personal jurisdiction, ORS 12.150 would not apply to any defendant * * * and the statute would be rendered a nullity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). We emphasized that \u201c[t]he objective of the statute is not to assure that service can be effected, but to assure that a plaintiffs ability to bring a timely action is not defeated or frustrated by the inaccesibility of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, the legislature determined that limiting the benefit of the suspension period under ORS 12.150 to situations where \u201cservice cannot be made within the state\u201d would properly further that objective. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The legislative history of the 1973 amendment to ORS 12.150 that added the phrase \u201cand service cannot be made within the state\u201d confirms our conclusion in <em>Wright </em>(to which we adhered in <em>Herzberg) </em>that \u2014 although the placement of the phrase may indicate otherwise \u2014 the legislature did not intend to make a distinction between the two circumstances addressed in the statute. Rather, the change was intended simply to codify existing law, specifically <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Winters. See </em>Minutes, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 137, Mar 7, 1973, at 2 (so stating).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">At hearings on the bill, members of the Committee on Procedures and Practice of the Oregon State Bar (OSB) described the holding of <em>Whittington </em>and <em>Winters </em>and testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\"><em>\u201c[t]he proposed amendment would prevent the statute of limitations running where the defendant is not within the state but could be served outside the state under the long arm statute. </em>ORS 14.035. The proposed amendment would allow the statute to run <em>if </em>the defendant could be served within the state through a statutory or other type of agent or jurisdiction in rem is possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Testimony, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 137, Mar 7, 1973, Ex G (statement of William V. Deatherage and Bruce Kellington, Committee on Procedures and Practice of the OSB) (emphasis added); Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, SB 137, May 23, 1973, Ex (unnumbered) (same). In a hearing before the House Committee on Judiciary, David Templeton, another member of the OSB procedures and practice committee, explained that the bill was intended to codify court interpretations of ORS 12.150 that, \u201cif service could be made on Department of Motor Vehicles [,] the statute of limitations continued its run even though the man concealed himself within the state or <em>left the state!\u2019 </em>Minutes, House Judiciary Committee, SB 137, May 23, 1973, at 4 (describing testimony of David Templeton) (emphasis added). That is, regardless of whether the defendant is out of state (or concealed) when the cause of action accrues or leaves (or conceals himself or herself) later, the key inquiry in determining whether ORS 12.150 applies to toll the statute of limitation is whether the defendant can be served within the state. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d (and the other requirements of the statute are satisfied), then ORS 12.150 does not apply and the limitation period continues to run. If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then the limitation period is tolled under ORS 12.150.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">With that background in mind, resolution of the statutory question in this case is straightforward. Defendant argued to the trial court that the limitation period was not tolled by ORS 12.150 because he was subject to service and personal jurisdiction under ORCP 4, that is, under Oregon\u2019s long-arm rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the principles announced in <em>Wright </em>and <em>Hertzberg </em>\u2014 and confirmed by the legislative history of the 1973 amendment to ORS 12.150 \u2014 that argument fails because ORCP 4 does not provide a mechanism for in-state service of an out-of-state defendant. Rather, ORCP 4 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that the court has personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant served under ORCP 7 on claims for which the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Oregon. ORCP 7, in turn, allows for various methods of service, including service by mail. Thus, under ORCP 4, a plaintiff is able to serve a defendant out <em>of state </em>for the purpose of litigating the plaintiffs claims in the state. Accordingly, unless we conclude that its application would violate the Commerce Clause, ORS 12.150 tolled the running of the statute of limitation on plaintiffs claims after defendant moved to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">B. <em>Commerce Clause Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c [t] o regulate Commerce *** among the several states.\u201d US Const, Art I, \u00a7 8, cl 3. \u201cThough phrased as a grant of regulatory power to Congress, the Clause has long been understood to have a \u2018negative\u2019 [also referred to as \u2018dormant\u2019] aspect that denies the States the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.\u201d <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., </em>511 US 93, 98, 114 S Ct 1345, 128 L Ed 2d 13 (1994). \u201cIn its negative aspect, the Commerce Clause prohibits economic protectionism \u2014 that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 US 325, 330, 116 S </em>Ct 848, 133 L Ed 2d 796 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u201cIf a restriction on commerce is discriminatory, it is virtually <em>per se </em>invalid. * * * By contrast, nondiscriminatory regulations that have only incidental effects on interstate commerce are valid unless \u2018the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u2019\u201d <em>Oregon Waste Systems, </em>511 US at 99 (quoting <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 US 137, 142, 90 S Ct 844, 25 L Ed 2d 174 (1970)). In <em>Pike, </em>the United States Supreme Court described the latter test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cWhere the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">397 US at 142 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Here, as noted, plaintiff argues that \u201cthere is no evidence in the trial court record regarding any interference with, let alone burden on\u201d interstate commerce. Defendant responds that defendant\u2019s move to Washington is, \u201cin and of itself,\u201d interstate commerce and the tolling statute \u201cburdens [defendant\u2019s] ability to move from state to state, which is an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, particularly when balanced against the ability to obtain jurisdiction over [defendant] under the Oregon long[-]arm statute.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court agreed with defendant that application of ORS 12.150 in this case would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\"><em>Bendix </em>is the governing Supreme Court case applying the dormant Commerce Clause in the context of a statute that tolls a limitation period. There, the plaintiff, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, brought a breach-of-contract action in federal district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>court in Ohio against the defendant, an Illinois corporation, after a dispute arose over the defendant\u2019s delivery and installation of a boiler system at the plaintiffs Ohio facility. 486 US at 890. The defendant asserted that the plaintiffs claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitation; the plaintiff responded that the limitation period was tolled under an Ohio statute that suspended the running of the time for claims against entities that are not present in the state and have not designated an agent for service of process in Ohio. <em>Id. </em>After reiterating the principles announced in <em>Pike,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201c[a]lthough statute of limitations defenses are not a fundamental right, it is obvious that they are an integral part of the legal system and are relied upon to protect the liabilities of persons and corporations active in the commercial sphere. The State may not withdraw such defenses on conditions repugnant to the Commerce Clause. <em>Where a State denies ordinary legal defenses or like privileges to out-of-state persons or corporations engaged in commerce, the state law will be reviewed under the Commerce Clause to determine whether the denial is discriminatory on its face or an impermissible burden on commerce. </em>The State may not condition the exercise of the defense on the waiver or relinquishment of rights that the foreign corporation would otherwise retain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 893 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Ultimately, the Court concluded that the Ohio provision violated the dormant Commerce Clause, reasoning that, under Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme, the defendant corporation \u2014 which had no corporate office in Ohio, was not registered to do business in Ohio, and had not appointed an agent for service of process in Ohio \u2014 would have had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cappoint a resident agent for service of process in Ohio and subject itself to the general jurisdiction of the Ohio courts\u201d in order to gain the protection of the statute of limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 891-92.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\">\u201c[t]he Ohio statutory scheme *** forces a foreign corporation to choose between exposure to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts or forfeiture of the limitations defense, remaining subject to suit in Ohio in perpetuity.

Consequently, the Court concluded, \u201cthe Ohio statute imposes a greater burden on out-of-state companies than it does on Ohio companies, subjecting the activities of foreign and domestic corporations to inconsistent regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894 (citation omitted). That burden, the Court concluded, \u201cexceeds any local interest the State might advance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 891, explaining that, because Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute would have permitted service on the out-of-state corporation throughout the limitation period, the state could not justify subjecting out-of-state entities to more onerous requirements based on its desire to protect its residents from corporations that become liable for acts done within the state but later leave the jurisdiction, <em>id. </em>at 893-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Applying those principles in the present case, it is clear that application of ORS 12.150 would, in Bendix\u2019s terms, deny defendant, an out-of-state person, the benefit of an ordinary legal <em>defense </em>\u2014 viz., application of a statute of limitation. <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 893. The threshold question to be resolved, however, is whether defendant is an out-of-state person <em>engaged in commerce </em>for purposes of the Commerce Clause. <em>Id.; see, e.g., Dan Clark Family Ltd. Partnership v. Miramontes, </em>193 Cal App 4th 219, 231, 122 Cal Rptr 3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>517 (2011) (\u201cUnder <em>Bendix, </em>we first consider whether application of [the tolling statute] in this case \u2018denies ordinary-legal defenses or like privileges to out-of-state persons . . . engaged in commerce.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 893)); <em>Tesar v. Hallas, </em>738 F Supp 240, 241-42 (ND Ohio 1990) (\u201cThe threshold question is whether [the defendant] can be deemed, in [C]ommerce [C]lause terms, to be or to have been \u2018engaged in commerce.\u2019\u201d). Although that is a question of first impression in Oregon, courts in other jurisdictions have confronted similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In <em>Tesar, </em>for example, the federal district court considered an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to a portion of the same Ohio tolling statute that was invalidated in <em>Bendix. </em>The court noted that, \u201c[u]nlike the corporation in <em>Bendix, </em>[the defendant] is not alleged to have been engaged in a business causing him frequently to ship goods or to travel himself interstate,\u201d <em>Tesar, </em>738 F Supp at 242; rather, the defendant had simply lived and worked in Ohio and then moved to Pennsylvania. However, because the defendant had moved to Pennsylvania <em>to begin a new job in that state, </em>the court concluded that interstate commerce was nonetheless sufficiently implicated, noting that the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018the movement of persons falls within... the Commerce Clause,\u201d\u2019 <em>id. (quoting Edwards v. California, </em>314 US 160, 172, 62 S Ct 164, 86 L Ed 119 (1941)), and other courts have since \u201cfollowed suit, holding that interstate commerce is affected when persons move between states <em>in the course of or in search for employment,\u201d id. </em>(emphasis added; citations omitted). As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cThe ability of businesses to recruit out-of-state personnel will be adversely affected if these potential employees must forfeit statute of limitations protection. Following Bendix\u2019s holding that requiring foreign corporations to submit to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts \u2018is an unreasonable burden on commerce,\u2019 it seems plainly \u2018unreasonable\u2019 for persons who have committed acts they know might be considered tortious to be held hostage until the applicable limitations period expires. Persons in that position, or businesses desirous of hiring them, would be burdened to a greater degree than Bendix\u2019s foreign corporations, because Ohio has no procedure that permits a person who wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>to move out-of-state to register with the state for service purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><em>Tesar, </em>738 F Supp at 242; <em>see also Ward v. Graue, </em>987 NE2d 760 (Ohio Ct App 2013) (affirming trial court grant of summary judgment to out-of-state defendant on ground that plaintiffs complaint for negligence involving a motor-vehicle accident had been filed after the expiration of the limitation period and the tolling provision in RC 2305.15 could not constitutionally be applied under the facts of the case, where defendant\u2019s affidavit established that defendant was traveling in Ohio in the course of employment at the time of the accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Similarly, in <em>Grover v. Bartsch, </em>170 Ohio App 3d 188, 866 NE2d 547 (2006), the court held that the tolling provision could not constitutionally be applied to a nonresident defendant who was in Ohio on the date that a defamation action accrued, because \u201cthe application of the tolling provision to an out-of-state defendant \u2014 regardless of whether that defendant is an individual or a corporation \u2014 would cause the defendant to be perpetually subject to liability in Ohio,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 200, 866 NE2d at 557, and \u201ccreate an impermissible burden on interstate commerce,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 201, 866 NE2d at 558. There again, however, it was significant that the defendant had travelled to Ohio for business purposes\u2014 promoting his upcoming book and making prepublication sales of that book \u2014 thus, he was engaged in interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 866 NE2d at 557-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Abramson v. Brownstein, </em>897 F2d 389 (9th Cir 1990), is also informative. The issue before the Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>was the constitutionality of a California tolling provision as applied to an action for breach of contract and other claims based on a sales transaction between two California residents \u2014 World Coin Partners and its general partner, Abramson \u2014 and a Massachusetts resident.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 390. The threshold question was satisfied in that case because the defendant \u201cwas engaged in interstate commerce when, as a Massachusetts resident, he entered into a sales transaction with Californians Abramson and World.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Abramson, </em>the complaint was based on conduct that <em>itself </em>involved an activity of interstate commerce. <em>See also Dan Clark Family Ltd. Partnership, </em>193 Cal App 4th at 231 (allegations of complaint demonstrated that the conduct underlying the plaintiffs claims was an interstate commercial transaction; thus, the defendants were \u201cout-of-state persons\u201d who were \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d under <em>Bendix).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">By contrast, in <em>Pratali v. Gates, </em>4 Cal App 4th 632, 643, 5 Cal Rptr 2d 733 (1992), the court, considering the same statute that was at issue in <em>Abramson, </em>determined that there were \u201cinsufficient circumstances [implicating] interstate commerce to invoke the [C]ommerce [C]lause.\u201d The court observed that, although the loan at issue was made in Nevada and payable in California,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cthere is no evidence respondent was in the business of making loans or was otherwise engaged in commerce. Although appellant would have us believe the loan proceeds were used in a commercial venture in another state, there is no competent evidence in the record to substantiate this assertion. * * * In any event, we question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>a single amicable loan between California acquaintances while visiting in Las Vegas can rise to the level of interstate commerce within the meaning of the [C]ommerce [C]lause \u2014 however the proceeds are used. *** Consequently, we reject appellant\u2019s attempt to characterize the transaction as interstate commerce and find, under the particular circumstances in this case, application of the tolling provision of section 351 does not violate the [C]ommerce [C]lause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><em>Pratali, </em>4 Cal App 4th at 643. \u201cThus,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cwhile section 351\u2019s tolling provision may violate the [Commerce [C] lause as applied to a defendant engaged in interstate commerce, there is no showing the statute violates the [C]ommerce [C] lause <em>when applied to a noncommercial defendant not engaged in interstate </em>commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In the present case, the record demonstrates only that defendant moved from Oregon to Washington in November 2003 and has been living in Washington continuously since then. There is no evidence that defendant relocated for employment purposes or moved to Washington in the course of any other business or commercial endeavor, nor does the underlying claim involve an interstate commercial transaction. Thus, in our view, here, as in <em>Pratali, </em>\u201cthere are insufficient circumstances [implicating] interstate commerce to invoke the [C]ommerce [C]lause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">As noted, the trial court relied on other cases, in particular, <em>Bloomquist </em>and <em>Heritage Marketing, </em>to arrive at the contrary conclusion that, because application of the statute would \u201cburden [] the defendant\u2019s ability to move from state to state,\u201d \u201cthat alone is a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to implicate the Commerce Clause.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In <em>Bloomquist, </em>the Missouri Supreme Court held unconstitutional a provision that tolled the statute of limitation \u2014 in that case, for medical malpractice \u2014 as to a Missouri resident who had moved out of the state during the limitation period. 244 SW3d at 144. The court rejected the argument that, because the defendant doctor\u2019s treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the patient that gave rise to the medical malpractice claim occurred in Missouri while both were Missouri residents, it did <em>not </em>implicate interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 142. The court held that, because the statute tolled the statute of limitation based solely on the out-of-state residence of the defendant doctor, it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\u201cthereby \u2018impose [es] a greater burden on out-of-state [defendants] than it does on [resident defendants].\u2019 <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 894 * * *. <em>As so applied, it plainly discourages and burdens his ability to move from state to state, which runs afoul of the Commerce Clause\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Bloomquist, </em>244 SW3d at 142-43 (emphasis added; brackets in <em>Bloomquist). </em>As support for that position, the court simply quoted, in a footnote and without elaboration, <em>Hoke v. United States, </em>227 US 308, 320, 33 S Ct 281, 57 L Ed 523 (1913) (\u201c\u2018Commerce among the states *** consists of intercourse and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transportation of persons and property. There may be, therefore, a movement of persons as well as of property; that is, a person may move or be moved in interstate commerce.\u2019\u201d). <em>Bloomquist, </em>244 SW3d at 143 n 4 (quoting <em>Hoke, </em>227 US at 320).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In <em>Heritage Marketing, </em>160 Cal App 4th at 763, a California appellate court adopted the reasoning of <em>Bloomquist </em>to invalidate a similar California tolling statute. Although the trial court there had found that the \u201cessence of this case is that defendants, residents of Texas, are wrongfully competing with plaintiff, a California company,\u201d <em>Heritage Marketing, </em>160 Cal App 4th at 759 and, therefore, \u201cthis competition between companies in different states constitutes interstate commerce,\u201d <em>id., </em>the appellate court apparently did not rely on that reasoning. Instead the court explained that it was persuaded by <em>Bloomquist </em>and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cSection 351 penalizes people who move out of state by imposing a longer statute of limitations on them than on those who remain in the state. <em>The [C]ommerce [C]lause protects persons from such restraints on their movements across state lines. </em>(See <em>Service Mach. &amp; Shipbuilding Corp. v. Edwards </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 617 F.2d 70, 73, affd. <em>sub nom. Edwards v. Service Machine &amp; Shipping Corp. </em>(1980) 449 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>U.S. 913 [66 L. Ed. 2d 142, 101 S. Ct. 310], citing <em>Edwards v. California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 160, 172 [86 L. Ed. 119, 62 S. Ct. 164].) <em>By creating disincentives to travel across state lines and imposing costs on those who wish to do so, the statute prevents or limits the exercise of the right to freedom of movement.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><em>Heritage Marketing, </em>160 Cal App 4th at 763-64 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We are not persuaded by the reasoning of those cases. Although creating a \u201cdisincentive [] to travel across state lines\u201d may very well implicate the constitutional right to travel between states, <em>see State v. Berringer, </em>234 Or App 665, 671-72, 229 P3d 615, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010) (noting that, although the source of the constitutional right to travel between states has not been \u201cidentified definitively,\u201d it \u201cundoubtedly exists\u201d), we fail to see how moving across state lines \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 constitutes \u201cengaging\u201d in interstate commerce for purposes of invoking the dormant Commerce Clause. We disagree that <em>Hoke </em>and Edwards\u2014 the Supreme Court precedent on which <em>Bloomquist </em>and <em>Heritage Marketing </em>are ultimately predicated \u2014 compel the conclusion that a decision by an individual to move from one state to another, without evidence of any economic purpose or activity in doing so, is \u201cengaging] in [interstate] commerce\u201d under <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Hoke </em>is easily distinguishable. In <em>Hoke, </em>the Court held that a congressional enactment making it a crime to transport or cause to be transported women and girls in interstate commerce for immoral purposes was within Congress\u2019s commerce power.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 227 US at 320-23. As the Court described it, \u201cWhat the act condemns is transportation obtained or aided or transportation induced in interstate commerce, for the immoral purposes mentioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. (The case involved allegations that the defendants had enticed women and girls to go from Louisiana to Texas for the purpose of engaging in prostitution.) Thus, <em>Hoke </em>stands for the unremarkable proposition that the activity of transporting others across state lines for purposes of commerce, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>or aiding in that activity, is \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d within Congress\u2019s power to regulate under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In <em>Edwards, </em>the Court examined the constitutionality, under the dormant Commerce Clause, of a California statute prohibiting the transportation of indigent people into the state. 314 US at 160. Specifically, the statute provided, \u201c\u2018Every person, firm or corporation or officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a resident of the state, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 (quoting Cal Welf &amp; Inst Code \u00a7 2615 (1937)). The Court struck the provision as violative of the dormant Commerce Clause, reasoning that \u201cthe transportation of persons is \u2018commerce,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 172, and that the California law at issue raised an \u201cunconstitutional barrier\u201d to that commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 173. The Court explained that the dormant Commerce Clause protects \u201cagainst attempts on the part of any single State to isolate itself from difficulties common to all of them by restraining the transportation of persons and property across its borders,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 173, and the statute in question was \u201csquarely in conflict\u201d with that principle, <em>id. </em>at 174. The Court held, \u201cThe burden upon interstate commerce is intended and immediate; it is the plain and sole function of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The same is not true here. ORS 12.150 does not attempt to regulate the activity of transporting others across state lines in an attempt to isolate the state from problems common throughout the country, much less is it the statute\u2019s \u201cplain and sole function.\u201d Moreover, as in <em>Hoke, Edwards </em>does not imply that moving oneself (as opposed to arranging for the transportation of others) across state lines is interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Defendant also relies on <em>Service Mach. &amp; Shipbuilding Corp. </em>(which was cited by the court in <em>Heritage Marketing) </em>to support his theory that moving from one state to another is, itself, engaging in interstate commerce. Although the Fifth Circuit bluntly stated in that case that, \u201cthe movement of persons falls within the protection of the [C]ommerce [C]lause,\u201d 617 F2d at 73 (citing <em>Edwards, </em>314 US at 172), the precise issue before the court was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>constitutionality of a Louisiana parish ordinance that established a worker-registration system. The purpose of the ordinance was to \u201cprovide for the identification and registration of itinerant laborers seeking employment within [the parish].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Thus, in that case, the statute directly affected the movement of people for purposes of commerce\u2014 that is, employment. We are reluctant to extrapolate from that narrow holding the principle that an individual engages in interstate commerce simply by moving himself or herself from one state to another, without any evidence of a similar nexus with commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to establish the threshold requirement that he is an out-of-state person \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d for purposes of invoking the dormant Commerce Clause; accordingly, ORS 12.150 does not, as applied here, violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The trial court correctly determined that ORS 12.150 applies to plaintiffs claims; however, the court erred in concluding that its application violates the dormant Commerce Clause. There is no dispute between the parties that, if ORS 12.150 applies to toll the statute of limitation, then plaintiffs claims were timely.

Those contentions are unavailing. The trial court decided precisely the issue that we are asked to consider here: whether ORS 12.150 unreasonably burdens the flow of interstate commerce by negatively affecting defendant\u2019s ability to move from state to state. Moreover, the parties stipulated to the fact necessary to review that legal ruling on appeal \u2014 that defendant moved from Oregon to Washington in November 2003 and lived there continuously up to and including the time of trial. (That fact is also established by the portion of the record that was submitted on appeal by agreement of the parties.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Defendant makes a passing reference, in the summary-of-facts section of his brief, that he had \u201cma[de] reference during his testimony at trial regarding his employment records in Washington.\u201d However, defendant does not argue that such a reference would support a finding that defendant had moved to Washington for employment purposes, nor are those facts supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> The Court framed the analysis this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cWhere the burden of a state regulation falls on interstate commerce, restricting its flow in a manner not applicable to local business and trade, there may be either a discrimination that renders the regulation invalid without more, or cause to weigh and assess the State\u2019s putative interests against the interstate restraints to determine if the burden imposed is an unreasonable one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 891 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> Under Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme, the statute of limitation tolled indefinitely against nonresident defendants unless those defendants appointed an agent for service of process in Ohio. <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 889.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The court ultimately concluded that application of the tolling provision presented an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce when weighed against the state\u2019s interest in enacting the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201c[T]he prospective individual defendant has an even more draconian choice to make than that presented to the foreign corporation in <em>Beridix. </em>There being no mechanism by which he could register with the state for service purposes, [the defendant] would have had to choose between traveling out-of-state and enjoying the protection of the statute of limitations. He would have had to forego the position in Pittsburgh, or at least delay it substantially. On the other hand, again like in <em>Bendix, </em>[the plaintiff] would have had no trouble obtaining personal jurisdiction over [the defendant] via Ohio\u2019s long arm statute; O.R.C. \u00a7 2307.38.2(3) provides for jurisdiction over one alleged to have caused tortious injury in the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-9\"><em>Tesar, </em>738 F Supp at 242-43 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> Under California case law, the tolling statute applied even though the defendant had never been physically present in California. <em>Abramson, </em>897 F2d at 391.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> The court concluded that the statute imposed a significant burden on commerce because it \u201cforces a nonresident individual engaged in interstate commerce to choose between being present in California for several years or forfeiture of the limitations defense, remaining subject to suit in California in perpetuity.\u201d <em>Abramson, 897 </em>F2d at 392 (citing <em>Bendix, </em>486 US at 893).
