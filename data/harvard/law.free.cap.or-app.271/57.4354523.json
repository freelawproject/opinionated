J.</author>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment finding him in contempt for failure to pay child support and imposing 60 months of bench probation. He contends that the trial court erred in finding him in contempt and that the court \u201cplainly erred when it imposed a determinate term of probation on the basis of proceedings that were not conducted as provided in the punitive contempt statute.\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in holding him in contempt, but agree that the court committed plain error in imposing a determinate term of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand the portion of the judgment imposing a punitive contempt sanction, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">As part of a dissolution of marriage, defendant was ordered to pay $604 per month in child support. Defendant, who has a law degree and has worked in the past as a financial planner, began having financial troubles. He was unemployed or underemployed for several years, although he attempted to find employment. Defendant fell behind on his child support and, at the time the contempt motion was filed, owed thousands of dollars in arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In 2012, the state moved for a show cause order for the imposition of remedial sanctions for contempt. It asserted that the \u201cimposition of remedial sanctions of contempt is necessary to enforce the support and motivate future compliance with the support order [.]\u201d The court entered an order to show cause, and defendant responded by raising the affirmative defense \u201cof inability to comply with [the] Court\u2019s order to pay child support, for the reason that he has had insufficient funds to do so since 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">At the contempt hearing, the court heard evidence regarding defendant\u2019s financial difficulties and attempts to find employment. It also heard evidence that, after the contempt motion was filed, defendant began having health problems. There was also evidence that defendant had received approximately $5,000 from a settlement and $3,000 as a gift from a relative, but had not used any of that money for child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>support. However, he had purchased several things such as running shoes, guitar strings, and an antique camera to give as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The trial court found that defendant could not pay all the back child support that he owed, but noted that its \u201cinterpretation of the failur\u00e9 to pay defense is not hey, I can\u2019t pay the $600 a month, therefore I have a defense. It comes down to, can you pay anything? Can you pay a dollar?\u201d The court found that, although defendant could not \u201cpay the $600 a month,\u201d he could have paid something and did not. Accordingly, the court determined that defendant\u2019s failure to pay was willful, \u201cthat the failure to pay defense was not complete,\u201d and, therefore, found defendant in contempt. As noted, in its judgment, the trial court imposed a determinate term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it found him in contempt. He asserts that he was \u201cnot in contempt because he established the affirmative defense of inability to pay by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u201cIt has long been Oregon law that a willful failure to pay ordered child support constitutes contempt and that a case of contempt is established by proof that a person willfully failed to comply with a valid support order [.]\u201d <em>State ex rel Mikkelsen v. Hill, </em>315 Or 452, 456, 847 P2d 402 (1993). Willful disobedience \u201cof a court order to pay child support is established by showing that a party, aware of a court order, neither has complied with nor sought a modification of the court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458. In a \u201ccontempt proceeding brought for failure to pay child support, inability to comply with the support order is an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden of establishing that defense is on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Defendant does not dispute the trial court\u2019s factual determination that he was able to pay something toward his child support obligation but had failed to do so. Instead, defendant asserts that the trial court \u201capplied an incorrect legal standard to the affirmative defense of inability to pay.\u201d The court understood the defense to \u201ccome[] down to\u201d whether a defendant could pay anything at all toward child support. In defendant\u2019s view, contrary to the trial court\u2019s understanding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the defense does not require a defendant to establish that he cannot pay anything. Rather, in defendant\u2019s view, where there was a court order requiring him to pay a certain amount per month and he established that \u201che was unable to comply with the court order,\u201d the court committed legal error in finding him to be in contempt. Defendant is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u201cIf the defendant is able to comply partially with the decree, the law requires that he comply to the extent of his ability.\u201d <em>State ex rel Fry v. Fry, </em>28 Or App 403, 406, 559 P2d 1293 (1977); <em>see also State ex rel Wolf v. Wolf, 11 </em>Or App 477, 480, 503 P2d 1255 (1972) (\u201cThe law requires that one comply with the court\u2019s order to the extent of his ability.\u201d). Thus, where a defendant could not fully comply with a support order, but had some money that he could have, but failed to, apply toward his support obligation, that defendant may be properly held in contempt. <em>See State ex rel Wolf, </em>11 Or App at 480 (a defendant was properly held in contempt for failure to pay support where, although it was \u201cobvious that he could not have complied fully with the\u201d support order, \u201cthere was evidence that defendant, during [the relevant] period, had <em>some </em>funds in his hands which he could have applied toward [the support obligation], but *** he chose to make other application of his money\u201d (emphasis in original)). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the trial court in this case did not apply an incorrect legal standard and did not err in holding defendant in contempt where it found that he could have paid something toward his support obligation but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant asserts that the \u201ctrial court plainly erred when it imposed a determinate term of probation on the basis of proceedings that were not conducted as provided in the punitive contempt statute.\u201d <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d). Specifically, because the proceedings before the trial court were for remedial sanctions, defendant asserts that the trial court was not authorized to impose a determinate term of probation. In response, the state observes that the \u201ccase law is clear that a determinate term of probation is punitive, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>remedial, and there is no dispute that the proceeding below was initiated as a proceeding for the imposition of remedial sanctions.\u201d Thus, the state agrees that \u201cit was an error of law apparent on the face of the record for the trial court to impose a determinate term of probation on defendant.\u201d We agree, and accept that concession. <em>See </em>ORS 33.045(2) (a sanction is remedial \u201cif it continues or accumulates until the defendant complies with the court\u2019s order or judgment\u201d and is punitive \u201cif it is for a definite period that will not be reduced even if the defendant complies with the court\u2019s order or judgment\u201d); ORS 33.065 (setting forth requirements for proceedings to impose punitive sanctions for contempt); <em>Miller and Miller, </em>204 Or App 82, 129 P3d 211 (2006) (trial court may not impose a punitive sanction in remedial contempt proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The state nonetheless asserts that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error. In deciding whether to exercise our discretion to correct plain error, we consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the . case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, i.e., whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\"><em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991). In light of those considerations, we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in this case. Specifically, as defendant points out, neither party has an interest in maintaining an unlawful contempt sanction, and the sentence \u201centails a risk of probation violation proceedings and sanctions to which defendant would not otherwise be subject.\u201d In short, we agree that the interests of the parties, the gravity of the error, and the ends of justice require correction of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Portion of judgment imposing punitive contempt sanction reversed and remanded for entry of judgment imposing remedial contempt sanction; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, defendant raises three additional assignments of error, which we reject without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
