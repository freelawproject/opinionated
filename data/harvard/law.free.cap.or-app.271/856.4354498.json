That judgment was entered following a status hearing at which mother participated by telephone and, in the judgment, the court noted that mother was defaulted for failing to appear at the hearing in person, though she had appeared telephonically.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Mother, whose attorney had been present at the hearing, subsequently filed a motion to set aside the default and \u201cthe Judgment of Jurisdiction and Disposition that was entered as a result of the default,\u201d asserting that mother had appeared and participated in the hearing and, alternatively, that any \u201cfailure to appear was due to good cause or excusable neglect.\u201d In support of her motion, mother\u2019s attorney filed a declaration asserting that mother had appeared in person before the court in this case at several prior hearings, but that she had been mistaken about the date of the hearing in question and, although not physically present at the hearing, had participated by telephone. The court denied mother\u2019s motion to set aside the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Mother appeals, asserting that the \u201cjuvenile court erred in denying mother\u2019s motion to set aside its \u2018default\u2019 judgment asserting jurisdiction over [M].\u201d She asserts, in part, that the juvenile court \u201chad no authority to enter a \u2018default\u2019 judgment as a punitive measure when mother appeared by phone and through counsel for the scheduled status hearing.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) The Department of Human Services concedes that, \u201cin the unique circumstances presented by this case,\u201d the juvenile court erred \u201cin denying mother\u2019s motion to set the jurisdiction judgment aside, and the judgment should be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We agree with the parties that the juvenile court erred in denying mother\u2019s motion under the circumstances presented here. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the juvenile court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
