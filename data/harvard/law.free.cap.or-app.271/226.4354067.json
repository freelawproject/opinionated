SAIF assigns error to the board\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe medical opinions upon which it relied were legally sufficient or otherwise adequate to prove major contributing cause under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A).\u201d We conclude that the board did not err, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We summarize the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ) findings of fact, which the board adopted. On September 6, 2007, while working for employer and assigned to a glass company, claimant sustained a compensable injury when two glass shower doors landed on the top of his left foot. SAIF accepted the claim for closed left foot fracture, and abrasions and contusions to the left foot. Claimant\u2019s attending physician, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Ballard, also noted a \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d amount of swelling. Throughout claimant\u2019s treatment with Ballard, claimant continued to have swelling in his left foot severe enough that Ballard prescribed larger sized work boots to accommodate the swelling. SAIF closed the claim on April 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On April 18, 2008, claimant went to the emergency room complaining of foot and leg swelling with redness, and a fever. He also had an area of \u201coozing\u201d on the top of his foot at the site of the fracture. Claimant was diagnosed with cellulitis, and his condition in the hospital deteriorated rapidly. He was taken to the ICU with renal and respiratory failure, and sepsis of the leg. Claimant was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and administered a tourniquet. The following day, Dr. VanDerHeyden performed a below-the-knee amputation. Lab tests revealed that the necrotizing fasciitis resulted from a group A streptococcal infection. Claimant filed new/omitted medical condition claims for the cellulitis, group A strep infection, necrotizing fasciitis, and the amputation. SAIF denied the claims, and claimant requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The record contains opinions from four of claimant\u2019s treating physicians, including Ballard and VanDerHeyden, as well as three physicians who performed record reviews, and from Dr. Puziss, who examined claimant and authored a report. Those opinions included an explanation that swelling causes reduced blood flow and therefore reduced immunological response that provides a good host environment for bacteria, creating essentially a \u201cpetri dish\u201d for the infection. They explained that group A strep bacteria is ubiquitous and could have entered the body through any minor skin break some time after the work injury, but developed into an infection in the foot because of the swelling there.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Medical opinions differed as to whether claimant\u2019s left foot fracture caused the infection and eventual amputation of his left foot. Dr. Selinger and Dr. Rabinovitch, who conducted record reviews, as well as VanDerHeyden and Puziss, agreed that it was \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cextraordinarily\u201d unlikely that claimant would have developed the infection that led to the amputation of his foot were it not for the chronic swelling associated with his left foot fracture. VanDerHeyden described the infection as \u201ca secondary infection, <em>i.e. </em>complication of the original injury.\u201d Selinger and Rabinovitch, both infectious disease specialists, emphasized that the swelling impaired claimant\u2019s defenses and, thus, allowed the bacteria to thrive. Rabinovitch opined it was \u201chighly likely that the infection occurred as a result of the original trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Following a hearing, the AL J found that claimant\u2019s evidence established the compensability of the conditions under either a material or major contributing cause standard, but concluded that the material contributing cause standard applied because the group A strep infection arose directly from the injury. The ALJ found that claimant met this standard and accordingly set aside the denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">SAIF appealed to the board, arguing that claimant\u2019s claim should be analyzed as a consequential condition claim, subject to the major contributing cause standard, and that claimant failed to prove causation under that standard. The board agreed with SAIF that claimant\u2019s claim was for consequential conditions subject to the major contributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>cause standard. The board, nevertheless, agreed with the ALJ that the conditions were compensable, because it found claimant\u2019s \u201cinjury-related swelling, which resulted in reduced blood flow and compromised immune system defenses,\u201d to be the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s strep infection, which was undisputedly the major contributing cause of the resulting cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and amputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">On review, SAIF contends that the medical opinions upon which the board relied were not \u201clegally sufficient\u201d to prove that claimant\u2019s compensable injury was the major contributing cause of the strep infection. SAIF argues, first, that the experts improperly considered the contribution from claimant\u2019s swelling, which SAIF argues is a \u201cpredisposition\u201d or \u201csusceptibility\u201d and, therefore, \u201clegally excluded from consideration.\u201d SAIF also argues that the medical opinions do not permit the board\u2019s causation finding, because they do not describe claimant\u2019s injury-related swelling as the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of the strep infection and do not reflect the required weighing of injury-related factors against other causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">As an initial matter, we reject SAIF\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the expert opinions. Although SAIF is correct that causation in this case was a complex medical question requiring proof by expert opinion and that an expert\u2019s determination of \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d involves weighing the relative contribution of work-related versus nonwork-related causes, we have repeatedly said that there are no \u201cmagic words\u201d required from experts. <em>See SAIF v. Durant, </em>271 Or App 216, 220, 350 P3d 489 (2015); <em>see also SAIF v. Strubel, </em>161 Or App 516, 521, 984 P2d 903 (1999) (medical opinion that did not explicitly weigh all contributing causes of injury established work was major cause of need for treatment when evaluated in context of record as a whole); <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Arnold, </em>142 Or App 98, 105, 919 P2d 1192 (1996) (medical opinion explicitly addressed only material causation, but established that the claimant\u2019s occupational exposure was the major cause of his need for treatment); <em>McClendon v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., </em>77 Or App 412, 417, 713 P2d 647 (1986) (description of the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>condition as \u201cdue to or aggravated by her occupation\u201d and \u201coccupational disease type involvement\u201d established that work activities were the major contributing cause of the condition or its worsening). Rather, we allow the board to \u201cdraw reasonable inferences\u201d about whether the expert is expressing a \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d opinion and whether the expert engaged in the required weighing process for that opinion. <em>Durant, </em>271 Or App 221 (quoting <em>Benz v. SAIF, </em>170 Or App 22, 26, 11 P3d 698 (2000)). The board\u2019s analysis here makes clear that it interpreted several of the expert opinions in this record as describing a major contributing cause relationship between claimant\u2019s compensable injury and the strep infection, and as reflecting the required weighing of contributing causes. The evidence permits those inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">That leaves SAIF\u2019s primary argument \u2014 that claimant\u2019s foot swelling was a mere \u201cpredisposition\u201d or \u201csusceptibility\u201d and \u201clegally excluded from consideration\u201d as a cause of claimant\u2019s infection-related conditions. In support of its conclusion, SAIF relies on <em>Murdoch v. SAIF, </em>223 Or App 144, 149-50, 194 P3d 854 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 361 (2009), in which we held that the claimant\u2019s diabetes was a \u201cmere susceptibility,\u201d which the board could not consider in weighing the causes of an infection, and ultimate toe amputation, that the claimant suffered after developing a blister from his work boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">To explain why <em>Murdoch\u2019s </em>\u201csusceptibility\u201d distinction has no bearing on the analysis here, we begin by explaining the distinct statutory frameworks governing compensability in the two cases. The issue in <em>Murdoch </em>was whether the claimant\u2019s infection was a compensable occupational disease under ORS 656.802(2). The statute governing proof of a compensable occupational disease specifically provides: \u201cPreexisting conditions shall be deemed causes in determining major contributing cause under this section.\u201d ORS 656.802(2)(e). In <em>Murdoch, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201c[I]n order to receive workers\u2019 compensation for medical treatment of a disease, a worker \u2018must prove that employment conditions were the major contributing cause\u2019 of the need for that treatment. ORS 656.802(2)(a). Thus, if the major contributing cause is a preexisting condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>that is not related to </em>employment, the treatment is not compensable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">223 Or App at 146 (emphasis added). Thus, our decision in <em>Murdoch </em>focused on ORS 656.005(24), which supplies the definition of a \u201cpreexisting condition,\u201d and specifically paragraph (c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cFor the purposes of industrial injury claims, a condition does not contribute to disability or need for treatment if the condition merely renders the worker more susceptible to the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d definition has no bearing on this case, however, because the issue here is whether claimant\u2019s infection and amputation are compensable \u201cconsequential conditions.\u201d That determination is governed by ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201cNo injury or disease is compensable as a consequence of a compensable injury unless the compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the consequential condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Thus, in determining whether claimant\u2019s infection-related conditions were a compensable \u201cconsequential condition,\u201d the board was required to consider the contribution from claimant\u2019s \u201ccompensable injury,\u201d which \u2014 as the board found\u2014 included soft tissue swelling. We reject SAIF\u2019s suggestion that the board could evaluate the contribution of claimant\u2019s compensable injury without considering the contribution of a part of that injury. We agree with the board\u2019s succinct response to SAIF\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201c[T]he conclusion that a compensable injury is not a \u2018cause\u2019 because it \u2018render [s] the worker more susceptible\u2019 to the consequential condition is not consistent with the statutory framework, which requires the compensable injury to be weighed in determining the major contributing cause of the consequential condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The board\u2019s finding that swelling \u2014 a part of the compensable injury \u2014 was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s infection-related conditions means the conditions are compensable as a consequence of his compensable injury. ORS 656.005 (7)(a)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
