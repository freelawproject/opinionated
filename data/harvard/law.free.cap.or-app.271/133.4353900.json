Kine, </em>268 Or App 623, 342 P3d 1075 (2015). For the reasons that follow, we allow the petition for reconsideration, withdraw our prior disposition, modify our prior opinion in the manner described and adhere to it as modified, and substitute a new disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In <em>Vukanovich, </em>the jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor on claims for breach of contract and fraud, but the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) to defendants on those claims. The trial court had, alternatively, ruled that the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and equitable estoppel barred plaintiff from recovering on his claims. We affirmed in part and reversed in part. Specifically, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of JNOV to defendants on plaintiffs fraud claim, but reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of JNOV to defendants on plaintiffs breach-of-contract claim. We held further that the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiffs recovery was barred by the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and equitable estoppel, concluding that the conduct of plaintiff on which the trial court predicated its ruling \u2014 all of which had occurred after defendants had terminated the contract \u2014 was insufficient as a matter of law to establish an unclean hands or equitable estoppel defense against plaintiff. Based on those determinations, we affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding to the trial court with directions to reinstate the verdict on the breach-of-contract claim and enter judgment in favor of plaintiff on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In their petition for reconsideration, defendants argue, among other things,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that we procedurally erred by remanding with directions to the trial court to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff on the breach-of-contract claim. In defendants\u2019 view, the correct course of action was to remand to the trial court for further proceedings in connection with defendants\u2019 equitable defenses. Defendants point out that the record contains evidence of other conduct by plaintiff \u2014 other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>than the conduct that we determined was insufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling and on which the court did not rely in making its earlier determination \u2014 that would permit the court to find in their favor on the equitable defenses. In particular, defendants point to evidence that could support a finding that plaintiff engaged in inequitable conduct in connection with the formation of, and during the life of, the contract. Defendants argue that we should remand to the trial court to evaluate in the first instance whether they can prevail on their equitable defenses based on that other evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, plaintiff argues that we have already decided that issue. In addition, plaintiff points out that the trial court would necessarily have to make factual findings that conflict with the jury\u2019s verdict in order to rule in defendants\u2019 favor on the equitable defenses based on evidence of alleged inequitable conduct by plaintiff in connection with the formation of, and during the life of, the contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We agree with defendants that the proper procedural course is to remand to the trial court to determine whether to credit the other evidence of the alleged inequitable conduct by plaintiff prior to the termination of the parties\u2019 contract and to determine, based on the court\u2019s factual findings, whether that inequitable conduct \u2014 if the court finds that it occurred \u2014 bars plaintiffs recovery on the breach-of-contract claim under the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and estoppel. <em>See Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, </em>356 Or 654, 671-74, 342 P3d 70 (2015) (remanding to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>court to make pertinent factual finding and apply correct legal standard in the first instance, where court had not made pertinent factual finding in the light of prior legal error, but evidence in the record did not compel the facts to be found one particular way). The record indicates that the parties agreed that the equitable defenses would be tried to the court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it is for the trial court, not us, to determine in the first instance whether the remaining alleged inequitable conduct on which defendants predicate their defenses occurred, now that we have determined that the conduct that the court <em>did </em>find to have occurred was insufficient to support its ruling on the equitable defenses. Although plaintiff is correct that a ruling in defendants\u2019 favor on the equitable defenses based on plaintiffs conduct in connection with the formation and performance of the contract necessarily would require the trial court to find the facts differently from the jury, plaintiff does not present any developed argument as to why the trial court, sitting in equity, would be <em>precluded </em>from finding the facts differently from the jury, and the extent to which a jury\u2019s findings on a legal claim bind a trial court in its resolution of an equitable issue need not be addressed unless and until the trial court makes factual findings that conflict with the jury\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Accordingly, we modify our disposition as follows. The judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>breach-of-contract claim; we otherwise affirm. Accordingly, our new disposition is as follows: \u201cJudgment on plaintiffs breach-of-contract claim reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; judgment on plaintiffs breach-of-contract claim reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> We reject without discussion all of defendants\u2019 arguments on reconsideration except for the argument that we expressly address herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-5\"> In our opinion, we rejected defendants\u2019 argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the equitable defenses could be sustained based on that evidence because \u201c[t]he trial court made explicit on the record that it was relying on plaintiffs post-termination conduct to conclude that [the equitable defenses] barred plaintiffs recovery,\u201d and we were \u201cthus unable to infer that the court also found that plaintiff had engaged in the alleged pretermination inequitable conduct, which plaintiff disputed.\u201d <em>Vukanovich, </em>268 Or App at 641.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> The jury answered the following questions in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cDo you find that [defendant Larry Kine was induced into entering a contract with [plaintiff] through [pllaintiffs knowing or reckless misrepresentations or concealment of material facts known to [p]laintiff at the time promises were exchanged to enter into the contract?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cDo you find that [plaintiff] breached the contract by failing to perform or comply with material terms or conditions of the contract?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\u201cDo you find that [plaintiff] breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in performing the contract?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-5\"> Although the record does not contain an express stipulation by the parties that the equitable defenses would be tried to the court, the \u201cNeutral Statement of Case\u201d filed by plaintiff indicates that some issues would be determined by the judge and that some issues would be determined by the jury. Although the statement does not identify what issues would be determined by the court, it does not include the equitable defenses among the issues to be decided by the jury. Further, when defendants reminded the court at the end of trial that it still needed to decide the equitable defenses, plaintiff did not object or otherwise indicate that plaintiff contemplated that the equitable defenses would be tried to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> As we observed in our original opinion, plaintiff did not preserve his argument on appeal that the trial court erred in concluding that defendants could raise equitable defenses to plaintiffs breach-of-contract claim. <em>Vukanovich, </em>268 Or App at 639 n 10. We observe further that the law is unsettled as to whether and when a court sitting in equity is required to give weight to a jury\u2019s findings on a legal claim in the same case. <em>See generally </em>Steve Berman, <em>Avoiding Pyrrhic Victories, Risks in Joining Legal and Equitable Claims in Contract Cases, </em>Or St Bar Litig J, Spring 2015, at 11-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
