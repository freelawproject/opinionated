That statute provides that a \u201clocal government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employees of the local government shall, insofar as and to the extent possible, make the coverage available for any retired employee of the local government.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that the city violated ORS 243.303(2) when it made certain health insurance coverage available to city employees while they were working, but failed to make that coverage available to plaintiff and members of a certified class of current employees when they retired. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and the trial court granted him that relief after concluding, on plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, that the city had violated ORS 243.303(2). The city appealed, challenging that ruling along with several others. We concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to plaintiff on his claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under ORS 243.303(2), because \u201cthe legal standard that the trial court applied conflicts with the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>347 Or 564, 227 P3d 683 (2010) <em>[Doyle I], </em>a decision that issued after the trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling.\u201d <em>Bova v. City of Medford, </em>262 Or App 29, 31-32, 324 P3d 492 (2014) <em>(Bova I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Plaintiff petitioned for review. While his petition was pending, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>356 Or 336, 337 P3d 797 (2014) <em>(Doyle II), </em>a case involving claims for damages brought by retired city workers under ORS 243.303(2) that the trial court considered along with plaintiffs claims in this case. As to the <em>Doyle </em>plaintiffs\u2019 damages claim under ORS 243.303(2), the trial court determined that that statute provided for a private right of action for damages. In <em>Doyle II, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that there is no tort-based private right of action for a local government\u2019s violation of ORS 243.303(2), but held that the plaintiffs in that case did \u201chave a claim for a determination of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under the statute that is actionable under the Declaratory Judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Act\u201d and could seek \u201csupplemental relief\u2019 under the act for \u201cany cognizable damages.\u201d 356 Or at 372, 383. Shortly after issuing its decision in <em>Doyle II, </em>the Supreme Court allowed review in this case, vacated our decision, and remanded \u201cfor determination of whether plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the city violated ORS 243.303 as determined under ORS Chapter 28.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Bova v. City of Medford, </em>356 Or 516, 340 P3d 47 (2014) <em>(Bova II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In light of the focused nature of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on remand, we need not review in detail the tortured procedural history surrounding the <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Bova </em>litigation, which is now the subject of at least a dozen state and federal appellate court opinions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, consistent with the court\u2019s instructions, we consider plaintiffs ORS 243.303(2) claim in light of the Declaratory Judgments Act (the Act), ORS chapter 28. In his complaint, plaintiff sought a \u201c[declaratory judgment and equitable relief, including an injunction prohibiting [the city] from continuing [its] unlawful conduct.\u201d In <em>Bova I, </em>262 Or App at 36 n 4, we noted that \u201cplaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on the application of ORS 243.303(2) under the [Act].\u201d As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Doyle II, </em>356 Or at 383, the Act provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>plaintiff, a now-retired employee of the city, with a claim for a determination of rights and duties under ORS 243.303(2). The Act also gives the trial court the power to order \u201c[f]urther relief,\u201d which may include an injunction where appropriate. <em>See </em>ORS 28.080 (\u201cFurther relief based on a declaratory judgment may be granted whenever necessary or proper.\u201d); <em>Ken Leahy Construction, Inc. v. Cascade General, Inc., </em>329 Or 566, 575, 994 P2d 112 (1999) (explaining that \u201c[flurther relief\u2019 available under ORS 28.080 includes an injunction); <em>see also Swett v. Bradbury, </em>335 Or 378, 389, 67 P3d 391 (2003) (noting that, in a proceeding under the Act, \u201ca court has the power to grant equitable remedies,\u201d including an injunction, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\">But relief under the Act depends on whether plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the city violated ORS 243.303(2). In this case, when it considered plaintiffs summary judgment motion, the trial court understood ORS 243.303(2) to preclude the city from relying \u201con the cost of insurance coverage as indicating impossibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court viewed the determinative question under the statute as whether the record showed \u201cthat other insurance which provides bridge coverage for retirees indisputably is and has been available.\u201d Because plaintiff had \u201csolicited evidence from the appropriate City representative that it was, indeed, possible for the City to contract for, or otherwise provide, health benefit insurance for both current employees and retired employees,\u201d the trial court granted plaintiffs summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We adhere to our conclusion in <em>Bova I </em>that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs motion. As we explained, \u201c[t]he trial court ruled that plaintiff could establish that the city violated ORS 243.303(2) by showing that \u2018insurance which provides bridge coverage for retirees indisputably is and has been available,\u2019 and that, to create a genuine issue of material fact, the city had the burden to show that such coverage was not available.\u201d 262 Or App at 42. In <em>Doyle I, </em>however, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that, \u201cif there are providers available who are willing to provide [health insurance] coverage that includes retirees, the city must provide that coverage, regardless of cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>or other circumstances.\u201d 347 Or at 570 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court reasoned that the statute was \u201cnot intended to be unduly burdensome,\u201d and a local government could present evidence of \u201cfactual circumstances that excuse\u201d its obligation under ORS 243.303(2). <em>Id. </em>at 576, 579. The court reiterated that view of ORS 243.303(2) in <em>Doyle II, </em>explaining that it had earlier rejected the plaintiffs view that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201ca local government could be relieved of its obligation only if providing health insurance to retirees was factually impossible, because the legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u2018insofar as\u2019 and \u2018to the extent possible\u2019 emphasize [d] the concept of degree or amount, indicating that the legislature did not view the health insurance coverage obligation as one that necessarily was either \u2018possible\u2019 or \u2018not possible\u2019 \u2018but rather as a flexible obligation that might be possible only to some degree or to some extent.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><em>Doyle II, </em>356 Or at 365 (quoting <em>Doyle I, </em>347 Or at 574).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Because the trial court\u2019s understanding of ORS 243.303(2) conflicts with the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle I </em>and <em>Doyle II, </em>we reverse and remand for the trial court to reconsider plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the question of whether the city violated ORS 243.303(2). On remand, the trial court should determine whether there are any disputed issues of material fact and, if not, the trial court should determine whether making healthcare insurance available to its retirees would be unduly burdensome to the city because of cost or other circumstances. If the court determines that the city has violated the statute, the court will have the opportunity to consider whether plaintiff is also entitled to the injunction he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In A144254, limited judgment reversed and remanded. In A146597, appeal dismissed. In A147477, contempt judgment affirmed; general judgment on claim for age discrimination under ORS 659A.030 reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> As with this case, the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle II </em>remanded the case to this court to decide \u201cwhether plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the city violated ORS 243.303 as evaluated under ORS Chapter 28.\u201d 356 Or at 383. On remand from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doyle II, </em>we concluded that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 243.303(2) was incorrect under <em>Doyle I, </em>and we therefore reversed and remanded for the trial court to reconsider the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the question of whether the city violated ORS 243.303(2). <em>See Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>271 Or App 458, 463, 351 P3d 768 (2015). As explained herein, we reach the same result here with respect to plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his ORS 243.303(2) claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> We also need not revisit our disposition of the other assignments of error considered in <em>Bova I. </em>We adhere to (1) our conclusion that the city failed to preserve its argument that the trial court erred in ruling in plaintiff\u2019s favor on the city\u2019s summary judgment motions because the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 preempted ORS 243.303 and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim under that statute, <em>Bova I, </em>262 Or App at 48-49; (2) our rejection without discussion of the city\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in finding it in contempt of the trial court\u2019s orders, <em>id. </em>at 49; and (3) our dismissal of the city\u2019s appeal from a supplemental judgment for attorney fees related to the ORS 243.303(2) claim because the city had appealed from an invalid and unappealable judgment \u2014 a supplemental judgment arising from a limited judgment that was entered before the general judgment, <em>id. </em>We also adhere to our conclusion that the trial court erred in allowing plaintiffs age discrimination claim to proceed to trial on the unpleaded theory of disparate impact. <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
