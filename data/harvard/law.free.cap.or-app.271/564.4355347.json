We conclude that existing Supreme Court case law controls our disposition of both challenges and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The trial court granted a dismissal under ORCP 21 A(9), which is proper if \u201cthe pleading shows that the action has not been commenced within the time limited by statute.\u201d On review of the dismissal, \u201cwe must liberally construe the pleadings and draw all inferences in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Simonsen v. Ford Motor Co., </em>196 Or App 460, 473, 102 P3d 710 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 681 (2005) (citation omitted). According to the operative pleading \u2014 the third amended complaint \u2014 decedent died September 29, 2008, as a consequence of \u201cAcute Myelogenous Leukemia\u201d (AML) caused by long-term exposure to unreasonably dangerous benzene-containing products. One of those products was \u201cQuick Shot,\u201d a product manufactured by defendant, purchased by decedent\u2019s employer in 1995, and used by decedent approximately once a month from the mid-1990s to the time he was diagnosed with AML. Plaintiff filed this wrongful death action in 2011, which alleges that defendant and others are liable for decedent\u2019s death under theories of both negligence and strict product liability. The trial court ruled that the claims against defendant were barred by ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008) and entered a limited judgment of dismissal, from which plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">As pertinent to this appeal, ORS 30.905 (2008) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201c(3) * * * a product liability civil action[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] for death must be commenced not later than the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c(b) Ten years after the date on which the product was first purchased for use or consumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Plaintiff does not dispute that her claim is facially barred by ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008), but argues that the limitation violates Article I, section 10, and Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the statute of repose found in ORS 30.905 against challenges under the same constitutional provisions. <em>Sealey v. Hicks, </em>309 Or 387, 396, 788 P2d 435 (1990), <em>overruled in part by Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 123, 23 P3d 333 (2001). Plaintiff argues, however, that subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court now require a different answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">A. <em>Article I, Section 10</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The remedy clause of Article I, section 10, provides that \u201cevery man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\u201d Because a cause of action does not accrue until the \u201cplaintiff has suffered an actual loss[,]\u201d <em>see Lowe v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>344 Or 403, 410, 183 P3d 181 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), a statute of ultimate repose arguably precludes a \u201cremedy by due course of law\u201d for wrongfully caused harm that occurs too long after the tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Plaintiff recognizes that <em>Sealey </em>rejected a similar remedy-clause challenge to ORS 30.905 based on reasoning that \u201c[t]he legislature has the authority to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>what constitutes a legally cognizable injury.\u201d 309 Or at 394-95. In addition, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis v. Whiting Corporation, </em>66 Or App 541, 543, 674 P2d 1194, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 82 (1984), which predated <em>Sealey, </em>applied the same interpretation of Article I, Section 10, to also reject a remedy-clause challenge to ORS 30.905. Plaintiff points out, however, that the Supreme Court has since disavowed Sealey\u2019s interpretation of the remedy clause. Plaintiff urges us to expressly disavow <em>Davis, </em>revisit the question, and hold that ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008) violates the remedy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">As an initial matter, we agree with plaintiff that <em>Sealey </em>and <em>Davis </em>are no longer controlling precedent with respect to whether ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008) violates the remedy clause. In <em>Smothers, </em>the Supreme Court expressly \u201cdisavowed] \u201d the line of cases \u2014 including <em>Sealey </em>\u2014 in which it had interpreted the remedy clause as allowing the legislature to \u201cabolish or alter absolute rights respecting person, property, or reputation that existed when the Oregon Constitution was drafted ***.\" 332 Or at 119. The court in <em>Smothers </em>announced that the constitutionality of a statute under the remedy clause depends, instead, on whether the common law of Oregon when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857 recognized a cause of action for the alleged injury and, if so, whether the legislature has \u201cabolished the common-law cause of action\u201d without providing \u201ca constitutionally adequate substitute remedy for the common-law cause of action for that injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. <em>Smothers </em>effectively overruled the remedy clause holding of <em>Davis, </em>which relied on the same \u201cdisavowed\u201d interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">That does not mean, however, that this court is now free to declare that ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008) violates the remedy clause. The issue under the remedy clause is whether plaintiffs particular alleged injury is one for which the common law recognized a cause of action. <em>See Juarez v. Windsor Rock Products, Inc., </em>341 Or 160, 165, 144 P3d 211 (2006) (\u201cIn addressing the first question in the <em>Smothers </em>analysis, our initial task is to identify the relevant circumstances of the alleged injury.\u201d). The alleged injury here is economic loss to decedent\u2019s estate, a loss of \u201csociety and companionship\u201d to decedent\u2019s daughters, and other noneconomic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>damages, resulting from the wrongful death of plaintiffs decedent. Defendant points out that the Supreme Court has repeatedly described actions for wrongful death as not among those recognized by the common law in 1857. <em>See, e.g., Storm v. McClung, </em>334 Or 210, 222 n 4, 47 P3d 476 (2002) (stating proposition that wrongful death is an entirely statutory cause of action and has no basis in the common law); <em>Kilminster v. Day Management Corp., </em>323 Or 618, 627, 919 P2d 474 (1996) (same). Thus, under the <em>Smothers </em>framework, wrongful death actions would not be protected by the remedy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In the past decade, the Supreme Court has considered the historical accuracy of the premise that wrongful death actions have no basis in the common law \u2014 and no protection under the remedy clause \u2014 but has not disavowed its prior opinions. In <em>Juarez, </em>after describing the plaintiffs evidence of common-law actions for wrongful death, the court saw no need to reconsider its prior holdings, because the wrongful death injury claimed by the plaintiffs, who did not allege \u201cthat they were dependent on decedent for his services or financial assistance, that decedent had any legal obligation to provide such support, or that they had any other legal interest in his income [,]\u201d was not an injury to their \u201cperson, property, or reputation,\u201d that would have been recognized by the common law in 1857. 341 Or at 169, 173. In <em>Hughes v. PeaceHealth, </em>344 Or 142, 152, 178 P3d 225 (2008), the court again undertook a detailed reanalysis of the historical evidence for common-law wrongful death actions and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cEven if we were to accept the notion that there was some general movement in the common law of the early nineteenth century that might, had it been left alone, eventually have grown into a common-law recognition of a wrongful death action, there is no basis for us further to conclude that the common law would have recognized the particular cause of action that plaintiff now asserts \u2014 an action seeking damages for <em>all </em>injuries occasioned by the wrongful death of a family member, including mental suffering and loss of society and care, without limitation of any kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">(Emphasis in original.) Although, as in <em>Juarez, </em>the <em>Hughes </em>decision may leave open the possibility of some future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>wrongful death plaintiff alleging a protected injury, it also leaves intact the court\u2019s prior broad-brush statements that wrongful death actions were not recognized by the common law in 1857. The decisions of the Supreme Court leave no room for this court to decide that plaintiff has alleged an injury to \u201cperson, property, or reputation\u201d for which the common law recognized a cause of action in 1857.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Indeed, plaintiff does not specifically ask us to hold that her action for wrongful death would have been recognized by the common law in 1857. Instead, plaintiff argues that, in <em>Foster v. Miramontes, </em>352 Or 401, 425, 287 P3d 1045 (2012), the Supreme Court \u201cimplicitly overruled\u201d \u2014 or at least invited challenges <em>to </em>\u2014 Smothers\u2019s conclusion that the remedy clause protects only causes of action that existed at common law in 1857. <em>Foster </em>holds that there is a right to jury trial in a claim for damages based on the violation of a stalking protective order because the claim is of \u201clike nature\u201d to others that existed in 1857. 352 Or at 413, 426. We disagree with plaintiffs suggestion that the \u201cforward-looking approach\u201d implicitly overrules <em>Smothers. </em>First, <em>Foster </em>is not a remedy clause case and does not even mention <em>Smothers. </em>Moreover, the \u201cforward-looking approach\u201d to Article I, section 17, is not new; it reflects the court\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the right to jury trial as guaranteed \u201cnot only in those cases in which the right was customary at the time the constitution was adopted\u201d but also in \u201ccases of like nature as they may hereafter arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Plaintiff also cites Justice Landau\u2019s concurrence in <em>Klutschkowski v. PeaceHealth, </em>354 Or 150, 178, 311 P3d 461 (2013), which emphasizes the ways in which the \u201chyperoriginalism\u201d required by a focus on common-law rights that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>vested in 1857 is \u201cuntenable.\u201d Plaintiff may be correct that Justice Landau\u2019s concurring opinion is an \u201cinvitation\u201d to litigants to challenge the reasoning of <em>Smothers </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>But it is not an \u201cinvitation\u201d to this court to ignore the controlling Supreme Court precedent. <em>See State v. Turner, </em>235 Or App 462, 466, 234 P3d 993 (2010) (\u201c[W]e remain bound by Supreme Court precedent until such time as that court reconsiders and disavows it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">B. <em>Article I, Section 17</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Article I, section 17, provides, \u201cIn all civil cases the right of Trial by Jury shall remain inviolate.\u201d As plaintiff recognizes, <em>Sealey </em>also presents an obstacle to her challenge to the statute of repose under Article I, section 17. The Supreme Court held in <em>Sealey </em>that ORS 30.905 does not violate Article I, section 17, because \u201cSection 17 is designed to guarantee a jury trial when a right to a trial exists in a civil action. It is not an independent guarantee of the existence of a cognizable claim.\u201d 309 Or at 396. Unlike the remedy clause analysis employed in <em>Sealey, </em>the decision\u2019s jury trial analysis has not been disavowed. <em>See, e.g., Jensen v. Whitlow, </em>334 Or 412, 422, 51 P3d 599 (2002) (relying on the Article I, section 17, holding of <em>Sealey). </em>Indeed subsequent cases have repeatedly reiterated the principle that \u201cArticle I, section 17, is not a source of law that creates or retains a substantive claim or a theory of recovery in favor of any party.\u2019\u201d <em>See, e.g., Hughes, </em>344 Or at 155 (quoting <em>Jensen, </em>334 Or at 422, and citing other cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">As plaintiff points out, the Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cArticle I, section 17, guarantees a jury trial in civil actions for which the common law provided a jury trial when the Oregon Constitution was adopted in 1857 and in cases of like nature.\u201d <em>Lakin v. Senco Products, Inc., </em>329 Or 62, 82, 987 P2d 463 (1999). That extension to \u201ccases of like nature,\u201d however, does not aid plaintiffs argument. The question here is not whether plaintiff would have a right to a jury trial if the claims against defendant were cognizable; the question is whether Article I, section 17, guarantees the existence of a cognizable claim against defendant. Sealey's answer is \u201cno,\u201d and this court is bound by it. 309 Or at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The trial court did not err in dismissing the claims against defendant pursuant to ORS 30.905(3)(b) (2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Affirmed on appeal; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> The 2009 amendments to ORS 30.905 \u2014 which, among other changes, extend the ultimate repose period for products manufactured in or imported into states with longer periods of repose \u2014 apply only to claims arising after January 1, 2010. Or Laws 2009, ch 485, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-11\"> There is no dispute that both the negligence and strict liability claims are governed by this limitation because they allege death caused by a defective product. <em>See Kambury v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>185 Or App 635, 639, 60 P3d 1103 (2003) (a product liability civil action \u201cembraces all theories a plaintiff can claim in an action based on a product defect,\u201d including both negligence and strict liability claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\"> Plaintiff\u2019s remedy clause argument would also require us to disavow \u2014 or somehow distinguish \u2014 our <em>post-Smothers </em>decision in <em>Barke v. Maeyens, </em>176 Or App 471, 481, 31 P3d 1133 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 655 (2002). <em>Barke </em>upheld the statute of ultimate repose for medical negligence actions against a remedy clause challenge based on our determination that statutes of limitation in existence in 1857 effectively operated as ultimate repose limitations on common law actions: \u201cIn short, plaintiff\u2019s action would have been time barred under the law as it existed at the time that Article I, section 10 was enacted, just as it is barred under current law.\u201d 176 Or App at 482-83. Plaintiff does not ask us to disavow <em>Barke </em>or suggest a basis on which we would distinguish it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> Defendant also moved for summary judgment on the same statutory basis, and the trial court denied that motion as \u201cmoot.\u201d Defendant challenges the mootness ruling through a cross-appeal \u201cin an abundance of caution.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s judgment was \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d \u2014 while a grant of summary judgment would have resulted in dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \u2014 defendant\u2019s challenge is not necessarily a miscast cross-assignment. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.57(2)(a) (cross-assignment of error is appropriate if the respondent\u2019s challenge \u201cdoes not seek to reverse or modify the judgment on appeal\u201d). Nevertheless, given the identity of issues, our decision to affirm the judgment of dismissal fully disposes of plaintiffs claims against defendant and obviates the need to decide what is essentially a conditional cross-appeal. <em>See Patrick v. Otteman, </em>158 Or App 175, 188, 974 P2d 217, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 594 (1999) (dismissing conditional cross-appeal as \u201cmoot\u201d because the affirmance on the appeal obviated any need to consider it).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
