J.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-3\">Petitioner appeals from a judgment denying her petition for post-conviction relief. She first assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of her claim alleging that the criminal trial court judge coerced her into waiving her right to a jury trial, and additionally argues that the judgment fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), as construed in <em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 676, 227 P3d 714 (2010). We reverse and remand based on the deficiencies in the judgment, and do not reach petitioner\u2019s first assignment given those deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">We begin with the judgment. ORS 138.640(1) requires that a judgment granting or denying post-conviction relief \u201cmust clearly state the grounds on which the cause was determined, and whether a state or federal question was presented and decided.\u201d In order to comply with the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201ca judgment denying claims for post-conviction relief must, at a minimum: (1) identify the claims for relief that the court considered and make separate rulings on each claim; (2) declare, with regard to each claim, whether the denial is based on a petitioner\u2019s failure to utilize or follow available state procedures or a failure to establish the merits of the claim; and (3) make the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"><em>Datt, </em>347 Or at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The judgment here fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1) because it fails the second and third prongs of <em>Datt. </em>First, the judgment fails to meet the third prong in that it does not clearly state the legal bases for the court\u2019s denial of each claim for relief, but instead focuses on petitioner\u2019s first claim, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel based on her trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate mitigation evidence. Although the judgment states that \u201call questions were presented and decided,\u201d it fails to address at all petitioner\u2019s second claim for relief, that her confession was coerced and that she was denied the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The judgment also fails to meet the second and third <em>Datt </em>prongs as to petitioner\u2019s third claim for relief (the subject of her first appellate assignment of error), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>alleged that the criminal trial judge coerced petitioner to agree to waive her right to a jury trial. The only possible reference to that claim in the judgment is the statement, \u201cAttorney explained court vs. jury trial.\u201d The judgment thus fails to explain \u201cwhether the denial [of that claim] is based on * * * petitioner\u2019s failure to utilize or follow available state procedures or a failure to establish the merits of the claim ***,\u201d and also fails to \u201cmake the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d <em>Datt, </em>347 Or at 685. That petitioner\u2019s attorney explained the difference between a court trial and a jury trial, by itself, does not provide a legal basis for denying relief if the trial judge was indeed coercive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Because the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment in this case fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), we reverse and remand for the court to enter a judgment in compliance with the statute. <em>See Walker v. State of Oregon, </em>256 Or App 697, 700, 302 P3d 469 (2013) (when a judgment fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), as elucidated in <em>Datt, </em>the judgment is \u201cfatally deficient in that regard\u201d and \u201cwe must reverse and remand for the court to enter a judgment that includes findings complying with ORS 138.640(1)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Because of the judgment\u2019s deficiencies, we do not address the merits of petitioner\u2019s first assignment, which challenges the denial of her third claim for post-conviction relief. On remand, the post-conviction court will have an opportunity to address whether it disbelieved petitioner\u2019s deposition testimony about the trial judge\u2019s statements, which she contends is the only evidence presented to the post-conviction court but which is not addressed in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
