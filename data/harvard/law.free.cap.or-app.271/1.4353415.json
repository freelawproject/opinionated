We write only to address defendant\u2019s assertions that the trial court committed reversible \u201cplain error\u201d by (1) admitting \u201cvouching\u201d testimony by a witness, Muggia, relating to victim RW\u2019s credibility with respect to Count 4 (first-degree unlawful sexual penetration) and (2) failing to instruct the jury as to the requisite mental state for forcible compulsion, a material element of first-degree sodomy and attempted first-degree sodomy, as charged in Counts 1 and 5. As explained below, the asserted errors either do not qualify as \u201cplain error,\u201d see <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990), or we decline to exercise our discretion to correct them, see <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">As pertinent to our review, defendant was charged with, and convicted of, committing sex offenses against a girl and two women who are directly, or collaterally, related to his wife: (1) RW, his step-granddaughter; (2) E, an adult cousin of RW\u2019s; and (3) RB, his adult step-daughter and RW\u2019s mother. As explained more fully below, the only charge relating to RW was Count 4 (first-degree unlawful sexual penetration). Counts 1 (first-degree sodomy) and 5 (attempted first-degree sodomy) related to E and RB, respectively. We separately relate the predicate circumstances of those charges below in our consideration of the asserted plain error as to each. For narrative and analytical coherence, we begin with the alleged impermissible vouching for RW\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">1. <em>Count 4: Admissibility of Muggia\u2019s \u201cVouching\u201d Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">At the time of the charged conduct, sometime during the summer of 2006, RW was 10 years old. RW and her older <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>sister, S, were living with defendant and his wife, their maternal grandmother. According to RW, she awoke one morning to find defendant touching her genital area. That incident was not reported until May 18, 2007, when S disclosed it to a school counselor. That same day, S repeated the allegations to Child Protective Services child abuse investigator Valentina Muggia. Muggia, in turn, interviewed RW, who provided further details about the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">The state charged defendant with first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.411. Both RW and Muggia testified at trial. On direct examination, Muggia recounted RW\u2019s statements and demeanor during the May 18, 2007, interview. Then, after referring to Muggia\u2019s extensive training and experience interviewing child victims, the prosecutor and Muggia had the following exchange about that interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u00abQ. * * * [W]hat were the significant observations that you made in determining that there \u2014 there is a need for help here or intervention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">\u201cA. Well, one is the \u2014 the specific amount of details that [RW] was able to disclose during the interviews. And then also her \u2014 her demeanor in how much this interview!] was affecting it and \u2014 and her anger that she had in expressing her feelings. <em>Those were all collectively what led me to believe that indeed she had been </em>molested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The italicized statement is the basis of defendant\u2019s appellate assertion that Muggia impermissibly vouched for RW\u2019s credibility. Defense counsel did not object to, or move to strike, that statement. Rather, on cross-examination, defense counsel revisited Muggia\u2019s opinions as to RW\u2019s believability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. And part of your investigation, is it to decide whether what\u2019s being disclosed is true or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I \u2014 I\u2014part of my investigation is to determine whether I have enough evidence to say that child abuse has occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. And part of that evidence is to determine whether the \u2014 whether the child is telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cA. I suppose so, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. Well, you have to, I mean \u2014 okay. So you don\u2019t care so much about whether they\u2019re telling the truth if there\u2019s evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I guess it\u2019s in my experience if I founded the cases is because the child has been telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. So is it \u2014 have you investigated cases when child \u2014 children were not telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">\u201cA. I \u2014 believe it or not, in my experience I only had two cases where the child was not talking \u2014 not saying the truth, and generally was because has been coached by a parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. Or another person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">\u201cA. Correct. So over 600-plus cases, I only had two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">\u201cQ. So during your investigation process do you take precautions to make sure a child hasn\u2019t been coached?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-11\">\u201cA. Well, that\u2019s part of the training that we received, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. So in this investigation did you take any steps to make sure no one was coaching her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-13\">\u201cA. Based on my experience, the way that the child disclosed, the amount of detail, and how she talked to me, she had not been coached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-14\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now, you said when you first talked to her she wanted to know what her sister had said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-15\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-16\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t that throw up a flag for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-17\">A. No, not at all. A lot of children, you know, do that, especially if they\u2019ve been talked to \u2014 you know, they talk to a sibling about abuse that has happened. Especially if it\u2019s an older sibling, you know, they want to know that they are okay. They want to know that their sibling is okay. And so that\u2019s actually very common.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-18\">\u201cQ. Okay. So \u2014 but\u2014so you don\u2019t think that\u2019s a flag at all, that one person \u2014 one child is trying to make sure they\u2019re saying the same story as another child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-19\">A. No. Not in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay. Do you think that\u2019s a mistake to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">\u201cA. I \u2014 I don\u2019t. I guess from my experience is that when a child has been coached, they\u2019re not able to provide the details. They are very repetitive with the same answer. And so you can ask a different question, and the answer will be just the same. They\u2019re very limited in what they can offer. And this was not the case for [RW].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Thus, defense counsel\u2019s questions not only invited Muggia to reiterate her previously expressed opinion about RW\u2014 but also called, repeatedly, for her to further develop and to defend that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">During closing arguments, neither party mentioned Muggia\u2019s assessment of RW\u2019s believability. The state, in referring to Muggia\u2019s testimony, focused on the content of the statements that RW made to Muggia but did not comment on Muggia\u2019s assessment of the truthfulness of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>exclude or strike Muggia\u2019s statement that, based, in part, on RW\u2019s statements, Muggia \u201cbelieve [ed] that indeed she had been molested.\u201d Defendant acknowledges that he failed to raise that issue before the trial court, but argues that the admission of that statement constitutes an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), and that we should exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Generally, we will not consider an unpreserved issue on appeal. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000). We may, however, review an unpreserved assignment of error as one \u201capparent on the record\u201d if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the legal point is \u201cobvious\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record,\u201d such that \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">If those requirements are satisfied, we must then decide whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error, based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 (even if an error is plain, the appellate court \u201cmust exercise its discretion to consider or not to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>error, and if the court chooses to consider the error, the court must articulate its reasons for doing so\u201d). Factors bearing on that inquiry include, but are not limited to,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-4\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Under the first and second <em>Brown </em>plain error requisites, the operative question must be legal and its correct resolution must not be reasonably in dispute. In those respects, defendant argues \u2014 and the state concedes \u2014 that the statement italicized above constituted impermissible \u201cvouching\u201d under <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 657 P2d 1215 (1983), <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), and <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010). That line of cases established, and amplified, the rule that \u201cone witness may not give an opinion on whether he or she believes that another witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 357. We agree that Muggia\u2019s statement was an improper comment on another witness\u2019s credibility because, in making it, Muggia necessarily implied that she believed the victim\u2019s statements during the 2007 interview. <em>See id. </em>at 355, 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The state remonstrates, however, that the asserted error is not plain because it does not comport with the third <em>Brown </em>requisite \u2014 that is, that it is not \u201capparent on the face of the record\u201d because we must \u201cchoose between competing inferences\u201d to reach it. According to the state\u2019s theory, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Muggia supports a plausible inference that there was a conscious tactical choice not to move to strike Muggia\u2019s comment (as opposed to not making a conscious choice at all, for whatever reason)\u2014 and, therefore, that the error is not \u201capparent\u201d because we must \u201cchoose between competing inferences\u201d to reach it. <em>See State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 511-12, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (rejecting state\u2019s argument that defense counsel made tactical choice as implausible \u201cregardless of whether it is more properly directed to the third plain error prerequisite or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to the proper exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion\u201d); <em>compare State v. Ramirez-Estrada, </em>260 Or App 312, 317 P3d 322 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 317 (2014) (concluding that a trial court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>exclude \u201cvouching\u201d testimony was not plain error because it was plausible that counsel made a strategic decision not to move to strike that testimony), <em>with State v. Pergande, </em>270 Or App 280, 284-85, 348 P3d 245 (2015) (rejecting state\u2019s argument that defense made tactical choice not to object to \u201cvouching\u201d testimony as implausible and speculative).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">We need not resolve that matter. Even assuming, without deciding, that the trial court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>exclude Muggia\u2019s statement constituted plain error, we would not, in any event, exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion primarily because, in these circumstances, any error was harmless. <em>See State v. Matheson, </em>220 Or App 397, 405, 186 P3d 309 (2008) (assuming, without deciding, that the trial court erred in admitting the challenged evidence, the error was rendered harmless by other evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In many cases where credibility is critical to the outcome, even a single \u201cvouching\u201d statement by a witness like Muggia, with years of experience and training in the field of child abuse prevention, can be given considerable weight by the jury. <em>See State v. Bahmatov, </em>244 Or App 50, 55, 260 P3d 592 (2011); <em>see also Berg v. Nooth, </em>258 Or App 286, 299-302, 309 P3d 164 (2013) (in post-conviction case, concluding that trial counsel\u2019s failure to take corrective steps after admission of \u201cvouching\u201d testimony was prejudicial). Here, however, Muggia\u2019s initial statement on direct examination was completely eclipsed by the far more repetitive and detailed exacerbating testimony elicited by defense counsel on cross-examination. <em>See </em>271 Or App at 3-5. For obvious reasons, defendant does not contend that the admission of <em>those </em>responses constituted reversible plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>To the extent that Muggia\u2019s comments may have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, any such effect was far more likely the product of her responses to defense counsel\u2019s questions on cross-examination than of her single, conclusory remark on direct examination. Accordingly, given the likelihood that the asserted plain error was rendered harmless because of the other testimony that was elicited by the defense, we decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion. Defendant\u2019s conviction as to Count 4 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">2. <em>Counts 1 and 5: Jury Instructions on Forcible Compulsion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As noted briefly above, defendant also contends that the trial court committed reversible plain error by failing to instruct the jury as to the requisite mental state for forcible compulsion with respect to Count 1 (first-degree sodomy, involving E) and Count 5 (attempted first-degree sodomy, involving RB). Defendant\u2019s contention, as amplified below, is predicated on <em>State v. Nelson, </em>241 Or App 681, 688, 251 P3d 240 (2011), <em>rev dismissed, </em>354 Or 62 (2012), and on various post <em>-Nelson </em>decisions in which we have held that the failure to give the instruction prescribed in <em>Nelson </em>constituted plain error and exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to remedy that error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Capote, </em>266 Or App 212, 337 P3d 858 (2014); <em>State v. Gray, </em>261 Or App 121, 322 P3d 1094 (2014). The state counters that the asserted instructional error did not satisfy the requisites of plain error with respect to either Count 1 or Count 5 and that, in all events, we should decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, with respect to Count 1, the failure to instruct on the requisite mental state as to forcible compulsion constituted plain error, but we decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct that error. With respect to Count 5, we conclude that, in the circumstances here, involving an extension of <em>Nelson </em>to an <em>attempt </em>crime, the correctness of such an extension is subject to reasonable dispute, precluding plain error review. <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions on Count 1 and Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We begin with the predicate circumstances of Count 1, pertaining to E. E, who was then 25 years old, has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, and uses a wheelchair. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>She alleged that defendant sexually assaulted her on several occasions, including in March 2011, when he came to her residence, ostensibly to help her with household chores, and proceeded to grope her and ask her to give him oral sex. According to E, after she declined, defendant grabbed the back of her head with his hands and forcibly put his penis in her mouth and proceeded to force oral sex for several minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Based on those allegations, the state charged defendant with first-degree sodomy, alleging that he \u201cdid *** knowingly, by forcible compulsion, cause [E] to engage in deviate sexual intercourse with *** defendant (defendant forcing [E] to give him oral sex - [E\u2019s] mouth to defendant\u2019s penis).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">At trial, E testified as described above. She also testified that defendant\u2019s sexual advances were predatory and unwanted, and denied ever having any kind of consensual sexual or romantic relationship or encounter with defendant. By contrast, the defense contended that defendant had engaged in a series of mutually consensual sexual encounters with E, including the March 2011 incident. The defense, asserting that E had lied about the nature of their involvement, maintained that defendant\u2019s conduct was not criminal because E had consented, and denied that defendant had subjected E to forcible compulsion during the March 2011 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">As material to our review, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201cSodomy in the first degree, Count 1. Oregon law provides that a person commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree if the person knowingly engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person and if the victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u201cIn this case, to establish the crime of sodomy in the first degree, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201c3. [Defendant] knowingly had deviate sexual intercourse with [E].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\"><em>\u201c4. </em>[E] was subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The jury found defendant guilty on all charges, including Count 1 as well as two other charges involving E.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">As noted, on appeal, defendant asserts that, given <em>Gray </em>and its progeny, the trial court plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury as to the requisite culpable mental state with respect to the element of forcible compulsion on Count 1. For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that the asserted instructional error was plain error, but we decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Under our holdings in <em>Gray, </em>261 Or App at 130, and <em>Nelson, </em>241 Or App at 688, it is beyond reasonable dispute that, where a completed crime includes the element of forcible compulsion, a trial court errs when it fails to give an instruction that the state must prove that the defendant possessed the alleged culpable mental state in using forcible compulsion to commit that crime. Here, the state charged defendant solely with a \u201cknowing\u201d mental state as to first-degree sodomy and, consequently, was required to prove that defendant acted with that mental state with respect to all material elements of the crime, including the element of forcible compulsion. <em>Nelson, </em>241 Or App at 688-89. The trial court, in turn, was required to instruct the jury that, as to that element, \u201cit must determine that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with a culpable mental state in subjecting the victim to forcible compulsion.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>261 Or App at 130. Here, it is undisputed that the trial court\u2019s instructions as to Count 1 did not satisfy that requisite. We further conclude that the assigned error otherwise meets the requirements of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Defendant contends that we should exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to remedy that error. In that regard, defendant asserts that such correction would further \u201cthe ends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>of justice,\u201d <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 \u2014 emphasizing the significant sentence imposed (100 months) \u2014 and also posits that there does not appear to have been a strategic basis for defense counsel\u2019s failure to alert the trial court to the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">We conclude, however, that an exercise of discretion is not appropriate in this instance, because, in the totality of the circumstances, the failure to give the Nelson.-prescribed instruction was unlikely to have affected the verdict. By way of informative distinction, it is useful to contrast the circumstances in this case \u2014 specifically, the nature of the evidence and of the defense \u2014 with those in <em>Gray, </em>where our exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion rested largely on our conclusion that the absence of a <em>Nelson </em>instruction was not harmless. 261 Or App at 131-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In <em>Gray, </em>the evidence and the defense theory of the case put the defendant\u2019s mental state with respect to forcible compulsion squarely at issue. There, at the time of the rape and first-degree sex abuse, the defendant and the complainant, A, were living together as a married couple. Although each testified to \u201cdrastically different versions of the encounter that precipitated the charges,\u201d 261 Or App at 122, in A\u2019s account, the defendant had put his hands around her neck \u2014 conduct which A acknowledged \u201chad previously been accepted sexual behavior in their relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the jury rendered a \u201cmixed verdict,\u201d convicting the defendant of, <em>inter alia, </em>rape and first-degree sexual abuse, but acquitting on various other charges. <em>Id. </em>at 124-25. On appeal, the defendant asserted that, given <em>Nelson, </em>the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct as to the requisite culpable mental state with respect to the forcible compulsion element of the rape and sexual abuse charges constituted reversible plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 125. We agreed and, in so holding, based our exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion primarily on our agreement with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the instructed error was not harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">\u201c[E]ven if the jury believed A\u2019s versions of the events (which, as defendant points out, is questionable given the mixed verdict), a reasonable juror might have doubted whether defendant knew that he had subjected A to forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>compulsion, particularly given A\u2019s testimony that she had, on previous occasions, allowed defendant to pull her hair and put his hands on her neck. Therefore, the absence of a specific instruction with respect to defendant\u2019s mental state cannot be said to have had little likelihood to have affected the verdicts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 131 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Here, in contrast, there was no evidentiary basis from which the jury could find that defendant, in engaging in the charged conduct, subjected E to forcible compulsion but not find that defendant did so knowingly. In E\u2019s account \u2014 which the jury necessarily credited in finding forcible compulsion \u2014 after she had declined to give defendant oral sex, he grabbed her by the back of her head and forced his penis into her mouth. Unlike in <em>Gray, </em>nothing in the parties\u2019 history suggested that such conduct had \"previously been accepted sexual behavior\u201d from which defendant might, plausibly, have not known that he was subjecting E to forcible compulsion. The asserted plain error was harmless. <em>See State v. Digesti, </em>267 Or App 516, 525, 340 P3d 762 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 111 (2015) (determining that trial court plainly erred under <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Gray, </em>but declining to exercise <em>Ailes </em>discretion because the error was harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We therefore decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct the error. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 1 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We turn, finally, to defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court concomitantly erred in its instructions on the <em>attempted </em>first-degree sodomy charge (Count 5), ORS 161.405(1) and ORS 163.405(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That charge was based on RB\u2019s allegation that defendant sexually assaulted her in December 2011, the specifics of which we need not discuss, given our disposition of this issue. Defendant asserts that the absence of an instruction on the requisite culpable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>mental state with respect to the element of forcible compulsion constitutes plain error under <em>Nelson.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">However, we have never addressed the propriety of extending <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>analysis into the context of an attempted sexual crime. It is unclear whether, or how, <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>instructional requirement would apply to such crimes, which are dissimilar from completed crimes with respect to the elements of the state\u2019s proof. <em>See State v. Walters, </em>311 Or 80, 84, 804 P2d 1164, <em>cert den, </em>501 US 1209 (1991) (in attempt crimes, the state must prove that a defendant intentionally or knowingly engaged in conduct that constituted a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards commission of a crime); <em>State v. Fox, </em>262 Or App 473, 477-78, 324 P3d 608, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 163 (2014) (where an attempted crime includes the element of forcible compulsion, the state must prove that a defendant, with the requisite intent, took a substantial step towards forcibly compelling the victim to engage in the act). Accordingly, the claimed error is not \u201cobvious\u201d because <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>application to attempted sexual crimes is reasonably disputed, precluding \u201cplain error\u201d review. We affirm defendant\u2019s conviction as to Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-8\"> Defendant raises three separate assignments of error relating to alleged \u201cplain error\u201d in the admission of \u201cvouching\u201d testimony by three different witnesses as to Count 4. We address only the first of those statements; the latter two statements do not warrant published discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">We further reject, without published discussion, defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, challenging the denial of his motion to sever the trial of counts pertaining to the different victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\"> Defendant does not contend that counsel\u2019s questions of Muggia on cross-examination were merely a \u201crepair effort\u201d \u2014 derivative of, and necessitated by, Muggia\u2019s vouching testimony on direct examination. <em>Accord State v. Hollywood, </em>250 Or App 675, 679, 282 P3d 944 (2012) (rejecting \u201cconscious tactical choice\u201d argument as implausible where reaction to impermissible sexual diagnosis testimony was \u201cpurely defensive\u201d and the defendant accrued no strategic advantage from its admission).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b29-9\"> \u201cA person who engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree if *** [t]he victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor.\u201d ORS 163.405(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> ORS 161.405(1) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when the person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime.\u201d For ORS 163.405(1), establishing the crime of first-degree sodomy, see 271 Or App at 9 n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\"> With respect to Count 5, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201ca person commits the crime of attempted sodomy in the first degree if the person intentionally attempts to engage in deviate sexual intercourse with another person and if the victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.\u201d Further, and in pertinent part, the jury was instructed that the state was required to prove that \u201c[defendant] intentionally attempted to have deviate sexual intercourse with [RB]\u201d and that \u201c[RB] was subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">As with Count 1, there was no instruction as to defendant\u2019s mental state with respect to forcible compulsion, and defendant did not propose additional instructions or take exception to those instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
