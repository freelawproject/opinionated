In particular, it requires us to consider whether the plaintiff in this case alleged sufficient facts in his complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8) that was predicated on the theory that plaintiff had not adequately pleaded the foreseeability element of her negligence claims against defendants. Plaintiffs decedent was a foreign exchange student who was fatally shot outside an underage nightclub while she and other exchange students were waiting in line to enter the club. Plaintiff subsequently brought negligence claims against the owners and operators of the nightclub and the Rotary organizations that ran the foreign exchange program, alleging that each of those defendants knew of prior instances of violence around the nightclub and failed to take reasonable precautions to avoid the harm that befell the decedent. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that this particular act of violence \u2014 an assault by a mentally ill person who went to the nightclub looking to shoot \u201cpreppies\u201d or \u201cpop tweens\u201d \u2014 was unforeseeable as a matter of law. The trial court agreed with defendants, ruling that the assault was \u201ca random shooting by a mentally disturbed individual\u201d and that \u201c[n] either the Rotary defendants nor the club defendants could reasonably anticipate the actions of [this particular shooter] or of homicidal mentally ill individuals in general.\u201d Because we conclude that the complaint sufficiently alleged the foreseeability element of plaintiffs claims so as to withstand an ORCP 21 A(8) motion, thereby permitting the case to proceed from the pleading stage to the evidentiary stages,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">A. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Plaintiff is the personal representative of the Estate of Martha Paz de Noboa Delgado (Delgado). Her complaint alleges the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>1. <em>Factual allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Delgado, a 17-year-old Peruvian resident, was staying with a host family in White Salmon, Washington, as part of an international exchange program run by defendants Rotary International and Rotary International District 5100 (\u201cthe Rotary defendants\u201d). On the evening of January 24, 2009, a group of approximately 14 Rotary exchange students, including Delgado, gathered at the home of the host parents of one of the students for a birthday celebration. Later in the evening, the host parents drove the group to a Portland nightclub, The Zone. The host parents dropped the students off near The Zone without a chaperone and planned to pick them up at 1:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Zone, which is owned and operated by a family of entities (\u201cthe Zone defendants\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), was an underage nightclub that admitted people ages 16 to 21 and featured dancing. The Zone frequently had a \u201ccordoned-off line of customers on the sidewalk outside the club waiting to get in.\u201d Delgado and the other exchange students were waiting on the sidewalk to get into The Zone when an assailant, Erik Ayala, shot Delgado twice. Delgado died as a result of her injuries. Ayala, who had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had exhibited obvious signs of mental illness and depression to coworkers, \u201cwent to [T]he Zone nightclub looking to shoot \u2018preppies\u2019 or \u2018pop tweens,\u2019 against whom he may have held a grudge.\u201d Before shooting Delgado, Ayala had stood in front of The Zone and loaded his pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The 2009 shooting was not the first at that particular location. In July 2002, a shooter fired into a crowd of people standing outside the nightclub, striking three people. At that time, the club was named \u201cQuest PDX,\u201d but it was owned and operated by the Zone defendants. There had also been a \u201chistory of fights and assaults in the line outside the nightclub.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Moreover, The Zone\u2019s surrounding area had experienced violent crimes before the 2009 shooting. The Zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>was located in the \u201cOld Town/Chinatown neighborhood\u201d bordering downtown Portland; it was also part of what is referred to by police as the \u201cdowntown entertainment district,\u201d which includes several streets in downtown Portland where nightclubs and bars are located. In the years leading up to the 2009 shooting, the downtown entertainment district was \u201cplagued by recurrent incidents of violence,\u201d which were \u201clinked by police to gang activity and to clubs in the district exceeding capacity and serving too much alcohol.\u201d In 2005, a string of downtown shootings left two people dead and four injured, and police \u201cblanketed the downtown entertainment district with police officers to ease fear.\u201d The effort, which was called \u201cOperation Safe Streets,\u201d included at least two dozen police officers patrolling on foot and horseback on Friday and Saturday nights through early morning, gang enforcement officers, traffic safety officers, parole officers, and liquor control investigators. Owners of downtown nightclubs were asked to close early on weekend nights and were advised to have adequate security, cut off all intoxicated customers, and respond swiftly to problems or notify police.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">After violence continued in the downtown entertainment district, Portland police called a \u201cbar summit\u201d in August 2006 with owners and managers of downtown bars and nightclubs to help them adopt policies to reduce violence. At the meeting, which included a representative of one of the Zone defendants, businesses and police addressed, among other issues, the shootings in the Old Town/Chinatown neighborhood. \u201cIt was known by Portland police and club owners alike that there was a high probability that more shootings would take place in the downtown entertainment district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">At the summit, police and businesses also addressed whether the violence on downtown sidewalks and parking lots was related to drunken club-goers (as police believed) or drug dealers (as clubs contended). The Zone was located in what used to be one of Portland\u2019s \u201cDrug Free Zones,\u201d in which anyone convicted of a drug offense could be barred from returning. The drug-free-zone program expired in 2007, and \u201cdrug dealers and addicts took over Portland\u2019s Chinatown/Old Town neighborhood\u201d; \u201c[p]olice officers came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>to refer to the area as \u2018crack alley\u2019 and residents complained of being terrorized by an increasingly aggressive and confrontational breed of drug users and sellers.\u201d By January 2009, the Old Town/Chinatown neighborhood \u201chad approximately fourteen agencies serving addicted, mentally ill, and homeless people, more than any other neighborhood in the city, with thousands of clients coming to the area every day. Many of those clients bought drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u201cDrug dealers, drug users, and gang members, all of whom frequented the area where the Zone nightclub was located, frequently carried weapons ***.\u201d \u201c[S]ome club owners, realizing that their clients were in danger of violent assault, increased security at their bars and nightclubs.\u201d In 2006, Dan Lenzen, a principal at one of the Zone defendants, \u201cacknowledged downtown safety problems, but said they were created by \u2018a few bad apples,\u201d\u2019 and that police, liquor control, and others should \u201cwork together for the benefit of club-goers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Before the shooting, The Zone had undertaken measures to provide security for their customers inside and outside their club. Those measures included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c(a) The Zone had an employee whose primary responsibility was monitoring customers as they come and go from the club. The employee was to assist in line control; to distance \u2018undesirables,\u2019 i.e., intoxicated persons, harassers, transients, known trouble makers, or gang affiliated persons from guests; and to monitor the parking lot and deter potential guests from loitering in or around their cars;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201c(b) The Zone nightclub had a security camera that monitored the outside of their establishment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201c(c) The Zone nightclub had a security guard or door-person at the door outside of the premises who frisked everyone before entry, checking for drugs, alcohol, firearms, or other weapons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201c(d) In the past, The Zone had hired off-duty police officers to provide security for their customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201c(e) On or about 2006, The Zone nightclub remodeled its facilities in the hopes of attracting a better clientele and reducing problems at the club including violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Thus, plaintiff alleged, the Zone defendants \u201cknew about the risk of violence that its customers faced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Plaintiff further alleged that underage nightclubs, generally, are understood to pose \u201cinherent\u201d risks of violence because of the high proportion of young male patrons, high noise levels, crowding, competitive environment, and underage drinking. \u201cA metropolitan nightclub may see as many as three or four assaults on staff each night and are often confronted with armed patrons. Shootings, stabbings, felonious assaults, drug violations, and/or murders are commonplace in metropolitan nightclubs across the country.\u201d Indeed, several cities around the country \u201chave banned or heavily regulated teen dance clubs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">According to plaintiffs allegations, the instances of violence that \u201coccurred nationally at underage nightclubs and locally in the area around The Zone nightclub were all publicized in local and/or national media, and [the Rotary defendants] knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, about the dangers of leaving [Delgado] at The Zone nightclub on the date and at the time in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">2. <em>Specifications of negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In plaintiffs second amended complaint, which is the operative complaint, she alleged that the Zone defendants owed a duty to Delgado, a business invitee, to exercise reasonable care to make the premises safe for her, including protection from criminal acts by third parties. Plaintiff alleged that the Zone defendants breached that duty in the following particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201c(a) In failing to take reasonable measures to protect their customers from the criminal acts of third parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201c(b) In making their customers stand in line in front of the club;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201c(c) In failing to have sufficient security personnel to protect their customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">\u201c(d) In failing to properly train their staff to identify threats to their customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201c(e) In failing to identify Erik Ayala as a threat while he was in front of The Zone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">\u201c(f) In failing to have adequate emergency response procedures in place to protect customers once a threat was identified; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201c(g) In failing to warn their customers or the parents of their customers about the risk of being assaulted while patronizing The Zone nightclub.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">With regard to the Rotary defendants, plaintiff alleged that Delgado lived with a host family under the \u201causpices, sponsorship, and control\u201d of the Rotary defendants, and that the host parents were the Rotary defendants\u2019 agents. Plaintiff alleged that the Rotary defendants were authorized to exercise \u201cindependent supervisory and parental responsibility to safeguard [Delgado\u2019s] physical and mental well-being,\u201d and, thus, that the special relationship between Delgado and the Rotary defendants \u201cgave rise to a heightened duty of care beyond the general duty to avoid foreseeable risk of harm.\u201d According to plaintiff, the Rotary defendants, directly or acting through their agents, breached that duty in the following particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201c(a) In failing to provide host parents with sufficient training so as to reasonably ensure the safety of the students;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201c(b) In leaving the students unsupervised, late at night in a high crime area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\u201c(c) In failing to adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations to ensure the safety of the students;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201c(d) In failing to adopt reasonable rules and regulations regarding travel to prevent the students from being left alone in dangerous areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u201c(e) In failing to properly and adequately warn all the students and their parents of the dangers of being left unsupervised in a high crime area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The Zone defendants and Rotary defendants each moved under ORCP 21A to dismiss all of the claims asserted in plaintiffs second amended complaint, on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>plaintiff had failed to allege any foreseeable risk of harm to Delgado. <em>See </em>ORCP 21 A(8) (providing for dismissal for \u201cfailure to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim\u201d). In their respective Rule 21 motions, defendants argued that plaintiffs negligence allegations boiled down to the following theory: (1) Criminals were more likely to commit crimes in the area in which The Zone was located; (2) defendants knew or should have known of that fact; and (3) Delgado was killed in that \u201chigh crime area.\u201d But those allegations, defendants argued, failed to establish a foreseeable risk of the <em>particular crime </em>that killed Delgado, which defendants characterized as a \u201crandom spree shooting\u201d against a particular class of person (\u201cpreppies\u201d). According to defendants, such a shooting was just as likely to occur at a mall, a movie theater, or an ice cream parlor; thus, \u201cthe occurrence of a random spree shooting in a high crime area does not make it any more foreseeable than if it occurred in a place one would normally deem safe, such as a movie theater or a school.\u201d Indeed, the \u201crandomness\u201d of shootings like the one that injured Delgado, defendants argued, \u201cmeans that when and where they occur are not foreseeable, as that term is used in Oregon tort law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Plaintiff, meanwhile, argued that defendants\u2019 arguments misapprehended what it means for a risk of harm to be foreseeable under Oregon case law. In plaintiffs view, \u201c[foreseeability in this case does not turn on being able to foresee \u2018random spree shootings,\u2019 but rather on foreseeing the risk of a <em>violent criminal assault\u201d </em>to Delgado. (Emphasis added.) \u201cIt is the dangerous character of the nightclub, its location and its violent history,\u201d plaintiff asserted, \u201cthat would allow a jury to conclude that the harm in this case was foreseeable.\u201d She explained that, \u201c[t]here are many foreseeable ways in which the assault might have taken place [.] * * * Even if an assault by a mentally ill person is somehow unusual or unexpected, the resulting harm was legally foreseeable because it was within the class of reasonably foreseeable hazards\u201d at The Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The trial court ultimately agreed with defendants, ruling that the shooting that killed Delgado was unforeseeable as a matter of law. In the order granting defendants\u2019 motions, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cFor the purposes of these motions the allegations about what the defendants should have known must be accepted as true. The court assumes both the club owners and the exchange program sponsors knew of all the alleged acts of violence associated with the neighborhood, and of the problems with violence alleged to be characteristic of underage clubs. Knowing of these dangers, the defendants may be expected to take reasonable steps to avert them. They should not be required to take precautions against dangers not reasonably expected. So the question becomes one of how reasonable it is to expect attempts at mass murder.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">\u201cThe answer is that such crimes are both rare and random. Looking back over the years there have been similar acts of violence at a McDonald\u2019s in San Ysidro, California, a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, a college campus in Virginia, and an army base in Texas. Each of these events, like this event, was a random shooting by a mentally disturbed individual. Other crimes, even violent crime, which happened at one of these locations prior to the shooting do not create an expectation that such shootings will occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201cNeither Rotary defendants nor the [Zone] defendants could reasonably anticipate the actions of Mr. Ayala in particular or of homicidal mentally ill individuals in general. There may come a time in which such crimes are reasonably anticipated, but that time is not, thankfully, the present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The court subsequently entered limited judgments that dismissed all claims against both the Zone defendants and the Rotary defendants. Plaintiff appeals those limited judgments and argues, as she did below, that her complaint alleges facts that, if proved, establish a foreseeable risk of the type of harm that befell Delgado.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under ORCP 21 A(8), we assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor. <em>Bailey v. Lewis Farm, Inc., </em>343 Or 276, 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>171 P3d 336 (2007). We then assess whether a reasonable juror could find that plaintiff had proved the disputed element of her claim \u2014 in this case, foreseeability \u2014 if the facts pleaded are ultimately proved at trial. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 287 (\u201cIf those facts [in the complaint] are true, then a reasonable jury could find that the failure of the axle, the loss of the wheels, and the resulting injury to plaintiff were all foreseeable.\u201d); <em>Moore v. Willis, </em>307 Or 254, 256, 767 P2d 62 (1988) (\u201cAt issue is whether the plaintiff alleged ultimate facts that would allow a factfinder to determine that the violence was foreseeable.\u201d); <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 17, 734 P2d 1326 (1987) (\u201cThe role of the court is what it ordinarily is in cases involving the evaluation of particular situations under broad and imprecise standards: to determine whether upon the facts alleged * * * no reasonable factfinder could decide one or more elements of liability for one or the other party.\u201d). In conducting this analysis of the sufficiency of the complaint, we adhere to the command of ORCP 12 A that \u201c[a] 11 pleadings shall be liberally construed with a view of substantial justice between the parties,\u201d and we \u201cattribute [] to the pleading all facts which can be implied by fair and reasonable intendment from those expressly averred.\u201d <em>Stotts v. Johnson and Marshall, </em>192 Or 403, 415, 234 P2d 1059 (1951) (interpreting the statutory predecessor to ORCP 12 A).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">A. <em>Negligence Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Under Oregon law, \u201cunless the parties invoke a status, a relationship, or a particular standard of conduct that creates, defines, or limits the defendant\u2019s duty, the issue of liability for harm actually resulting from defendant\u2019s conduct properly depends on whether that conduct unreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 17. Where a party invokes a special status, relationship, or standard of conduct, \u201cthen that relationship may \u2018create,\u2019 \u2018define,\u2019 or \u2018limit\u2019 the defendant\u2019s \u2018duty\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP, </em>336 Or 329, 341, 83 P3d 322 (2004) (quoting <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 17). However, even in that circumstance, \u201cwhen a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>alleges a special relationship as the basis for the defendant\u2019s duty, the scope of that [particular] duty may be defined or limited by common-law principles such as foreseeability.\u201d <em>Oregon Steel Mills, Inc., </em>336 Or at 342 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In this case, plaintiff invokes two special relationships that potentially \u201ccreate,\u201d \u201cdefine,\u201d or \u201climit\u201d defendants\u2019 duties. <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 17. The first, which plaintiff invokes as to the Zone defendants, is the relationship between owners of land and persons whom they invite onto their premises. Under the \u201cbusiness invitee rule,\u201d which is described in section 344 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1965),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201ca business, as a possessor of premises, has a duty to take reasonable steps to protect its visitors from <em>reasonably foreseeable </em>criminal acts by third persons.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Kids Incorporated of Dallas, OR, </em>245 Or App 267, 278, 261 P3d 1272 (2011), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>353 Or 104 (2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The second \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d which plaintiff invokes with respect to the Rotary defendants, is the relationship between a child and a person entrusted with that child\u2019s care. <em>See id. </em>(describing similar allegations that a defendant was \u201can organization entrusted with children for supervision and care, [and] had a duty akin to the relationship between a school and its minor students\u201d). In <em>Stewart, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>we explained that schools \u201chave a special duty to students \u2018apart from any general responsibility not unreasonably to expose people to a foreseeable risk of harm,\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he scope of this obligation does not exclude precautions against risks of crime or torts merely because a third person inflicts the injury.\u2019\u201d 245 Or App at 279 (quoting <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 19-20). At the same time, a school \u2014 or, by analogy, an organization similarly entrusted with the supervision and care of a minor \u2014 is not strictly liable for all injuries that occur during the time of that relationship. \u201c[T]he duty to protect against risks of harm \u2014 including the risk of harm from third-party criminal acts \u2014 imposed by the special relationship is broader than that which might apply in the absence of a special relationship, [but] <em>that obligation does not extend to unforeseeable risks of harm.\u201d Stewart, </em>245 Or App at 279 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Thus, the scope of each of the special relationships alleged in this case is defined in terms of reasonable foreseeability. That is, \u201calthough each defendant may have had a special relationship with plaintiffs [decedent] and a corresponding duty to protect against criminal conduct by third parties, that duty extended only to reasonably foreseeable criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The question, then, is what does it mean for third-party criminal conduct to be \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d? Or, more to the point, when a plaintiffs negligence claim arises from harm caused by third-party criminal conduct, what facts must the complaint allege to withstand an ORCP 21 A(8) motion on the forseeability element of the claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The starting point for discussing what must be alleged (and eventually proved) to establish foreseeability of harm \u2014 regardless of mechanism \u2014 is <em>Fazzolari. In Fazzolari, </em>a case that itself involved harm caused by third-party criminal activity, the court explained that \u201ccommon-law negligence imposes liability for harms of the general kind and to plaintiffs of the general class placed at risk, harms that a reasonable factfinder, applying community standards, could consider within the range of foreseeable possibilities.\u201d 303 Or at 12-13 (citing <em>Stewart v.

That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201c[i]t has been observed that \u2018if we use a very generalized description of the type of harm that was foreseeable and of the type of harm that occurred, an answer that the result was within the risk is inevitable.\u2019 And on the other hand, \u2018[if] we use a detailed, mechanism-of-harm description of the result and the risks, the answer will be negative.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Jefferson Plywood, </em>255 Or at 610 (quoting Robert E.

Our decision in <em>McPherson v. Oregon Dept. of Corrections, </em>210 Or App 602, 152 P3d 918 (2007), exemplifies that struggle. In <em>McPherson, </em>on review of a grant of summary judgment, we considered whether a reasonable factfinder could find that it was foreseeable to an apartment complex that two of its tenants would be subject to violent assaults in a standalone laundry shed on the complex premises. The assaults were committed by an escaped convict. Before concluding that a reasonable factfinder could find that the risk of such assaults was foreseeable to the apartment complex because of the evidence of past similar crimes in and around the complex, we thoroughly canvassed the case law on foreseeability of harm caused by third-party criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 609-17. After conducting that analysis, we explained that we were able to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cdraw only one conclusion: whether a rational juror can find that harm is foreseeable, particularly in the context of criminal activity by third parties, is an <em>ad hoc </em>determination depending on the particular circumstances of each case. No bright line rules exist. Fact-matching is of limited utility. Unforeseeability as a matter of law should be found only in extreme cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Notwithstanding that admonition, there are common features to the decisions involving third-party criminal activity \u2014 and perhaps more consistency to our approach to the issue of foreseeability in such cases than we acknowledged in <em>McPherson. </em>First, the cases have essentially asked the same two questions concerning foreseeability that the Supreme Court asked in <em>Jefferson Plywood: </em>(1) Based on the facts that the defendant knew or should have known, what general class of criminal harm was foreseeable to the defendant?; and (2) was the criminal harm that ultimately befell the plaintiff within that general class of harm? <em>See, e.g., Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 21 (considering whether an assault and rape of the plaintiff, a high school student, by an unknown assailant while waiting outside her school was reasonably foreseeable, and reiterating that \u201cthe concept of foreseeability refers to generalized risks of the type of incidents and injuries that occurred rather than predictability of the actual sequence of events\u201d); <em>Uihlein v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>282 Or 631, 640-41, 580 P2d 1014 (1978) (examining whether \u201con this record [the defendant supermarket] neither knew nor had reason to know of the likelihood of harmful acts of this kind against its patrons in general and plaintiff in particular\u201d); <em>Torres v. United States Nat. Bank, </em>65 Or App 207, 215, 670 P2d 230, <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 237 (1983) (explaining that the harm to the plaintiff must be within the \u201cgeneral class of harm a reasonable person would anticipate might arise from defendant\u2019s conduct, and the person injured must be within the general class threatened by the conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Second, a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that the harm by third-party criminal conduct was foreseeable to the defendant in a concrete way and may not rely on the abstract proposition that \u201ccrimes may occur and that the criminals perpetrating them may cause harm.\u201d The Supreme Court rejected that theory in <em>Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., </em>316 Or 499, 511-12, 853 P2d 798 (1993), explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cWhile it is generally foreseeable that criminals may commit crimes and that prisoners may escape and engage in criminal activity while at large, that level of foreseeability does not make the criminal\u2019s acts the legal responsibility of everyone who may have contributed in some way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>to the criminal opportunity. In other words, in our society it is foreseeable that crimes may occur and that the criminals perpetrating them may cause harm. Thus, in a general sense, it is foreseeable that anyone whose conduct may in any way facilitate the criminal in committing the crime has played some part in the resulting harm. But mere \u2018facilitation\u2019 of an unintended adverse result, where intervening intentional criminality of another person is the harm-producing force, does not cause the harm so as to support liability for it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Our recent decision in <em>Stewart </em>illustrates the point made in <em>Buchler. </em>There, the plaintiff alleged that his ward, Jane Doe, had been sexually assaulted by an adult male in the men\u2019s restroom of a Dairy Queen restaurant during a fundraiser sponsored by Kids, Inc. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants, Kids, Inc. and Dairy Queen, should have reasonably foreseen the risk of that harm because \u201c(1) the car wash was advertised; (2) teenage girls would be present at the car wash, and (3) sexual predators might have had Internet contact with the teenage girls.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>245 Or App at 284. The trial court ruled that the risk was unforeseeable as a matter of law and dismissed the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In analyzing whether the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that the sexual assault was foreseeable to the defendants, we reasoned that the plaintiffs theory in <em>Stewart </em>(that the world is full of sexual predators who pose a foreseeable risk of assault) was indistinguishable from the theory discredited in <em>Buchler, i.e., </em>that it is always foreseeable that criminals will steal guns and harm people with them. We further reasoned that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>allegations against Dairy Queen were insufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that the \u201cplace or character\u201d of the restaurant was such that Dairy Queen should have anticipated the sexual assault. We explained that the plaintiff was required to allege <em>specific factual support </em>\u2014 as opposed to relying on generalized abstractions about the existence of criminal activity \u2014 that those in the family restaurant business should know that widely advertising an event with minors would attract sexual predators. <em>Id. </em>at 286 (explaining that the plaintiffs complaint had alleged \u201cnothing more than a theoretical possibility that such a harm might occur; for example there are no allegations of fact that sexual assault occurs at these types of sites, or among gatherings of teenagers in public places, or that sexual assault is a \u2018hazard inherent\u2019 in this type of activity\u201d (quoting <em>Torres, </em>65 Or App at 214)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">A third principle that emerges from our case law in this area is that proof of foreseeability will differ depending on whether the alleged negligence by a defendant is the failure to protect against the risk of harm posed by criminals in general, such as at a school (Fazzolari), a bank <em>(Torres), </em>an apartment complex <em>(McPherson), </em>stores <em>(Uihlein </em>and <em>Brown v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>297 Or 695, 688 P2d 811 (1984)), bars <em>(Cunningham v. Happy Palace, Inc., </em>157 Or App 334, 970 P2d 669 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 365 (1999), and <em>Moore, </em>307 Or 254), or a restaurant <em>(Stewart), </em>or whether the alleged negligence is negligent supervision or screening of <em>particular individuals </em>who might engage in criminal activity (B<em>uchler; Allstate Ins. Co. v. Tenant Screening Services, Inc., </em>140 Or App 41, 914 P2d 16 (1996); and <em>McAlpine v. Multnomah County, </em>131 Or App 136, 883 P2d 869 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 507 (1995)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we observed in <em>McPherson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>courts have occasionally defined the class of harm more narrowly when the question is whether a particular person\u2019s criminal history makes a future crime by that same person foreseeable, sometimes requiring a high degree of similarity between the actor\u2019s past crimes and the crime at issue. 210 Or App at 615 (describing the holdings in <em>Allstate </em>and <em>McAlpine).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">By contrast, where the case involves a theory of negligence based on the foreseeability of criminal activity at large, as this case does, courts have consistently defined the class of harm more generally. In this type of case, courts have focused on whether the defendant was on notice of the potential for harm from some class of criminal activity. <em>See Uihlein, </em>282 Or at 641 (\u201c[W]e do not mean to say that the storekeeper must be able to foresee the exact harm which occurs, but there must be something to alert the storekeeper to the likelihood of harm of some kind from a criminal agency.\u201d); <em>Cunningham, </em>157 Or App at 338 (explaining that the question was \u201cwhether [the] defendant could have foreseen that [the] plaintiff would fall victim to <em>a </em>criminal act\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>at 338 n 2 (\u201cThe specific details of the sexual assault need not have been foreseeable, only that plaintiff in some way would become a crime victim.\u201d). If the plaintiff presents facts that would allow a jury to find that the defendant could have foreseen a harm from some general class of criminal activity, such as the risk of assault on the premises, then the remaining question is whether the particular harm that befell the plaintiff resulted from criminal conduct within that general class. Under <em>Fazzolari, </em>that is a jury question unless, on the facts alleged in the complaint (when the question is considered at the ORCP 21 A(8) stage of the case, as it is here), or on the evidence adduced (when the question is considered at summary judgment or at trial), (1) no reasonable factfinder could find that the criminal harm suffered by the plaintiff was qualitatively similar to the past criminal activity known to the defendant, <em>e.g., Uihlein, </em>282 Or at 640 (prior incidents of shoplifting did not make harm from a violent assault reasonably foreseeable), or (2) the connection between the alleged act of negligence by the defendant and the criminal harm suffered by the plaintiff is so attenuated that no reasonable factfinder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>could find that the defendant was on notice that the alleged act of negligence risked criminal harm to the plaintiff, <em>e.g., McPherson, </em>210 Or App at 618 (criminal harm not foreseeable where risk of harm would have to \u201cresult from some strange \u2018concatenation of highly unusual circumstances\u2019 * * * [or] an extended sequence of improbable chance occurrences\u201d (quoting <em>Jefferson Plywood, </em>255 Or at 609)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">B. <em>Sufficiency of Plaintiffs Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">With that background, we turn to the question before us: whether the harm that befell Delgado was unforeseeable as a matter of law, as the trial court ruled. Plaintiff argues, as she did below, that Delgado was put at risk of a violent assault while waiting in line and that \u201c[v]iolent criminal assault was the very hazard that [defendants] had a responsibility from which to protect plaintiff\u2019s decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendants, meanwhile, reassert their argument that a \u201crandom\u201d shooting is, by its very nature, unforeseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">1. <em>The Zone defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We assume, as did the trial court, that the Zone defendants were aware of prior criminal activity at The Zone and in its general vicinity. That criminal activity included a 2002 shooting at The Zone; \u201ca history of fights and assaults in the line outside the nightclub\u201d; aggressive and confrontational drug users and dealers in the vicinity; and serious enough problems with gang violence and intoxication in the immediate area to necessitate a \u201cbar summit\u201d between police and bar owners, including The Zone\u2019s representatives, in 2006. Plaintiff further alleged that The Zone had an employee who was charged with assisting in line control and \u201cdistancing] \u2018undesirables,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>intoxicated persons, harassers, transients, known trouble makers, or gang affiliated persons from guests\u201d \u2014 the inference being, in light of the other factual allegations, that security was necessary to protect guests waiting in line.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>From those facts, a jury could find that it was reasonably foreseeable that guests waiting in line outside The Zone nightclub would be exposed to criminal activity and would be at risk of a violent assault, including gun violence. That is, a jury could find that The Zone\u2019s guests waiting in line were at risk of the general class of criminal harm \u2014 violent assault \u2014 that had occurred there previously, thus requiring the Zone defendants to take reasonable precautions to protect those guests from such harm. <em>See McPherson, </em>210 Or App at 617-18 (evidence that, among other things, an apartment complex was in a high-crime area that included gunshots, car break-ins, and thefts, and a tenant was threatened by an ax-wielding person, was sufficient to prove foreseeable risk of assault by criminals frequenting the complex and its laundry room, notwithstanding the fact that \u201cno incidents of violence had occurred in the laundry room\u201d); <em>Cunningham, </em>157 Or App at 340 (evidence of the defendant\u2019s awareness of risks that intoxicated persons are more likely to be victims of crime and assault, coupled with an ORCP 47 E affidavit regarding foreseeability, was sufficient for a jury to find that the defendant \u201ccould have reasonably foreseen that it was placing [the] plaintiff at risk of criminal assault by forcing her to leave the safety of the restaurant before she could arrange for transportation home\u201d); <em>Torres, </em>65 Or App at 215 (holding that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that, because of the bank\u2019s design and the use of the night deposit, \u201cthe general class of harm which a customer might suffer in making a deposit included physical assault by a robber, and that [the plaintiff] was within the general class threatened by such conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Nonetheless, the Zone defendants argue that a risk of violent assault is \u201csimply insufficient as a matter of law\u201d to make Delgado\u2019s death foreseeable, because, under <em>Buchler </em>and <em>Stewart, </em>\u201ca plaintiff must plead and prove that the <em>specific type of criminal activity </em>was foreseeable.\u201d (Emphasis by the Zone defendants.) Neither <em>Buchler </em>nor <em>Stewart </em>supports that understanding of the law. Those cases stand for the proposition that a plaintiff must prove that criminal activity was foreseeable in a <em>specific circumstance, </em>not that the specific criminal act that harmed the plaintiff was foreseeable. That is, in each case, the court rejected the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>attempt to rely on the generic fact that there are criminals in the world who might commit crimes, requiring the plaintiff to put forth concrete facts demonstrating that the defendant was on notice that its negligence risked someone being harmed by criminal activity. <em>Buchler </em>and <em>Stewart </em>hold that something more than that \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d is required, but neither case requires a plaintiff to prove that a specific type of crime was foreseeable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Having concluded that the facts alleged by plaintiff establish a general class of foreseeable <em>harm </em>\u2014 i.e., violent assault of persons waiting in line outside The Zone \u2014 the remaining question is whether plaintiff has alleged facts which, if proved, would permit a reasonable factfinder to find that the criminal harm that Delgado suffered falls within that general class. The trial court reasoned, and the Zone defendants argue on appeal, that the harm to Delgado was qualitatively different from any previous criminal activity that had occurred at or near The Zone, because the shooter, Ayala, was mentally ill and selected a target \u201cat random.\u201d Although a reasonable factfinder might well agree with the Zone defendants that Ayala\u2019s crime was unforeseeable, such a finding is not <em>required </em>as a matter of law. Again, viewing the pleadings liberally, as we must at this stage of the case, we are unable to say that it would be unreasonable for a factfinder to affirmatively reject the Zone defendants\u2019 view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of things and find that the harm suffered by Delgado was similar enough to the prior physical assaults at or around The Zone so as to bring it within the class of crimes that The Zone defendants knew or should have known were likely to occur.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Oregon courts have never required a plaintiff to prove that the precise mechanism of injury or \u201cactual sequence of events\u201d that caused the harm in question was foreseeable. <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 21; <em>see Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc., </em>357 Or 74, 106 n 17, 347 P3d 766 (2015) (explaining that the defendant\u2019s argument, which focused on the actual sequence of events that injured the plaintiff, \u201cmisunderstands foreseeable risk\u201d). Cases involving third-party criminal activity are no different: A plaintiff is not required to prove that the \u201cdetails\u201d of the crime were foreseeable. <em>Cunningham, </em>157 Or App at 338 n 2. Assaults often can be characterized as \u201csenseless\u201d and \u201crandom,\u201d and can be committed for any number of reasons, by any number of means or weapons, and against any number of victims. Whether the circumstances of a particular assault \u2014 such as the shooter\u2019s motive or mental state, the intended victim, or the weapon used \u2014 are \u201cdetails,\u201d or instead serve to make the crime qualitatively different from other foreseeable harms, will vary from case to case. Based on the facts alleged in plaintiffs complaint, a reasonable juror could conclude that this type of assault \u2014 a gunman firing at patrons waiting in line to enter The Zone \u2014 fell within the category of risks that the Zone defendants should have anticipated, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the shooter\u2019s particular motive, mental state, intended targets, or weapon used.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">For the same reason, we cannot say that, as a matter of law, the circumstances alleged in the complaint were so highly unusual, or the sequence of events so attenuated, that no reasonable person in the Zone defendants\u2019 position could have anticipated the harm to Delgado. <em>See McPherson, </em>210 Or App at 618 (explaining that probability of harm, and therefore reasonable foreseeability, decreases as the number of steps between a defendant\u2019s action and the plaintiffs harm increases). A jury could find, based on the facts alleged in the complaint, that the link between Ayala\u2019s crime, the Zone defendants\u2019 conduct, and Delgado\u2019s death was relatively straightforward: The Zone defendants exposed their invitees to criminal activity when they left them to line up and wait on the street in a high-crime area, whereby a criminal could approach the line and shoot at the invitees. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the assault of a tenant by a stranger in the laundry room of the apartment complex \u201cdid not result from some strange concatenation of highly unusual circumstances\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). Once again, a jury could find that this particular type of shooting was so highly unusual as to be unforeseeable, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>taking all allegations in the complaint as true, a jury could also find that the shooting was similar enough to the past acts of violence at and around The Zone so as to make it foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Thus, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claims against the Zone defendants on foreseeability grounds, and we reverse the limited judgment in their favor. We appreciate the trial court\u2019s concern that a club owner might not reasonably be expected to prevent an attempt at \u201cmass murder.\u201d However, that concern relates more directly to the standard of care: Did the Zone defendants respond reasonably to the foreseeable risk of a violent assault against someone waiting in line at The Zone? <em>See Brown, </em>297 Or at 710 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the defendants were aware of the need for security forces,\u201d the question is \u201cwhat would a reasonably prudent person in [the] defendants\u2019 circumstances do to protect customers if he knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that there were a large number of reports of complaints of crimes in the immediate area\u201d); <em>accord Towe, </em>357 Or at 105 (separately addressing whether the defendant\u2019s actions \u201cdid not create a foreseeable risk of harm\u201d and whether \u201cits actions were not unreasonable in light of that risk\u201d). And the Zone defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss did not put at issue the standard of care or any other element of plaintiffs claim for negligence; it addresses solely the issue of whether plaintiff had adequately pleaded the element of foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. <em>The Rotary defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We conclude, for reasons similar to those discussed above, that plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the Rotary defendants, acting through the host parents, created a foreseeable risk of harm to Delgado \u2014 at least with respect to one of plaintiffs specifications of negligence. Plaintiffs specifications of negligence, which are set out above, 271 Or App at 496-97, include leaving students in a high-crime area. Plaintiff further alleged that the prior crimes in and around The Zone were \u201cpublicized in local and/or national media, and [the Rotary defendants] knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, about the dangers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>leaving [Delgado] at The Zone nightclub on the date and at the time in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Those allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss on the question of foreseeability. Plaintiffs complaint does not rest on allegations that crime is generally foreseeable, or on a conclusory allegation that The Zone is located in a high-crime area. Rather, plaintiff alleged specific facts that, if proved at trial, would establish that The Zone nightclub had experienced violent crime, including homicidal violence. Assuming, as we must at this stage of the proceedings, the truth of those allegations, and that the host parents were aware of those facts and nevertheless left Delgado there, a reasonable juror could conclude that the host parents\u2019 conduct exposed her to a foreseeable risk of violent assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The question then reduces to whether a reasonable jury could find that the harm that actually befell Delgado was within that general class. The crux of the Rotary defendants\u2019 argument is the same as the Zone defendants \u2014 that \u201c[a] random spree shooting is simply not the same thing as the robberies, assaults, burglaries and kidnappings referenced in Appellant\u2019s Second Amended Complaint.\u201d We reject that argument for the same reasons expressed above: On the facts alleged, we are unable to say that <em>all </em>reasonable factfinders would have to agree with the Rotary defendants that the criminal harm that befell Delgado was \"not the same thing\u201d as the criminal harms of which the Rotary defendants had notice, and that <em>no </em>reasonable factfinder could find that the harm to Delgado fell within the class of harms of which the Rotary defendants are alleged to have been aware.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Nor can we say, on the facts alleged, that, as a matter of law, no reasonable person in the Rotary defendants\u2019 position could have anticipated the sequence of events that resulted in harm to Delgado. The link between defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent conduct and the actual harm that befell Delgado was direct: The host parents knew that there had been a significant history of violent crime at or near The Zone, they took Delgado to The Zone and left her there, and she was the victim of a violent assault. Although a jury might conclude that the host parents could not have reasonably foreseen the consequences of leaving Delgado at The Zone, the chain of events is not, as a matter of law, a \u201cconcatenation of highly unusual circumstances\u201d that would preclude as a matter of law a contrary finding. <em>Jefferson Plywood, </em>255 Or at 609.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we reverse the limited judgment dismissing the claims against the Rotary defendants, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We emphasize the narrow scope of our holdings in this case. The defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss were limited to the question of foreseeability, and that is the only question we have addressed. However, a plaintiff must plead and prove additional elements beyond the foreseeability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the harm to the plaintiff to recover on a negligence claim. Specifically, a plaintiff must plead and then prove \u201c(1) that [the] defendant\u2019s conduct caused a foreseeable risk of harm, (2) that the risk is to an interest of a kind that the law protects against negligent invasion, (3) that [the] defendant\u2019s conduct was unreasonable in light of the risk, (4) that the conduct was a cause of [the] plaintiffs harm, and (5) that [the] plaintiff was within the class of persons and [the] plaintiffs injury was within the general type of potential incidents and injuries that made [the] defendant\u2019s conduct negligent.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>245 Or App at 274-75 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Towe, </em>357 Or at 87 (explaining that \u201cforeseeability and causation are separate elements\u201d and that foreseeability does not \u201celiminate [] the plaintiffs obligation to prove, as an element of a negligence claim, cause-in-fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We imply no view on any of those other elements of plaintiffs negligence claims against either set of defendants. Similarly, and notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s view, our opinion should not be read as imposing strict liability anytime a business is or should be aware of some risk of criminal activity on its premises, or anytime a custodian of a child leaves a child in an area known for crime. We hold simply that, in this case, plaintiff has alleged sufficient concrete facts about the nature of The Zone and its neighborhood that, if proved, would permit a reasonable factfinder to find that (1) the Zone defendants were on notice that, absent appropriate security measures, their patrons were at risk of harm by physical assault, including assault by weapon; (2) the Rotary defendants were on notice that assaultive conduct occurred frequently in The Zone\u2019s neighborhood and, thus, on notice that, by leaving Delgado at The Zone, they would be exposing her to the risk that she would become the victim of such assaultive conduct; and (3) the harm that befell Delgado \u2014 death by shooting \u2014 fell within the class of criminal harms of which both The Zone and the Rotary defendants had notice, making that harm a foreseeable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> By \u201cevidentiary stages\u201d we mean summary judgment or trial depending on the parties\u2019 litigation choices and the outcome of any summary judgment practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> These include defendants Five Stars, Inc.; Concept Entertainment Group, Ltd.; and Concept Real Estate, LLC.

J., dissenting). In the dissent\u2019s view, the \u201ccircumstances that existed in 2005 to 2007, when the last homicides in the district occurred, are of little weight unless they are a part of a pattern that occurred in the past and that continued up to the time of the shooting in this case.\u201d 271 Or App at 520 (Edmonds, S. J., dissenting). The dissent does not cite any Oregon case \u2014 nor is there one \u2014 that holds that a business owner\u2019s duty to protect its invitees from third-party criminal activity is triggered only when there is a pattern of a specific crime, such as a homicide, that continues up until the moment of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Nor is there support in Oregon law for the dissent\u2019s suggestion that a business owner is only on notice of risks from crimes that occurred in the preceding two years. Although we certainly agree with the dissent that a prior crime could be so remote in time that a court would have to rule that no reasonable factfinder could find that the prior crime made a subsequent crime foreseeable to a defendant, we are unable to reach that conclusion here, particularly in light of the allegations that other types of assaultive conduct occurred in and around The Zone, and that such assaultive conduct, including homicidal conduct, was commonplace in the nightclub industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\"> Our deepest disagreement with the dissent is on this point: Who should decide whether the harm to Delgado was qualitatively different from the previous criminal activity that occurred at or near The Zone? The dissent, applying its own formulation of \u201creasonableness,\u201d would give little weight to criminal activity that occurred more than two years before the incident and conclude, as a matter of law, that the harm that befell Delgado was unforeseeable in the absence of a previous and continuous pattern of \u201crandom\u201d shootings near The Zone. But, as we understand Oregon law, juries \u2014 not judges \u2014 are entrusted with applying community standards of reasonableness in negligence cases and, in particular, are entrusted with determining what facts to give little weight and what facts to give greater weight in that calculus. At least since <em>Fazzolari, </em>it has been well established that \u201c[t]he jury is given a wide leeway in deciding whether the conduct in question falls above or below the standard of reasonable conduct deemed to have been set by the community. The court intervenes only when it can say that the actor\u2019s conduct clearly meets the standard or clearly falls below it.\u201d 303 Or at 18 (quoting <em>Jefferson Plywood, </em>255 Or at 607).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b532-5\"> The dissent adopts defendant\u2019s characterization of the incident as a \u201crandom\u201d shooting and consistently repeats that description throughout its opinion. <em>E.g., </em>271 Or App at 517 (Edmonds, S. J., dissenting) (\u201cThe only reasonable inference that could be drawn from the circumstances of the shooting as alleged is that it was a completely random event.\u201d). The word \u201crandom\u201d commonly means \u201clacking or seeming to lack a regular plan, purpose, or pattern,\u201d or \u201cmarked by absence of bias : chosen at random.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1880 (unabridged ed 2002). The allegations, though, are susceptible to an inference that Ayala had a specific purpose \u2014 -to shoot \u201cpreppies\u201d or \u201cpop tweens\u201d \u2014 and targeted a location, an underage nightclub, where he would find those particular victims. In that respect, the shooting is no more or less \u201crandom\u201d than the other shootings and physical assaults in the area that were the product of gang violence, to the extent that gang violence arises from members of one gang targeting another gang at a location where that gang might be found \u2014 or so a reasonable factfinder could find. The shooting was \u201crandom\u201d in the sense that Ayala could have chosen other places to find those same victims, and, from an emotional perspective, certainly must have felt \u201crandom\u201d to the victims and bystanders affected by it, but that does not dictate whether the harm that befell Delgado was reasonably foreseeable to the Zone defendants. A business owner owes a duty to protect its invitees from reasonably foreseeable criminal activity regardless of whether the same crimes are equally likely (or even more likely) to be carried out at some other location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\"> The Rotary defendants contend that \u201c[t]he arguments regarding foreseeability are different with respect to the two respondents. The claim against [the Zone defendants] is based on premises liability, and the allegations in support of that claim differ from the allegations against Rotary, which are based on the alleged existence of a special relationship.\u201d Although we agree in the abstract with the Rotary defendants that there are potential differences in how foreseeability is analyzed with regard to each defendant, the Rotary defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was not based on those differences or on what the Rotary defendants, as opposed to the Zone defendants, knew about prior criminal activity at and around the nightclub. Rather, the basis of their motion was the same as the Zone defendants: that is, the prior criminal acts and violence around The Zone were not sufficient to demonstrate that <em>this shooting </em>was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> Some of the other specifications of negligence by the Rotary defendants, which involve their failure to train host parents, failure to adopt reasonable rules and regulations to ensure student safety and restrict student travel, and failure to warn students and parents of the dangers of high-crime areas, provide a helpful contrast in that respect. For that conduct to expose Delgado to a risk of harm, there are a number of additional contingent steps in play: that, without such training, warning, or rules, the students and host parents would be unable to perceive risks from high-crime areas or ignore those risks; host parents would, in fact, take students into high-crime areas without taking steps to ensure their safety; and that harm would result from that failure. The length of that chain of events might well preclude the conclusion that the harm to Delgado was a foreseeable risk of the particular alleged acts of negligence. However, because the Rotary defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, we need only address whether any of the specifications of negligence presents a viable theory. We discuss the specifications concerning the Rotary defendants\u2019 failure to train, warn, or adopt and enforce rules and regulations only to the extent that they illustrate, by contrast, the direct relationship between the host parents\u2019 alleged knowledge of the dangers and their decision to expose Delgado to that known risk by dropping her off in that area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>EDMONDS, S. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Plaintiff alleges that the Zone defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> negligently caused her decedent\u2019s death on January 24, 2009, by allowing her decedent, a club patron, to stand outside the club in a cordoned-off line of people awaiting entrance into the club. The area where the decedent was standing is in a public area within the City of Portland\u2019s entertainment district in Old Town/Chinatown. Plaintiffs decedent was shot and killed at that location by Erik Ayala, who had no connection or relationship to the club or to the surrounding area. Plaintiff alleges that, \u201cOn the night of the shooting at issue, Erik Ayala went to the Zone nightclub looking to shoot \u2018preppies\u2019 or \u2018pop tweens,\u2019 against whom he may have held a grudge.\u201d But, according to plaintiff, the specific risk of harm to her decedent under the above circumstances was legally foreseeable to the Zone defendants because the risk of a random shooting spree was within the general class of reasonably foreseeable hazards connected with the activity of operating an underage nightclub at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Plaintiffs theory of legal foreseeability is belied by the uniqueness of the above circumstances, as will be developed more fully later in this dissent. However, before discussing the legal import of the above circumstances, it is appropriate to consider the legal standard of review that is accorded to plaintiffs allegations, and the rule of law that governs the legal analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Zone defendants and Rotary defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint under ORCP 21 A on the ground that it failed to state sufficient facts to allege that the risk of harm that resulted in the decedent\u2019s death was reasonably foreseeable by defendants. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motions, resulting in this appeal. The only reasonable inference that could be drawn from the circumstances of the shooting as alleged is that it was a completely random event. Nonetheless, plaintiff attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>classify the shooting as a specific risk of harm resulting in injury to her decedent that is within the scope of a general class of reasonably foreseeable hazards, thus making the resulting harm to the decedent legally foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In support of her theory, plaintiff alleges four general categories of factual circumstances that were allegedly known or should have reasonably been known to the Zone defendants. She makes allegations about the general culture of \u201cunderage nightclubs\u201d; the history of fights and assaults in the line of patrons outside the club; and the history of the excessive use of alcohol and drugs, and gang-related activities within the area. Plaintiff also relies on crime statistics for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, and the early weeks of 2009 for rapes, assaults, robberies, kidnappings, and sex crimes occurring in the downtown neighborhood. According to her allegations, no homicides occurred in the area in 2008 or during the early weeks of January 2009. Three homicides are alleged to have occurred in the neighborhood in 2007 and one homicide in 2006. We do not know from plaintiffs allegations whether those homicides were caused by gunshots. We also do not know from the statistics what assaults or other crimes involved the use of firearms. The \u201cneighborhood\u201d is, according to the allegations, a 52-square-block area within which the entertainment district comprises nine blocks. Additionally, plaintiff alleges two prior instances of shootings within the district, one in 2002 and one in 2005. Pursuant to the applicable standard of review, I assume that plaintiffs allegations are true, and I afford her the benefit of all reasonable inferences that arise therefrom in making the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It is helpful to the analysis to observe what plaintiff does allege and what she does not allege. As to the particular claims of negligence against the Zone defendants, plaintiff alleges a different set of facts than she alleges in support of her allegations concerning legal foreseeability. She alleges that the Zone defendants were negligent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201c(a) In failing to take reasonable measures to protect their customers from the criminal acts of third parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201c(b) In making their customers stand in line in front of the club;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201c(c) In failing to have sufficient security personnel to protect their customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201c(d) In failing to properly train their staff to identify threats to their customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201c(e) In failing to identify [the shooter] as a threat while he was in front of The Zone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c(f) In failing to have adequate emergency response measures in place to protect customers once a threat was identified; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201c(g) In failing to warn their customers or the parents of their customers about the risk of being assaulted while patronizing The Zone nightclub.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">When the allegations of negligence and foreseeability are compared, it is evident that plaintiff does not claim that there were prior instances of random shooting sprees or drive-by shootings of patrons within the entertainment district or at the club prior to January 24, 2009, that are similar to the circumstances of this case and that thereby put the Zone defendants on notice as to a specific risk of harm from a random shooter. (Plaintiff does allege two prior incidents of shooting within the entertainment district, and those allegations will be discussed later in this dissent.) Rather, she can prevail on her claims of negligence only if she demonstrates that the decedent\u2019s death was a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm encompassed within the scope of the general risks of harm that she claims defendants should have anticipated in the exercise of reasonable care. <em>See Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP, </em>336 Or 329, 344, 83 P3d 322 (2004) (rejecting \u201cproximate cause\u201d as a useful inquiry in Oregon tort law).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Identifying the legally proper scope of the general risk of harm that is applicable to the particular circumstances of this case from the allegations of the amended complaint is not an easy task. Plaintiff adopts a diffused rather than a focused approach. That approach is in itself problematic to the analysis, because the more circumstances the description of the general risk of harm encompasses by a proposed definition, the more generalized its scope becomes for purposes of fitting a specific risk of harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>within it that may not reasonably belong in the general harm classification. For example, plaintiffs theory groups crimes of rape, robberies, kidnappings, drugs, other sex crimes, and non-gunshot related assaults and homicides into the same general risk of harm for gun-related assaults and homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In my view, the proper approach is to narrow the scope of general harm to those kinds of crimes that are similar to the circumstances of this crime based on a test of reasonableness. First, that test should consider circumstances as they existed on or about January 2009, at the time of the shooting. Consequently, circumstances that existed in 2005 to 2007, when the last homicides in the district occurred, are of little weight unless they are a part of a pattern that occurred in the past and that continued up to the time of the shooting in this case. Under a test of reasonableness, the crime statistics (by themselves) that plaintiff relies on do not give rise to a reasonable inference that random shooting sprees, or gunshot-related assaults and homicides were a common occurrence or part of a preexisting pattern at the time that the decedent was shot. Indeed, the absence of such allegations could permit a reasonable factfinder to draw the opposing inference. Also, under a test of reasonableness, the other violent criminal activities that plaintiff claims put the Zone defendants on reasonable notice as to the likelihood of a shooting spree are not alleged to have existed at the place and time that the decedent was shot. Finally, even giving plaintiff the benefit of an inference that the Zone defendants\u2019 club was located in a \u201chigh crime\u201d area and that the Zone defendants operated a youth nightclub that provided a forum for excessive alcohol and drug use and fights, none of these kinds of activities are alleged by plaintiff to have specifically contributed in any way to the decedent being shot by a random shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Nonetheless, along with allegations of a \u201cclimate of violence\u201d prior to 2009, plaintiff alleges two prior incidents of shooting within the entertainment district. In one allegation, plaintiff alleges that, \u201c[i]n August 2005, after a string of downtown shootings that left two people dead and four people injured, police blanketed the downtown entertainment district with police officers to ease fear.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>a second allegation, plaintiff alleges: \u201cOn or about July 28, 2002, there was another shooting outside The Zone nightclub. Christopher Lambert shot into a crowd of people standing outside The Zone nightclub striking these people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">I am unpersuaded by plaintiffs argument that the above incidents, together with the allegations concerning the Zone defendants\u2019 youth nightclub operation and its location in the entertainment district, as discussed above, give rise to a permissible inference that the Zone defendants should have reasonably anticipated the kind of harm that befell the decedent. The shooting incidents are remote in time, and any claim of similarity of the incidents to the facts in this case would require a factfinder to speculate. Two shooting incidents and four unspecified homicides over a period of seven years within a 52-square-block area do not establish a pattern of random shooting of bystanders. The earlier shooting incident occurred in 2002; the more recent shooting incident occurred in 2005 (four years before the decedent was shot) and not at the Zone defendants\u2019 location. Indeed, the complaint cites numerous efforts after 2005 by city and police officials and local business owners to combat the criminal activity within the area that separates that time period from 2009. The rule of legal foreseeability of a risk of harm imposes a standard that is based on circumstances that exist on or about the time of the injury to the plaintiff. I would hold that the prior incidents relied on by plaintiff are too remote in time and too qualitatively different to permit a reasonable person to infer any similarity to the circumstances that befell plaintiffs decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Moreover, the allegations of prior shooting incidents are too ambiguous to give rise to a reasonable inference that the risk-creating activity that defendant allegedly engaged in is qualitatively similar to the circumstances of the earlier shootings. According to plaintiffs pleading, the Old Town/ Chinatown neighborhood is comprised of 52 square blocks and the entertainment district covers a nine-block district \u201cwhere many nightclubs and bars are located.\u201d The 2005 incident occurred somewhere in the \u201cdowntown\u201d area. With respect to the shooting outside the club in 2002, plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>allegations do not inform the reader whether the victims were patrons standing in line waiting to get into the club, ordinary bystanders, gang members, or of any other reason for their presence. Also, plaintiffs allegations do not inform the reader whether the 2002 shooter was a random shooter, a gang member, or someone who had an intended victim in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In the final analysis of plaintiffs allegations, she is left to rely on the criminal history of the entertainment district (in which no homicides occurred within the year and weeks preceding the decedent\u2019s death) and on out-of-state experiences with underage nightclubs as the basis for her claim of reasonable foreseeability. In abstract terms, random shooting sprees and gunshot-related homicides could constitute a separate category of general risk of harm, or they could constitute a specific risk within a general class of risk of harm for foreseeability purposes. A hypothetical contrast illustrates the point. Consider a case where a child at a daycare center is playing outside and is shot during a drive-by shooting. An operator of such a daycare center could reasonably anticipate that risk of harm to the child if random drive-by shootings or gunshot homicides occurred in the area on a regular basis. It would follow that the risk of harm to the child could be legally foreseeable because the specific risk to the child is within the general risk of gunshot homicides and random shootings. In contrast to the hypothetical, the alleged circumstances in this case do not involve regular incidents of random or drive-by shootings, or gunshot-related homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In summary, the very tragic specific harm that befell plaintiffs decedent was the result of a random shooter who was mentally ill and who undertook to shoot \u201cpreppies.\u201d The randomness of his criminal target demonstrates that it could have just as well have been committed at a soccer or football game, an outside youth church or synagogue gathering, a mall, a public or private school event, or any place where young people typically gather. Giving plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences, it was a mere happenstance that the shooter chose the line of young people outside the Zone defendant\u2019s club as his target. For purposes of reasonable foreseeability, a specific risk of harm is only within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the scope of a general risk of harm if the specific risk of harm resulting in the injury is qualitatively similar to other foreseeable specific risks of harm that fall within a general risk of harm. That test is not satisfied by plaintiffs allegations. The circumstances of the random shooting spree in this case are unrelated to plaintiffs \u201chigh crime area\u201d allegations. For these reasons, the specific risk of harm from a random shooting spree like the one in this case is not within the general risk of harm alleged by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Plaintiffs allegations against the Rotary defendants suffer from a similar flaw. Plaintiff alleges in substance that the Rotary defendants were negligent because it was reasonably foreseeable that the decedent would be exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm due to the alleged high-crime area in which the club operated and the perils of underage nightclubs. That argument appears to be an argument that no reasonable parent would have permitted their child to attend the underage nightclub for safety reasons. Even if that is not plaintiffs argument, it is difficult to imagine how any parent could have reasonably anticipated the risk of harm from a random shooter. Additionally, whatever reasonably anticipated risks of harm (harm from alcohol, drugs, or fights) existed, plaintiffs decedent was not killed as the result of one of those risks. Rather, she was randomly killed as the result of a harm that no reasonable parent could have anticipated or prevented. The analysis regarding whether the specific harm that befell the decedent is within the scope of reasonably anticipated general harms applies equally to the Rotary defendants, and I would affirm the trial court on the rulings as to both sets of defendants for these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Finally, this case has important policy implications. The majority\u2019s conclusion effectively implies that the highly-policed nine-block entertainment district within the largest city in Oregon was a dangerous place subject to ongoing criminal violence against ordinary citizens in 2009 and that business operators, by operating their businesses within that district, risked injury to their patrons because of random criminal activities of third parties who were not within the operators\u2019 control. In defining what constitutes a general class of harm for foreseeability purposes, the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>opinion expands the concept of general risk of harm far beyond the practical realities of what business operators, parents, and <em>de facto </em>guardians should reasonably anticipate as risks of harm. In the end, the expansiveness of the majority\u2019s holding regarding the general class of risk of harm turns the policy that actionable negligence must be based on reasonable foreseeability on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">I dissent for these reasons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> On appeal, there are two sets of defendants: the operators of the underage nightclub, who will hereafter be referred to as the \u201cZone defendants,\u201d and the defendants who were connected with the Rotary Exchange program of which decedent was a part, who are referred to in the opinion as the \u201cRotary defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
