Having reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered husband to pay stepped-down spousal support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the court erred in not reducing husband\u2019s life insurance obligation, commensurate with the decrease in spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The parties divorced in 2008. Among other things, the dissolution judgment required husband to pay wife $1,250 per month in support indefinitely and to maintain a $240,000 life insurance policy to secure his spousal support obligation, with that obligation reducing at the rate of $15,000 per year. After husband retired, his income decreased, and he filed a motion to terminate or modify the obligation. The court ordered husband to pay stepped-down support for three years, after which his obligation would terminate. Though requested, the court did not modify the original judgment\u2019s life insurance requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s order to determine if it \u201creflect[s] the exercise of discretion under the correct methodology\u201d and if it lies \u201cwithin the range of legally permissible outcomes.\u201d <em>Olson and Olson, </em>218 Or App 1, 16, 178 P3d 272 (2008). ORS 107.810 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">\u201cIt is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage persons obligated to support other persons as the result of a dissolution * * * of marriage * * * to obtain or cooperate in the obtaining of life insurance adequate to provide for the continued support of those persons in the event of the obligor\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Here, husband\u2019s spousal support obligation will decrease and then cease in three years, yet the life insurance he has been required to maintain is meant to secure a larger indefinite award. As the statute requires life insurance \u201cadequate to provide for the continued support * * * in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>of the obligor\u2019s death,\u201d the life insurance obligation must be commensurate with the ordered spousal support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the trial court did not adjust husband\u2019s life insurance obligation when it adjusted the spousal support downward, its decision did not \u201clie within the range of legally permissible outcomes.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>218 Or App at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Supplemental judgment reversed and remanded to modify husband\u2019s life insurance obligation; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-9\"> We reject husband\u2019s third assignment of error without written discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-5\"> We also note that the life insurance requirement, without adjustment by the trial court, awards wife a large windfall in the event of husband\u2019s death, which is antithetical to the public policy underlying ORS 107.810.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
