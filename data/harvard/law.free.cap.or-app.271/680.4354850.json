We conclude that LUBA properly understood and applied the correct standard of review and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">A detailed recitation of the facts of this case is unnecessary for purposes of explaining our decision. Petitioner owns property within the City of St. Helens that is zoned \u201cApartment Residential\u201d (AR) or \u201cGeneral Residential\u201d (R5). A significant part of the property is a camas basalt bluff, which sits at a much higher grade than the surrounding property. Petitioner proposed to remove the basalt bluff as well as basalt below the grade of the surrounding property, and to then add fill that would level the property for the development of duplexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Because petitioner\u2019s proposal would have required removal of rock within a protected wetland area, petitioner applied for a sensitive lands permit. The city denied the permit on the alternative grounds that (1) petitioner\u2019s proposed excavation constituted \u201cnatural mineral resources development\u201d under the city\u2019s code, which was not allowed in the AR or R5 zones, and (2) even if the excavation of basalt was not \u201cnatural mineral resources development,\u201d it nevertheless was not a \u201clisted\u201d use in AR or R5 zones and did not meet the criteria for approval as an unlisted use. LUBA affirmed the city\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On judicial review, petitioner argues that LUBA erred in various respects by approving the city\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s permit application. To the extent that petitioner\u2019s arguments are directed at LUBA\u2019s view of the evidence, including evidence that petitioner would be engaged in \u201cmining,\u201d those arguments fail under our standard of review. As we explained in <em>Stevens v. City of Island City, </em>260 Or App 768, 772, 324 P3d 477 (2014), our role on review is limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing a land use decision, LUBA may reverse or remand the local government\u2019s decision if the decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>based on facts that are \u2018not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.\u2019 ORS 197.835(9)(a)(C). If, viewing the record as a whole, a reasonable person could make the disputed factual finding, then the finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wetherell v. Douglas County, </em>209 Or App 1, 4, 146 P3d 343 (2006) (citing <em>Younger v. City of Portland, </em>305 Or 346, 360, 752 P2d 262 (1988)). So long as that standard is met, LUBA cannot substitute its view of the evidence for that of the local government. <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. Marion County, </em>116 Or App 584, 587, 842 P2d 441 (1992) (citing <em>Younger, </em>305 Or at 360).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u201cOur role on judicial review of LUBA\u2019s order is even more circumscribed: We examine whether LUBA has applied the proper substantial-evidence standard of review. <em>Citizens for Responsibility v. Lane County, </em>218 Or App 339, 344, 180 P3d 35 (2008). \u2018[W]here LUBA has properly understood and applied the \u201csubstantial [-] evidence\u201d test * * *, a reviewing court should affirm its order, notwithstanding the reviewing court\u2019s disagreement with LUBA as to whether the evidence is \u201csubstantial.\u201d\u2019 <em>Younger, </em>305 Or at 358-59. Thus, where LUBA properly articulates its substantial-evidence standard of review under ORS 197.835(9)(a)(C), we will not reverse its determination unless there is no evidence to support the finding or if the evidence in the case is \u2018so at odds with LUBA\u2019s evaluation that a reviewing court could infer that LUBA had misunderstood or misapplied its scope of review.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 359.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In this case, LUBA correctly articulated the substantial-evidence standard of review, and we are not persuaded that LUBA misunderstood or misapplied that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Petitioner also challenges LUBA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cnatural mineral resources development,\u201d as used in the city code, to include petitioner\u2019s proposed excavation of basalt. We are inclined to agree with LUBA\u2019s interpretation; however, we need not conclusively resolve that question because LUBA affirmed the city\u2019s denial on an alternative and independent ground. LUBA explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201c[T]he planning commission also adopted an alternative finding * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201c\u2018In the alternative, assuming that the applicant\u2019s proposed blasting and removal of 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards of camas basalt is not properly classified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>as natural mineral resources development within the scope of [St. Helens Municipal Code] 17.32.140(2)(i), the Planning Commission has reviewed the lists of uses allowed in the R-5 and AR zones, and finds that the proposed blasting and extraction of rock and gravel is not on those lists.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cThe above alternative finding is an adequate basis, by itself, for the planning commission to deny the Proposal, without regard to whether the planning commission correctly found the Proposal qualifies as \u2018natural mineral resources development.\u2019 The above alternative finding is that even if the Proposal is accurately characterized as rock removal that does not for some reason also qualify as \u2018natural mineral resources development,\u2019 rock removal of the volume and scope proposed in the Proposal is not a use that is allowed in the AR or R5 zone. The alternative finding is adequate and supported by substantial evidence, and requires that we affirm the city\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Petitioner does not present a developed or coherent challenge to that part of LUBA\u2019s decision, so provides no ground for us to reverse LUBA\u2019s alternative basis for affirming the city\u2019s decision. <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh'd to as clarified on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (\u201c[I]t is not this court\u2019s function to speculate as to what a party\u2019s argument might be. Nor is it our proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself.\u201d). Because we affirm LUBA\u2019s alternative and independent basis for its decision, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether LUBA correctly interpreted the term \u201cnatural mineral resources development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In affirming LUBA\u2019s decision, we observe, as did LUBA, that nothing in the city\u2019s decision precludes petitioner from seeking to develop its property under a different proposal. LUBA explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cWe have no reason to believe the planning commission would not agree with petitioner that a more modest proposal to remove only as much rock as necessary to permit reasonable and functional access to the developable portions of the top of the bluff that complies with city street grade and ADA requirements, along with additional excavation and grading of the top of the bluff as necessary to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>utilities and residential construction, is properly viewed a part of such residential development rather than a basalt mine. But the Proposal goes considerably beyond what the city might be obligated to view as simply the grading and excavation necessary to permit residential development of the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Although petitioner has less confidence in the feasibility of\u2014 and the city\u2019s receptiveness to \u2014 a \u201cmore modest proposal,\u201d we agree with LUBA that nothing in this case prevents petitioner from pursuing such a proposal in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
