Petitioner raises two assignments of error; we write only to address petitioner\u2019s contention that the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment does not comply with ORS 138.640 and conclude that petitioner is correct. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">ORS 138.640(1) requires that a judgment granting or denying post-conviction relief \u201cmust clearly state the grounds on which the case was determined, and whether a state or federal question was presented and decided.\u201d To comply with the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201ca judgment denying claims for post-conviction relief must, at a minimum: (1) identify the claims for relief that the court considered and make separate rulings on each claim; (2) declare, with regard to each claim, whether the denial is based on a petitioner\u2019s failure to utilize or follow available state procedures or a failure to establish the merits of the claim; and (3) make the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\"><em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 685, 227 P3d 714 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The post-conviction court\u2019s judgment fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1). Although the judgment complies with the <em>Datt </em>factors for the first and third claims, it fails the third prong of <em>Datt </em>in that it does not clearly state the legal bases for the court\u2019s denial of the second and fourth claims for relief. As to the second claim for prosecutorial misconduct, the judgment addresses only one of several items of evidence that petitioner alleges were withheld as discovery violations, and omits mention of the rest. As to the fourth claim for general due process violations, likewise, the judgment addresses only a subset of the denials of due process alleged and omits mention of the rest. Accordingly, the judgment is not sufficient to \u201cmake the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Because the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment in this case fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), we reverse and remand for the court to enter a judgment in compliance with the statute. <em>See Walker v. State of Oregon, </em>256 Or App 697, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>700, 302 P3d 469 (2013) (when a judgment fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), as elucidated in <em>Datt, </em>the judgment is \u201cfatally deficient\u201d in that regard and \u201cwe must reverse and remand for the court to enter a judgment that includes findings complying with ORS 138.640(1)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
