Defendant argues that the officer violated Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution when he decided to run defendant\u2019s license plate. The trial court denied the motion on the basis of our decision in <em>State v. Davis, </em>237 Or App 351, 239 P3d 1002 (2010), <em>aff\u2019d by an equally divided court, </em>353 Or 166, 295 P3d 617 (2013), and we agree that <em>Davis </em>is dispositive. In <em>Davis, </em>we affirmed a trial court\u2019s determination that the officer\u2019s decision to run a \u201crandom\u201d license plate check did not violate Article I, section 20, because the evidence permitted an inference that the officer\u2019s decision \u201cwas the result of a confluence of training, time, and opportunity[,]\u201d and that <em>\u201cany </em>driver\u201d the officer encountered under similar circumstances \u201cwould have been subject to the same scrutiny.\u201d 237 Or App at 360-61 (emphasis in original). The evidence here permitted the same inference, and we affirm. <em>See also State v. Savastano, </em>354 Or 64, 96, 309 P3d 1083 (2013) (an individual-based claim under Article I, section 20, requires an initial showing that the government \u201cfin fact denied defendant individually * * * [an] equal privilege * * * with other citizens of the state similarly situated.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Clark, </em>291 Or 231, 243, 630 P2d 810, <em>cert den, </em>454 US 1084 (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
