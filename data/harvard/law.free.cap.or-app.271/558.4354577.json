Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence of intoxication, arguing that the evidence was obtained during an unlawful traffic stop, and the trial court denied the motion. During the suppression hearing, the trial court refused to allow into evidence a Final Order Dismissing Suspension for Refusing a Breath Test that was issued by the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV), which contains findings regarding the circumstances of the stop at issue in the motion to suppress. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the exclusion of that DMV order, emphasizing that the rules of evidence do not apply to preliminary hearings and that the administrative order was probative of the credibility of one of the arresting officers. We conclude that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the DMV order, but we also conclude that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Officers Ginnow and Fender arrested defendant for DUII based on observations they made after stopping defendant for speeding. Following the arrest, defendant refused to submit to a breath test, and the DMV held a hearing to determine if his driver\u2019s license should be suspended for that refusal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the breath test request flowed from the officer\u2019s observations during the traffic stop, one of the issues at the suspension hearing was the validity of the stop. The excluded DMV order reflects findings by the administrative law judge (ALJ) that the seven-block stretch of road along which defendant was allegedly speeding \u201chas at least four large speed bumps\u201d and that Ginnow\u2019s testimony that defendant was traveling at least 60 miles per hour was \u201cimplausible.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In explaining that credibility assessment, the administrative order recites, \u201cIn this matter, Officer Ginnow testified that there were no speed bumps between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>79th and 72nd Avenue on Crystal Springs where he followed Petitioner. He then later testified he did not recall any speed bumps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Fender testified that the road stretch contained speed bumps, and Ginnow again testified that defendant\u2019s speed was at least 60 miles per hour. Defense counsel sought to admit a copy of the AL J\u2019s order, arguing that it was relevant because \u201cit contains statements that Officer Ginnow made.\u201d The trial court disagreed, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the opinion of an administrative law judge has any relevance to the fact finding and decision-making I have to make here[.]\u201d That is the ruling to which defendant assigns error, renewing his argument that the DMV order was relevant for impeachment because it \u201ccontained statements that Ginnow made during the DMV hearing which contradicted his testimony at the suppression hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Defendant first emphasizes \u2014 correctly\u2014that the rules of evidence do not apply in suppression hearings. OEC 104(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cPreliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court ***. In making its determination the court is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">That exception is echoed by OEC 101(4)(a), which specifies that the evidence code (apart from the rules governing privileges) does not apply to \u201c[t]he determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court under [OEC 104].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A hearing on a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case is a hearing involving a preliminary question concerning evidence within the meaning of OEC 101(4)(a) and OEC 104(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and is not governed by the rules of evidence. <em>State v. Wright, </em>315 Or 124, 129, 843 P2d 436 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In excluding the DMV order, the trial court described the \u201copinion\u201d of the ALJ as not relevant to the \u201cfact finding and decision-making\u201d task of the trial court at the suppression hearing. To the extent the trial court meant that the AL J\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d regarding credibility and probable cause had no bearing on how the trial court decided those issues, defendant does not disagree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But defendant sought to admit the order because it describes prior statements that Ginnow made regarding pertinent facts. Although the trial court would have been free to give that evidence little or even no weight in assessing Ginnow\u2019s credibility, the court should have admitted and considered the offered evidence at the suppression hearing and then determined what weight to afford it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The state argues, however, that the error in this case was harmless, and we agree. In <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003), the Supreme Court explained that a defendant\u2019s conviction must be affirmed, despite the error, if there is \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the error affected the verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the erroneous exclusion of evidence required reversal of the judgment because the excluded evidence was \u201cqualitatively different than\u201d and not \u201cmerely cumulative of\u2019 other, admitted evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Applying that standard, we have held that the exclusion of evidence was \u201cunlikely to have affected the verdict\u201d when the excluded evidence was not \u201cdifferent in nature\u201d from admitted evidence. <em>State v. Klein, </em>243 Or App 1, 15, 258 P3d 528 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>352 Or 302, 283 P3d 350 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Here, too, the DMV order was not \u201cdifferent in nature\u201d from admitted evidence. According to defendant, the significance of the DMV order was that it \u201ccontained statements that Ginnow made during the DMV hearing which contradicted his testimony at the suppression hearing [,]\u201d and identified the contradictory statements as Ginnow\u2019s testimony during the DMV hearing about the absence of speed bumps on Crystal Springs Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">However, defendant introduced the same evidence through Ginnow\u2019s admissions during cross-examination at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL: At the license suspension hearing], you testified that there were no speed bumps between 79th and Crystal Springs and 72nd and Crystal Springs, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201c[GINNOW]: I didn\u2019t recall at that time, yes. I\u2019m not sure of my exact testimony. I\u2019m sure you have it. But no, I did not remember there were speed bumps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Well, did you tell the administrative law judge at first that there were no speed bumps and then \u2014 well, actually, you couldn\u2019t remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201c [GINNOW]: I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you receive a copy of the order from the administrative law judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201c[GINNOW]: I did.

The actual DMV order would not have provided \u201cqualitatively different\u201d evidence on that point, and defendant does not identify any other reason why the trial court should have considered the DMV order. The court\u2019s error in refusing to admit the DMV order is not a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> ORS 813.100 provides that drivers in Oregon are \u201cdeemed to have given consent\u201d to a breath test upon an arrest for DUII and that a driver\u2019s driving privileges are subject to suspension if the driver refuses consent or has a blood alcohol level that constitutes being under the influence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> We granted defendant\u2019s motion to add the DMV order to the appellate record as an \u201coffer of proof only.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> OEC 101(4) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201c[OEC 100 to 412] and [OEC 601 to 1008] do not apply in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201c(a) The determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court under [OEC 104].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The privilege rules are set out at OEC 503 to 514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> Defendant emphasized below that he was not suggesting the trial court was \u201ccollaterally estopped\u201d from deciding the issue anew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> <em>Davis </em>interpreted Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cIf the supreme court shall be of opinion, after consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">ORS 138.230 similarly provides that, in criminal cases, \u201cAfter hearing the appeal, the court shall give judgment, without regard to * * * defects or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
