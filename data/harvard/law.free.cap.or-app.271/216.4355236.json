(MPP),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seek review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board that found MPP responsible for claimant\u2019s 2011 shoulder condition as a consequential condition of claimant\u2019s 2006 shoulder injury at MPP. MPP contends that the board erred by refusing to apply the last injurious exposure rule (LIER) to shift responsibility for the admittedly work-related shoulder condition to a later employer. MPP also contends that the board erred in concluding that claimant\u2019s compensable injury was the major contributing cause of his 2011 shoulder condition. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s 2006 injury was the major contributing cause of his full rotator cuff tear and that, based on that finding, the board properly classified the claim as a consequential condition for which MPP is liable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We state the facts consistently with the board\u2019s unchallenged factual findings. <em>Sparling v. Providence Health System </em>Oregon, 258 Or App 275, 276, 308 P3d 1103 (2013). Claimant, who worked for MPP as a pipefitter, suffered a workplace injury in November 2006, which SAIF accepted as a \u201cright shoulder strain.\u201d In March 2007, Dr. Sedgewick performed surgery on claimant\u2019s right shoulder, during which he diagnosed \u201cimpingement and partial tear of the rotator cuff\u2019 and performed \u201carthroscopic subacromial decompression.\u201d He described the partial rotator cuff tear as it existed at the time of surgery as a \u201c25% tearing.\u201d After the surgery, claimant worked as a pipefitter for two subsequent employers \u2014 McKinstry Company and Harder Mechanical.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The pipe-fitting work was physically demanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Claimant began to experience increasing discomfort in his right shoulder. In April 2011, he returned to Sedgewick, and an MRI revealed a full thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Claimant filed a new or omitted condition claim with MPP for his right rotator cuff tear with impingement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and SAIF denied responsibility for the claim. Claimant then filed an occupational disease claim for the condition with employers McKinstry Company, also insured by SAIF, and Harder Mechanical, insured by Sedgwick.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those employers also denied the claims, on the basis of responsibility only. Claimant requested a hearing on all three denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the November 2006 injury at MPP was the cause of claimant\u2019s partial thickness rotator cuff tear and impingement and that the partial tear, in turn, was the \u201cdirect and major contributing cause\u201d of the full thickness rotator cuff tear and impingement. The ALJ also rejected MPP\u2019s attempt to shift responsibility to one of the later employers under the LIER, reasoning that the rule does not apply when \u201cactual causation\u201d has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determinations that the 2006 injury was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s 2011 right shoulder condition and, thus, that the full thickness rotator cuff tear and impingement is a consequential condition of the compensable 2006 injury. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board also concluded that the claim was \u201cmost appropriately characterized as a consequential condition claim\u201d and that the LIER, therefore, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We first consider MPP\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s 2006 injury at MPP was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s full thickness rotator cuff tear and impingement. We review the board\u2019s challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>factual findings for substantial evidence and substantial reason. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8); <em>SAIF v. Martinez, </em>219 Or App 182, 184, 182 P3d 873 (2008) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In finding that the 2006 injury was the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s condition, the board relied on the opinion of Sedgewick as well as the opinions of Dr. Puziss, an orthopedic surgeon who examined claimant and reviewed his records, and Dr. Keizer, who examined claimant on behalf of the insurers. Sedgewick opined that the November 2006 injury was the major cause of the \u201cpartial tear and impingement,\u201d and that the partial tear progressed to the full thickness tear, which was also caused in major part by the 2006 work injury. Keizer also opined that \u201cthe major contributing cause of the full thickness tear and need for treatment\u201d was the November 2006 injury, explaining that the partial tear \u201cfailed to heal\u201d and \u201cthe full thickness tear developed as a direct consequence of the partial tear resulting from the 2006 injury.\u201d Similarly, Puziss opined that the 2006 injury was the major contributing cause of the full thickness tear and impingement, because the partial tear \u201cnever healed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board determined that, based on the \u201cpersuasive opinions\u201d of those three medical experts, there was sufficient evidence in the record to establish that the partial thickness tear was compensably related to the 2006 injury and was the major contributing cause of the full thickness rotator cuff tear and impingement. That finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">MPP, nevertheless, urges us to declare the three medical opinions \u201clegally insufficient\u201d because \u201cthe expression \u2018major contributing cause\u2019 has a very specific meaning under the workers\u2019 compensation law\u201d and, \u201c[a]bsent some confirmation that the doctor understood the legally correct meaning of the expression, then the doctor\u2019s opinion is inherently ambiguous and legally insufficient for a lay fact-finder to find major contributing cause.\u201d We have repeatedly held, however, that there are no \u201cmagic words\u201d required for an expert to express a \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d opinion. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>e.g., Freightliner Corp. v. Arnold, </em>142 Or App 98, 104-05, 919 P2d 1192 (1996) (citing <em>McClendon v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., </em>77 Or App 412, 417, 713 P2d 647 (1986)). Rather, we allow the board to \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from the medical evidence[.]\u201d <em>Benz v. SAIF, </em>170 Or App 22, 26, 11 P3d 698 (2000); <em>see also O\u2019Connor v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>232 Or App 419, 425, 222 P3d 1097 (2009) (stating that we accept the board\u2019s interpretation of medical evidence if \u201c\u2018the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding\u2019\u201d (quoting ORS 183.482(8)(c))).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Thus, while \u201cdetermining the \u2018major contributing cause\u2019 involves evaluating the relative contribution of different causes of an injury or disease,\u201d we have made it clear that the board may infer from context that an expert engaged in this weighing process. <em>Dietz v. Ramuda, </em>130 Or App 397, 401, 882 P2d 618 (1994), <em>rev dismissed, </em>321 Or 416 (1995); <em>see also Allied Waste Industries, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>203 Or App 512, 520, 125 P3d 794 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 80 (2006) <em>(Crawford). </em>In <em>Crawford, </em>the ALJ and board credited an expert opinion that did not <em>\u201cexplicitly </em>assess or weigh the relative contribution of all of the potential causes [.]\u201d 203 Or App at 522 (emphasis added). We affirmed, concluding that the board could reasonably infer from the context of the expert opinion that the expert \u201cdid weigh the relative contributions of the work incident and the other contributing causes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Here, each medical opinion on which the board relied explicitly states that the doctor took into account the contribution of subsequent work to the worsening of claimant\u2019s rotator cuff tear and concluded that the original partial tear, which never healed, was the major contributing cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is nothing unreasonable about the board\u2019s inference that the doctors in fact weighed the relative contribution of the later work exposure against the contribution of the partial tear from the 2006 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>MPP\u2019s primary argument is that, even if claimant\u2019s full thickness rotator cuff tear was caused in major part by the 2006 injury at MPP, the board should have applied the LIER and assigned responsibility to a later employer. The LIER is a judicially created rule that is \u201cboth a rule of proof and a rule of assignment of responsibility.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Hoffman, </em>193 Or App 750, 753, 91 P3d 812 (2004) (citing <em>Willamette Industries, Inc. v. Titus, </em>151 Or App 76, 80, 950 P2d 318 (1997)). As a rule of proof, the LIER allows a claimant to prove that a disease is compensable because it is caused by work exposure generally, \u201cwithout having to prove the degree, if any, to which exposure to disease-causing conditions at a particular employment actually caused the disease.\u201d <em>Roseburg Forest Products v. Long, </em>325 Or 305, 309, 937 P2d 517 (1997). \u201cAs a rule of assignment of responsibility, the last injurious exposure rule assigns full responsibility to the last employer that could have caused the claimant\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Our cases have emphasized that, when a claimant brings a consequential condition claim, and the board finds a claimant\u2019s condition compensable as a consequential condition of a previously accepted injury, then liability is to be assigned to that employer under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A), rather than according to one of the judicially created rules for assigning responsibility among multiple employers. <em>See SAIF v. Webb, </em>181 Or App 205, 211, 45 P3d 950 (2002) (rejecting suggestion that responsibility for claimant\u2019s condition should be determined under a judicially created rule\u2014 analogous to the LIER \u2014 for assigning responsibility among multiple employers, because proof that the claimant\u2019s condition was caused in major part by an injury at a specific prior employer meant that employer was liable under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A) for the consequential condition); <em>Garoutte v. Mail Well Corp., </em>200 Or App 507, 513, 115 P3d 957 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (describing <em>Webb </em>as declining to apply the LIER upon proof that a prior compensable injury was the major contributing cause of the condition). In <em>Waste Management v. Pruitt, </em>224 Or App 280, 285-86, 198 P3d 429 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 66 (2009), we affirmed the board\u2019s assignment of responsibility for the claimant\u2019s arthritic knee condition under the LIER to the last employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>that could have contributed to the condition. Despite the last employer\u2019s effort to defensively point to a prior injury at a nonjoined employer as the major contributing cause of the claimant\u2019s condition, we concluded that the board found the claimant\u2019s condition was most appropriately characterized as an occupational disease caused by \u201c\u2018treatment of the [prior] injury <em>and subsequent factors </em>[.] \u2019 \u201d <em>Pruitt, </em>224 Or App at 285-86 (quoting board\u2019s order; emphasis in <em>Pruitt).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Although MPP suggests that the workers\u2019 compensation bar is confused about when to follow <em>Pruitt </em>and when to follow <em>Webb </em>in assigning responsibility, the board\u2019s decision reflects a correct understanding of the analytical framework described in both cases. As we emphasized in <em>Pruitt,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201c[b]ecause the board found that claimant\u2019s condition is properly considered as an occupational disease, and not as a consequential condition, <em>see DiBrito v. SAIF, </em>319 Or 244, 248, 875 P2d 459 (1994) (the board\u2019s first task is to determine which provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law are applicable), and because the board\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, we conclude that the board properly applied the last injurious exposure rule[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 286. Here, the board found that claimant\u2019s full rotator cuff tear is \u201cmost appropriately characterized as a consequential condition claim\u201d caused in major part by his 2006 injury at MPP. The finding that the 2006 injury is the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s condition is supported by substantial evidence, as described above, and the board, based on that finding, correctly assigned liability according to the rules specified by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The board\u2019s approach is required by the framework the legislature has specified for assigning responsibility in the context of a consequential condition:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201c(A) No injury or disease is compensable as a consequence of a compensable injury unless the compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the consequential condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c(B) If an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">ORS 656.005(7)(a). Legislative history shows that the limitations on the definition of \u201ccompensable injury\u201d were added by the 1990 legislature with the intent \u201cto make it more difficult to shift responsibility to a subsequent employer.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Drews, </em>318 Or 1, 7, 860 P2d 254 (1993). <em>Drews </em>emphasizes statements of Representative Mannix during a public hearing of the 1990 Joint Interim Special Committee on Workers\u2019 Compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\"><em>\u2018\u201c[T]his will do away with the current court interpretations of what is a new injury for responsibility purposes. </em>Do you hear that, judges on the Court of Appeals, members of the Board, when you read the transcript of this hearing? This does away with what they\u2019ve been saying, which is if the subsequent employment contributed however slightly to the causation of the disabling condition, then all of that \u2014 I won\u2019t even go into all the standards that are there and you know that they are there. This says that there\u2019s going to have to be a new compensable injury and <em>this bill defines compensable injury </em>and so <em>if there isn\u2019t a new compensable injury under the definition of the law, then responsibility remains with the first employer\u201d\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-8 (quoting Joint Interim Special Committee on Workers\u2019 Compensation, May 4, 1990, Tape 18, Side A) (emphases in <em>Drews).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">MPP, nevertheless, argues that the LIER applies to shift responsibility in a way not contemplated by the legislature, <em>i.e., </em>to shift responsibility for claimant\u2019s full thickness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>rotator cuff tear to a later employer upon proof that work at the later employer partially contributed to progression from a partial to a full thickness tear. MPP relies on cases in which we have recited the general proposition that, \u201c[i]f a claimant chooses not to rely on LIER\u2019s rule of proof and instead to prove that conditions at a particular employer actually caused the disease, that employer can defensively invoke LIER to shift responsibility to a subsequent employer.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>193 Or App at 753 (citing <em>Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>151 Or App at 81).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The board correctly recognized that the general proposition recited in <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>does not apply when it has determined that the disputed condition is most appropriately considered \u2014 as in <em>Webb </em>\u2014 a consequential condition caused in major part by a prior compensable injury. <em>See DiBrito, </em>319 Or at 248 (\u201c[T]he Board\u2019s first task is to determine which provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law are applicable.\u201d). Neither <em>Hoffman </em>nor <em>Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>addressed a consequential condition claim. Moreover, neither applies the judicially created rule of responsibility to override the statutory rules of liability for consequential conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The board\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s 2006 injury was the major contributing cause of the full rotator cuff tear with impingement \u2014 a finding we already have determined is supported by substantial evidence \u2014 means that claimant\u2019s later work activity could not have been the major contributing cause. Under the framework established by the legislature, the board appropriately classified the claim as a consequential condition for which MPP is liable and appropriately declined to assign liability according to the LIER.
