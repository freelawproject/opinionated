He argues further that the post-conviction court therefore erred by dismissing the petition as untimely. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In support of his claim that he alleged sufficient facts to invoke the escape clause, petitioner points to his allegations that (1) his criminal trial lawyer misled him into thinking that he could not file for post-conviction relief at all; and (2) by the time petitioner determined that he could seek post-conviction relief, the two-year period had almost expired and petitioner was incarcerated in Pennsylvania without access to a notary. He argues that those allegations compel the conclusion that he could not reasonably have raised his grounds for relief in a timely-filed petition because, in his view, they compel the conclusion that petitioner was \u201cphysically prevented from complying with the statutory time limit due to his incarceration and lack of access to a notary\u201d at the time the petition was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">To the extent that petitioner argues that the alleged inaccurate advice from his criminal trial lawyer is sufficient to entitle him to invoke the escape clause, that argument is foreclosed by <em>Brown v. Baldwin, </em>131 Or App 356, 361, 885 P2d 707 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 507 (1995). There, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>that a lawyer\u2019s \u201cactive misrepresentation\u201d about the time-lines for seeking post-conviction relief did not excuse the petitioner\u2019s untimely filing under the escape clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Further, we disagree that the allegations on which petitioner relies demonstrate that petitioner was \u201cphysically prevented\u201d from timely filing the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, petitioner\u2019s allegations affirmatively demonstrate that he was able to work on his post-conviction petitions while he was incarcerated in Pennsylvania, and he \u201chad all the post-conviction paperwork sent to me from Oregon.\u201d Although ORS 138.580 establishes that facts alleged in a petition for post-conviction relief \u201cmust be sworn to affirmatively as true and correct,\u201d nothing in the applicable statutes or rules requires that the petition or any supporting documentation be notarized. <em>See </em>ORCP 1 E (allowing for a signed declaration under penalty of perjury in lieu of an affidavit); UTCR 2.120 (providing that affidavits \u201cneed not be notarized\u201d). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s allegations that he was incarcerated without access to a notary are insufficient, as a matter of law, to permit the inference that he was \u201cphysically prevented\u201d from filing his petition within the two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> Petitioner did not appeal the judgment of conviction. As a result, he was required to file for post-conviction relief within two years of \u201cthe date the judgment or order on the conviction was entered in the register\u201d of the trial court. ORS 138.510(3)(a). Had petitioner appealed, the two-year period for seeking post-conviction relief would not have started to run until the completion of the appellate process. ORS 138.510(3)(b), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\"> Defendant also argues that the escape clause, as it has been interpreted by this court and the Supreme Court, would not excuse petitioner\u2019s untimeliness even if petitioner\u2019s allegations were sufficient to establish that he was physically prevented from timely filing the petition. Because we conclude that petitioner\u2019s allegations do not establish that he was physically prevented from timely filing the petition, we do not address that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
