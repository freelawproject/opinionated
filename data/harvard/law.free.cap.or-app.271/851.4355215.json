Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that the victim\u2019s use of force against defendant was lawful if the victim reasonably believed that defendant was committing a criminal trespass (a defense of premises instruction). At trial, defendant raised a self-defense theory and the trial court instructed the jury accordingly. In his view, giving a defense of premises instruction was error because <em>State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 194, 218 P3d 1281 (2009), and <em>State v. Carlon, </em>265 Or App 390, 397, 335 P3d 343 (2014), together hold that instructing the jury to consider the lawfulness of the victim\u2019s use of force in defense of premises inserts irrelevant issues into the jury\u2019s deliberations regarding a defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. That is, the defense of premises instruction impermissibly shifted the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s perspective (whether <em>defendant </em>reasonably believed that the victim unlawfully used force against him) to the victim\u2019s perspective (whether the <em>victim </em>reasonably believed that he lawfully used force). <em>See Oliphant, </em>347 Or at 194 (the defendant \u201chad a right to have the jury consider the circumstances surrounding the event from his own point of view\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The state agrees that <em>Oliphant </em>and <em>Carlon </em>are dis-positive here and concedes that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on defense of premises. We accept the state\u2019s concession and conclude that the instructional error is not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
