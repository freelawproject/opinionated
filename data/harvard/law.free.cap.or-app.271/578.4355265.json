Under the board\u2019s rule, the petition for an interim hearing must include a copy of certain documents, including a copy of the inmate\u2019s \u201cSpending Account,\u201d or the petition will be denied. OAR 255-062-0021(2)(c)(C); OAR 255-062-0021(2)00. According to petitioner, the board violated his constitutional rights by considering his Spending Account and relying on \u201cthe circumstances surrounding his financial standing\u201d to deny his petition for an interim hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">To the extent that petitioner argues that OAR 255-062-0021(2)(c)(C) can be applied unconstitutionally in particular circumstances, such a challenge is not authorized under ORS 183.400. <em>See AFSCME Local 2623 v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>315 Or 74, 79, 843 P2d 409 (1992) (explaining that ORS 183.400 authorizes only facial challenges to agency rules; \u201cthe legality of any particular application of the rules is premature, and not subject to review under ORS 183.400\u201d). Petitioner does not sufficiently develop any argument as to why the rule is <em>facially </em>invalid, and we therefore reject his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">OAR 255-062-0021(2)(c)(C) held valid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
