On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) awarded damages to the defendant for emotional distress for abuse of process, (2) awarded treble emotional distress damages, and (3) held that the plaintiff failed to prove his affirmative defense that he acted on the advice of legal counsel. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court or undisputed in the record, and procedural history are relevant to our review. \"It began ... with an ill conceived but straightforward complaint by [the plaintiff] that [the defendant] had 'falsely and maliciously accused [him] of creating a public disturbance ... [an infraction] of which [she] knew he was innocent.' That accusation, the complaint went on to allege, caused him to be arrested and charged with that offense and to suffer damage to his reputation and extreme emotional\n   distress. The complaint correctly alleged further that the charge was subsequently nolled. This alleged conduct by [the defendant] gave rise to four counts in the complaint, namely, malicious prosecution (count one), slander (count two), and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress (counts three and four).\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This alleged malicious prosecution arose from events occurring in the early morning of January 3, 2008. The defendant had called the Berlin Police Department to complain about lights shining into her bedroom window from the rear of the plaintiff's house. Sergeant Chris Tralli and Officers Ryan Gould and Brian Falco of the Belin Police Department responded to the call. Although the plaintiff alleges that the lights in question were Christmas lights, upon arrival at the plaintiff's house, Officer Falco noted that \"[t]he light in question was on the second story deck on the rear of [the plaintiff's] house and looked to be a blue LED strobe light similar to lights used in [vehicles] of volunteer firemen. The light was angled directly at [the defendant's] house and appeared to be done so deliberately.\" This was not the first time that the police had responded to a complaint about this light and had ordered the plaintiff to turn it off. Consequently, the plaintiff was issued an infraction ticket for creating a public disturbance. It was on the basis of receiving this infraction ticket that the plaintiff claimed that he was maliciously prosecuted by the defendant, although he was never\n   arrested, never paid any fine, and never appeared in court concerning the infraction ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On January 5, 2009, the court,\n   <em>\n    Trombley, J.,\n   </em>\n   struck counts two, three, and four [of the plaintiff's complaint] for their failure sufficiently to allege the elements of the respective causes of action. [Although] the court denied the motion to strike count one [for malicious prosecution], it had barely survived, but it took three\n   more years and a change in Connecticut law for count one of [the plaintiff's] complaint to be disposed of by summary judgment in favor of [the defendant]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In the meantime, however, [the defendant] had upped the ante by filing a counterclaim that accused [the plaintiff] of abusing the court's process by bringing his malicious prosecution lawsuit 'not in pursuit of justice' but as 'improper retaliation for the efforts of [the defendant] to stop the harassing, bizarre, and criminal misconduct of [the plaintiff] over several years.' ... [The defendant's] counterclaim sought damages also for intentional infliction of emotional distress, based on [the plaintiff's] alleged seeking of a warrant for [the defendant's] arrest for harassment, after she had made a telephone call to the fire department officials of the town of Berlin claiming that [the plaintiff, who was a volunteer firefighter] had engaged in inappropriate behavior and was mentally ill. A third count alleged a conspiracy between [the plaintiff] and Berlin fire and police officials to cause [the defendant] severe emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"After she obtained summary judgment on the malicious prosecution count of [the plaintiff's] complaint in 2012, [the defendant] amended her counterclaim to include counts for common-law (count four) and statutory (count five) vexatious litigation.... Because all of the counts of [the plaintiff's] complaint had been stricken or had been disposed of by summary judgment in favor of [the defendant], by the time this case came on for trial on February 26, 2014, the only issues before the court were those raised by the [defendant's] five count counterclaim.\" (Footnotes omitted; citation omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A bench trial was held on February 26 and 27, and March 5, 2014. On July 23, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision with respect to liability only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court held that the defendant had proved by a preponderance of the evidence all of the elements of abuse of process and common-law and statutory vexatious litigation. The court further held, however, that the defendant had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. In the July 23, 2014 memorandum, the court deferred making a determination as to the appropriate amount of damages to award the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 6, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision with respect to damages. The court determined that the defendant had proven $35,000 in emotional distress damages pursuant to her abuse of process (count one) and statutory vexatious litigation (count five) claims. The court trebled the emotional distress damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and awarded the defendant $105,000, as damages for those counts. The court further awarded the defendant the nominal sum of $1 in compensatory damages and $20,000 in reasonable attorney's fees as punitive damages for common-law\n   vexatious litigation. In total, the defendant was awarded $125,001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly awarded the defendant emotional distress damages for abuse of process. In support of this claim, the plaintiff sets forth two arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, he contends that the\n   award of emotional distress damages was improper because the court improperly found that the malicious prosecution action initiated by the plaintiff was the cause of the defendant's emotional distress. Second, he contends\n   that the court improperly awarded emotional distress damages because the evidence in the record was insufficient to establish all the elements of abuse of process, in particular, that his primary purpose in bringing the malicious prosecution action was improper. Although the plaintiff frames this claim as a challenge to the award of emotional distress damages for abuse of process, his arguments, in essence, challenge the merits of the court's liability determination. We are not persuaded by either argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff first contends that the award of emotional distress damages for abuse of process was improper as a matter of law because the court improperly found that the malicious prosecution action initiated by the plaintiff was the cause of the defendant's emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiff argues that there is no evidence in the record to support the court's finding that the plaintiff's action caused the defendant's emotional distress. Rather, he argues, any emotional distress that the defendant experienced was\n   due to other traumatic events that occurred at the time of the action, such as the defendant undergoing open heart surgery. In response, the defendant cites to multiple sections of her testimony at trial in which she described the emotional distress that she experienced as a direct result of the plaintiff's action. We are not persuaded by the plaintiff's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts, which the trial court reasonably could have found on the basis of the record, are relevant to this argument. At trial, the defendant was questioned about how she reacted to being served with the plaintiff's action, to which she responded: \"I was just beside myself. I said I can't believe that he's suing me because he broke the law.\" Then, in response to a question concerning how the action had affected her emotionally, the defendant stated that: \"It changed my life dramatically, drastically.... I don't sleep well at night, I lock all my doors.\" Similarly, the defendant's husband testified at trial that the action had made her \"very, very upset, distraught,\" and \"[i]nconsolable.\" In its memorandum of decision, the court credited the defendant's testimony that the action had caused her emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Damages suffered through an abuse of legal process not malicious must be compensatory, that is compensation for the natural consequences resulting, which would include injury to the feelings because of the humiliation, disgrace or indignity suffered, together with injury to the person and physical suffering....\"\n   <em>\n    McGann v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1529509\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/105/177/#p184\">\n    105 Conn. 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.%20810\">\n    134 A. 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1926). Thus, for the court to properly award emotional distress damages for abuse of process, the abuse of process must have caused the defendant's emotional distress. Whether such causation exists is a question of fact. See\n   <em>\n    Burton v. Stamford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063585\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/47/#p87\">\n    115 Conn.App. 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20A.2d%20739\">\n    971 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148096,4148123,4148110\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/912/\">\n    293 Conn. 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20A.2d%201108\">\n    978 A.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n   Our review of the trial court's factual findings is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. \"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.... We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Verspyck v.

She and her husband testified that the action upset her and caused insomnia. The court credited that testimony. Accordingly, we conclude that the record supports the court's finding that the plaintiff's action caused emotional distress to the defendant, and, thus, the court properly awarded emotional distress damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, the plaintiff contends that the court improperly awarded emotional distress damages for abuse of process because there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's conclusion that the defendant had met her burden to establish all the elements of abuse of process, particularly, that his primary purpose in bringing the malicious prosecution action was improper. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the defendant produced no evidence that he had\n   brought the malicious prosecution action in order to intimidate and harass her. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this aspect of the plaintiff's claim. On April 5, 2012, the plaintiff e-mailed his attorney, John Williams, that \"[t]he suit worked as far as I'm concerned by keeping the [defendant] at bay the last four years.\" Although Williams testified that he did not recall the plaintiff stating that the purpose of the malicious prosecution action was to keep the defendant \"at bay,\" he did admit that he thought that \"[d]eterrence [was] a legitimate basis for a legal action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the court's July 23, 2014 memorandum of decision, it found that the plaintiff's action \"was brought not for the purpose of obtaining just damages from [the defendant] but to continue the pattern of harassing behavior in which [the plaintiff] had previously engaged vis-\u00e0-vis the [defendant's] family and to intimidate [the defendant] from making any further complaints about him to the local authorities.\" In making this finding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court found persuasive that the plaintiff \"confirmed this [improper] intention on his part in an e-mail to his attorney on April 5, 2012....\" Furthermore, the court drew an\n   adverse inference against the plaintiff for not testifying at trial, although he was present, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-216c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We first set forth the applicable standard of review for a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. \"[W]e must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.... We also must determine whether those facts correctly found are, as a matter of law, sufficient to support the judgment.... [W]e give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bhatia v. Debek,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733973\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/397/#p404\">\n    287 Conn. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=948%20A.2d%201009\">\n    948 A.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Keeping this standard of review in mind, we turn to the elements of the tort of abuse of process. \"An action for abuse of process lies against any person using a legal process against another in an improper manner or to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed.... Because the tort arises out of the accomplishment of a result that could not be achieved by the proper and successful use of process, the Restatement Second (1977) of Torts, \u00a7 682, emphasizes that the gravamen of the action for abuse of process is the use of a legal process ... against another primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed.... Comment b to \u00a7 682 explains that the addition of 'primarily' is meant to exclude liability when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of benefit to the defendant.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mozzochi v. Beck,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501621\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/490/#p494\">\n    204 Conn. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20171\">\n    529 A.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the April 5, 2012 e-mail does not prove that he had an improper purpose for bringing the malicious prosecution action. We do not agree. The\n   e-mail stated that the action \"worked\" by keeping the defendant \"at bay.\" The court interpreted this phrase to mean that the action was successful because it achieved its intended purpose, to intimidate the defendant from making further lawful complaints to the police. The court's interpretation of the e-mail is reasonable, and, thus, we will defer to it. See\n   <em>\n    Bhatia v. Debek,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733973\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/397/#p404\">\n    287 Conn. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=948%20A.2d%201009\">\n    948 A.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]e give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If the plaintiff's statement in the e-mail about keeping the defendant \"at bay\" was meant in some other way, he had the opportunity to testify at trial as to what he actually meant by this statement. The plaintiff also could have offered testimony establishing that he had brought the malicious prosecution action for a legitimate purpose. The plaintiff chose not to avail himself of this opportunity and the court exercised its discretion, which is not challenged on appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   by drawing an adverse\n   inference against the plaintiff. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-216c. In light of this adverse inference, the April 5, 2012 e-mail supports the court's factual finding that the plaintiff's primary purpose in bringing the malicious prosecution action was improper. Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the court's determination that all the elements of abuse of process were met, and, thus, the court properly awarded emotional distress damages.\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly awarded treble damages for abuse of process. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court lawfully could treble damages only for statutory vexatious litigation pursuant to \u00a7 52-568(2), but that the court awarded them for abuse of process. The defendant responds that, viewing the judgment as a whole, it is clear that the court properly awarded treble damages for statutory vexatious litigation, and, that to the extent that the court entered treble damages for abuse of process in the concluding paragraph of the judgment, this was merely a clerical error that can be corrected at any time. We agree with the defendant that, in light of the judgment as a whole, the award of treble damages was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this claim. The court issued a memorandum of decision with respect to liability only on July 23, 2014. The court, however, deferred making a determination as to the appropriate amount of damages to award the defendant. On November 6, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision with respect to damages (November 6, 2014 judgment). In the November 6, 2014 judgment, the court discussed the amount of damages awarded under each count separately. The court determined that the defendant was entitled to $35,000 for emotional distress for abuse of process. The court then ordered that \"[b]ased on [its] finding for [the defendant] on count five of her counterclaim [for statutory vexatious litigation], the damages awarded on count one for emotional distress are trebled to $ 105,000 pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568(2).\" In the concluding paragraph, containing a tally of all the damages awarded, however, the court indicated an award for compensatory damages in the amount of $105,000 under\n   count one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no amount of damages entered under count five in the concluding paragraph.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The law of judgments ... is well settled. The construction of a judgment is a question of law with the determinative factor being the intent of the court\n   as gathered from all parts of the judgment....

The court considered damages under each count separately. After discussing the damages that the defendant was entitled to for abuse of process, the court, in a separate paragraph, awarded damages for statutory vexatious litigation. The court specifically stated that it was trebling the emotional distress damages \"[b]ased on [its] finding for [the defendant] on count five of her counterclaim ... pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568(2).\" Although the concluding paragraph of the judgment, if viewed in isolation, would suggest that the treble damages were awarded for abuse of process; see footnote 8 of this opinion; the court's statement that it was awarding emotional distress damages pursuant to the statutory vexatious litigation claim leads us to conclude that the judgment as a whole should be interpreted as an award of treble damages for statutory vexatious litigation, rather than for abuse of process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the\n   award of treble damages was proper.\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly held that, with regard to statutory and common-law vexatious litigation, the plaintiff failed to prove his affirmative defense that he relied on the advice of counsel. Specifically, he argues that the court improperly found that he did not give a full and fair statement of all the facts within his knowledge to his attorney, a necessary element of the defense. The defendant responds that the record supports the court's factual finding, especially in light of the adverse inference that the court reasonably drew against the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 52-216c, because he did not testify at trial. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our analysis of this claim. In the plaintiff's second revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged that \"the defendant falsely and maliciously accused the plaintiff of creating a public disturbance in the vicinity of his ... dwelling by having Christmas lights on his property.\" On the basis of this allegedly false accusation, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant's conduct constituted malicious prosecution, slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. After the plaintiff's claims were disposed of\n   and only the defendant's counterclaim remained to be tried, in his answer to the amended counterclaim, the plaintiff asserted the special defense that he relied on the advice of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff, although present throughout the trial, did not testify at trial. In lieu of testifying, a portion of the plaintiff's deposition transcript was admitted without objection as a full exhibit. In the portions of the deposition transcript admitted into evidence, the plaintiff did not discuss what he told his counsel, Williams, prior to Williams filing the complaint against the defendant for malicious prosecution, nor did he discuss what advice Williams gave and whether he relied on that advice. On the basis of the plaintiff's failure to testify at trial, the court drew an adverse inference against the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 52-216c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiff, however, did offer at trial the testimony of Williams. Williams testified that, when he wrote the complaint, he was under the impression that the blue lights, which were the basis for the infraction ticket for creating a public disturbance, were Christmas lights: \"If I thought they were strobe lights, I wouldn't have characterized them as Christmas lights.\" Williams' belief that the lights in question were Christmas lights was based solely on what the plaintiff had told him. Williams could not recall whether he had viewed the police report from January 3, 2008, which was admitted into evidence at trial and stated that the lights in question \"looked to be a blue LED strobe light similar to lights used in [vehicles] of volunteer firemen.\" Williams also could not recall whether, prior to filing the complaint, he had been aware of the fact that on December 30, 2007, four days prior to the night in question, there had been a complaint about the lights and a police officer had warned the plaintiff to turn the lights off at\n   night, describing them as \"a blue strobe light ... facing and flashing towards the ... [defendant's] bedroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Williams also testified that he did not speak to anyone besides the plaintiff in\n   preparing the complaint. He never spoke with the defendant or any of the police officers who were present when the plaintiff was issued the infraction ticket. He relied primarily on the plaintiff's version of events, although he did review some documents, including the infraction ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its July 23, 2014 memorandum of decision, the court held that the plaintiff \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the elements of his defense that he acted on the advice of counsel. In particular, he has failed to prove that the advice given him by counsel was given 'after a full and fair statement of all the facts within [the plaintiff's] knowledge, or which [the plaintiff] was charged with knowing.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not expand upon what evidence it relied upon in determining that the plaintiff did not give a full and fair statement of the facts to Williams, and the plaintiff did not seek an articulation on this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Advice of counsel is a complete defense to an action of ...

The\n   defendant has the burden of proof with respect to this special defense....

In other words, a client should not be permitted to rely upon the defense of advice of counsel if the client did not disclose all of the material facts related to a potential claim, because the lawyer cannot render full and accurate legal advice regarding whether there is a good faith basis to bring the claim in the absence of knowledge of all material facts. In such instances, a client's reliance on the advice of counsel is unreasonable regardless of whether the material facts would have altered counsel's assessment of the validity of the claim. Accordingly, in the present case, the issue is whether the record supports the court's factual finding that the plaintiff failed to provide Williams with some fact within his knowledge that was material to the malicious prosecution action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court did not specify the subordinate facts underlying its factual finding that the plaintiff failed to make a full and fair disclosure of material facts to his counsel. The burden, however, is on the appellant to seek an articulation, which the plaintiff failed to do. See\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities ex rel. Arnold v.

On the basis of the evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the court reasonably could have found that the lights in question\n   were LED strobe lights and that the plaintiff had not informed Williams of this fact. This omitted fact concerned the subject matter at the very heart of the plaintiff's malicious prosecution action, namely, whether the defendant falsely accused the plaintiff of creating a public disturbance. Whether the lights in question were Christmas lights or LED strobe lights would have affected significantly a court's determination of whether the defendant falsely accused the plaintiff of making a public disturbance. Thus, the court reasonably could have concluded that this omitted fact was material to the malicious prosecution action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The evidence in the record supports the court's factual finding that the plaintiff did not make a full and fair statement of all facts within his knowledge or which he was charged with knowing when he related to Williams that the defendant falsely and maliciously accused him of creating a public disturbance.

Additionally, at trial, the plaintiff did not object to the introduction of evidence concerning the defendant's mental and emotional distress caused by the plaintiff's filing of the malicious prosecution action.

The plaintiff's argument challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint, which is properly raised in a motion to strike. See Practice Book \u00a7 10-39(a)(2). The plaintiff, however, did not file a motion to strike; rather, he filed an answer with a special defense to the amended counterclaim. Accordingly, he waived his right to raise this issue.
