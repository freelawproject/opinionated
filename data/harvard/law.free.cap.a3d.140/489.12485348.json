Brady, a mechanic employed by Appellant, the Board of Education of Prince George's County (the \"Board of Education\"), was injured on the job. He remained absent from his position for sixteen and a half months before he retired on accidental disability retirement. During his absence, Brady elected to use his accrued paid personal and sick leave, rather than seek temporary total disability (\"TTD\") payments afforded under the Workers' Compensation Act. After a proceeding in front of the Workers' Compensation Commission on Brady's claim for permanent partial disability payments, where Brady was awarded a permanent partial disability award, the Commission granted the Board of Education an offset against the award for the Board's prior leave payments to Brady based on its interpretation of Maryland Code (1991, 2008 Repl Vol), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-610 (\"L &amp; E\"). The Circuit Court for Prince George's County reversed this offset, leading to this appeal. The question before us is whether the Board of Education is entitled to an offset under L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 because Brady\n   elected to use his personal and sick leave rather than avail himself of Workers' Compensation TTD benefits. For the following reasons, we hold the Board of Education is entitled to the offset and reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 8 April 2011, Brady injured his neck and right shoulder in a workplace accident. The diagnosis was that he suffered\n   two herniated cervical discs. The initial treatment did not alleviate Brady's injuries. He was referred to a neurosurgeon, who performed a two-level, anterior cervical fusion. Following this surgery, Brady was unable to return to his position because he could not perform physically the duties of a mechanic. He retired on service-connected disability on 1 July 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brady worked under a collective bargaining agreement between the Board of Education and his union, Local 2250 of ACE/AFSCME. Article four of the contract contained specific provisions on leave benefits, including accrued leave and workers' compensation benefits. The contract included a provision that entitled Brady to full pay (in the form of TTD leave) for an initial period of ninety working days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This leave was in lieu of any other benefits, including his accrued personal sick leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   He received this disability pay for the requisite ninety days and, on 14 February 2012, when it expired, Brady was obliged to select how he would proceed as he was still unable to perform his job. He was presented with two options: remain on leave with pay status, which would grant him his full wages and current benefits, or pursue TTD benefits under the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act. In a letter from Diane Mullin-Fines, on behalf of the Board of Education, Brady was informed that if he opted for the \"on leave with pay\" status, \"[i]n return for the ability to maintain the benefits ... [he] waive[d his] right to receive direct payment of [TTD] benefits from the Third Party Administrator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   He elected to remain on leave with pay status, which afforded him his full salary, but this option required him to use his accrued sick leave. As explained by Brady's counsel,\n   Brady \"had accrued a good amount of leave ... [a]nd up until the time of his retirement on July 1, 2013, he was paid essentially out of his own leave pocket.\" Being unable to perform physically his job, Brady applied subsequently for Accidental Disability Retirement. He began to receive Accidental Disability Retirement benefits on 1 July 2013 at the rate of $865.65 per week after he retired formally from his position as a mechanic for the Board of Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 1 April 2014, the Workers' Compensation Commission considered the employer's issue regarding the offset provision in L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610. After a hearing, a Commissioner granted to the Board of Education the right under L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 to offset the payment of Brady's full wages under his accrued sick leave that he received between 15 February 2012 and 1 July 2013 (the \"gap period\"). On 22 April 2014, the Workers' Compensation Commission issued its order finding that \"as a result of the accidental injury sustained on April 8, 2011 the claimant was paid disability\n   leave (in lieu of temporary total benefits) from September 26, 2011 to February 14, 2012 inclusive, and paid sick leave (in lieu of temporary total benefits) from February 15, 2012 to June 27, 2013.\" The Commission provided further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Ordered that the above named employer [Board of Education for Prince George's County] and above named insurer pay unto the above named claimant [James T. Brady], compensation for permanent partial disability ... beginning February 15, 2012, for a period of 333 weeks pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-630 of the Labor and Employment Article ; subject to a complete set-[o]ff in accordance with Section 9-610. It is further ORDERED that from the Subsequent Injury Fund the claimant shall be paid compensation for permanent partial disability ... pursuant to the provisions of Sections 9-802 and 9-804 of the Labor Article; subject to a complete set-off in accordance with Section 9-610.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The award of $705 per week for 333 weeks was a permanent partial disability award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brady appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. A hearing was held on 29 May 2015 to consider cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the litigants. Brady argued that his earned leave was \"proprietary\" and his decision to use it should not be considered as receiving benefits similar to the benefits under Workers' Compensation laws. During the circuit court's hearing, he observed that the Board of Education \"saved more than $23,500\" because it did not have to pay him upon retirement for his unused sick leave and annual leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board of Education argued that it was settled \"that when there's a single cause such as the workplace accident here, which is the basis of the compensation such as an accidental disability retirement, the County, in this case the Board of Education or whatever governmental entity is involved, is entitled to an offset for the period of payment of those benefits.\" Further, the Board maintained that, had no accident occurred and Brady retired without a workplace disability, he would have received only payment for thirty days of accrued sick and personal leave, under the collective bargaining agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties waived further proceedings in the circuit court and preserved their right to appeal, but agreed that the decision on the summary judgment motions would constitute a final order in the circuit court. On 2 June 2015, the circuit court\n   entered an order granting judgment in favor of Brady, offering no elaboration as to its reasoning for this conclusion. The Board of Education appealed timely to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    QUESTION PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant presents one question for our consideration, which we have rephrased for the sake of clarity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Did the circuit court err by granting Brady's motion for summary judgment, thus overruling the Commission's decision that the Board of Education, was entitled to an offset for benefits paid from 15 February 2012 to 1 July 2013 pursuant to Maryland Code (1991, 2008 Repl Vol), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-610 (\"L &amp; E\")?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the following reasons, we hold that it was error for the circuit court to give judgment to Brady and overrule the Workers' Compensation Commission's Order as to the off-set.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Board of Education contends that L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 entitles it to a complete offset of the sick leave it paid to Brady (treating it as the equivalent of TTD payments made under the Workers' Compensation statute) against the permanent partial disability award granted him by the Commission. Additionally, the Board of Education argues that the Commission finding of a \"Permanent Partial Disability\" as of 15 February 2012 should not affect the offset or credit due to the Board. Brady responds that the Board of Education was not entitled to an offset because his right to leave benefits for the permanent loss of wage earning capacity is \"patently dissimilar\" to temporary total disability benefits. He states that \"this case is not about an excessive or duplicative payment ... rather it is about the differences in temporary total disability and permanent partial disability benefits under the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 : Offset against other benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is not disputed that the Board of Education is subject to the provisions of\n   the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code or that Brady is a protected employee. Thus, the question for this Court is whether the Board of Education is entitled to an offset for the monies paid to Brady while he was on disability sick leave. Under traditional \"wage-loss\" legislation, the prevailing view was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion, such as one-half to two-thirds, of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss; the cause of the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover more than his actual wage. He is experiencing only one wage loss and, in any logical system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

The Commission's order specified that the weekly benefit be paid for the period of January 22, 1994 through November 16, 1995 and provided that \"thereafter any permanent partial disability due and payable is offset by claimant's weekly pension benefits of $1,038.25.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Blevins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    352 Md. at 623-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    724 A.2d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The county sought to have the entire amount offset, including the permanent partial disability benefits awarded to the employee before his retirement. Permanent partial disability benefits, however, are \"lost earning capacity benefits,\" not \"wage loss\" benefits. This distinction makes the two different for purposes of L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610. The presented argument in\n   <em>\n    Blevins\n   </em>\n   for the offset relied on\n   <em>\n    Frank v.

The Court of Appeals disagreed and held that the offset did not apply in\n   <em>\n    Blevins\n   </em>\n   because the employee was not receiving duplicate benefits for one injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The workers' compensation benefits were awarded for a weekly period prior to his retirement, when he was not receiving and was not entitled to receive any offsetting retirement benefits. The fact that the actual award of workers' compensation benefits or their payment came after his retirement is of no consequence. There was no overlap, as found by the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Blevins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    352 Md. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    724 A.2d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That is essentially the same issue that we are confronted with here. Brady was absent from his job for sixteen and a half months before he retired. He was awarded permanent partial disability under L &amp; E \u00a7 9-630 from the Workers' Compensation Commission because his disability had become permanent. Prior to this permanency determination, Brady was receiving his accrued sick leave, which equates to TTD benefits under workers' compensation laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although Brady's sick leave, as a form of wage loss protection, was not a benefit similar to permanent partial disability, a lost-earning capacity benefit, an offset should still apply. Because the award for permanent partial disability is to be \"paid in addition to and consecutively with compensation for a temporary total disability\" pursuant to L &amp; E \u00a7 9-631, Brady would not start to receive the permanent partial disability award until after he ceased receiving TTD benefits (or in this case, the similar sick leave benefits).

Additionally, Brady received more money by using his leave than he would have received under any lawful award for permanent partial disability, not unlike the situation present in\n   <em>\n    Oros.\n   </em>\n   The difference here is that the Board of Education is not asking to use the money paid already to offset Brady's post-retirement permanent partial disability\n   (which is already offset under L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 ). The Board of Education is asking that it not be required to pay Brady twice for the same injury because the two overlap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court of Appeals concluded previously that when the alternative benefit exceeds what an employee would have received from workers' compensation benefits, the employer is not obligated to pay additional funds to the employee and the set-off is \"complete.\"\n   <em>\n    Blevins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    352 Md. at 622-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/#p625\">\n    724 A.2d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is what happened here. The alternative benefit Brady received in the form of his full wages exceeded what he would have received under any workers' compensation award. To refuse the Board of Education an offset of these funds would go against the Legislature's intent that an injured employee is entitled to a single recovery for a single injury. The offset pursuant to L &amp; E \u00a7 9-610 does not start until 1 July 2013, the date of Brady's retirement, but we hold that the Board of Education is entitled to a complete offset of the funds paid to Brady for the \"gap\" period.
