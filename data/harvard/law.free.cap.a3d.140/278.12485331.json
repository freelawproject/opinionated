The plaintiff brought this subrogation action against the defendant and his son, the defendant Bruce Fern, Jr.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to recover damages resulting from a fire occurring on a residential property on November 6, 2011. The defendant argues that the court erred in determining that (1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff's insured and (2) the\n   defendant installed a boiler and was equally at fault with his son. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court made the following findings of fact. The defendant and his son both work as contractors, although only the defendant is a registered improvement contractor. Although both had some prior experience in installing new boilers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   neither the defendant nor his son has the necessary occupational license to engage in plumbing and piping work or heating, piping, and cooling work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Charles Loria (insured) was the owner of property located at 155 Twin Lanes Road in Easton (property), on which he possessed an insurance policy issued by the plaintiff. At the time of the fire, the insured's former wife, Elizabeth Loria (occupant), lived on the property with her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She told investigators subsequent to the fire that the defendant and his son had installed the boiler about a week before the fire occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the day of the installation, the defendant and his son arrived at the property, removed the old boiler, and installed the new boiler. The defendant was responsible for certain aspects of the installation of the new pipe connecting the boiler to the chimney. This work involved measuring the pipe, making the proper cuts, and installing the adapter\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that connected the pipe and chimney into the masonry. When installing the chimney connector into the masonry, the defendant used a two-by-four board to knock the adapter into the chimney. He also held the pipe in place while his son affixed the\n   adapter and the pipe to one another. No further action, such as the use of cement or strapping the pipe in place, was taken to secure the chimney connector into the chimney. The defendant did not read the installation manual for the boiler or speak with a building inspector about the applicable regulations governing the installation of the boiler. The defendant's son ignited the boiler, but failed to make any adjustments\n   to the appliance as required by the manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately one week after the defendant and his son installed the boiler, the chimney connector became disconnected from the masonry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, exhaust gases from the boiler were directed onto the joists of the basement ceiling and, over time, generated sufficient heat to start the fire. From the basement, the fire spread to other parts of the property, resulting in damages exceeding $350,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the subsequent investigation into the fire, two potential causes were identified as causing the fire. First, the boiler had not been placed to the proper settings and adjusted as required during the initial installation; consequently, the boiler had been running improperly and accumulated a large amount of soot. Second, the chimney connector had not been cemented into the chimney or secured in place by a separate piece of equipment; consequently, it became dislodged from the chimney. One of the investigators stated that, if the chimney connector had been secured properly into the chimney, the connector would not have become disconnected due to the improper installation and adjustment of the burner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its amended complaint, the plaintiff asserted two theories for recovery: (1) the defendant and his son had acted negligently in installing the boiler (counts one and three); and (2) they had breached an implied covenant that all work would be performed in a workmanlike manner (counts two and four). Following a trial to the court, the court issued its memorandum of decision on February 26, 2015. Recounting the essentials of this chronology, the court found that both the defendant and his son had violated various statutes and regulations while installing the boiler. Consequently, the court held that the defendant and his son had acted negligently and violated an implied covenant that their work would be done in a workmanlike manner, their actions were the proximate cause of the fire, and they were equally at fault. Therefore, the court found in favor of the plaintiff on each count of its complaint. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendant primarily asserts that the court erred in finding that he owed a duty to the insured or the occupant. The defendant asserts that the resulting fire was unforeseeable to him because his role in installing the boiler was relatively limited. In making this argument, the defendant relies on the difference in the type and character of his work when compared to that of his son. In particular, the defendant asserts that his son was the contractor retained or engaged by the occupant, made the agreement to install the boiler, held himself out as having the necessary skill and expertise to install the boiler, and, thus, had the ultimate responsibility for verifying that the boiler was properly installed. The defendant frames his personal involvement much more narrowly, contending that he was merely a laborer or helper, rather than a subcontractor, and claims as support that he took direction from his son, was not paid for his labor, and never held\n   himself\n   out as having any skill whatsoever in boiler installation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin by noting that the defendant's argument appears to confuse the existence of a duty with the scope of that duty once one is found to exist;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   thus, he blends together two separate concerns. \"The essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury.... Contained within the first element, duty, there are two distinct considerations.... First, it is necessary to determine the existence of a duty, and [second], if one is found, it is necessary to evaluate the scope of that duty.... The issue of whether a duty exists is a question of law ... which is subject to plenary review. We sometimes refer to the scope of that duty as the requisite standard of care.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Instead, it relied on two groups of statutes and regulations that the defendant and his son contravened while installing the boiler. It first noted that although neither the defendant nor his son had the occupational license required by statute for this work, they wilfully engaged in this work and the fire was \"[t]he harm that ... the licensing requirement was designed to prevent.\" It also noted that certain codes and standards promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association (standards) had been incorporated into our law and were not followed by the defendant. Thus, in effect, the court analyzed duty as a question of negligence per se under these two groups of statutes and regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Negligence per se ... serves to superimpose a legislatively prescribed standard of care on the general standard of care.... A violation of the statute or regulation thus establishes a breach of duty when (1) the plaintiff is within the class of persons intended to be protected\n   by the statute, and (2) the injury is the type of harm that the statute was intended to prevent.... Although the plaintiff still must demonstrate the remaining elements of negligence, the jury in a negligence per se case need not decide whether the defendant acted as an ordinarily prudent person would have acted under the circumstances. [It] merely decide[s]\n   whether the relevant statute or regulation has been violated. If it has, the defendant was negligent as a matter of law.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

See, e.g., Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed.2001) (defining chimney as \"a structure ... containing a passage or flue by which the smoke, gases, etc., of a fire or furnace are carried off\"). Indeed, the defendant testified that he did not need any instructions from his son to know that the chimney connector must be secured as much as possible. Because it is within the understanding of an ordinary person that improperly installing the chimney connector for an oil burner could lead to a fire, the court reasonably could have found that the risk of fire arising from an improperly secured chimney connector either was, or at the very least should have been, foreseeable to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

They removed the old boiler and [chimney connector] and installed a new boiler and [chimney connector]. [The defendant] cut pipes and held them in place while his son soldered them together. Both worked on installing the [chimney connector]. [The defendant] connected the end of the metal pipe to the chimney, but did not cement it in place or otherwise fasten it to the chimney. He merely pounded it in place\n   with a wood board. He did not read the manufacturer's instruction booklet or check with a building inspector. His son turned on the oil-fired boiler, but did not make any adjustments to the burner motor as required by the manufacturer.\" It then found that \"the fire was proximately caused by [the defendant and his son's] careless and improper installation of the boiler and [chimney connector],\" and that they were equally at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant argues that the court erred in characterizing his participation and responsibility as equivalent to that of his son. The defendant notes that the court made no specific finding that the defendant's manner of inserting the pipe into the chimney was negligent, but \"simply treat[ed] [the defendant] as having undertaken to install the boiler along with his son, and charge[d] [the defendant] with negligence in the overall improper installation of the boiler-the entire job. That conclusion is flawed, however, [insofar as it is based on the arguments that the defendant's] status with respect to the job was as a laborer\" and \"it was the responsibility of [the defendant's son] to ensure that the new boiler and all appurtenances were installed correctly.\" In making this argument, the defendant has alleged facts that the court did not find.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although relying on certain facts throughout his brief that the court did not adopt in its memorandum of decision, the defendant points to no separate error in the court's findings beyond this particular\n   characterization and presents no independent argument beyond his conclusory position that the role of his son before and during the installation of the boiler somehow neutralizes his own responsibility to act in compliance with the applicable statutory provisions and in exercise of due care. Further, the court's recitation of the work completed by the defendant and his son was an accurate, if truncated, recitation of the defendant's and his\n   son's testimony at trial about their actions at the property in late 2011. Although the court did not discuss in detail the evidence showing that the defendant's son arranged many of the project's details prior to the day of the actual installation, both the defendant and his son presented similar accounts of their work at the property and used terms suggestive of joint efforts to describe their labor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the installation of the chimney connector itself, it is undisputed that the defendant was responsible for preparing most of the piping for the chimney connector, reinstalled the end of the chimney connector into the flue, and held the pipes while his son affixed them to one another. The defendant's son testified that he was not actively supervising the defendant's work in this respect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant testified that he did not need any direction to reinstall the chimney connector or to know that he had to make the connection as secure as possible. We also note that the court explicitly found that it was the defendant, not his son, who inserted the chimney connector into the masonry and failed to properly affix it, and the defendant does not challenge this finding of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, expert testimony offered at trial stated that the fire was caused by the improper adjustment of the boiler following its initial ignition by the defendant's son and the failure of the defendant to secure the chimney connector into the flue properly. These experts also testified, however, that the failure to secure the chimney\n   connector properly into the chimney was primarily responsible for the fire or, at the very least, that the fire would have been significantly less likely to occur, even with the improper adjustment of the boiler settings, if the connector had been secured properly. Thus, despite the defendant's reliance on certain assertions and testimony presented at trial that were not adopted by the court or challenged on appeal, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to characterize the defendant's labors or responsibility for the resulting fire as equivalent to that of his son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In summation, the defendant engaged in specialized work that he knew or should have known required a professional license that he did not possess. The defendant failed to take necessary precautions when doing this specialized work that required a licensed professional and failed to install the chimney connector in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Accordingly, the defendant failed to exercise due care when undertaking this specialized endeavor. Because the risk of a fire was both within the contemplation of the applicable statutes and regulations of which the defendant was in violation, and the damages\n   sustained were a foreseeable result of the improper installation of the chimney connector to the oil-fired boiler, the defendant's arguments that he did not owe a duty to the plaintiff's insured are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Because Bruce Fern, Jr., is not a participant in this appeal, hereafter we will refer to Bruce Fern, Sr., as the defendant in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Specifically, the court described their experience as follows: \"[The defendant] and [his son] have limited experience in installing boilers.

Additionally, \u00a7 1805.2 of the 2003 International Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings portion of the 2005 State Building Code provides in relevant part: \"A connector entering a masonry chimney shall extend through, but not beyond the wall and shall be flush with the inner face of the liner. Connectors, or thimbles where used, shall be firmly cemented into the masonry.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The expert relied on standard 211 to address whether the concrete ring was a \"thimble\" as that term is used in standard 31. Standard 211 provides in relevant part: \"Thimbles for chimneys or vent connectors shall be fireclay ... galvanized steel of minimum thickness of 24 ga[u]ge, or material of equivalent durability. Thimbles shall be installed without damage to the liner. The thimble shall extend through the wall to, but not beyond, the inner face of the liner and shall be firmly cemented to masonry.\" National Fire Protection Assn., NFPA 211: Standard for Chimneys, Fireplaces, Vents, and Solid Fuel-Burning Appliances (1992 Ed.) \u00a7 3-1.8.1, p. 211-18. Thus, because the clay ring was only two inches long and did not extend to the vertical flue, the expert explained, it was not a \"thimble\" as that term is used in standard 31. The defendant has not asserted on appeal that either the court's reliance on this testimony or its application of the law was in error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"In cases involving the doctrine of negligence per se ... the defendant ordinarily may avoid liability upon proof of a valid excuse or justification.\"\n    <em>\n     Gore v.

The idea of risk in this context necessarily involves a recognizable danger, based upon some knowledge of the existing facts, and some reasonable belief that harm may possibly follow....
