After we issued our decision in the petitioner's direct appeal, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming, among other things, his criminal trial and appellate counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to raise or sufficiently present a plethora of claims during the criminal proceedings. After an evidentiary hearing, the habeas court rejected each of the petitioner's claims and rendered judgment\n   denying the petition. The habeas court granted certification to appeal from its judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470(g) and the petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court. The petitioner later filed a motion to transfer the appeal to this court, which we granted. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199(c) ; Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner raises thirteen separate issues with the habeas court's decision.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the habeas court with respect to the petitioner's sentence. Three claims remain regarding the underlying capital felony conviction: (1) that the criminal trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the charges; (2) that his criminal trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during the guilt phase of the petitioner's trial; and (3) that international law precludes his conviction for a capital felony. We reject each of these claims and affirm the judgment of the habeas court with respect to the petitioner's underlying conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petitioner first claims that the substitute long form information charging him with a capital felony\n   failed to describe each and every element of the offense charged, thus depriving the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. The state initially charged the petitioner with a short form information alleging that he committed the offense of capital felony in the city of Waterbury on or about December 18, 1992, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-54b (1). The petitioner later filed a motion for a bill of particulars asking for more information about the nature of the charge. The state filed a substitute long form information in response. The long form information alleged that the petitioner \"did commit the crime of [capital felony] in violation of\n   Connecticut General Statutes [Rev. to 1991] \u00a7 53a-54b (1) in that on or about [December 18, 1992], at approximately [4 a.m.], at or near the intersection of Orange and Ward Streets [in] Waterbury ... the [petitioner] did commit [murder] of a member of a local police department, to wit: [Officer Williams] of the Waterbury ... Police Department.\" The parties agree that the long form information did not allege that Officer Williams was acting within the scope of his duties at the time of the offense, one of the elements of a capital felony under (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-54b (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the petitioner, the state's failure to allege every element of the capital felony offense deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over that charge, thus rendering his conviction and resulting sentence invalid. In response, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, asserts that the petitioner did not preserve this issue for our review because he failed to raise this claim before the habeas court, preventing him from raising it for the first time in this appeal. The respondent also argues that the petitioner's claim, even if raised, cannot overcome the procedural hurdles required to mount a collateral attack on the subject matter jurisdiction of the original trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We do not address the respondent's arguments about whether the petitioner is procedurally barred from presenting this collateral attack because, assuming for the sake of argument that we could properly review his claim, which presents a question of law;\n   <em>\n    Stepney Pond Estates, Ltd. v.

The state filed a short form information charging the petitioner with a capital felony and included the statutory citation for the alleged offense and the date and place the offense allegedly occurred. Nothing more was required to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction. The fact that the substitute long form information contained additional factual allegations relating to some, but not all, of the elements of the crime had no impact on the trial court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

These cases do not, however, discuss whether the alleged defects in the information rendered the trial court without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the charges.

Specifically, the petitioner asserts that his trial counsel should have brought a claim of misconduct against the state because the petitioner believes the state improperly granted leniency to Crawford to induce Crawford to testify against the petitioner. The petitioner also argues that his trial counsel did not adequately use the state's favorable treatment of Crawford to challenge Crawford's credibility at the petitioner's trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the petitioner, the state could have charged Crawford with more severe offenses, including murder and attempted sale of cocaine.

Neither of them were charged with any drug crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crawford was acquitted of the hindering prosecution charge after a bench trial on the basis that his \"silence\" was, as a matter of law, not an act of concealment under the hindering prosecution statute. Crawford later testified against the petitioner. The petitioner claimed that Crawford had shot Officer Williams, but Crawford named the petitioner as the shooter in his trial testimony. The three judge panel ultimately\n   found that the petitioner shot Officer Williams. Crawford testified that the state had neither made a deal with him nor given any promises in exchange for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner contends that the state could have charged Crawford as an accomplice in Officer Williams' murder and for the attempted sale of cocaine, but that the state did not do so because it had an undisclosed deal with Crawford to forgo more serious charges in return for Crawford's testimony against the petitioner. The petitioner further claims that the state, as part of its undisclosed \"ruse\" to secure Crawford's testimony,\n   intentionally bungled its case against Crawford to all but ensure that he would be acquitted on the hindering prosecution charge. The petitioner argues that trial counsel was deficient for failing to argue that the state's charging decisions amounted to misconduct because they \"corrupt[ed] the truth seeking function\" of the trial. He also argues that trial counsel should have argued the existence of a secret deal between the state and Crawford as a means to attack Crawford's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The respondent asserts that there was no misconduct for the petitioner's trial counsel to raise, because the state enjoys broad discretion to charge defendants, and was under no obligation to bring more severe charges against Crawford. The respondent also asserts that the petitioner has provided no evidence that a deal existed between the state and Crawford, and notes that both the trial prosecutor and Crawford denied that any deal existed. Consequently, the respondent argues that the petitioner's trial counsel cannot be faulted for failing to make an issue of any purported deal with Crawford. We agree with the respondent and reject the petitioner's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before turning to the petitioner's claims, we observe that the petitioner's burden and our standard of review are explained in detail in\n   <em>\n    Small v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960705\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/707/#p712\">\n    286 Conn. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    946 A.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). We briefly note that to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must prove both that his trial counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and that his defense suffered prejudice as a result.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As for the misconduct argument, the petitioner has not shown that his counsel's performance was deficient because he has not shown that any misconduct occurred. Both the decision to criminally charge an individual and the choice of which crime should be\n   charged lie within the discretion of the state and are not ordinarily subject to judicial review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Kinchen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"205344\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/243/690/#p699\">\n    243 Conn. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699-700,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20A.2d%201255\">\n    707 A.2d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (explaining in detail reasons for this deference). To be sure, this discretion is not unlimited. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The petitioner has not, however, directed us to any authority, and we are aware of none, that the state commits misconduct if it chooses not to bring the most severe charges possible against a cooperating witness. To the contrary, prosecutors frequently show leniency toward witnesses who cooperate in a prosecution, a practice that has been upheld by courts time and again. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cervantes-Pacheco,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741550\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/310/#p315\">\n    826 F.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (5th Cir.1987) (noting that \"[n]o practice is more ingrained in our criminal justice system\" than prosecutors giving leniency to\n   testifying witnesses). Furthermore, barring the state from this practice could severely hinder the state's ability to gather evidence from coparticipants, who frequently hold the best evidence available about the crimes charged. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dailey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388174\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/192/#p196\">\n    759 F.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (1st Cir.1985) (noting that coparticipants are frequently present at crime scenes and can be most knowledgeable witnesses available). Without demonstrating any legal basis for a claim of misconduct, the petitioner has not established that his counsel were deficient by failing to raise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But even if the petitioner could show some form of misconduct, the petitioner's claim fails nevertheless because he has provided no argument whatsoever in his briefs about how this alleged deficiency prejudiced him. The petitioner has not provided us any authority\n   to show what remedy the trial court could have provided the petitioner had his counsel raised a charge of misconduct. The petitioner does not suggest-and we are aware of no authority holding-that the state's leniency toward Crawford somehow precluded the state from charging the petitioner with more severe crimes than Crawford or required his acquittal. Nor has the petitioner suggested that leniency by the state rendered Crawford an incompetent witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having failed to provide any argument or authority to support a finding of prejudice, the petitioner cannot succeed on his claim based on this alleged misconduct. See\n   <em>\n    Small v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960705\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/707/#p712\">\n    286 Conn. at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    946 A.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (failure to prove prejudice defeats claim for ineffective assistance of counsel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As for the petitioner's argument that his trial counsel failed to adequately attack Crawford's credibility at trial, we conclude his counsel's actions were reasonable and, thus, not deficient. According to the petitioner, his counsel should have done more to challenge Crawford's credibility by arguing the existence of a clandestine deal. The petitioner faults his trial counsel for not relying on Crawford's acquittal on what the petitioner calls a \"bogus\" hindering prosecution charge and the state's failure to charge Crawford with homicide or drug charges to argue that the state had \"obviously cut a deal\" with Crawford in exchange for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is hardly unreasonable for counsel to choose to preserve credibility with the finder of fact by declining\n   to pursue an argument that is supported by nothing more than conjecture. The petitioner has not cited any evidence that a deal existed other than mere speculation based on the state's lenient treatment of Crawford. One of the petitioner's trial attorneys testified that he had no evidence of any deal and Crawford denied that the state had made any promises in exchange for his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The petitioner's trial counsel also reasonably could have chosen not to imply the existence of a deal to avoid raising an unsupported implication that the state had acted improperly. Had there been a deal, the state would have been obligated to disclose it.\n   <em>\n    State v. Floyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545259\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/700/#p736\">\n    253 Conn. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20799\">\n    756 A.2d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Had the state neglected to disclose the deal initially, it would have been obligated to correct the record when Crawford testified that no\n   deal existed.\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20359\">\n    309 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20512\">\n    71 A.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Thus, to imply that a secret deal was struck is to imply that the state violated its obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rather than make such accusations without any supporting evidence, the petitioner's trial counsel opted for the eminently reasonable alternative of questioning Crawford about an unrelated charge pending against him as a means to suggest that Crawford was lying or embellishing his testimony because he hoped, even in the absence of a deal, that the state might be more lenient in his other case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the petitioner claims that his counsel should have exposed to the three judge panel that Crawford was acquitted of hindering prosecution because the charge was \"bogus,\" his counsel reasonably could have chosen to avoid revealing Crawford's acquittal, lest it make Crawford appear less culpable for Officer Williams' death in the eyes of the\n   fact finder. We therefore conclude that his trial counsel's performance was not deficient and we do not consider whether any purported deficiency prejudiced the petitioner, an element of his claim that, as we have previously noted, the petitioner did not brief in this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lastly, the petitioner asserts that the habeas court improperly concluded that international law did not bar his conviction for a capital felony. We decline to address this argument, however, because the petitioner did not adequately brief it. Although the petitioner makes a passing statement that his conviction violates international law, the petitioner's claim appears aimed at his sentence, which is governed by our decisions in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The petitioner spends all of his argument explaining that international law prohibits a sentence of death, but cites no authority and provides no argument that international law also prevents a capital felony conviction, which does not necessarily carry a sentence of death.
