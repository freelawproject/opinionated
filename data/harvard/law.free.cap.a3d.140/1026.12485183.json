He also claims that the trial court improperly excluded a videotape of an interview conducted by police of a crucial prosecution witness just prior to the administration of a polygraph examination, admitted evidence of prior misconduct committed by the defendant, and excluded expert testimony that he proffered regarding the lack of reliability of jailhouse informant testimony. Although we disagree with the defendant's claims regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, we agree that the court improperly excluded the polygraph pretest interview videotape, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial. Because the remaining two evidentiary issues are likely to arise again on remand, we address them in turn. Although we disagree with the defendant that the court improperly admitted evidence of his prior misconduct, we agree that the court improperly excluded expert testimony proffered by the defendant regarding the reliability of jailhouse informant testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 29, 1996, the victim, A.P.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was fifteen years old, snuck out of her parents' home to meet P.J. Allain, another teenager, so that they could smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, and have sex. The two teenagers were picked up by the defendant, who at the time was thirty-three years old. They then drove to a secluded location in the woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.P. and Allain drank beer, smoked marijuana, and kissed in the defendant's pickup truck. The defendant took Allain aside and told him that he wanted \"to do her\" and that he \"wanted a body for the altar.\" The\n   defendant had previously told Allain that he was in a cult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Allain returned to the truck and told A.P. that she was going to be raped by the defendant. A.P. asked that she have sex only with Allain. Allain then removed her clothes and had sex with her in the truck while the defendant watched through the windshield. After Allain and A.P. finished having sex, the defendant climbed into the truck and sexually assaulted A.P. During\n   the assault, Allain kept his hand on A.P.'s breast but could not look at her because he felt horrible. Afterward, A.P. pretended not to be upset so that the defendant would not harm her further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant then proceeded to drive the teenagers toward home. The defendant dropped off Allain near his home. After Allain was no longer present, the defendant drove A.P. to an unknown location, where he pretended to run out of gas. The defendant forced A.P. to run into the woods with him, and at times he had to drag her along. The defendant then choked A.P., killed her, and disposed of her body in an unknown location. A.P. was never seen again by anyone despite a nationwide search by law enforcement for many years, and her remains have never been recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant admitted to four individuals, on different occasions, to killing A.P. and/or to disposing of her body: Allain\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and three inmates-Michael Douton,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zee Ching,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Kenneth Buckingham.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant was\n   incarcerated with Douton, Ching, and Buckingham at various times while he was serving a sentence for sexually assaulting K.S., a thirteen year old girl, approximately six months prior to the disappearance of A.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A warrant was issued for the defendant's arrest on March 28, 2008, and the defendant was subsequently charged in a substitute, long form information with the following crimes: murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a ; capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (5) (kidnap-murder); capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (7) (murder in the course of sexual assault); and capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (9) (murder of person under age sixteen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The matter was tried to a jury,\n   <em>\n    Jongbloed, J.,\n   </em>\n   presiding. On March 2, 2010, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. On June 22, 2010, the court merged the verdicts into a single conviction of capital felony and sentenced the defendant to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of release. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history shall be set forth as necessary to address the claims of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any of the charges of which he was convicted. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) A.P. is dead, because, pursuant to the corpus delicti rule, the defendant's alleged confessions may not be used as evidence to prove that A.P. is dead in the absence of independent proof of her death; (2) the defendant intended to kill A.P.; (3) he murdered A.P. during the commission of a sexual assault because there was no\n   evidence independent of his confessions that he sexually assaulted A.P.; and (4) he murdered\n   A.P. in the course of a kidnapping or before she could be returned to safety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the defendant cannot prevail on his sufficiency of the evidence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first turn to the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that A.P. is dead because, in his view, the only evidence of A.P.'s death is the testimony of four of the state's witnesses that the defendant separately confessed to each of them that he killed A.P. and disposed of her body. The defendant argues that, under these circumstances, the common-law corpus delicti rule prevents him from being convicted of murder and capital felony solely on the basis of his uncorroborated confessions and in the absence of independent extrinsic evidence of the fact of death of the alleged victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, the state argues that the evidence is sufficient to prove A.P.'s death beyond a reasonable doubt because (1) the defendant cannot rely on the corpus delicti rule, as he failed to object to the admission of his confessions at trial; and (2), under Connecticut's formulation of the corpus delicti rule, a defendant's confession may be used to prove the corpus delicti, i.e., the death of the victim, as long as there is\n   corroborating evidence that substantially establishes the trustworthiness of the defendant's confession. Such corroborating evidence, the state contends, need not itself independently establish the corpus delicti, may be circumstantial in nature, and need not prove any element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We reject the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove A.P.'s death. We reach this conclusion primarily for two reasons. First, we conclude that under Connecticut law the corpus delicti rule is an evidentiary rule regarding the admissibility of confessions rather than a substantive rule of criminal law to be applied in reviewing the sufficiency of the state's evidence. In this case, the defendant did not object to the admissibility of his confessions at trial and has not challenged their admissibility on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that because the defendant has not challenged the admission of the confessions, the confessions may be considered by this court in analyzing the sufficiency of the state's evidence without reference to the corpus delicti rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, we conclude that, even if the defendant is permitted to raise the corpus delicti rule as part of his sufficiency of the evidence claim, the sufficiency claim fails because substantial evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, was admitted at trial to corroborate both the trustworthiness of his confessions and the fact of A.P.'s death. As a result, because the defendant's confessions may be considered by this court in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply the traditional standard of review\n   in assessing the evidence and conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that A.P. is dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin our analysis by reviewing the purpose, history, and present scope of the corpus delicti rule in\n   Connecticut. The corpus delicti rule, which is often also referred to as the corroboration rule, exists \"to protect against conviction of offenses that have not, in fact, occurred, in other words, to prevent errors in convictions based solely upon untrue confessions to nonexistent crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Doucette\n   </em>\n   described the rule as follows: \"[T]he\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   [that is, that the crime charged has been committed by someone] cannot be established by the extra-judicial confession of the defendant unsupported by corroborative evidence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Connecticut rule, which we reaffirm, is that, although the confession is evidence tending to prove both the fact that the crime [charged] was committed [by someone, that is, the corpus delicti] and the defendant's agency therein, it is not sufficient of itself to prove the former, and, without evidence [from another source] of facts also tending to prove the corpus delicti, it is not enough to warrant a conviction; and that there must be such extrinsic corroborative evidence as will, when taken in connection with the confession, establish the corpus delicti in the mind of the trier beyond a reasonable doubt.... The independent evidence must tend to establish that the crime charged has been committed and must be material and substantial, but need not be such as would establish the corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt apart from the confession.... Properly this [extrinsic] evidence should be introduced and the court satisfied of its substantial character and sufficiency to render the confession admissible, before the latter is allowed in evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In other words, in all criminal cases in which the corroboration rule is raised, the state need only present extrinsic corroborating evidence of the trustworthiness of the defendant's confession and need not offer material and substantial independent evidence of the corpus delicti itself. The court held that as long as a sufficient showing has been made that the confession is trustworthy, the confession itself may be used to meet the state's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the corpus delicti and all elements of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a somewhat cryptic footnote, however, the court in\n   <em>\n    Hafford\n   </em>\n   provides what can be described as commentary on its newly minted holding, using language that the concurring opinion here appears to construe as carving out a limited exception for homicide cases. In that footnote, the court stated: \"We note, however, that proving the trustworthiness of a defendant's confession to a crime resulting in injury or loss\n   <em>\n    often\n   </em>\n   will require evidence of that injury or loss. For example, a confession to a homicide\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   would not be trustworthy\n   without evidence of the victim's death.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20A.2d%20150\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 317 n. 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20A.2d%20150\">\n    746 A.2d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We have several observations about this footnote. First, by its use of the adverbs \"often\" and \"likely,\" our Supreme Court appeared to recognize at least the possibility that in some homicide cases, the state could be successful in establishing that a defendant's confession is sufficiently trustworthy without independent, extrinsic evidence of the victim's death. We are unconvinced that the footnote was intended to convey any deviation from the court's holding. Rather, the footnote simply conveyed that in many cases involving an injury or loss, the trustworthiness of the\n   confession might be most easily and sufficiently corroborated through evidence of the corpus delicti itself. That statement, however, does not alter the court's holding that such evidence is no longer mandatory if other sufficient corroborating evidence is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, unlike the former version of the corroboration rule expressed in\n   <em>\n    Tillman,\n   </em>\n   the touchstone of the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hafford\n   </em>\n   is the trustworthiness of the confession rather than an evaluation of whether the state has presented independent, material, and substantial evidence of the corpus delicti itself. We do not read the footnote, which contains no analysis, to change that focus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, the footnote is dictum. \"Dictum is generally defined as [a]n expression in an opinion which is not necessary to support the decision reached by the court.... A statement in an opinion with respect to a matter which is not an issue necessary for decision.... Our Supreme Court has instructed that dicta have no precedential value.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Torres,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943944\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/85/303/#p320\">\n    85 Conn.App. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=858%20A.2d%20776\">\n    858 A.2d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2607298\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/947/\">\n    271 Conn. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20A.2d%201179\">\n    861 A.2d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In\n   <em>\n    Hafford,\n   </em>\n   the victim's body was found and thus\n   there was undeniable evidence of the victim's death. As a result, there was no need for the court to opine whether a confession to a homicide may or may not be trustworthy without evidence of the victim's death. Moreover, the footnote has never been relied upon by our Supreme Court or this court. In any event, even if we were to conclude that in homicide cases the trustworthiness of a confession may only be sufficiently established by extrinsic evidence of the victim's death, we conclude, for reasons that we will subsequently discuss at greater length, that the state in this case has offered sufficient independent evidence of A.P.'s death, along with other facts, to establish both the trustworthiness of the defendant's confession and the fact of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having ascertained and articulated the specific version of the corroboration rule that is to be applied, we next turn to the issue of whether Connecticut's corroboration rule is an evidentiary rule that must be raised by objecting to the admission of the defendant's confessions at trial, or whether it is a substantive rule of criminal law that may be raised for the first time after the confessions are introduced, either at trial or in postverdict proceedings, including on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This question is not academic because if the corroboration rule is a substantive rule of criminal law, i.e., an implicit element of the state's case for which there must be sufficient evidence, then the state's failure to establish the corpus delicti could entitle a defendant to a judgment of acquittal. If the corroboration rule is simply an evidentiary rule that prohibits the admission of a defendant's confession until the state has offered material and substantial evidence to establish the trustworthiness of the defendant's confession, then any reversible error by the trial court in applying the rule\n   could only result in a new trial for a defendant rather than a judgment of acquittal. We conclude that Connecticut's corroboration rule is properly understood and applied as an evidentiary rule rather than a substantive rule of criminal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We begin our analysis by reviewing Connecticut authority on this point. Prior to 1988, our Supreme Court typically applied the corroboration rule in the context in which the defendant raised it. In other words, if a defendant at trial objected to\n   the admission of his confession on the ground that the state had not satisfied the corpus delicti rule, then, on appeal, our courts treated the claim as an evidentiary issue. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Hafford,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546800\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/274/\">\n    252 Conn. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20A.2d%20150\">\n    746 A.2d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The defendant's final claim is that ... [his] confession was inadmissible under the corpus delicti rule. We disagree.\");\n   <em>\n    State v. Tillman,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1579919\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/152/15/#p20\">\n    152 Conn. at 17-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%20494\">\n    202 A.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The defendant objected to the admission ... of each of these confessions on the ground that the state had failed to offer sufficient preliminary proof of the corpus delicti to render any of the confessions admissible.... [T]here was no error....\" [Citations omitted.] ). If, however, the defendant raised the corroboration rule as part of a sufficiency of evidence claim, then our courts reviewed the claim under that rubric. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Arnold,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517953\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/276/#p287\">\n    201 Conn. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20A.2d%20330\">\n    514 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a\n   <em>\n    naked\n   </em>\n   extrajudicial confession of guilt by one accused of crime is not sufficient to sustain a conviction when unsupported by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   corroborative evidence\" [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 1988, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    State v.

The question of whether the corroboration rule is an evidentiary rule or a substantive rule of criminal law has been the subject of significant discussion in other jurisdictions and by commentators. Professor Wayne LaFave aptly describes this debate as follows: \"In its traditional form, the corpus delicti rule may have barred the government from introducing the defendant's confession until it had first proved the corpus delicti. However, it is now generally accepted that a trial judge has the discretion to vary the order of proof, meaning that the government may introduce the defendant's confession before it has introduced the additional evidence that will establish the corpus delicti, so long as the corpus delicti is proved before the government rests. Aside from the order of proof, there is also the question of whether the corpus delicti rule simply defines the evidentiary foundation needed to support the introduction of the defendant's confession, so that the decision is to be made by the trial judge before the case is submitted to the jury, or whether on the other hand it establishes an implicit element of the government's proof, so that the trial judge's evidentiary ruling would be merely preliminary to the jury's later determination of corpus delicti. There\n   is a split of authority between the 'evidentiary foundation' and 'implicit element' approaches, though apparently most courts follow the latter view.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnotes omitted.) 1 W.

LaFave, supra, at p. 31.\n   Some federal courts have characterized the corroboration rule as a hybrid rule.

First, our Supreme Court has chosen to follow the corroboration rule established for federal courts in\n   <em>\n    Opper v. United States,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930785\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/84/#p93\">\n    348 U.S. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930785\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/84/#p93\">\n    75 S.Ct. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the typical application of that rule, the court exercises its traditional evidentiary gatekeeping function by deciding whether the defendant's extrajudicial confession is sufficiently trustworthy before allowing the jury to hear the confession evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Harris,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"542481\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/215/189/#p192\">\n    215 Conn. at 194-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20A.2d%20223\">\n    575 A.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the defendant's inculpatory statements are admitted by the trial court, the jury typically does not receive any instruction from the court regarding the corroboration rule, but instead simply assesses whether all of the evidence is sufficient to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In so doing, the jury accords the defendant's confession whatever evidentiary weight it concludes is appropriate\n   after considering all relevant evidence, including evidence of its trustworthiness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Lego v. Twomey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174724\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/477/#p486\">\n    404 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174724\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/477/#p486\">\n    92 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174724\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/477/#p486\">\n    30 L.Ed.2d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (\"[j]uries [are] at liberty to disregard confessions that are insufficiently corroborated or otherwise deemed unworthy of belief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Certainly, if the corroboration rule implicated the sufficiency of the evidence, then the jury would be expected to play some role in its application but, as previously discussed, most courts following the\n   <em>\n    Opper\n   </em>\n   rule do not instruct the jury on the corroboration rule. Moreover, in our view, an appellate court reviewing the jury's factual determination of guilt should not apply a sufficiency of the evidence standard\n   that looks at the evidence at trial through a different lens than that used by the jury in deciding whether the evidence established the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, an appellate court should review for error the trial court's gatekeeping determination that the defendant's confessions are sufficiently trustworthy to permit the jury to hear them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, there is no constitutional requirement to have a corroboration rule at all. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dickerson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11781978,3666236\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/639/\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11781978,3666236\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/639/\">\n    163 F.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (corroboration requirement \"stems from a judicially created evidentiary rule\"). Indeed, at least one state has chosen to abandon altogether the corroboration rule; see\n   <em>\n    State v. Suriner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081137\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/154/81/#p87\">\n    154 Idaho 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87-88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081137\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/154/81/#p87\">\n    294 P.3d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ; and\n   other jurisdictions, such as Connecticut, have significantly narrowed the rule over time. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Hafford,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546800\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/274/\">\n    252 Conn. at 315-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20A.2d%20150\">\n    746 A.2d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the rule itself is not constitutional in nature and jurisdictions are free to abandon it altogether, then it makes little sense to characterize it as an implicit element of the state's case that is subject to appellate review like all other unpreserved sufficiency of the evidence claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, treating the corroboration rule as an implicit element of the offense has been criticized by courts and commentators because it places juries in the difficult position of having to determine whether the state has proven the corpus delicti or otherwise met the corroboration rule after it has heard evidence regarding the defendant's confessions. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Langevin v. State,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988216\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/866/#p869\">\n    258 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   870 ; 1 W. LaFave, supra, at p. 31. As the Alaska Court of Appeals explained in\n   <em>\n    Langevin v. State,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 870: \"The implicit element approach to corpus delicti is difficult to reconcile with our law's normal view concerning a jury's ability to dispassionately assess a confession. Confessions can be powerful evidence, and courts have traditionally feared that, once a jury hears the defendant's confession, the jury will be unable to put aside this knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"One example of the cautious approach taken by courts when faced with admitting defendants' confessions is the\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   rule-the rule that, when two or more defendants are being tried jointly, if one defendant has confessed and has implicated the co-defendants, that confession cannot be admitted unless the confessing defendant takes the stand. [See\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126, 128-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968) ] ... The [United States Supreme] Court concluded that, once the jury heard that one of the defendants had confessed and had implicated one or more co-defendants, the jurors simply could not be trusted to obey an instruction that forbade them from considering that confession when assessing the guilt of the other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The implicit element approach to the corpus delicti rule suffers from this same psychological difficulty. Under this approach, if the trial judge rules that the corpus delicti is satisfied, the jury would hear the defendant's confession, only to later be asked to set the confession to one side and determine whether the government's remaining evidence is sufficient to establish the corpus delicti. One might doubt whether jurors, having heard the defendant's confession to a heinous crime, could dispassionately discharge this duty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Connecticut's corroboration rule is a\n   rule of admissibility to be decided by the court. A defendant who fails to challenge the admissibility of the defendant's confession at trial is not entitled to raise the corroboration rule on appeal because (1) the evidentiary claim is not of constitutional magnitude and, thus, cannot meet\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's second prong; see\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, the defendant admitted to Allain on the day following her disappearance that he had choked A.P. to death and disposed of her corpse in a body of water. This admission, for the reasons discussed previously in this opinion, may be used as substantive evidence that she is dead. Similarly, the defendant told Douton, a fellow inmate, that \"she was in the river\" and that \"they would never convict him because they would never find [her] body.\" The defendant also told his cellmate, Ching, about a teenage girl whom he had raped and killed on his boat before disposing of her body by hiding it in a well and later dumping it in Long Island Sound. In the same vein, but on a different occasion, he told another inmate, Buckingham, that he had accidentally choked a young girl to death while having sex with her and \"disposed of her off of a boat that he had or had access to out in the Sound.\" Although these confessions certainly differed from one another in certain respects, the core facts admitted in them were the same: that he killed A.P. by choking her, then disposed of her remains in a body of water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, there is evidence independent of the defendant's confessions from which the jury could infer that A.P. is dead. For example, A.P. disappeared during the evening hours from her house never to be seen again despite a nationwide search for her. She had been missing for more than thirteen years at the time of the defendant's trial. She left home that evening without taking money, clothes, or other personal belongings. She was fifteen years old at the time, and the jury could infer from her age and from other evidence of her mental state and maturity that she lacked the intellectual ability and life skills that would equip her with the necessary resources to live elsewhere, undiscovered by law enforcement and her family.

In his statement, Butler claimed to have seen and spoken with A.P. in Virginia Beach, Virginia, after her disappearance. Butler was not called to testify at trial, however, and the police were unable to verify any of the details he supplied as to his claimed encounter with A.P. In any event, the jury certainly was free to disbelieve this evidence because it was largely dependent on hearsay and unsupported by any other evidence.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The evidence previously discussed substantially corroborates the trustworthiness of the defendant's confessions that he acted in accordance with his intention to kill A.P., as expressed to Allain. There is direct eyewitness testimony that he sexually assaulted A.P. on the night of her disappearance. He had a motive to kill her. The behavior to which he confessed, i.e., having sex with and choking a young lady victim under sixteen years of age, is consistent with his behavior in doing the same to K.S. All of this evidence leads to the inevitable\n   conclusion that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that there was substantial evidence to corroborate the trustworthiness of the defendant's confessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, even if footnote 23 in\n   <em>\n    Hafford\n   </em>\n   required the state to offer substantial evidence of A.P.'s death that is totally independent of the defendant's confessions, we would still conclude that the state has met this burden. On the basis of the conduct and statements of the defendant during the evening hours of May 29, 1996, and the other circumstances regarding A.P.'s abrupt disappearance, all of which was supported by testimony and facts independent from his confessions, there was substantial circumstantial evidence from which the jury could conclude that A.P. is dead. Under any version of the corroboration rule, this evidence alone need not establish the death of the victim beyond a reasonable doubt, provided that this evidence and the defendant's confessions together constitute sufficient evidence from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that A.P. is dead. We conclude that the state met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the death of A.P. Specifically, the defendant argues that the evidence was sufficient at best to demonstrate an accidental homicide, but falls short of establishing intent to kill. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"[T]he specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder.

In other words, the test ... to determine whether [the] confinements or movements involved [were] such that kidnapping may also be charged and prosecuted when an offense separate from kidnapping has occurred asks whether the confinement, movement, or detention was merely incidental to the accompanying felony or whether it was significant enough, in and of itself, to warrant independent prosecution.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant confessed to Allain that he pretended to run out of gas, and that A.P. was \"freaking out, saying she had to go home.\" The defendant stated to Allain that he then dragged A.P. into the woods, \"made her run with him\" and choked her because\n   she was \"freaking out.\" According to Allain, the defendant also admitted that he tied A.P. to a tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On the basis of the defendant's admissions and the reasonable inferences that they support, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that the defendant's movement and confinement of A.P. was not merely incidental to the crime of murder because he engaged in conduct beyond that necessary to choke the victim to death. Specifically, in a series of events, the defendant prevented A.P. from returning to safety and dragged her by force into the woods and tied her to a tree. The jury was free to infer that these events were protracted and occurred along a series of independent locations. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

We further conclude, contrary to the state's position, that because the evidentiary error pertained to the veracity of a crucial state's witness, it was harmful and, therefore, constituted reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The following additional facts, as established by the record and procedural history, are relevant to the defendant's claim. In August, 2004, Allain, who already had\n   provided the police with a written statement implicating the defendant in the murder of A.P., made himself available for a polygraph examination conducted by the state police. Immediately prior to the administration of the polygraph examination, Allain was subjected to an approximately\n   ninety minute pretest interview that was conducted by the polygraph examiner, state police Trooper Tim Madden. Allain was alone with Madden for the majority of the pretest interview, although, at one point, officers who had taken Allain's earlier written statement were brought in to allow Allain to amend that statement. Although Madden informed Allain of his right to have counsel available, Allain never requested access to a lawyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The pretest interview was videotaped, as was the polygraph examination itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At the outset of the interview, Allain repeatedly made clear that he was motivated to take the test because he recently had been charged with violating his probation and had a suspended period of incarceration hanging over his head. Allain told Madden that his probation officer was \"pushing toward violating me if I don't take [the polygraph test].\" Although Madden attempted to persuade Allain that there were other and perhaps better reasons why he should take the test, the videotape of the interview plainly demonstrates the pressure Allain felt to take the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   During the pretest interview, Madden stressed to Allain several times that the police wanted Allain \"on their team.\" He suggested to Allain that the goal of the polygraph was to help Allain give a truthful and consistent statement at trial so that they could \"get\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   the defendant, whom Madden described as the \"big fish.\" Madden said he wanted Allain to pass the polygraph test because it would ensure that he would be a more reliable witness for the state against the defendant. Madden reviewed Allain's prior sworn statement with Allain in detail, and several times expressed his desire that Allain \"confirm\" his prior statement. On more than one occasion, Madden stopped to point out weak spots in Allain's narrative and arguably attempted to shape Allain's future testimony by suggesting ways in which his statement could be amended to make it more believable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Madden also repeatedly indicated that it was in Allain's best interest to cooperate with the state, and made clear to Allain that if he failed to cooperate fully, he risked being charged in this matter, something that Allain thus far had avoided. Several times during the pretest interview, Madden offered Allain assurances that even if he were to admit to more substantial involvement in A.P.'s disappearance and murder than previously disclosed, things would go better for Allain if he cooperated fully with the state. To illustrate this point, on at least six different occasions during the pretest interview, Madden and the officers who took his amended statement told Allain about the well-publicized Maryann Measles case, in which a number of persons had been implicated in the horrific rape and murder of a teenage girl in Litchfield County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   As it was explained to Allain, one of the participants\n   in the Measles murder (Maggie Bennett), who had cooperated\n   fully with the state, had \"gotten off lightly,\" and received a \"slap on the wrist,\" whereas those who had lied or had been uncooperative with the police and prosecutors received harsh punishments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The defendant contends, on the basis of a report disclosed to the defense by the state, that Allain failed the polygraph examination. Although the state conceded that the report contained a preliminary conclusion that some of Allain's answers were consistent with deception, the state argued that it would have had to conduct additional testing to determine whether Allain actually failed the polygraph test. There is no evidence that the state performed such testing despite the officers' representations to Allain that the test would definitively determine if he was telling the truth, and thus he must take and pass it before he would be permitted to testify and become eligible for favorable treatment in connection with A.P.'s rape, disappearance, and death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all testimony or evidence pertaining to the polygraph examinations of any witnesses. The court first took up the motion in limine at a hearing on February 8, 2010. At that time, defense counsel indicated his opposition to the motion, stating that it was his intention to have the videotape of Allain's pretest interview admitted into evidence along with the results of the polygraph test. With respect to the videotape of the pretest interview, the defendant stated that he would seek to offer it on the ground that it showed Madden giving Allain numerous assurances that Allain would receive favorable treatment if he cooperated,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   which defense counsel argued \"raises questions in my mind\n   about whether this young man is coming into this courtroom with the intention to do anything other than save himself.\" With respect to the polygraph results, defense counsel argued that Allain had failed the polygraph with respect to questions about whether he had killed A.P. or seen her body after she was dead, and the defendant sought to offer those results not for their truth but for the limited purpose of showing Allain's motivation to fabricate or tailor his trial testimony in order to curry favor from the state. According to defense counsel, because Allain failed the polygraph, he likely was motivated more than ever to convince the state that the defendant was the sole guilty party and that he had nothing to do with A.P.'s murder. Defense counsel stated to the court: \"I understand the general rule against the admissibility of polygraph exams and would contend that if the finder of fact were made available of the results, it do so with a limiting instruction that [Allain's] credibility is for them to determine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The state took the position that none of the evidence that the defense sought to present to the jury regarding the polygraph examination was admissible under applicable law as set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. Porter,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/\">\n    241 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state argued that, as with any witness, the defendant could question Allain about whether his testimony was the result of coercion or assurances from the state. The state also argued that the defendant could call Madden to testify. The state nonetheless agreed with the defendant that the court needed to review the pretest videotape prior to ruling on the motion in limine. The court agreed and passed on ruling on the motion until after it had viewed the videotapes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On February 11, 2010, the day that Allain was scheduled to testify, the court returned to the issue of the polygraph examination and the videotape evidence, having had an opportunity to review the videotapes of the pretest and the examination itself. The court heard\n   additional arguments from the defense and the state, each of which essentially reasserted the arguments made at the prior hearing. The state's position remained that the videotape of the pretest interview, like the polygraph results themselves, was \"polygraph evidence\" as that term was used by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   in reaffirming \"our per se rule against the use of polygraph evidence in Connecticut courts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Porter,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/\">\n    241 Conn. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defense countered that, at least with respect to the admission of the videotape of the pretest, this did not present a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   issue because the\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   holding was limited to the scientific reliability and admissibility of polygraph results, and because the court in\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   never considered or addressed whether the existing bar should extend to any reference to the term polygraph or to other types of evidence related to the administration of polygraph tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In an oral ruling following argument, the court refused to admit the videotape as evidence at trial. The trial court appears to have agreed with the state's position that the videotape constituted inadmissible polygraph evidence, reasoning as follows: \"Well, I guess in part it depends on how you define the phrase polygraph evidence, but\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   does indicate and I quote that: Polygraph evidence should remain per se inadmissible in all trial court proceedings in which the rules of evidence apply, and for all trial purposes, in Connecticut courts.

Thus, because the existing rule under consideration in\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   was a per se prohibition against the use of polygraph results or evidence of a witness' willingness to take a polygraph test-usually the defendant-we construe the\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   court's use of the term \"polygraph evidence\" as a shorthand reference to those two specific types of evidence, which were the only evidence associated with the rule of admissibility under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   We are aware of no other appellate decision in which our courts have been asked to directly address whether a videotape of a pretest interview constitutes excludable polygraph evidence.

In concluding that\n   the defense had not been unfairly surprised by the evidence because the defendant was aware of the videotape of the pretest interview and had asked the state about it prior to trial, this court rejected the defendant's argument that \"he believed that the tape was unusable as evidence,\" noting: \"there is no reason that the substance of the statements made by the defendant during that interview would not have been admissible evidence at trial.\" Id., at 401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20A.3d%20446\">\n    42 A.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state never advanced either ground in support of excluding the videotape from evidence. The videotape of the pretest interview was not \"polygraph evidence\" and, accordingly, did not fall within the scope of the per se exclusionary rule reaffirmed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Porter.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   decision, or in any other case law of which we are aware, countenances the trial court's decision to preclude all evidentiary references to the term \"polygraph\" itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not necessary for the court to preclude from evidence the mere fact that a polygraph examination had occurred.

Because the court's ruling regarding the admissibility of the videotape of the pretest interview was not made on the basis of a correct view of the law but on the court's mistaken belief that the videotape was inadmissible \"polygraph evidence,\" the court improperly excluded the videotape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Furthermore, upon consideration of the entire record, we do not have a fair assurance that the exclusion of the videotape of the pretest interview did not substantially affect the verdict.

According to the state, the court only precluded the defendant from making references to the polygraph test itself, and, therefore, the defendant could, and did, question Allain about any motivations, inducements, or promises made to him prior to his testifying. The state also suggests that its case against the defendant was strong. The state contends that although the evidence of A.P.'s death was largely circumstantial, it was overwhelming. The state also asserts that \"evidence of motive, means and opportunity was abundant,\" and notes that the defendant confessed to the murder to at least four different individuals. We disagree that the defendant has failed to demonstrate harm under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The videotape of the pretest interview was offered for the limited and proper purpose of showing Allain's motivation for testifying in favor of the state against the defendant.

The tape shows Madden and other officers repeatedly trying to convince Allain that it would be in his best interest to testify favorably for the state, indicating that they wanted him \"on the team\" and suggesting that if he\n   cooperated in getting a conviction of the defendant, he would receive favorable treatment and likely escape any criminal charges himself. Moreover, from the videotaped interview, the jury would have had the opportunity to more fully assess Allain's mindset in agreeing to testify against the defendant, including his significant concerns regarding his fear of being charged with violating his probation. Additionally, the jury could reasonably conclude from the videotape that Madden attempted to shape Allain's story about the defendant's actions on May 29, 1996, in order to make it more plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It is undisputed that Allain's trial testimony was an integral component, if not the linchpin, of the state's case against the defendant. He was the only witness with any direct knowledge of the events that led up to A.P.'s disappearance and his testimony corroborated the reliability of the defendant's alleged jailhouse confessions. Because the state's case against the defendant turned in large part on Allain's testimony in order to secure a conviction, the jury's assessment of Allain's credibility was crucial. Accordingly, any evidence of Allain's bias and motivation to tailor his testimony in favor of the prosecution's case was critically important to the defense, and the videotape of the pretest interview was the most persuasive evidence available to the defendant because it reveals Allain's demeanor and concerns in living color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The state correctly notes that the defendant was not precluded from raising during cross-examination the fact that Allain had been interviewed by the police or from exploring whether the state had offered Allain any incentives to testify against the defendant or pressured him to testify in a particular way. Our review of Allain's cross-examination shows that the defense challenged Allain's credibility by pointing out evidence tending to demonstrate that Allain had changed or augmented\n   aspects of his story on a number of occasions. Cross-examination highlighted a number of details that he testified to on direct examination that he never disclosed in his prior written statements. The defense questioned Allain about his \"interview\"\n   with Madden and, without mentioning that it occurred prior to a polygraph examination, noted the fact that the police believed he was not telling the truth about his involvement in A.P.'s murder, suggesting that Allain had incentive to cooperate with the state and implicate the defendant in order to keep the investigation away from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   No cross-examination, however, could have substituted for or been as impactful as to Allain's motive and bias as the direct evidence afforded by the videotape. Although the defendant was allowed to question Allain regarding his \"interview\" with Madden, the defense was precluded, among other things, from revealing the context in which that interview occurred. That context was significant. The videotape reveals that the law enforcement officers used the context of the polygraph examination process to pressure Allain to inculpate the defendant in the (lengthy) pretest interview in the following way. Madden emphasized to Allain that the polygraph examination would definitively determine whether he was going to be part of the state's \"team\" that would \"get\" the defendant, \"the big fish\" in the case, and possibly receive a slap on the wrist himself, or, conversely, whether he would be fully prosecuted like the noncooperating witnesses in the Measles case. In our view, the videotape tends to show, among other things, the subtle but significant pressure placed on Allain by law enforcement through the means of the specific factual context in which the pretest interview occurred. No amount of generic questioning of Allain on cross-examination, without clarifying this important context, would show the precise degree, nature, and effect of both the inducements and pressure on Allain\n   to inculpate the defendant that the videotape reveals. In other words, exclusion of the videotape and all references to polygraph deprived the defense of its best opportunity to show the degree of pressure, inducements and manipulation exerted on Allain. We are convinced that had the jury been given an opportunity to view the pretest interview, the evidence may have significantly altered how the jury assessed Allain's testimony as a whole, possibly raising reasonable doubt about the guilt of the defendant. The defendant, therefore, is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Our conclusion that a new trial is warranted because the court improperly excluded evidence of bias is dispositive of the defendant's appeal, thus eliminating the need to address the remainder of the defendant's evidentiary claims. Nevertheless, because the defendant's claims that the court improperly admitted prior misconduct evidence and improperly precluded the defendant from presenting expert testimony concerning the reliability of jailhouse informants are likely to arise again on remand, we also address those claims.

First, the defendant challenges the court's admission of testimony by K.S., a former girlfriend of Allain, that the defendant choked and raped her six months prior to the rape and murder of A.P. Second, the defendant challenges the admission of testimony by Ching that, during his time as the defendant's cellmate, the defendant asked Ching for his opinion about whether the defendant should \"do in\" Allain. The state responds that, in each instance, the court properly admitted the challenged testimony under a recognized\n   exception\n   to the general rule precluding evidence of a defendant's prior misconduct or on other grounds. See Conn.Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5. For the reasons we will set forth, we agree with the state that the court properly admitted the challenged testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Before turning to a discussion of each of the defendant's claims, we set forth the legal principles and standard of review generally applicable to the admissibility of evidence of prior misconduct. Section 4-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \"(a) Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is inadmissible to prove the bad character, propensity, or criminal tendencies of that person except as provided in subsection (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \"(b) Evidence of other sexual misconduct is admissible in a criminal case to establish that the defendant had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant and compulsive sexual misconduct if: (1) the case involves aberrant and compulsive sexual misconduct; (2) the trial court finds that the evidence is relevant to a charged offense in that the other sexual misconduct is not too remote in time, was allegedly committed upon a person similar to the alleged victim, and was otherwise similar in nature and circumstances to the aberrant and compulsive sexual misconduct at issue in the case; and (3) the trial court finds that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \"(c) Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is admissible for purposes other than those specified in subsection (a), such as to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, common plan or scheme, absence of mistake or accident, knowledge, a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime, or to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \"(d) In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person in relation to a charge, claim or defense is in issue, proof shall be made by evidence of specific instances of the person's conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Under this rule, evidence of a defendant's prior misconduct generally is inadmissible to show that a defendant committed the crime charged or to show that the defendant is predisposed to commit that crime. Nevertheless, otherwise inadmissible prior misconduct evidence may be admitted if it is offered, not for propensity purposes, but \"to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

With those principles in mind, we now turn to the specific claims raised by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly allowed K.S., a former girlfriend of Allain's, to testify that the defendant had choked and raped her in November, 1995. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this aspect of the defendant's claim. In November, 1995, K.S. was thirteen years old and a girlfriend of Allain. Allain introduced K.S. to the defendant. On November 26, 1995, at approximately 10 p.m., K.S. was picked up by the defendant in his pickup truck. She went with the defendant to his trailer, which was behind the homes of the defendant's parents, believing that Allain would join them later. The defendant provided K.S. with beer and\n   whiskey, which she drank while she waited for Allain to arrive. The defendant received a call on his cell phone, which he told K.S. was from Allain, who could not leave home to join them. K.S. asked to leave at that point, but the defendant told her that she was not going anywhere. She tried to open the trailer door to leave, but it was locked. At that point, the defendant pushed K.S. over to his bed, where he choked and raped her. At about 5 a.m. the defendant left the trailer to make a phone call in his parents' house, threatening K.S. that he would hunt her down and kill her if she tried to leave the trailer. After the defendant left, K.S., fearing that this might be her only opportunity \"to make it out alive,\" ran to the nearest home and called the police and her father. The defendant later was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine giving notice of its intent to call K.S. as a witness who would testify about being raped by the defendant. The state primarily argued that her testimony was admissible to show a common plan or scheme, although the state also argued that it was admissible to show motive, intent, identity and to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony. The defendant filed a written opposition to the motion in limine arguing that the testimony was not relevant to any exception to the general rule barring the admission of prior misconduct evidence and, alternatively, that the evidence was far more prejudicial than probative. Prior to ruling on the admissibility of K.S.'s testimony, K.S. testified about the prior rape to the court outside the presence of the jury. Following that testimony, and after hearing additional oral argument, the court ruled that K.S.'s testimony was admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The court, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Snelgrove,\n   </em>\n   supra, 288 Conn. at 760,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20A.2d%20165\">\n    954 A.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , first determined that because the defendant was charged with the capital felony of causing the death of A.P. in the course of committing a sexual assault in the first degree, this case properly was viewed as a sex\n   crime case despite the state's not having charged the defendant directly with a sexual assault. On the basis of that determination, the court found that the more liberal test set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713810\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/418/#p473\">\n    288 Conn. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , applied to the admission of K.S.'s testimony. Applying that test, the court found that evidence of the defendant's sexual assault of K.S. was relevant to the defendant's propensity to engage in aberrant and criminal sexual behavior because it was not too remote in time, the incident was similar in many ways to the sexual assault that led to A.P.'s murder, and it was committed upon a similar person. The court also found that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. On the basis of those findings, the court ruled that K.S.'s testimony was admissible for propensity purposes and instructed the jury that, if it believed the testimony, the jury could consider it for \"its bearing on any matter to which [the jury found] it relevant, including, specifically, motive and whether the defendant acted under a common scheme or plan.\" After K.S. testified to the jury about the 1995 incident, the court repeated its limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in admitting K.S.'s testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Our review is guided by subsection (b) of \u00a7 4-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, set forth previously, which codifies the exception, first recognized in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   that evidence of prior sexual misconduct may be admitted to show a defendant's propensity to engage in similar misconduct. Before permitting K.S. to testify, the court made all necessary determinations regarding each of the three elements set forth in the rule necessary to admit evidence of prior sexual misconduct for propensity purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The first requirement of the rule pertains to the applicability of the exception and requires that the court\n   determine whether the case in which the prior misconduct evidence is offered \"involves aberrant and compulsive sexual misconduct....\" Conn.Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5(b)(1). The court properly determined that such conduct was involved in the present case. As the trial court indicated, that determination does not hinge on whether the defendant was charged with a sexual assault in the present case, but only on whether the prior misconduct and the offense presently charged each were \"driven by an aberrant sexual compulsion, regardless of whether the prior misconduct or the conduct at issue resulted in sexual offense charges.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, the defendant, in furtherance of the capital felony for which he was charged, was alleged to have used a teenage boy to isolate a teenage girl and then raped and choked her. Such behavior-followed by threats of death in the case of K.S. and murder in the case of A.P.-constituted aberrant and potentially compulsive sexual misconduct sufficient to support the court's initial determination regarding the applicability of the propensity exception in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Second, the court was required to determine if K.S.'s testimony about the prior sexual misconduct was relevant to the offense currently charged. The relevancy requirement is met if the prior sexual misconduct \"is not too remote in time, was allegedly committed upon a person similar to the alleged victim, and was otherwise similar in nature and circumstances to\" the misconduct in the present case. Conn.Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5(b)(2). The court properly found that each of these requirements was met. The defendant's rape of K.S. occurred just six months prior to the sexual assault and murder of A.P., and, thus, clearly was not too remote in time. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

The court also properly determined that the sexual assaults were committed upon similar persons on the basis of its findings that \"these were both very young girls-one, thirteen; one fifteen-from the same town who both were girlfriends of [Allain].\" Last, the sexual assaults at issue were otherwise sufficiently similar in nature and circumstances for the reasons cited by the court, including that both incidents involved Allain, who had arranged for the young victims to meet the defendant, both incidents occurred late at night, the defendant had provided alcohol to both victims, both victims were driven by the defendant to a secluded location where they were both sexually assaulted and choked by the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20325\">\n    313 Conn. at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%201238\">\n    96 A.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding trial court properly determined charged crime and uncharged misconduct sufficiently similar to satisfy\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   exception because both acts involved sexual assaults in which victim was choked by attacker).\n   Finally, the trial court properly considered whether the probative value of K.S.'s testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect before admitting K.S.'s testimony, and provided the jury with a limiting instruction that was based upon the instruction set forth in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   the purpose of which was to limit any prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is well settled that \"[t]he primary responsibility for conducting the balancing test to determine whether the evidence is more probative than prejudicial rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion....

Although the defendant claims that the admission of K.S.'s testimony \"created a very strong likelihood that the jury's emotions were unduly roused,\" and that this prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value, we are unconvinced. Clearly, given the similarities between the sexual assaults of K.S. and A.P., K.S.'s testimony was highly probative. In a case in which the defendant is accused of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering a young woman and disposing of her body, it is unlikely that the addition of K.S.'s testimony would have unduly roused the emotions or passions of the jury further. Nor did the testimony consume an unreasonable amount of time, raise any distracting side issues, or surprise the defense. On the basis of our review, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of K.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The defendant also contends that the court improperly permitted Ching to testify that the defendant had asked him his opinion on whether the defendant should kill Allain. The state argued at trial that this was not evidence of uncharged misconduct, and, therefore, was not improperly admitted as such and argues on appeal that the court properly admitted the testimony as relevant evidence of the defendant's consciousness of guilt. We agree with the state on both points and, thus, reject the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Ching testified at trial that he had shared a cell with the defendant for two weeks at the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center in 2007. During that time, the defendant told Ching that he and a younger man had taken a fifteen year old girl out on his boat, gotten\n   her drunk, and raped her. Ching did not recall the defendant giving him the name of either the girl or the young man. Ching testified that the defendant had admitted to killing the girl after she \"started flipping out,\" and that \"[t]he young man that was with him refused to cooperate in helping with this\" and \"he killed her on his own and hid the body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   When the state inquired during its direct examination of Ching whether the defendant had talked to Ching about the young man, Ching responded: \"He asked my opinion if I thought he should, you know, do the guy in....\" After the state followed up by asking Ching how he interpreted that inquiry, defense counsel objected on relevancy grounds, arguing that although what his client said to Ching was admissible, Ching's interpretation of what he said was not. The court overruled the objection and counsel then asked to be heard outside the presence of the jury. After the jury was excused, defense counsel argued that although the state had disclosed its intent to offer evidence about\n   the defendant's prior sexual assault of K.S., it had never disclosed that it intended to present evidence that the defendant had discussed killing a witness. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that it was highly prejudicial to have this information, which he described as evidence of uncharged misconduct, blurted out to the jury absent any prior notice to the defendant. The state responded that it did not believe the information disclosed was uncharged misconduct, and, therefore, they had no obligation to disclose it. The state viewed the testimony as part of the conversation between the inmates and was not claiming that the defendant took any affirmative steps to kill anyone or to make anyone fear that they were going to be killed. The court took a brief recess during which the court met with counsel in chambers off the record.\n   Following that recess, the court indicated that the parties had agreed to a further proffer regarding the witness. In response to questions by the state, outside the presence of the jury, Ching disclosed that he had interpreted the defendant's inquiry about \"doing\" the young man as asking Ching's opinion about whether he should kill the young man who was with him on the boat. Ching further disclosed that he had told the defendant that, if he was in the defendant's situation, he would do so, and that this same conversation had been repeated three or four times over the course of the two weeks that Ching was housed with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   After hearing additional argument from both sides, the court denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial and ruled that Ching's testimony was admissible, treating it as prior misconduct evidence, but ruling that it was nonetheless admissible because it was relevant to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony and because its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. When the jury returned, the court gave a limiting instruction in which it indicated that the state had offered evidence of uncharged misconduct, that it was admitted not to prove the defendant's bad character or tendency to commit criminal acts, but only to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony, and, that if the jury believed the testimony, it was to consider the evidence only for that purpose and not as evidence demonstrating a propensity to commit the crimes charged. The examination of Ching continued. The state never asked any additional questions regarding the defendant's inquiries about \"doing in\" Allain. Defense counsel revisited the topic on cross-examination, getting Ching to admit that he had never mentioned that aspect of his conversation with the defendant in his prior statements to the police, and that he had first brought the issue to the attention of the state only a few weeks ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The defendant contends on appeal that Ching's testimony that the defendant had mused about whether he should have Allain killed constituted evidence of uncharged misconduct that was not previously disclosed to the defense, and that the court improperly denied its motion for a mistrial claiming unfair surprise and improper admission of the testimony for corroborative purposes. According to the defendant, nothing about the challenged portion of Ching's testimony corroborated the state's allegations that the defendant had sexually assaulted, kidnapped, or killed A.P., and, even assuming that Ching's testimony was true, it tended to show only that the defendant was angry at Allain for falsely accusing him of murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   At trial, in addition to arguing that Ching's statement was admissible for the purpose of corroborating crucial prosecution testimony, the state argued, in the alternative, that the testimony did not constitute\n   evidence of misconduct. The court rejected that argument. In chambers, the state also advanced the argument that Ching's statement was admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Although the state did not pursue that ground in its arguments before the trial court, in its appellate brief, the state urges us to conclude that Ching's testimony was relevant to show the defendant's consciousness of guilt and thus admissible on that alternate ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Having reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly labeled Ching's testimony as uncharged misconduct committed by the defendant. Ching's statement indicated only that the defendant had spoken to Ching about the possibility of killing Allain. Although such thoughts or ideations may certainly have reflected poorly upon the defendant in the eyes of the jury, without more, they do not constitute \"a clear expression of prior misconduct on the part of the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the defendant in the present case stopped short of directly threatening a witness, a jury nonetheless reasonably could have inferred that his statement to Ching constituted circumstantial evidence of his desire to keep his criminal activities from being revealed and, thus, his consciousness of guilt. In addition to being relevant evidence, nothing in the record before us leaves us with the impression that Ching's statement was so unduly prejudicial as to overcome its probative value. The jury had already heard evidence about the defendant's violent nature. Ching's statement that the defendant had been thinking about killing Allain was therefore unlikely to have unduly aroused the jurors' emotions. We accordingly reject the defendant's claim that Ching's statement was improperly admitted.\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   EXCLUSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, we turn to the defendant's claim that the court improperly excluded expert testimony regarding the use and effect of informant testimony. According to the defendant, because the case against him depended heavily upon the testimony of jailhouse informants, some if not all of whom benefited from cooperating with the state, the court should have permitted him to present expert testimony to the jury concerning the general unreliability of such evidence. The defendant contends that the information that he sought to present is not within the knowledge of the average juror, nor was it supplied to them through other evidence or by the court's instructions. The defendant claims that the court not only abused its discretion by precluding the expert testimony, but that it also violated his right to due process, and his rights under the sixth amendment to confront witnesses and to present a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In response, the state argues that the court properly excluded the expert testimony because the subject matter of the testimony was within the ken of the average juror and because allowing the testimony would have invaded the province of the jury, namely, its exclusive function as trier of fact to assess the credibility of witnesses. We agree with the defendant that the court abused its discretion by precluding the expert testimony offered by the defendant. We hold that expert testimony concerning the reliability of informant testimony should be admitted if the court on remand determines that the expert is qualified and the proffered testimony is relevant to the specific issues in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defense disclosed Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School, as a witness who the defendant intended to call regarding the general unreliability of informant testimony. The state filed a motion in limine to exclude Natapoff's testimony, arguing that (1) the substance of the anticipated testimony concerned matters within the general knowledge of jurors, and (2) the witness' opinions would invade the exclusive province of the jury to assess the credibility of witnesses. The state also argued, in essence, that Natapoff's testimony was unnecessary because the state\n   anticipated that the court would instruct the jury concerning testimony by jailhouse informants in accordance with our Supreme Court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    State v.

These informants wait until after they've testified to request favors-a request that is generally answered....

After testifying as to her educational background and professional credentials, which included authoring various scholarly works and testifying before Congress on the subject of informants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Natapoff testified about the inherent problems associated with the use of jailhouse informants. According to Natapoff, the manner in which informants are used in the criminal justice system is largely unregulated and secretive, and the public has very little knowledge about the process. She testified that jailhouse informants are known to fabricate information because they are aware that they can barter with the state for favorable treatment on the basis of such information. In particular, Natapoff stated: \"We have evidence of\n   collusion between jailhouse informants in which informants cooperate in order to create stories that they corroborate in order to persuade the government to use that information. We know that sometimes informants and criminal offenders can be very entrepreneurial about coming up with information, knowing that the system will likely reward them in some way.\" The hope for favorable treatment also provides a strong incentive for informants to search out any source of information, reliable or not, so that they can trade that information to the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Natapoff also testified about studies that demonstrate that the usual cautionary instructions given to jurors about informant testimony generally are not effective and that even if jurors are made aware of and cautioned about an informant's compensation or other motivation to fabricate testimony, jurors are ill-equipped to accurately evaluate an informant's credibility and often will accept the testimony as true. One study published by Northwestern Law School, discussed by Natapoff during her testimony, indicated that approximately 45 percent of all the wrongful capital convictions identified in this country were the direct result of an informant who was lying. According to Natapoff, informants' stories are often difficult to corroborate or to contradict, especially in cases in which the informant's testimony is the central evidence against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On cross-examination, the state questioned Natapoff about the fact that permitting experts to testify before juries was not among the reforms Natapoff had proposed in her book and asked Natapoff what information she believed a jury could not be expected to have knowledge of based upon common sense alone. Natapoff responded as follows: \"I think that a lay person on a jury cannot know the extent of the benefits and expectations that an informant in our system would reasonably expect to get; that a promise or an understanding made\n   by a police officer or prosecutor to an informant, and the history of the use of informants in our\n   jails and prisons give informants and law enforcement knowledge about benefits that a lay person couldn't understand and wouldn't see from the outside.... I think a lay person would not expect or could not be expected to understand how much effort informants sometimes put into coming up with information from stealing files from other inmates to calling outside sources and asking for resources from the newspapers and media from outside sources. They couldn't be expected to understand the culture in jails; the understanding that this entrepreneurial approach to information is expected. A lay person on a jury could not be expected to know how infrequent perjury prosecutions are for informants who turn out to be lying. In polling jurors after trials or after cases where a wrongful conviction is found, you sometimes hear jurors say that they think that if an informant lies, they'll be prosecuted for perjury but because that is so rare, that expectation is misguided, although it's a widely shared expectation, I think, among the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   At the conclusion of Natapoff's testimony, the court heard additional argument from the parties. The state argued that making credibility determinations fell within the exclusive province of the jury as fact finders \"into which no expert may venture,\" quoting this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Favoccia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059250\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/119/1/#p29\">\n    119 Conn.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%201081\">\n    986 A.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20770\">\n    306 Conn. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201002\">\n    51 A.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The state further argued that any concerns that the defense sought to alleviate through Natapoff's testimony would be adequately covered by the instruction mandated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Arroyo.\n   </em>\n   The state also made a direct analogy between the testimony that the defense sought to elicit from Natapoff and expert testimony concerning the reliability of eyewitness testimony, which, at that time, the Supreme Court had held\n   may be properly excluded. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Natapoff's testimony would provide only background information and would describe and put into context the rather opaque circumstances surrounding the development and use of jailhouse informants. Further, the defense disagreed that an\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   instruction offered all of the same information, particularly in light of the studies showing that such instructions had no appreciable difference on jurors. Finally, the defense noted that Natapoff's testimony was especially relevant in the present case because the state's case was built largely on the testimony of informants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   After taking a short recess, the court rendered the following oral ruling: \"It is the court's ruling that the proffered expert testimony of Professor Natapoff would indeed invade the very core function of the jury; that is, to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and so I am going to sustain the state's objection to her testimony. The court did have an opportunity to review the recent\n   <em>\n    Favoccia\n   </em>\n   case ... which confirms that credibility determinations are within the exclusive province of the fact finder. The subject matter about which Professor Natapoff would testify is\n   not, in the court's view,\n   outside the common experience, ken, or common knowledge of the jury; the court cites [\n   <em>\n    State v. McClendon,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520016\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/248/572/#p586\">\n    248 Conn. at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20A.2d%201107\">\n    730 A.2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Although Professor Natapoff may reference certain studies and research about which the jury may not be aware, that does not make her conclusions about the marketplace or exchange of information for certain benefits outside the common experience or ken of the jury. The court has given wide latitude throughout the cross-examination of the witnesses concerning any possible consideration for testimony or anticipation of benefits in exchange for testifying for the state, and the jury certainly will have that information to consider in making its credibility determinations. Finally, of course, the court will be instructing the jury in accordance with [\n   <em>\n    State v. Arroyo,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145506\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/558/#p569\">\n    292 Conn. at 569-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201254\">\n    973 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], as to the testimony of incarcerated witnesses. So, for these reasons, the court sustains the state's objections to the testimony of Professor Natapoff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Accordingly, Natapoff was not permitted to testify before the jury. Later, as part of the court's jury charge, the court gave an instruction regarding informant testimony, cautioning the jurors to consider such testimony with \"particular care\" and to \"scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   At the outset, we note that \"[a] witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, education or otherwise may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise concerning scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge, if the testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue.\" Conn.Code Evid. \u00a7 7-2. \"[I]n order to be admissible, the proffered expert's knowledge must be directly applicable to the matter specifically in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, expert testimony may be admitted if the witness has a special skill or knowledge, beyond the ken of the average juror, that, as properly applied, would be helpful to the determination of an ultimate issue....

The court provided scant analysis for its decision, essentially stating two reasons for precluding Natapoff from testifying as an expert. First, the court stated that Natapoff's testimony would invade the jury's core function of assessing the credibility of witnesses. Second, the court concluded that the subject matter of Natapoff's testimony was within the common knowledge of the jury. Both rationales, however, are belied by the substance of Natapoff's unchallenged proffer, and our Supreme Court's acknowledgement of the inherent unreliability of informant testimony in\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   and the need to further educate jurors on this topic. Moreover, the case law cited by the court is not controlling and does not support the court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We begin with the court's conclusion that Natapoff's testimony would invade the jury's exclusive province to determine the credibility of witnesses. The court indicated that it reached its decision on the basis of its review of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Favoccia,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059250\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/119/1/#p29\">\n    119 Conn.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%201081\">\n    986 A.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a case that was cited by the state. The court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Favoccia,\n   </em>\n   however, is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Favoccia\n   </em>\n   involved the sexual abuse of a child. The issue before this court was whether a psychologist, who was offered by the state as an expert witness to explain to the jury about characteristics and behaviors commonly exhibited by child sex abuse victims, improperly was permitted to testify about the particular victim in that case and if she had exhibited the type of behavior described by the expert because such testimony constituted inadmissible vouching for the credibility of a witness. We held that the expert's testimony \"crossed the line of permissible expert opinion\" because her testimony \"went beyond a general discussion of characteristics of sexual abuse victims and offered opinions, based\n   on her review of the videotaped forensic interview and other documentation, as to whether this particular victim in fact exhibited the specified behaviors....\" Id., at 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%201081\">\n    986 A.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As long as the expert does not directly opine about a particular witness' credibility or, as in\n   <em>\n    Favoccia,\n   </em>\n   testify in such a way as to vouch indirectly for or bolster the credibility of a witness, the expert's testimony would not invade the province of the jury to decide credibility and may be admitted.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Natapoff, in fact, offered no testimony regarding any of the particular informants in this case, either with respect to their status as informants, how they had obtained their information, or their potential reliability as witnesses. The defense clearly indicated to the court during argument that the defendant did not intend to ask Natapoff about the present case, and that Natapoff had no specific knowledge of\n   the case or the informants involved. Natapoff's testimony, as proffered, was narrowly tailored to provide only general information related to informant testimony and its unreliability, an issue clearly recognized by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our review of her testimony reveals that it could have aided the jury in making its own informed and independent assessment regarding the credibility of the informants in the present case. Accordingly, the court abused its discretion by excluding Natapoff's testimony on the ground that it invaded the province of the jury to decide the credibility of witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The court also abused its discretion when it concluded that the subject matter of Natapoff's testimony was within the common knowledge of the average juror. The court provided no legal or factual basis for that determination. The court never expressly stated that it was rejecting\n   Natapoff's testimony or that it found unreliable the underlying studies, some of which had already been cited with approval by our Supreme Court. The state offered nothing to counter Natapoff's testimony that, based on these studies, expert testimony would provide significant information to the jury that is not known by the average juror. Indeed, we are aware of no empirical studies, nor were any provided by the state, that suggest the subject matter of Natapoff's testimony was well within the knowledge of the average lay person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   To the contrary, Natapoff testified that even if average jurors had some limited knowledge related to the use of jailhouse informants, they did not understand the true culture of jails or the full extent to which informants could benefit in our criminal justice system. She explained that a juror could not be expected to understand the efforts informants put forth to obtain their information or the possible sources for that information. Further, according to Natapoff's research,\n   jurors often have a misguided understanding regarding the consequences an informant likely will face if he or she lies. She explained that although perjury prosecutions of informants are rare, jurors nevertheless often believe the threat of perjury charges plays an important role in ensuring that an informant tells the truth. Natapoff testified that without access to background information, jurors are ill-equipped to assess properly an informant's credibility, even in the face of an instruction asking them to take great care in doing so. In the face of Natapoff's uncontested testimony that jurors were not fully aware of the dangers in relying on informant testimony and that expert testimony could assist jurors in properly evaluating an informant's credibility, the court abused its discretion by concluding that the substance of Natapoff's testimony was within the ken of the average juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In finding that the information Natapoff had to convey was within the ken of the average juror, the court cited favorably without discussion to our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In part because of this case, the corpus delicti rule, requiring some evidence of actual death besides the confession of a person accused of a killing, eventually became a part of the common law.

Furthermore,\n   although I agree with the majority that, in this case, there was sufficient independent evidence of the victim's death. I respectfully dissent from that portion of part I A which holds that the corpus delicti rule is merely evidentiary and independent proof of death is unnecessary in a murder case. First, this holding is unnecessary to the decision in a murder case like this where we all agree that there is independent evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, of the death of A.P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Secondly, there are sound reasons to require independent circumstantial evidence to avoid convictions that are based solely on false confessions. That rationale is especially compelling in a case like this where there was at least a scintilla of evidence that a former neighbor and other persons reported seeing A.P. alive after her disappearance. Although the jury was free to reject this evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   its existence leads me to conclude that this is not the time nor is this the case to conclude that the corpus delicti rule has no place in our review of evidentiary sufficiency of the defendant's murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The defendant claims that despite his lack of preservation by objecting to the testimony of others who testified to the admissions made by the defendant, his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewable.

The corpus delicti rule exists, going back to\n   <em>\n    Perry's Case,\n   </em>\n   so that persons are not convicted of murdering someone who is not dead based\n   on confessions or admissions that are ultimately unreliable.

Here, as the majority's opinion points out, there was circumstantial evidence, summarized in the majority's opinion, which, together with the inferences to be drawn from it, would permit the jury to conclude that the victim, A.P., was dead. Therefore, both\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hafford\n   </em>\n   are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Because I agree with the majority that there was ample independent evidence apart from the defendant's confession that the defendant caused A.P.'s death, I am of the opinion that although the corpus delicti rule was properly invoked, nonetheless the evidence stands the test of sufficiency in providing both circumstantial evidence of the death of A.P., and the reliability of the defendant's confessory admissions to intentionally causing it. I further agree with the majority that the intent to kill may also be inferred from the evidence that was before the jury. I, too, summarize the evidence and the resulting reasonable possible inferences to be drawn therefrom, from which the jury could have concluded\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that A.P. was dead and that the defendant's confession was sufficiently corroborated. A.P. was a young girl of only fifteen years old at the time she went missing. She lived with her parents while attending high school. P.J. Allain, the state's witness, admitted at trial that she had been importuned by him to sneak out of her home on the night of her disappearance to go with him to a party, A.P. and Allain to be driven there by the defendant in his truck. Jackie Scott, a close friend of A.P.'s, testified that A.P. told her that she was going to a party with Allain on the night that she disappeared. There was independent direct evidence from the testimony of the defendant's former wife that the defendant owned both a truck and a boat. From the evidence of\n   A.P.'s agreement to sneak out to be with Allain, the jury was free to infer that her purpose in sneaking out of her house was not to run away but to be with Allain. She had no independent income, nor was there evidence that she had any skills or training that would permit her to support herself, from which facts the jury was free to infer that because of her reliance on parental\n   support she did not freely choose permanently to leave home precipitously bereft of any alternative to that necessary support. She was last seen in her home on May 29, 1996. She never returned to it. Other than the clothes on her back, she took no personal items with her. The jury was free to infer from that failure to do so, that a person choosing to run away would have taken some such items with her and that she did not run away. Her mother, father, grandmother, and other close family members never heard from her again, from the May 29, 1996 date of her disappearance through the March 2, 2010 date of the verdict in the defendant's trial nearly fourteen years later. She had been particularly close to her mother and grandmother prior to her disappearance. The jury was free to infer from this lack of all communication with those closest to her, that she was no longer on this earth, because it was logical that she would have communicated with some or all of these family members sometime in the intervening fourteen years, were she still alive. Allain testified that he last saw A.P. in the defendant's truck, as he was being let off at his home. This evidence would permit a rational inference that she was last seen with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   There was a portion of the defendant's confessory statements that indicated that he had cut up A.P.'s body and put it into lobster traps where she would never be found. Additionally, there was corroborative direct\n   testimony that the defendant was a commercial fisherman and owned a boat and lobster traps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This circumstantial evidence convinces me that the state offered sufficient independent evidence permitting the jury to infer that A.P. was dead, even though her body had not been found, and corroborating the trustworthiness of the confessory admissions made by the defendant to others, with whom he was jailed, that he had killed her. General Statutes \u00a7 54-83 provides that in cases like this and the accused is charged with a capital felony where the crime is punishable by death or life imprisonment without the possibility of release, no person may be convicted without the testimony of two witnesses. However, the state can satisfy its statutory burden by producing more than one witness to provide circumstantial evidence from which the jury may infer the defendant's guilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.
