On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in (1) failing to determine that his conduct qualified as constitutionally protected under the first amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, of the\n   Connecticut constitution;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) finding that the conduct constituted stalking when the evidence was insufficient. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff filed an application for a protective order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-16a\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on April 4, 2015, alleging that he was being stalked pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181d\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a\n   hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After citing the standard for stalking pursuant to \u00a7 53a-181d, the court found that \"[t]he documentary evidence and the credible testimony of [the plaintiff] clearly demonstrates that [the defendant], having no justification to do so, embarked upon a course of conduct, the purpose of which was to impugn [the plain-tiff's] professional competence, humiliate and degrade him as a person and thereby adversely affect, if not destroy, his ability to make a living from his chosen profession as a clinical forensic psychologist, who specializes in threat assessments for government and corporate entities.\" Specifically, it found that the parties were initially friends, but in 2011, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant began \"to show signs of delusion and paranoia and was engaging in bizarre behavior,\" which motivated him to attempt to distance himself from the defendant. This attempt to distance himself \"was unsuccessful and generated bizarre e-mails and voice messages which began to constitute harassment....\" The plaintiff filed complaints with the Norwalk Police Department, which resulted in warnings from two separate police officers that the defendant ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court highlighted a number of incidents that \"would cause any reasonable person under the same circumstances to fear for his personal safety and to fear that his employment, business and career [were] thereby threatened.\" It found that the defendant had provided information regarding the plaintiff to the Connecticut Board of Firearms Permit Examiners, of which the plaintiff was a member, the State Board of Health, the American Psychological Association, and the Los Angeles Police Department, which had invited the\n   defendant to speak as a guest lecturer at a threat management conference. This information consisted of a 2009 ex parte abuse prevention order issued by the Boston Municipal Court against the plaintiff, and various \"e-mails and Internet postings ... showing that a civil judgment, presently unsatisfied, was entered against [the plaintiff] by the Superior Court for the judicial district of New Britain for his nonpayment of a student loan from Jacksonville University. Other postings and ... blogs questioned whether [the plaintiff] had a Florida criminal record and whether he attended, as claimed, Yale and Harvard Universities. [The plaintiff] denied the existence of any criminal record in any state and asserted at the hearing and\n   in his resume ... that he completed his predoctoral internship at Yale and his postdoctoral residency at Harvard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant also made comments about the plaintiff on Psychology Today, an online publication to which the plaintiff submitted several articles, referring to the Boston protective order and the unpaid civil judgment, and claiming that the plaintiff \"was a 'dangerous individual' and a 'psychopath,' offering no rational basis to support that unwarranted and defamatory assertion.\" The defendant also provided \"disparaging information about [the plaintiff] to [a security firm for which the plaintiff did consulting work on a routine basis] that was purposed to challenge his professional competence and impugn his character.\" The defendant \"referred company officials to a [website], clearly authored by him, entitled 'The Truth About [Stacy B.],' wherein, inter alia, detailed information about the Boston protective order and the unpaid judgment could be found and wherein he [referred] to [the plaintiff] as 'a very sick man.' \" The trial court also stated that the defendant continued to provide copies of the e-mail that he had sent to the Connecticut Board of Firearms Permit\n   Examiners \"to several third parties, including [the plaintiff's] past, present and potential clients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court also found that \"[m]ost concerning to this court is [the plaintiff's] credible claim that one week prior to the filing of [the plaintiff's] application seeking a civil protective order, [the defendant] contacted officials employed by the school system where [the plaintiff's] son is in the fourth grade and where [the plaintiff] is a member of that community's school safety board. [The defendant] apparently warned the school official that [the plaintiff] was 'a danger to children.' This incident, and other alarming and irrational conduct detailed herein, engaged in by [the defendant], has reasonably caused [the plaintiff] to fear that he was being 'hunted' by [the defendant] and to take certain precautions, including obtaining a post office box, registering his new car in his wife's premarital name, and hiring an Internet company to delete any derogatory information about him that was electronically posted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court then noted that despite its cautionary advisement that its finding could result in criminal prosecution for stalking and disciplinary action against the defendant, an attorney, for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the defendant had again contacted the Los Angeles Police Department regarding the plaintiff, regardless of warnings by both the court and a police officer. It then found that \"there is reasonable cause to believe [the defendant] is likely to continue acts that are designed to intimidate or retaliate against [the plaintiff], a finding that is statutorily mandated and is a prerequisite to the granting of the relief sought by [the plaintiff].\" It then ordered \"that [the plaintiff's] application for a civil protective order is granted. [The defendant] is enjoined from: 1. Assaulting, threatening, abusing, harassing, following, interfering with, or stalking [the plaintiff]; 2. Entering the home of [the plaintiff] or any place in which he may reside and\n   entering the office of [the plaintiff] or any place where he may be employed; 3. Contacting [the plaintiff] in any manner, including by written, electronic or telephone contact, and contacting his home, workplace or others with whom such contact would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to [the plaintiff]; 4. Contacting any person, including, but not limited to [the plaintiff's] past, current and prospective clients, family members and his child's educators in any manner for any purpose; 5. Creating any fictitious websites the purpose of which is to disseminate any information concerning [the plaintiff]; and 6. Posting any information,\n   whether adverse or otherwise, pertaining to [the plaintiff] on any website for any purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the court's judgment, the defendant appealed to this court. In his appeal, he claims that the trial court erred in (1) failing to determine that his conduct qualified as constitutionally protected speech under the first amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, of the Connecticut constitution; and (2) finding that the conduct constituted stalking when the evidence was insufficient. At oral argument before this court, he further asserted that a case recently decided by our Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Gleason v.

We conclude that the defendant failed to properly preserve his constitutional claim in the trial court, and failed to present an adequate record for us to review it.

This claim was not preserved in the trial court. We consider unpreserved claims of constitutional magnitude according to the requirements of\n   <em>\n    State v.

Due to the defendant's failure to provide sufficient analysis of the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   or of the controlling first amendment standard, and the lack of an adequate record to review any such constitutional claim, we decline to review this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Golding,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court held that \"a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)

Both analyses are based on prior case law that was available to the defendant. Despite this, the defendant does not connect any of the body of first amendment case law, some of which he references in conclusory fashion in his brief to this court, to \u00a7 53a-181d, to the facts found by the trial court, or to the evidence submitted in the hearing before the trial court. Providing such an analysis is necessary for us to analyze, and the plaintiff to refute, whether the activity qualifies as constitutionally protected. Barring this, neither the plaintiff nor this court knows what constitutional standards the defendant believes are applicable. The defendant, therefore, has failed to adequately brief this claim.\n   Our review of the trial court's memorandum of decision and the record before that court reveals that the record is inadequate to review this claim of error. Many of the standards for first amendment analysis are highly fact specific. See\n   <em>\n    Gleason v.

A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed....

The defendant asserts that the only finding related to this element was that the defendant complained to school board members of the district in which the plaintiff's son attends school that the plaintiff was a danger to children. To the contrary, after specifically describing the school board incident, the court found that \"[t]his incident, and other alarming and irrational conduct detailed herein, engaged in by [the defendant], has reasonably caused [the plaintiff] to fear that he was being 'hunted' by [the defendant] and to take certain precautions, including obtaining a post office box, registering his new car in his wife's premarital name, and hiring an Internet company to delete any derogatory information about him that was electronically posted.\" The defendant contends that there was \"not a scintilla of evidence presented to the court that the defendant is or ever has been physically dangerous to anyone.\" Despite this assertion, we find the trial court possessed sufficient evidence, after listening to two days of testimony and examining a variety of exhibits, to conclude that a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would have cause to fear for his own or a third person's physical safety, even if the plaintiff did not produce evidence of past physical violence committed by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court had sufficient evidence to conclude that as the plaintiff worked as a consultant, the places of employment or business of the plaintiff included the conference held by the Los Angeles Police Department, potential clients, and the publication Psychology Today. The plaintiff was paid for some consulting work for the school board, but his service on the school safety board was voluntary, as was his service on the Connecticut Board of Firearms Permit Examiners. Nonetheless, even these voluntary positions were related to his profession, and the court possessed sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant's statements could have affected the plaintiff's employment opportunities. The court's\n   finding that the defendant \"embarked upon a course of conduct, the purpose of which was to impugn [the plaintiff's] professional competence, humiliate and degrade him as a person and thereby adversely affect, if not destroy, his ability to make a living from his chosen profession as a clinical forensic psychologist, who specializes in threat assessments for government and corporate entities\" was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant also contends that there was no evidence that the defendant was ever told to cease his communications. In contrast, the trial court specifically found that \"despite this court's cautionary advisement on April 8, 2015, and despite [a police officer's] warning to [the defendant] on April 11, 2015, [the defendant] sent a second e-mail to [the organizer of the Los Angeles Police Department conference] and attached thereto his application and all of the documents that he submitted therewith. Referring to [the plaintiff], [the defendant], 'as a great matter of public concern,' warned [the organizer]: 'This man has no business advising public agencies such as police departments.' ... In light of that action by [the defendant] and the course of conduct described herein, this court finds, pursuant to [\u00a7 46b-16a ],\n   that there is reasonable cause to believe [the defendant] is likely to continue acts that are designed to intimidate or retaliate against [the plaintiff], a finding that is statutorily mandated and is a prerequisite to the granting of the relief sought by [the plaintiff].\" The defendant fails to analyze whether the court had sufficient evidence for these findings; having reviewed the evidence referenced by the court and the transcript, we find that it did. The court had copies of multiple e-mails sent by the defendant, it had police reports, and it heard the testimony of the plaintiff, all providing support for these findings. In addition, as previously noted, the defendant, who had represented himself during the first day of the hearing and during the morning of the second day of the hearing, absented himself on the afternoon of the second day of the hearing without testifying and before the plaintiff could call him as a witness. The court noted it could draw an adverse inference from this decision.
