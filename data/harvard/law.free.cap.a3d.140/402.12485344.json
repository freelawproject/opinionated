At that hour in the morning there was no vehicle traffic and no cars were parked by the side of the street. Hines heard several gunshots come from the New Haven green in the vicinity of Elm and College Streets, which location was approximately two blocks from where he was parked. When Hines looked in the general direction from which he heard the gunshots\n   fired, he saw a dark colored sport utility vehicle (SUV) turn left from Elm Street onto Church Street. As the SUV turned onto Wall Street, Hines noticed that the tires of the SUV were 'screeching....' Based on the speed at which the SUV was traveling and the way it turned onto Wall Street, Hines believed that it was likely that the occupants of the vehicle had discharged the gunshots; as a result he began to follow the SUV. Hines reported the incident to dispatch and activated his cruiser's lights and sirens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The SUV traveled through the city and onto the entrance ramp to Interstate 91; it 'would not stop.' Hines observed a 'dark colored item come out of the passenger side window' and 'a silver colored item come out of the driver side window.' Based on his training and experience, Hines believed the items thrown out of the windows to be guns. Officer Edward Dunford, who was following behind Hines' cruiser, also saw 'something dark colored come flying out of the passenger side of the vehicle....'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Before entering the highway, the SUV stopped. Hines drew his gun and went to the driver's side of the car. Dunford drew his gun and went, with other officers, to the passenger side of the vehicle. Tanika McCotter was operating the SUV, the [petitioner], her boyfriend, was in the front passenger seat and her brother, Jayeron McCotter, was in the rear passenger seat. The [petitioner] initially disobeyed commands from the officers, stepped over the guardrail and 'look[ed] around him.' The [petitioner] eventually complied with orders to lie on the ground and was arrested. Tanika McCotter and Jayeron McCotter also were arrested. The officers then searched the area where they believed the items were tossed from the windows of the SUV. Using a thermal imager, Sergeant Peter Moller found a semiautomatic .45 caliber black Ruger handgun, with the safety off\n   and its magazine empty, lying on top of a pile of leaves. No other weapon was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Detective Joshua Armistead investigated the area of College and Elm Streets where the gunshots reportedly had been fired. Armistead found eight .40 caliber shell casings spread out over several car lengths. He stated that the casings 'looked like they were fired from somebody moving on Elm Street.' Lieutenant Joseph Rainone, a firearms examiner with the Waterbury police department, determined that the Ruger handgun was operable. He also determined that although the eight shell casings had similar class characteristics, he was unable to conclude whether they had been fired from the same firearm. He was able to determine, however, that the shell casings did not come from the Ruger handgun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The [petitioner] was charged with one count of carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 29-35(a), one count of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c (a)(1), one count of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a)(1), one count of unlawful possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38 and one count of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-223 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"At trial, the state sought to introduce the testimony of Tanika McCotter from a prior court hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the\n   ground that she was unavailable to testify at trial. The [petitioner] objected to the admission of the prior testimony on the ground that the state did not exercise due diligence in attempting to locate her and that he did not have the opportunity at the prior hearing effectively and adequately to cross-examine the witness. The court determined that the state had proved that Tanika McCotter was unavailable to testify and overruled the [petitioner's] objections to the admission of her prior testimony. Tanika McCotter's prior testimony was redacted, as agreed upon by the parties, and was submitted to the jury in transcript form as a full exhibit. Its admissibility is not an issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In her\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony, Tanika McCotter testified to the following. She was driving the SUV at the time in question while the [petitioner] was seated in the passenger seat and Jayeron McCotter, her brother, was seated in the back passenger seat. She heard gunshots, 'kind of freaked out' and continued to drive until she noticed, as she was about to drive onto the highway, police cruisers following the SUV. She was arrested and taken to a police station. She stated that although she heard gunshots, she never saw a gun on the day in question. While at the police station, she told the detectives, in a recorded statement, that both of the passengers-Jayeron McCotter and the [petitioner]-were shooting guns from the SUV. She initially told the police that she did not see a gun, but that after 'they pressured for like ever' and told her she could lose her children if she did not cooperate, she told them that both passengers had fired guns. In response to a question of whether her statement to the police was truthful, she testified: 'No, I don't know where the shots came from.' She later stated, however, that she was being truthful to the police officers during the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"At the conclusion of the jury trial, the [petitioner] was found guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon in\n   a motor vehicle and of criminal violation of a protective order.

In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claimed that his trial counsel, Walter Bansley IV, rendered ineffective assistance in failing to specifically object on hearsay grounds to the substantive use of the portions of Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony during which she was impeached with her statement to police and that, but for his trial counsel's ineffectiveness, there was a reasonable probability\n   that the result of petitioner's trial would have been different.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a habeas trial, the court issued an oral decision denying the petition, and concluding that the petitioner's trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance. The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to prove that his trial counsel's representation was deficient or that he suffered any prejudice from his trial counsel's performance. In reaching its conclusion, the court made several relevant findings of fact, including, inter alia, the following: \"[the petitioner's trial counsel] also adequately objected to [Tanika] McCotter's testimony from the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing being introduced into evidence, which the trial court overruled; but at any rate, he was able to redact portions of the testimony that may have been prejudicial to the Petitioner.\" The petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal from the habeas court's denial of his petition for a writ of\n   habeas corpus, which the habeas court denied. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On direct appeal, this court determined that \"[o]ur review of the record indicates that the defendant never specifically objected to the admission of Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony-including her statements to the police-as substantive evidence....\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Given the petitioner's belief that the habeas court's finding that the petitioner's trial counsel \"adequately objected\" to McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony appeared to be in conflict with this court's determination that he \"never specifically objected\" to McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony as substantive evidence, the petitioner filed a motion for articulation requesting the habeas court to articulate several bases for its conclusion that the petitioner's attorney rendered constitutionally adequate representation at the petitioner's criminal trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court denied the petitioner's motion for articulation, and this court granted the petitioner's motion for review in part, ordering the habeas court to address the requests regarding whether its finding constituted a finding that his trial counsel objected to the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony and whether it constituted a finding that his trial counsel's failure to object to the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony was reasonable. In response, the habeas court's articulation stated: \"(1) [the petitioner's trial counsel] objected to the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony being introduced into\n   evidence. He did not object on hearsay grounds. The finding that [the petitioner's trial counsel] adequately objected is premised factually on the presumption that counsel performed effectively, which the petitioner did not affirmatively rebut with evidence. (2) This court cannot find that [the petitioner's trial counsel's] failure to object to the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony on hearsay grounds was unreasonable,\n   as no evidence whatsoever was presented as to this matter. Such a finding would be erroneous because it lacks sufficient evidentiary basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, we set forth \"the applicable standard of review and procedural hurdles that the petitioner must surmount to obtain appellate review of the merits of a habeas court's denial of the habeas petition following denial of certification to appeal.

Therefore, because failing to object to the admission of those references in the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony as substantive evidence appears to conflict with what would be considered effective representation, coupled with the fact that his actions were not part of a trial strategy, we conclude that the failure of the petitioner's trial counsel to object to the substantive use of those references in Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony, under the facts of this case, amounted to deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having concluded that\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's performance prong is satisfied, we next turn to the question of whether the petitioner was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to object.

Therefore, but for the failure of the petitioner's trial counsel to object to the substantive use of those portions of Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony about her prior statement to police, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We further conclude that the court erred in denying the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his trial counsel's failure to object to the substantive use of Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The judgment is reversed only as to the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to object to the substantive use of portions of Tanika McCotter's\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   testimony during which she was impeached with her statement to police, and the case is remanded to the habeas court with direction to render judgment granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus as to this claim and to order a new trial for the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    General Statutes (Rev. to 2008) \u00a7 29-38(a) provides in relevant part: \"Any person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by such person, any weapon, any pistol or revolver for which a proper permit has not been issued as provided in section 29-28 ... shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both, and the presence of any such weapon, pistol or revolver, or machine gun in any vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the owner, operator and each occupant thereof....\" Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, all references to \u00a7 29-38 in this opinion are to the 2008 revision of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \"Rainone testified that although there are methods through which .40 caliber bullets can be fired in a .45 caliber gun, in this particular case that did not occur.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
