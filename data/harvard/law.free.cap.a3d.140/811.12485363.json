Because there also has been no showing that the substance of the opinion has or will become a detriment to coherence and consistency in the law, applying the doctrine of stare decisis is appropriate. Moreover, although the state has now had an opportunity to present new arguments in the present case that it had no reason to present in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   because it was not on notice that this court would consider them, the three members of the current court who were in the majority in that case have rejected those arguments on the merits and the fourth member of the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   Justice Norcott, had for many years before that decision expressed his view that the death penalty is unconstitutional per se.

Ordinarily, our determination in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   that the death penalty is no longer constitutional would control the outcome of the present case as well, and the defendant and others similarly situated would be entitled to resentencing consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   The state, however, has argued that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was decided without the benefit of adequate briefing by the parties and that, as a result, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   made a series of legal and historical errors that led to an incorrect decision. Indeed, the state goes so far as to contend that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was\n   so unjust, and so completely devoid of legitimacy, that it should be afforded no precedential value and now may be overturned, only nine months later, merely because the composition of this court has changed.\n   I agree with and join the per curiam opinion in this case, in which the majority concludes that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   remains binding and valid authority, and that other convicted capital felons who have been sentenced to death are, therefore, entitled to be resentenced forthwith consistent with that decision. I write separately because I categorically reject any suggestion that the parties did not have the opportunity to brief these issues in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   or that the court in that case overlooked key authorities, arguments, or historical developments that, if properly considered, would have resulted in a different outcome. We already have explained at some length why the parties, and particularly the state, had a full and fair opportunity to address the issues on which our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was based.

In reality, the state contends, the authority to review and determine the propriety of a punishment\n   always has rested solely with the legislature. In so arguing, the state fundamentally misunderstands the relevant Connecticut history, this court's precedents, and the basis of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   Although a full review of the relevant history and the scope of the state's confusion in this regard lies beyond the ambit of this opinion, I briefly address three of the most significant flaws in the state's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the state misperceives the purpose of the discussion in part I of our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at 15-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the role that that discussion played in the outcome of the case. Our goal in part I of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was not to establish that this court has the constitutional authority to strike down legislatively enacted punishments as impermissibly cruel and unusual. There was no need to establish that principle because, as the defendant explains, and as the state ultimately concedes, the state lost that argument decades-if not centuries-ago. Just four years after the adoption of the 1818 constitution, Chief Justice Stephen Titus Hosmer, writing for the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors, rejected the asserted \"omnipotence of the legislature\" with respect to punitive sanctions such as imprisonment and clarified that the review of such laws was properly within the purview of the judiciary.\n   <em>\n    Goshen v.

Indeed, the very source on which the state relies explains at the outset how this preconstitutional history sowed the seeds that ultimately blossomed into this court's judicial review authority: \"When we speak of law in early Connecticut-legislation, adjudication, and executive administration-we speak of the law of the magistrates.\" E. Goodwin, The Magistracy Rediscovered: Connecticut, 1636-1818 (1981) p. 11. \"The Puritan's\n   peculiar concept of the magistracy was ... a unique contribution to the development of later concepts of independent judiciaries, distinct functions for courts of law, and even, perhaps, the distinctively American notion of judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lamme,\n   </em>\n   having reviewed this history, we concluded that \"the most significant aspect of the pre-1818 declaration of rights is that it had constitutional overtones even though it was statutory in form.

Accordingly, although the state is certainly correct that the legislature played a central role in establishing and enforcing our traditional freedoms from cruel and unusual punishment during Connecticut's preconstitutional era, the state has offered no reason to conclude, counter to well established authority, that the legislature has been the exclusive guardian of those freedoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Of course, any discussion of the relationship between the judicial and legislative authorities during the pre-constitutional era, and especially prior to the creation of this court in 1784, must be qualified by the recognition that the General Court, which, at the end of the seventeenth century, was renamed the General Assembly, blended and simultaneously exercised both judicial and lawmaking functions during that period. See, e.g., H. Cohn &amp; W. Horton, Connecticut's Four Constitutions\n   1988) p. 21; E. Goodwin, supra, at pp. 33-35, 52-54. In some sense, then, any discussion of whether the legislature or the judiciary was responsible for securing the people's freedom from cruel and unusual punishment is academic. In any event, it is clear that the adoption of the state's first formal constitution in 1818 was motivated in no small part by a desire to create an independent judiciary tasked with securing those basic constitutional liberties, and that these changes embodied a rejection of the belief \"that republican government with legislative supremacy was the best safeguard of personal liberties.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cohn &amp; W. Horton, supra, at p. 23 (call for independent judiciary was primary reason for constitutional convention).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The third fundamental flaw in the state's historical analysis is the state's failure to adequately and accurately document its theory that the freedoms from cruel and unusual punishment enshrined in the state constitution arose from and were limited to legislative efforts to circumscribe the harsh and arbitrary punishments imposed by colonial magistrates. Although the state weaves a lengthy and intriguing narrative in support of this theory, the state's account is sparse on citation, and, it must be said, one searches the cited authorities in vain for the propositions that the state attributes to them. Nowhere in the cited text, for example, does Professor Lawrence B. Goodheart state that the Ludlow Code of 1650-from which article first, \u00a7 9, of the state constitution derives its origins-was drafted to address public concerns that magistrates were wielding excessive power or imposing arbitrary penal sanctions. See L. Goodheart, The Solemn Sentence of Death: Capital\n   Punishment in Connecticut (2011) pp. 11-12. Quite the contrary. In the section of his book on which the state relies, Goodheart explains that the colonists generally deferred to magistrates' interpretation of Biblical authority; see id., at p. 9; and he discusses at some length the key role that the magistrates played in securing fundamental liberties and tempering the colonies' draconian capital statutes: \"The statutes are deceptive as to what occurred in practice. The laws represented a religious ideal, a public declaration, as the 1672 [colonial] code put it, of what was 'suitable for the people of Israel.' The judicial system was much more lenient. The courts aspired to be scrupulous and fair. There was concern to balance individual protection with the greater good. Drawing on centuries of English tradition, the Puritans upheld civil rights, including ... no torture [and] no cruel or barbarous punishments.... Attorneys did not usually function in either colony; the wise and impartial rule of the magistrates was deemed sufficient.\" (Footnotes omitted.) Id., at p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state's reliance on Everett Goodwin's book, The Magistracy Rediscovered: Connecticut, 1636-1818, is similarly misplaced. The state cites page 103 of Goodwin's book for the proposition that, in the state's words, \"Connecticut's history is unique in selecting the legislature as the body 'safeguarding' citizens from abusive, unlegislated, court-imposed punishments, and not the other way around.\" The cited passage, however, contains no mention whatsoever of abusive, court-imposed punishments. Rather, Goodwin merely discusses the fact that, as a general matter, Connecticut's early legal system relied less on English common law than did the other American colonies. E. Goodwin, supra, at p. 103. He also references the evolution in Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift's thinking with respect to the separation of powers; although Swift initially believed in the primacy of the legislature; see id., at pp. 99-100, 103; he ultimately\n   came to conclude that, because the legislature is vulnerable to \" 'undue and improper influence' \"; id., at p. 114; the courts must play an important role with respect to the constitutional review of statutes. See id., at pp. 99, 101, 103, 109-10, 114, 160 n. 34. In other parts of his book, Goodwin explains that the colonists codified an extreme version of the criminal law but \"[left] the mitigation to the discretion of the [m]agistrate\"; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., at p. 27; and that the discretion invested in the magistrates reflected the Puritans' confidence in their wisdom and godliness. Id., at p. 30. Like Goodheart, then, Goodwin provides little support for the state's account.\n   The other sources on which the state relies likewise fail to support-and in some cases flatly belie-the state's theory that Connecticut's traditional freedoms from cruel and unusual punishment originated from and were limited to a commitment to statutory law as a bulwark against abusive judicial sentencing practices. William Holdsworth, for example, explains that magistrates in both the Connecticut and New Haven colonies \"repeatedly avoided imposing the full penalties prescribed by ... [law]\"; W. Holdsworth, Law and Society in Colonial Connecticut, 1636-1672 (1974) p. 124 (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Claremont Graduate School); and that, although Connecticut's first criminal statutes were more severe than those of Massachusetts, Connecticut's colonial code actually \"placed fewer restrictions on the discretionary powers of the magistrates, and increased the penalties they could impose for certain crimes....\" Id., at p. 132. Holdsworth explains that \"these differences reflect a greater consensus in Connecticut between rulers and ruled and a greater degree of trust of the one for the other, but they also reflect the\n   <em>\n    growth\n   </em>\n   in magisterial power....\" (Emphasis added.) Id.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state's heavy reliance\n   on the language of Ludlow's Code also misses the point. Ludlow's Code authorized not only those punishments established by express legislative enactment, but also, in the absence of a controlling statute, penal sanctions imposed on the basis of the magistrates' own understanding of \"the word of God.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) L. Goodheart, supra, at p. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even more troubling is the state's representation that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pratt v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6753987\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/13/119/#p125\">\n    13 Conn. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 (1839), stands for the proposition that, \"[w]ith the exception of moving the judiciary to an independent body, the 1818 constitution '\n   <em>\n    left the legislative department as it found it\n   </em>\n   .' \" (Emphasis added.) The state uses the quoted passage from\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   in an attempt to demonstrate that the judiciary, which, the state alleges, had no authority to review the appropriateness of legislatively imposed punishments under the colonial common law, obtained no greater authority in this respect under the 1818 constitution. The state, however, neglects to account for the sentence in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   immediately preceding the one that it quotes. The full passage reads as follows: \"The [constitution of Connecticut], so far as it respects the legislature, is conversant principally\n   with its organization, the authority of its separate branches, and the privileges of its members. But we look in vain for the character of its legislative acts\n   <em>\n    any further than as they are, in some measure, restrained, by the bill of rights.\n   </em>\n   In short,\n   <em>\n    with few limitations,\n   </em>\n   it left the legislative\n   department as it found it.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Pratt v.

The only fair reading of\n   <em>\n    Pratt,\n   </em>\n   then, is that the creation of an independent judiciary was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the only change effected by the state constitution, as the state suggests. Rather, the highlighted portions of the foregoing passage, which the state omits, clearly indicate that the constitution, in tandem with the creation of an independent judiciary, constrained the authority of the legislature to enact laws that infringe our basic liberties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A thorough review of the cited historical sources and our related cases thus leaves one with the discomforting impression that the state, in its apparent zeal to retain the death penalty, has mischaracterized not only this court's precedents but history itself. For all of these reasons, I reject the state's contention that this court, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   relied on a flawed historical analysis or exercised its powers of judicial review in a manner precluded by either tradition or precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   DELAYS AND INFREQUENCY OF IMPLEMENTATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The state's next argument is that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we improperly considered the infrequency with which the death penalty is imposed in Connecticut, as well as the lengthy delays in carrying out capital sentences, in determining that capital punishment no longer comports with contemporary standards of decency and no longer serves any legitimate penological purpose. Specifically, the state contends that (1) this court rejected these arguments in\n   <em>\n    State v.

At that time, we did not reject out of hand the argument of the defendant, Todd Rizzo, that the death penalty had come to be so rarely used in the United States as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Nor did we specifically consider recent developments in this state. Rather, we recognized that both capital sentences and executions were declining in number nationwide, and we acknowledged that several of the likely causes of those declines suggested diminishing public support for capital punishment. See id., at 192-94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201094\">\n    31 A.3d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the same time, however, we noted that the decline also might reflect other, short-term factors, such as the economic recession, supply shortages of one of the lethal injection drugs, and temporary uncertainty about the legal status of capital punishment pending the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Baze v.

We also noted that the number of executions carried out nationally in 2007 and 2008, although a recent low, remained substantially higher than during the early 1990s, just prior to our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, and in light of the fact that capital punishment remained legal in most states; see id., at 190,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=833%20A.2d%20363\">\n    833 A.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we could\n   not conclude at that time that infrequency of imposition alone was sufficient evidence that the death penalty\n   had become impermissibly cruel and unusual.

Because capital punishment remained legal, and so presumably retained some deterrent value, we also did not have cause at that time to consider whether lengthy delays in carrying out capital sentences deprived capital punishment of its retributive value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Much has changed since\n   <em>\n    Rizzo.\n   </em>\n   Two additional states-Maryland and Nebraska-have abolished capital punishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The number of executions carried out nationally has continued to decline, falling by more than one third from 2011 to 2015, and is now lower than at any time since 1991.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The number of new capital sentences imposed likewise continues to fall; the total fell by nearly 40 percent between 2011 and 2015, and is now by far the lowest of the post-\n   <em>\n    Furman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   era.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It has been more than one decade since the last execution was carried out in New England (Michael Ross, who essentially volunteered to die, in 2005), and more than five decades since the one before that (Joseph Taborsky in 1960). That this is all true even though many of the short-term factors we considered in\n   <em>\n    Rizzo\n   </em>\n   no longer apply strongly suggests that the persistent, long-term declines in capital punishment are just what they appear to be-evidence that contemporary standards of\n   decency have evolved away from execution as a necessary and acceptable form of punishment. Significantly, the Death Penalty Information Center has published its 2015 year-end summary, and the statistics for 2015 continue to reflect a substantial decline in the imposition and implementation of the death penalty nationwide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If anything, the pace of decline is accelerating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Since our decision in\n   <em>\n    Rizzo,\n   </em>\n   a number of respected jurists also have concluded that the infrequent imposition and delayed execution of the death penalty call its constitutionality into question.

At the same time, new legal scholarship has emerged that powerfully debunks the state's argument that the rarity with which the death penalty is imposed in Connecticut merely indicates that our capital felony statutes are working as intended, and that the ultimate punishment is being reserved for the very worst offenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Most significant, however, is the fact that, in 2012, the year after we decided\n   <em>\n    Rizzo,\n   </em>\n   the legislature enacted P.A. 12-5, which prospectively abolished the death penalty in Connecticut. Legislative abolition fundamentally altered the constitutional calculation we conducted in\n   <em>\n    Rizzo.\n   </em>\n   It cast in a new light all of the various factors pointing to reduced societal acceptance of capital punishment. It swept away the most compelling arguments that capital punishment serves legitimate penological functions. And it reflected the awareness of the legislature that the infrequency with which the death penalty is imposed and the slowness with which it is carried out dramatically undermine its ability to serve a valid retributive function and to secure justice and peace for the families of murder victims. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   103 and n. 99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of these dramatic, recent changes in the constitutional landscape, it is difficult to comprehend how the state can argue with a straight face that \"[t]here is nothing new under the sun....\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lastly, I am not persuaded by the state's assertion that\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 5 Day (Conn.) 175, a case decided two decades before the invention of the typewriter, somehow precludes the result this court reached in\n   <em>\n    Santiago. Smith\n   </em>\n   was the first published case in which this court considered whether two sentences of imprisonment may be imposed to run consecutively without offending the state's common-law prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. See id., at 178. Because \"such ha[d] been the usage of our courts, for many years past,\" we concluded that postponing the commencement of the second term of imprisonment until the first had been completed was neither unprecedented nor cruel. Id., at 179. Nowhere in the court's brief discussion of that issue, however, did it consider or decide any of the novel questions raised in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   and in the present appeal: (1) whether a method of punishment that is only imposed a few times per decade and only carried out a few times per century may be deemed to violate contemporary standards of decency; (2) whether the retributive value of a punishment-both to the offender and to the victims-dissipates when\n   decades pass before it is carried out; and (3) whether the various procedural safeguards established by the federal and state legislatures and courts, which permit individuals on death row to pursue nearly endless appellate and postconviction remedies, reflect society's reluctance to impose the ultimate punishment and unwillingness to see it imposed erroneously. For these reasons, there is no doubt that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we properly considered the actual practices of this state with respect to the imposition and carrying out of capital sentences in concluding that capital punishment constitutes what has come to be seen as cruel and unusual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   RACIAL DISPARITIES AND PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The state next contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   when we observed that \"the selection of which offenders live and which offenders die appears to be inescapably tainted by caprice and bias\";\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   state argues that (1) a court in a habeas case currently pending on appeal before this court rejected these statistical claims; see\n   <em>\n    In re Death Penalty Disparity Claims,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. TSR-CV-05-4000632-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205879422\">\n    2013 WL 5879422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Conn.Super.

In other words, we agreed, as a matter of law, with those judges and scholars who have concluded that such a system cannot, in principle, ensure that the ultimate punishment will be imposed fairly and objectively, as it must be.

Rather, I understand the court to have acknowledged that there are significant racial disparities in capital charging (but not sentencing) in Connecticut; see\n   <em>\n    In re Death Penalty Disparity Claims,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205879422\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205879422\">\n    2013 WL 5879422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *19, *24-*25 ; but to have concluded that, as a matter of federal constitutional and discrimination law, such disparities do not impair the validity of capital sentences imposed in this state.

It enumerates five mitigating circumstances. But it states that the sentence shall not be death, if any mitigating factor exists, whether statutorily defined or not. In other words, unlike the practice in every other state (except to some extent Colorado), a Connecticut jury, once it finds a mitigating fact, whether enumerated or not, does not\n   have the power to balance or weigh the mitigating fact against any aggravating fact that may be present. The very existence of a mitigating fact precludes a death sentence.\" S. Gillers, \"Deciding Who Dies,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n    129 U. Pa. L.Rev. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 n. 10 (1980). Setting aside the question of whether the quoted passage even stands for the proposition for which the state cites it, the state is well aware that Connecticut's capital punishment law has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been as Gillers describes it for more than two decades. In 1995, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-46a to eliminate the provision on which the state relies. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-19, \u00a7 1. Since then, juries in capital cases in Connecticut have balanced aggravating and mitigating factors in deciding whether to impose the ultimate punishment, just as they do in our sister states. In addition, any past idiosyncrasies in Connecticut's capital\n   <em>\n    sentencing\n   </em>\n   scheme are simply irrelevant to the central question of whether minority defendants accused of offending against white victims are capitally\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   at a disproportionately high rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   EXECUTION OF THE INNOCENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The state next contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we improperly considered the possibility that an innocent person may be erroneously executed as one reason why the death penalty fails to serve a legitimate retributive purpose. Although the state does not dispute the growing body of research that recently persuaded two justices of the United States Supreme Court that capital punishment is likely unconstitutional for this reason; see\n   <em>\n    Glossip v. Gross,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2764\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2764\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2756-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., with whom Ginsburg, J., joins, dissenting); the state contends that the possibility of error is no longer a concern in this state because none of the eleven men\n   currently subject to a sentence of death in Connecticut has professed his innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if this were true, and even if it were properly subject to judicial notice, the state simply ignores the fact that, under P.A. 12-5, new prosecutions can still be brought at any time for capital felonies committed prior to April, 2012. Of the thousands of murders committed in Connecticut over the past several decades, some of which would be death eligible, many remain unsolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, it is not at all unlikely that, if the death penalty were to remain available, the state would continue to seek it for some who have been accused of committing those crimes, with the possibility that an innocent person could wrongly be sentenced to die. Indeed, in the four years since the legislature prospectively abolished capital punishment, one additional offender has been sentenced to death,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and at least one other likely would have been capitally charged if not for our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state is fully aware of this possibility, as both the majority and a dissenting justice discussed it in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v.

The basis of the state's\n   objection is not entirely clear. For example, the state contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we failed to make what it considers to be \"the required predicate finding that the language of [P.A. 12-5] itself is ambiguous,\" but, in the very next paragraph of its brief, the state quotes our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   that \"the policy judgments embodied in the relevant legislation are ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

More fundamentally, the state appears to assume that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   presented a\n   conventional question of statutory interpretation, for which we are constrained to follow the dictates of General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z, which embodies the plain meaning rule. At the same time, the state also appears to recognize that claims that a penal sanction constitutes cruel and unusual punishment are reviewed according to a unique standard of review that requires us to assess \"what a penal statute\n   <em>\n    actually indicates\n   </em>\n   about contemporary social mores.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 72 n. 62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any event, to the extent that it was not transparent from our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   I take this opportunity to clarify that a claim that a penal sanction impermissibly offends contemporary standards of decency is not a question of statutory interpretation subject to \u00a7 1-2z and the attendant rules of construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a reviewing court considers whether a challenged punishment is excessive and disproportionate according to current social standards, legislative enactments are just one-albeit the most important-factor to be considered. Moreover, our goal in evaluating those enactments is not merely to determine what the legislature intended to accomplish through the enabling legislation (the\n   touchstone of statutory interpretation), but also to understand what the legislation\n   <em>\n    says and signifies\n   </em>\n   about our society's evolving perspectives on crime and punishment. In that respect, we look not only to the words of the statute, but also to its legislative history, the aspirations and concerns that were before the legislature as it deliberated, and, to the extent we can perceive them, the political motivations and calculations that affected or effected the outcome of those deliberations. The latter, as much as anything else, offer a portal into what the final legislative product indicates about our contemporary standards of decency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   RETRIBUTION AND VENGEANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The state next argues that, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we incorrectly concluded that the death penalty now lacks any legitimate penological purpose because, among other things, the legislature's decision to retain it on a retroactive only basis was intended primarily to satisfy a public thirst for vengeance toward two especially notorious inmates, rather than to accomplish permissible retributive purposes. The state counters that (1) the legislature regularly and properly crafts penal statutes in response to public reactions to specific notorious and vicious crimes, and (2) P.A. 12-5 was crafted to make good on a promise to the families of murder victims that death would be repaid with death, and making good on such a promise is a legitimate manifestation of retributive justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although it is undoubtedly true that the legislature is naturally responsive to powerful public sentiments, in the arena of criminal law as in other areas, that alone does not insulate a penal statute from constitutional scrutiny. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   if the mere fact that a punishment arose out of the democratic process established that it served a legitimate penological purpose,\n   then the eighth amendment and its state constitutional counterparts would be largely superfluous.

It is that task that we undertook in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   With respect to promises made to families and friends of the victims, we all have deep compassion for those who have been made to suffer the curse of crime.

As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   however, whatever vows the state has made that it will seek and impose the ultimate penalty have proved to be unkeepable. Of the thousands of heinous murders that have been committed in Connecticut in the last six decades, only two have resulted in executions, and those only after the offenders renounced\n   their appellate and habeas remedies and, in essence, volunteered to die. For the countless other families and secondary victims, the promise that they will find \"restoration and closure\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the hangman's noose, or an infusion of sodium thiopental, has proved to be a false hope. The vast majority of even the worst of the worst offenders are never sentenced to die, and, for the minuscule number who are, the delays are endless.

I would, however, make a few additional points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Regardless of whether one considers\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   itself to be persuasive authority, recent scholarship both vindicates the reasoning of that case and sheds light on the defects in Justice Scalia's position. As Professor Joseph Blocher explains, \"some supporters of the death penalty continue to argue ... that the death penalty must be constitutional because the [f]ifth [a]mendment explicitly contemplates it. The appeal of this argument is obvious, but its strength is largely superficial, and is also mostly irrelevant to the claims being made against the constitutionality of capital punishment. At most, the references to the death penalty in the [constitution] may reflect a founding era assumption that it was constitutionally permissible at that time. But they do not amount to a constitutional authorization; if capital punishment violates another constitutional provision, it is unconstitutional.\" J. Blocher, \"The Death Penalty and the Fifth Amendment\" (December 16, 2015) p. 1 (unpublished manuscript), available at http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6227&amp;context=faculty_scholarship; see also B. Ledewitz, \"Judicial Conscience and Natural Rights: A Reply to Professor Jaffa,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.%20Puget%20Sound%20L.%20Rev.%20449\">\n    10 U. Puget Sound L.Rev. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (1987) (\"The fifth amendment represents a limitation on capital punishment, that it was not to be carried out in the future as it had been in the past. One could hardly call the\n   due process clause an endorsement of capital punishment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The state's argument appears to be that, with respect to the Connecticut constitution in particular, the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, cannot form the basis for holding capital punishment unconstitutional when that same clause authorizes the state to impose the death penalty, as long as it affords adequate due process of law. As the aforementioned authorities explain, however, this argument rests on two conceptual errors. First, a declaration of rights such as that contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution, or the federal Bill of Rights, is not a grant of governmental authority; rather, it delineates the rights and freedoms of the people\n   <em>\n    as against the government.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v. Conlon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806176\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/65/478/#p488\">\n    65 Conn. 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20A.%20519\">\n    33 A. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1895) ; see also J. Blocher, supra, at pp. 3, 8-9. For the state to suggest that one right (to be free from cruel and unusual punishment) bars the exercise of another\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   (presumably, to execute capital felons) is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the freedoms enshrined in article first. States have powers, and the people have rights vis-\u00e0-vis the exercise of those powers; there is no governmental\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A second, related conceptual error is the state's apparent failure to distinguish necessary from sufficient conditions. See J. Blocher, supra, at p. 9. Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article seventeen and twenty-nine of the\n   amendments, which provides in relevant part that \"[n]o person shall be ... deprived of life ... without due process of law ... [or] held to answer for any crime, punishable by death ... unless upon probable cause,\" indicates that, to the extent that the death penalty is otherwise permissible and authorized by law, it may be imposed only after the defendant is afforded adequate due process. In other words, due process is a\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   condition for the\n   imposition of the death penalty, and article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, thereby restricts the circumstances under which that penalty may be imposed. There is no textual support, however, for the state's apparent belief that article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, makes the provision of due process a\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   condition for the imposition of capital punishment, so that the state is authorized to carry out executions as long as it has complied with the requirements of due process. Of course, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ross,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763464\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/183/#p249\">\n    230 Conn. at 249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%201318\">\n    646 A.2d 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the fact that the founders expressly referenced capital punishment in the state constitution, and the fact that such references were retained when article first, \u00a7 8, was amended at the most recent constitutional convention in 1965, provides strong evidence that, at those times, capital punishment was seen to be a legal and permissible penalty that comported with standards of decency of the day. But that implies at most that the death penalty is not unconstitutional per se, at all times and under all circumstances. As Blocher explains, \"one could grant Justice Scalia's argument that the death penalty is not 'categorically impermissible' while maintaining that the conditions for its constitutional use are not currently satisfied and perhaps never will be.\" J. Blocher, supra, at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   VIII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   STARE DECISIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Lastly, the state argues that, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and resulted in an unjust outcome, the principle of stare decisis, that is, the duty of a court to adhere to established precedent, does not require that we uphold the conclusion that capital punishment offends the state constitution. The state itself concedes, however, that \"a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it....\" (Citation omitted;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Alvarez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963439\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/782/#p793\">\n    257 Conn. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793-94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20938\">\n    778 A.2d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). The state has provided neither reasons nor logic to justify overruling our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, having fully reviewed the state's arguments and the authorities on which it relies, I find no reason to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, let alone unjust. The state has not pointed to any controlling cases that we overlooked, persuasive arguments that we failed to consider, or fatal defects in our reasoning. Most\n   of the state's arguments are ones that we expressly considered and rejected in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and the others fail to hold up under scrutiny or simply miss the point. In a disturbing number of instances, the authorities on which the state relies do not even support the proposition for which the state cites them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, the state has failed to identify any case, and I am not aware of any, in which a court of last resort has reversed its own landmark constitutional ruling after a matter of just months. For this court to entomb the death penalty in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and then to exhume and revivify it nine months later, would be unprecedented and would make a mockery of the freedoms enshrined in article first of the state constitution. If the people of Connecticut believe that we have misperceived the\n   scope of that constitution, it now falls on them to amend it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, I question whether a decision in this case to overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and to revive the death penalty for the defendant in the present case, could survive federal constitutional scrutiny. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has received the benefit of our decision therein, namely, that capital punishment is an excessive and disproportionate punishment, and that he no longer may be executed. The state now proposes that we reauthorize the death penalty\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and proceed to execute the defendant, Peeler, solely on the basis of the fact that a different panel of this court, having considered essentially the same arguments only months later, might reach a different result. Nothing could be more arbitrary than to execute one convicted capital felon who committed his offense prior to the enactment of P.A. 12-5 but to spare another, solely on the basis of the timing of their appeals. For this reason as well, I reject the state's request that we overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   and revive the death penalty in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    I agree with much of Justice Zarella's analysis in his dissent in the present case, which, distilled to its essence, argues that, if a past decision was manifestly incorrect and there has been no reliance on it, principles of stare decisis may not require the court to stand by that decision. In\n    <em>\n     Santiago,\n    </em>\n    however, Justice Zarella, Justice Espinosa and I explained at great length why we believed that the majority decision was incorrect; see\n    <em>\n     State v. Santiago,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n     318 Conn. at 231-341\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n     122 A.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Rogers, C.J.,\n    </em>\n    dissenting); id., at 341-88,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n     122 A.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Zarella, J.,\n    </em>\n    dissenting); id., at 388-412,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n     122 A.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Espinosa, J.,\n    </em>\n    dissenting); and we were unable to persuade the majority. The three members of that majority who are also in the majority in the present case continue to believe that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    manifestly incorrect, and there is every reason to believe that the fourth member, Justice Norcott, would agree with them because of his unwavering belief that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional. See\n    <em>\n     State v. Rizzo,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174073\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/71/#p203\">\n     303 Conn. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    202 n. 1, 203,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201094\">\n     31 A.3d 1094\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Norcott, J.,\n    </em>\n    dissenting). When it is clear that the same majority in a prior recent decision that this court is considering overruling continues to believe that the case was correctly decided, I cannot conclude that a mere change in membership of the court justifies overruling that decision. When that has been the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    intervening change, stability is the overriding consideration. \"For it is an established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points come again in litigation; as well [as] to keep the scale of justice even and steady,\n    <em>\n     and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added.) 1 W.

The majority in\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    also recognized that this is an open question. See\n    <em>\n     State v.

Holdsworth, supra, at pp. 104, 109, 167-71.

See id., at pp. 104, 132, 137, 152-53, 171-72. As Holdsworth concludes, \"[Ludlow] omitted most of the Bay Colony's liberties and permitted the magistrates greater discretion in dealing with many crimes.

Stare decisis is a formidable obstacle to any court seeking to change its own law.... It is the most important application of a theory of [decision-making] consistency in our legal culture and it is an obvious manifestation of the notion that [decision-making] consistency itself has normative value.... Stare decisis does more than merely push courts in hard cases, where they are not convinced about what justice requires, toward decisions that conform with decisions made by previous courts.... The doctrine is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception\n   that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"As this court has stated many times, [t]he true doctrine of stare decisis is compatible with the function of the courts.... [T]here is no question but that [a] decision of this court is a controlling precedent until overruled or qualified.... [S]tare decisis ... serve[s] the cause of stability and certainty in the law-a condition indispensable to any well-ordered system of jurisprudence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"Whether stare decisis serves the interests of judicial efficiency, protection of expectations, maintenance of the rule of law, or preservation of judicial legitimacy, however, is not dispositive. The value of adhering to precedent is not an end in and of itself, however, if the precedent reflects substantive injustice. Consistency must also serve a justice related end.... When\n   <em>\n    a prior decision is seen so clearly as error\n   </em>\n   that its enforcement [is] for that very reason doomed ... the court should seriously consider whether the goals of stare decisis are outweighed, rather than dictated, by the prudential and pragmatic considerations that inform the doctrine to enforce a clearly erroneous decision. Stare decisis is not an inexorable command.... The court must weigh [the] benefits [of stare decisis] against its burdens in deciding whether to overturn a precedent it thinks is unjust. The rule of stare decisis may entail the sacrifice of justice to the parties in individual cases, but, far from being immune from considerations of justice, it\n   must always be tested against the ends of justice more generally....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"Indeed, this court has long believed that although [s]tare decisis is a doctrine developed by courts to accomplish the requisite element of stability in court-made law, [it] is not an absolute impediment to change.... [S]tability should not be confused with perpetuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   If law is to have a current relevance, courts must have and exert the capacity to change a rule of law when reason so requires.... [I]t is more important that the court should be right upon later and more elaborate consideration of the cases than consistent with previous declarations. Those doctrines only will eventually stand which bear the strictest examination and the test of experience.... The United States Supreme Court has said that when it has become convinced of former error, it has never felt constrained to follow precedent....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[One] well recognized exception to stare decisis under which a court will examine and overrule a prior decision ... [is when that prior decision] is\n   <em>\n    clearly wrong\n   </em>\n   .... The doctrine [of stare decisis] requires a clear showing that an established rule is incorrect and harmful before it is abandoned.... Because stare decisis is not a rule of law but a matter of judicial policy ... it does not have the same kind of force in each kind of case so that adherence to or deviation from that general policy\n   <em>\n    may depend upon the kind of case involved, especially the nature of the decision to be rendered that may follow from the overruling of a precedent.\n   </em>\n   \" (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Conway v.

In light of Chief Justice Rogers' repeated expressions regarding the fallacy of the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   it is no wonder she now overlooks the clearly wrong exception to our stare decisis jurisprudence. She could not reasonably rely on stare decisis if she acknowledged that exception.\n   Chief Justice Rogers' action highlights a deeper problem with our case law on stare decisis. Our jurisprudence on stare decisis is constructed on contradictory principles inconsistently applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The concurring opinions\n   of Justices Palmer and\n   Robinson in the present\n   case suffer from similar shortcomings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both fail to recognize the presence of certain characteristics that generally result in our affording of less stare decisis effect to a previous decision. At the very least, Justices Palmer and Robinson should explain why these characteristics are not important for purposes of the present case. For example,\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   announces a rule that applies in criminal cases. In such context, we have often stated that \"[t]he arguments for adherence to precedent are least compelling ... when the rule to be discarded may not be reasonably supposed to have determined the conduct of the litigants....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is especially true in the present case because the rule in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was announced after the defendant in the present case, Russell Peeler, engaged in criminal conduct and was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. In addition, neither Justice Palmer nor Justice Robinson explains why\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   should not receive less deference in light of the fact that it is a constitutional holding.

Thus, I take this opportunity to articulate a principled framework for the application of stare decisis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, I will\n   demonstrate why, in\n   the present case, stare decisis should not be applied to this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Before I delve into the stare decisis framework and application, it is important that I address two preliminary matters. First, stare decisis has both a vertical and horizontal component. See, e.g., W. Consovoy, \"The Rehnquist Court and the End of Constitutional Stare Decisis:\n   <em>\n    Casey,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   and the Consequences of Pragmatic Adjudication,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20Utah%20L.%20Rev.%2053\">\n    2002 Utah L.Rev. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55. Vertical stare decisis refers to the principle that the decisions of this court are binding on the lower courts of this state. Id.; see also Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) p. 1626 (defining vertical stare decisis as \"[t]he doctrine that a court must strictly follow the decisions handed down by higher courts within the same jurisdiction\"). On the other hand, horizontal stare decisis addresses when this court should adhere to its own earlier decisions. See W. Consovoy, supra, at 55 ; see also Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at p. 1626 (defining horizontal stare decisis as \"[t]he doctrine that court, esp[ecially] an appellate court, must adhere to its own prior decisions, unless it finds compelling reasons to overrule itself\"). The balance of this opinion concerns only horizontal stare decisis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, in my view, stare decisis has two modes of operation. As a general matter, stare decisis, Latin for \"to stand by things decided\"; (internal quotation marks\n   omitted) Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at p. 1626; is a doctrine that directs a court to adhere to its earlier decisions or to the decisions of courts that are higher in a jurisdiction's judicial hierarchy. More specifically, however, the doctrine operates in two distinct manners. First, the doctrine functions automatically in most cases. I will call this mode of operation the rule of precedent. Under this aspect of stare decisis, the court assumes that its prior decisions are correct and relies on such decisions in deciding the case before the court. Under the rule of precedent, our previous decisions are the bricks of the foundation on which the pending case will be decided. Moreover, we rely on such decisions, in large part, simply because they were decided prior in time, that is, because they are precedent. Each time this court cites a previous case to support a proposition, the rule of precedent mode of operation of stare decisis is implicitly at work. Second, stare decisis operates more explicitly and directly when we reconsider a previous decision or line of decisions. In this context, the doctrine provides a framework for determining whether the court should continue to abide by a past decision, even though it may be wrong. It is this distinct mode of operation-more particularly, the framework it provides-that I will address in this opinion. With these preliminary ideas in mind, I now turn to articulating a principled doctrine of stare decisis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   A Principled Doctrine of Stare Decisis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As I just explained, stare decisis guides this court's determination of whether it should adhere to a previous erroneous decision. Implicit in this framing of stare decisis is that the court must decide\n   whether the decision being reconsidered is wrong before it applies the doctrine of stare decisis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, and as I explain later\n   in this part of my opinion, the stare decisis analysis cannot be completely conducted unless the court has determined if, and more importantly, why, the previous decision is incorrect. Moreover, the court need not resort to the doctrine of stare decisis if it concludes that the previous decision is correct. See R. Fallon, \"Stare Decisis and the Constitution: An Essay on Constitutional Methodology,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%20570\">\n    76 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570 (2001). In such circumstances, the court can simply affirm the case on the basis of its merits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%20570\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I do not mean to suggest, however, that the wrongness of the previous decision is part of the stare decisis calculus. It is\n   <em>\n    not.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, it is fundamental that we avoid conflating the merits and stare decisis considerations. The reasons should be obvious. If a case could be overruled simply because a majority of justices believes it had reached the wrong conclusion, precedent would have no independent value, and stare decisis would be a hollow doctrine. See F. Schauer, \"Precedent,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20571\">\n    39 Stan.

In addition to placing too little value on precedent, the wrongness of a previous decision should not factor into the stare decisis calculus because it is difficult to quantify or measure the degree of a particular decision's wrongness. See J. Fisch, \"The Implications of Transition Theory for Stare Decisis,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20J.%20Contemp.%20Legal%20Issues%2093\">\n    13 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (2003). The ability to distinguish between the degrees of wrongness of previous cases becomes necessary, however, if wrongness is part of the stare decisis calculus. That is, if a lesser degree of error is tolerable but a higher degree of error is intolerable, some mechanism is needed to measure and distinguish degrees of error; but developing such a mechanism is prohibitively difficult.

Moreover, the merits determination is independent of, and has no impact on, the stare decisis analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Under this construction of stare decisis, the fact that Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson rely on the doctrine of stare decisis to uphold\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   suggests\n   that they both believe that decision is wrong. Of course, there can be no question that Chief Justice Rogers believes the decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is wrong. I am unsure whether Justice Robinson believes\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is wrong because he does not tell us, but, because he did not join Justice Palmer's concurrence and instead relies on stare decisis rather than the merits to uphold\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   I am left to conclude that he likely does believe that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was incorrectly decided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctrine of stare decisis naturally raises the following question: what justifies a doctrine that counsels this court to adhere to certain erroneous decisions?

Undoubtedly, this desire to achieve stability and consistency in our law is born from respect for the rule of law.

If fidelity to or concern for the rule of law justifies the doctrine of stare decisis, at least in part, then it is important that we understand what is encompassed in that ideal. At its essence, the rule of law is the concept that governmental power is exercised under, and constrained by, a framework of laws, not individual preference or ideology. J. Waldron, \"Stare Decisis and the Rule of Law: A Layered Approach,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n    111 Mich. L.Rev. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3 (2012). As Professor Randy J. Kozel aptly observed, this idea can helpfully be understood by comparison to its converse, the rule of individuals; see R. Kozel, \"Settled Versus Right: Constitutional Method and the Path of Precedent,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Tex.%20L.%20Rev.%201843\">\n    91 Tex. L.Rev. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1857 (2013) ; and Thomas Paine captured the concept when he proclaimed \"that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.\" T. Paine, Common Sense and Other Writings (2005) p. 44. Thus, adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis creates the appearance, and at times the reality, that this court is guided and constrained by the law-both written law, the constitution\n   and statutes, and decisional law, the rules set forth in the decisions of this court-and not the whim of its individual members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   What should be obvious, however, is that application of stare decisis can come into tension with the rule of law as well. For example, if this court, upon later consideration, concludes that our earlier reading of a constitutional provision was incorrect but nonetheless decides, due to stare decisis, to follow that erroneous reading, we have entrenched the\n   <em>\n    rule of individuals\n   </em>\n   -those individuals who comprised this court at the time of the earlier decision-rather than the rule of law. See J. Waldron, supra, at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%207\">\n    111 Mich. L.Rev. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This tension is particularly problematic in the context of constitutional adjudication, in which the text of the constitution, and not the construction given to it by this court, is the binding and supreme law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%207\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   After all, and in the words of Justice Douglas, a judge must remember, \"above all else that it is the [c]onstitution [that] he swore to support and defend, not the gloss [that] his predecessors may have put on it.\" W.

The balancing test I advocate includes four factors, one benefit and three costs. On the benefit side of the scale is the protection of reliance interests. The countervailing weights, that is, the costs of adhering to an erroneous judicial decision, are the (a) cost of error correction, (b) cost to the constitutional order, and (c) cost of unworkability or uncertainty. Each of these four factors will be discussed in this opinion. The analysis of each factor and the weighing of the benefit factor against the cost factors occur only after the court has concluded that the precedent in question is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Benefit of Stare Decisis-Protection of Reliance Interests\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At first glance, it would appear that the benefits of stare decisis are stability and constancy in the law.

Thus, as long as the law is predictable and relatively constant, citizens can rely on it in planning their affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   We have also directly recognized the importance of reliance interests when deciding whether to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. For example, in cases involving tort or criminal law, we often remark that \"[t]he arguments for adherence to precedent are least compelling ... when the rule to be discarded may not be reasonably supposed to have determined the conduct of the litigants....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we need to develop a framework in which to directly analyze what, if any, reliance interests a particular court precedent has engendered. The starting point, of course, is identifying the forms of reliance interests that may exist. One commentator has aptly organized these interests into four categories: specific reliance; governmental reliance; court reliance; and societal reliance. See R. Kozel, \"\n   <em>\n    Stare Decisis\n   </em>\n   as Judicial Doctrine,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Wash.%20%26%20Lee%20L.%20Rev.%20411\">\n    67 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Specific reliance arises when an individual or group conforms its behavior to rules announced by the court. For example, the United States Supreme Court has long held that stare decisis has special force in cases involving contract or property law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Tennessee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/#p849\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/#p849\">\n    501 U.S. at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/#p849\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved\"); see also T. Lee, \"Stare Decisis in Historical Perspective: From the Founding Era to the Rehnquist Court,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Vand.%20L.%20Rev.%20647\">\n    52 Vand. L.Rev. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691-98 (1999) (tracing property and contract distinction back to early nineteenth century United States Supreme Court cases). That court has explained that cases announcing property or contract rules are entitled to greater stare decisis weight because \"[everyone] would suppose that after the decision of [the] court, in a matter of that kind,\n   [they] might safely enter into contracts, upon the faith that rights thus acquired would not be disturbed.\"\n   <em>\n    Propeller Genesee Chief v.

It has also been observed that upsetting cases that establish rules of property can be injurious to many titles because, in conveying property, individuals rely on existing property and contract rules. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142852\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/265/472/#p486\">\n    265 U.S. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142852\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/265/472/#p486\">\n    44 S.Ct. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142852\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/265/472/#p486\">\n    68 L.Ed. 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1924) ; see also, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ozyck v.

In evaluating this cost, I consider whether the judicial error was constitutional or statutory in nature, because the cost of error will vary depending on its nature. Second, I evaluate the cost to the constitutional order. In assessing this cost, I ask if and how the error disrupts the constitutional order. Third, and finally, I consider the cost of the unworkability or uncertainty of the erroneous decision. Under this prong, I consider the difficulty\n   of implementing or the uncertainty created by the erroneous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Cost of Error Correction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that stare decisis has diminished force when the\n   precedent in question interprets or applies the constitution, as opposed to a statute.

Felton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"473\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    supra, at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When a court reaches an erroneous conclusion about the meaning or application of the constitution, such an error can be corrected only by judicial decision or constitutional amendment.

See\n   <em>\n    Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 406,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1175059\" index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/285/393/#p406\">\n    52 S.Ct. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Brandeis, J., dissenting).

Although the court does not discuss it in these terms, it can fairly be said that the preservation of judicial constitutional error imposes greater costs than the preservation of statutory error due to the limited recourse of the people to correct such error. See K. Lash, \"The Cost of Judicial Error: Stare Decisis and the Role of Normative Theory,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"479\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Notre%20Dame%20L.%20Rev.%202189\">\n    89 Notre Dame L.Rev. 2189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2195-97 (2014). Professor Kurt T.

Such costs result when a\n   judicial decision alters or disturbs the state polity. A brief digression into our constitutional history and theory is needed to better understand this harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   A fundamental principle of American government and constitutions, including the constitutions of the many states, is popular sovereignty. See A. Amar, \"The Central Meaning of Republican Government: Popular Sovereignty, Majority Rule, and the Denominator Problem,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"481\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20U.%20Colo.%20L.%20Rev.%20749\">\n    65 U. Colo. L.Rev. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749-51 (1994). In essence, popular sovereignty is the theory that, in a free society, the people hold the power, and the government has only that power the people delegate to it.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"482\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20U.%20Colo.%20L.%20Rev.%20749\">\n    Id., at 762-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining founding era understanding of republican government). The delegation of power occurs through the adoption of a constitution, which establishes the government and delegates the power among the branches.

Through this delegation, the people may reserve certain rights to themselves, limiting the government's power to act in particular areas. Also central to popular sovereignty is the people's ability to alter or abolish the established government, a right they exclusively hold. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20U.%20Colo.%20L.%20Rev.%20749\">\n    id., at 749, 762-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, evidence dating back to the 1630s demonstrates that the populace of the Connecticut colony adopted the popular sovereignty principles. See, e.g., W. Horton, \"Law and Society in Far-Away Connecticut,\" 8 Conn. J. Intl. L. 547, 549-50 (1993). In a 1638 sermon, Puritan Reverend Thomas Hooker expounded on these principles. See H. Cohn, \"Connecticut Constitutional History: 1636-1776,\" 64 Conn. B.J. 330, 332-33 (1990). Specifically, Reverend Hooker stressed that the civil power resided with the people, the people had the authority\n   to elect their political leaders, and the people established the limits within which their political leaders could act. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20U.%20Colo.%20L.%20Rev.%20749\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This sermon, it is argued by many, was the catalyst of the Fundamental Orders of 1639.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g., id., at 333-34; see also\n   W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution: A Reference Guide (2d Ed. 2012) p. 5. The Fundamental Orders contained \"the germs of a great principle-the principle of self-government based on a limited measure of popular control.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) H. Cohn, supra, at 335. This form of government and the popular sovereignty principles on which it was founded continued under the Charter of 1662,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   after Connecticut's signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and are embodied\n   in the 1818 and 1965 state constitutions. Indeed, the principle\n   is explicitly expressed in article first, \u00a7 2, of the Connecticut constitution: \"All political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   With this historical and theoretical background in mind, I return to discussing the costs inherent in following\n   erroneous constitutional decisions. In constitutional adjudication, we must take special care to ensure that we are enforcing the will of the people as expressed in their constitution. Because the ultimate power rests in the people and has been allocated to the separate branches of government, it is our duty to ensure that each branch, including the judiciary, does not usurp the power of its coequal branches. It is especially important that we take pains to restrain\n   <em>\n    this branch,\n   </em>\n   because a usurpation of legislative or executive power is, in effect, a usurpation of the people's power. It is true that the constitution entrenches certain fundamental principles, such as the freedom of the press, to immunize them from majoritarian control; however, most political and policy questions have been left to democratic rule, that is, majority control through the elected branches of government. In such cases, the people exercise their power and carry out or vindicate their will at the ballot box. Thus, it is essential that we not immunize from majoritarian control those questions that the people have left to the political process. To do so would be to misappropriate the power of the people.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   When we erroneously interpret or apply the constitution in ways that upset the governmental structure or intrude on the democratic process by frustrating the majoritarian government, we levy a cost on the constitutional order. See, e.g., K. Lash, \"Originalism, Popular Sovereignty, and\n   <em>\n    Reverse\n   </em>\n   Stare Decisis,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    93 Va. L.Rev. 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1442 (2007). Professor Lash provides a taxonomy that is helpful in understanding and evaluating such errors and the costs they impose. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1457-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He organizes judicial error in constitutional cases into two\n   broad parameters, namely, intervention versus nonintervention, and immunity versus allocation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    Id., at 1454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He explains his classifications as follows: \"First, courts may wrongfully intervene in the political process or they may wrongfully fail to intervene. Second, judicial error may involve a question of immunity (whether the government has any power over a given subject) or a question of allocation (which governmental institution has power over a given subject).\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The degree of harm imposed on popular sovereignty and the constitutional order, of course, varies with the type of error; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1457-61 ; and, as Professor Lash explains, depends on how intrusive the error is on the political process. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1456-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   I will begin with errors of allocation that, generally speaking, impose the smallest amount of harm on our constitutional order. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1457-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allocation cases are those involving questions of separation of powers. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the court erroneously allocates power to the wrong branch of government, the harm is minimal because, in most cases, the political process can correct such error. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, if we incorrectly determine that the Executive Branch has a power the constitution does not grant that branch, the people can reject\n   such error by electing a governor who will not exercise the wrongly allocated power.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    Id., at 1457-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allocation errors that appropriate power to the judiciary from the political branches are more problematic due to the court's insulation from the political process. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1455, 1458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In such cases, the costs inflicted on the constitutional system are dependent on the ability of the other branches to correct such error. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"498\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201437\">\n    id., at 1458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, if the judicial usurpation of authority can be corrected through the General Assembly's ability to define the jurisdiction of the court, the costs are minimal. See id.; see also Conn. Const. art. V, \u00a7 1 (\"[t]he powers and jurisdiction of these courts\n   shall be defined by law\"). If, however, the political process cannot correct such error, the costs are significant and of the same kind as discussed in erroneous cases of immunity intervention, which I discuss subsequently in this opinion. See K. Lash, supra, 93 Va. L.Rev. at 1458.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Cases of immunity involve the question of whether a particular issue is subject to political resolution; see id.; that is, whether the constitution has entrenched a principle, such as the freedom of the press, or left a question to the democratic process, such as general economic legislation. Immunity errors come in two forms, nonintervention and intervention. See id., at 1459. A nonintervention error imposes fewer costs on the constitutional order than does an intervention error. See id. Erroneous nonintervention occurs when the court fails to intervene, thereby overlooking a principle entrenched in the constitution and leaving it to the political process. See id., at 1454, 1459. Such error does undermine the legitimacy of our constitutional system by allowing a simple majority in the General Assembly to trump the entrenched will of the people; nonetheless, the costs generated by erroneous nonintervention are limited because the issue remains subject to majority control. See id., at 1459. Thus, if the court fails to protect a right entrenched in the constitution, the people can mobilize and, through the General Assembly, act to protect such right through legislation. See id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   On the other hand, intervention error occurs when the court entrenches a principle in the constitution that, under a proper reading of the document, has no constitutional status. See id., at 1455. Such error inflicts the greatest costs on popular sovereignty and the constitutional order because it often removes from the political process an issue that the constitution left to that process. See id., at 1460-61. Worse yet, the people have only one avenue to correct such error, namely, constitutional amendment, which requires either supermajoritarian\n   action by the General Assembly or awaiting the electorate's next opportunity to call a constitutional convention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 15 of this opinion.\n   In sum, judicial error in constitutional cases can frustrate the ideals of popular sovereignty and majority rule, thereby disturbing the constitutional order. The costs imposed by such a disruption should factor into this court's stare decisis calculus. Cases that involve the greatest costs are those of erroneous immunity intervention and erroneous usurpation of power by the court; in those cases, such usurpation cannot be corrected or mitigated by the political branches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Cost of Unworkability or Uncertainty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Perpetuating unworkable rules or uncertain judicial decisions also imposes costs. This principle naturally\n   flows from the justifications for stare decisis. That is, if stare decisis is a defensible doctrine because it creates predictability and stability in the law; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Conway v. Wilton,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197658\" index=\"499\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/238/653/#p658\">\n    238 Conn. at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20242\">\n    680 A.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; then decisions that create uncertainty \"undermine, rather than promote, the goals that stare decisis is meant to serve.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"501\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"502\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2563\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). It would be ironic to adhere to an uncertain precedent under the guise of stare decisis. Often, this principle arises when the court finds a previously announced rule to be unworkable or when it discovers that a particular precedent has come into conflict with another case or line of cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no reason, however, why the same principle should not apply when a case, despite not being unworkable or creating conflict in court jurisprudence, creates uncertainty. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"503\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    558 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"504\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"505\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (\"[I]f adherence to a precedent actually impedes the stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its stare decisis effect is also diminished. This can happen in a number of circumstances, such as when the precedent's validity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for decision in future cases ... and when the precedent's underlying reasoning has become so discredited that the [c]ourt cannot keep the precedent alive\n   without jury-rigging new and different justifications to shore up the original mistake.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court would employ a four step test in assessing whether\n   to adhere to stare decisis. In step one, the court will consider the merits of the case under reconsideration. If it concludes that the previous case is correct, it will reaffirm that decision on the merits, and the inquiry will end. On the other hand, if the court should conclude that the previous decision is wrong, it should continue on to steps two through four. In step two, the court will analyze the benefit of adhering to the precedent case. This analysis involves the evaluation of one factor, namely, the reliance interests. In assessing whether the case being reconsidered has engendered any reliance, the court must methodically work through each category of reliance interests-specific, governmental, court, and societal-and catalog how each group has ordered its behavior on the basis of the erroneous decision. It must further assess what disruption would result if the case is overruled. Next, in step three, the court would evaluate the costs of adhering to the erroneous decision, which requires the evaluation of three factors. Those factors include the (a) costs of correcting the judicial error, (b) costs the error imposes on the constitutional order, and (c) costs of unworkability or uncertainty. After the costs have been identified and evaluated, the court will move to the fourth and final step: the court would compare the benefit to the costs of adhering to the decision. If the reliance interests and the disruption costs that would arise from overruling the decision outweigh the costs of perpetuating judicial error, the previous decision will be afforded\n   stare decisis effect, and the court will be bound to follow it. If, however, the costs of preserving judicial error outweigh any reliance interests, the decision under reconsideration will be afforded no stare decisis effect, and it should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Application of Principled Doctrine of Stare Decisis to\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The court's adoption of the four step test outlined in part I A of this opinion would result in a more consistent and principled application of the doctrine of stare decisis. In fact, applying this approach would shield this court from the appearance that the doctrine of stare decisis is used as a tool to reach a preferred result.

I will consider each category in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   It cannot genuinely be argued that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has garnered any specific reliance.

E.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Salamon,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"509\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/#p519\">\n    287 Conn. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"510\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Driscoll,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653094\" index=\"512\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/312/\">\n    262 Conn. at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"513\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20A.2d%201003\">\n    813 A.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Sullivan, C.J.,\n   </em>\n   dissenting) (\"the doctrine of stare decisis has particular force in this case because of the long-standing nature of the common law [on] which our legislature has relied in crafting the remedies available to parties such as the plaintiffs\"). Moreover, neither\n   this court nor any other court in this state has relied on\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   to decide cases. Significantly, a judicial doctrine has not been built on the foundation of\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   In fact, courts that have been asked to apply the central holding of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   have elected to stay the proceedings and to await our decision in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally,\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has not amassed any societal reliance. As I discussed previously, societal reliance refers to the people's perception of our constitutional system and the relationship between themselves and government. The people of Connecticut have hardly had time to absorb our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and, thus, there has been little time for that decision to become part of Connecticut's consciousness.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   simply has not garnered, at least presently, the same level of social and historical significance as the United States Supreme Court's decisions in, for example,\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Board of Education,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"514\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n    347 U.S. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"515\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n    74 S.Ct. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"516\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20873\">\n    98 L.Ed. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954), or\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

The principles expounded on in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   have become part and parcel of who we are as a society, and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   is central to the people's understanding of their relationship with law enforcement. It cannot seriously be suggested that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has reached the same, or even similar, status. Whether the people of this state and country believe that capital punishment is, in all cases and under all circumstances, unconstitutional is far from a foregone conclusion, and, therefore,\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   does not represent a foundational legal norm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Clearly, there is not a scintilla of reliance on\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   Neither society nor the government has changed its behavior to comport with that decision. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is far from being part of our state consciousness. Even if it could be argued that there has been some reliance on\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   such reliance would surely be\n   unreasonable. This court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was released August 25, 2015, at a time when the present appeal was pending. On September 4, 2015, the state filed a motion for argument and reconsideration of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   a motion we denied on October 7, 2015. See\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra, 319 Conn. at 912,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"519\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.3d%20496\">\n    124 A.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    On that very day,\n   </em>\n   we also ordered supplemental briefing in this case, addressing, among other things, the effect of the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in an apparent moment of double speak, this court declined to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   and called its legitimacy into question. What's more, the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was not even final when we ordered supplemental briefing in this case. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

I will address each of the three costs outlined previously in this opinion. Those costs are the costs of error correction, costs to the constitutional order, and costs of unworkability or uncertainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Uncertainty of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   For the sake of brevity and clarity, I will first consider the creation of uncertainty. There is a great irony in\n   arguing that the dictates of stare decisis would have this court stand by a previous case that creates uncertainty.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is such a case. I do not suggest-nor could I-that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   announced an unclear rule of law or a test that will be unworkable in future cases. Nonetheless, the majority opinion in that case created an immense ambiguity, an ambiguity that has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over the powers of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The uncertainty arises from the majority's mode of analysis. In order to determine that the death penalty is now offensive to our state constitution, the majority employed a hybrid analysis of its own creation. As I noted in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   the majority's approach in that case fell somewhere between a per se analysis and a statutory analysis;\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"522\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J.,\n   </em>\n   dissenting); and, under that approach, the majority reached the amorphous conclusion that, in light of the legislature's adoption of P.A. 12-5, the death penalty no longer comports with the state's contemporary standards of decency, no longer serves any legitimate penological purposes, and, therefore, is prohibited by the state constitution. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    id., at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"525\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   I admit that parsing the 140 page majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   can be a difficult and, at times, perplexing task. After giving that decision careful, thorough, and thoughtful consideration, however, I concluded that the majority had not determined that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional, and the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   had not disputed that conclusion. See id., at 341-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"526\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J.,\n   </em>\n   dissenting). Although the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   never explicitly states that its holding was not per se, it seemed to suggest as much. For example, in a footnote, the majority acknowledged that \"society's standards of decency need not always evolve in the same direction. We express no opinion as to the circumstances under which a reviewing court might conclude, on the basis of a revision to our state's capital\n   felony\n   statutes or other change in these indicia, that capital punishment again comports with Connecticut's standards of decency and, therefore, passes constitutional muster.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"527\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 86 n. 88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"528\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A logical reading of this passage suggests that some action short of a constitutional amendment, such as a repeal of P.A. 12-5, would suffice to render the death penalty constitutional in Connecticut. In addition, the majority concluded its decision by holding \"that capital punishment,\n   <em>\n    as currently applied,\n   </em>\n   violates the constitution of Connecticut.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    Id., at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A plurality of justices in the present case, however, has caused me to query whether my reading of the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was incorrect. Justice Palmer, the author of the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and two other members of the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   now maintain that, \"[i]f the people of Connecticut believe that we have misperceived the scope of [the state] constitution, it now falls on them to amend it.\" Text accompanying footnote 21 of Justice Palmer's concurring opinion. If, however, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was not per se, why is a constitutional amendment necessary to reinstate capital punishment? The plurality notes that the issue of whether capital punishment may be reinstated in this state by means other than a constitutional amendment is not before us in this case; see footnote 21 of Justice Palmer's concurring opinion; and, therefore, the plurality expresses no opinion on that question. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The plurality simply creates further confusion regarding the ultimate holding in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   It is now obvious that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has created a great degree of uncertainty, and continuing that uncertainty will impose costs. It is true that this court's decisions will often generate some amount of uncertainty. That uncertainty, however, concerns whether the law announced in a case will apply under different factual circumstances. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Campos v. Coleman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"532\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%2036\">\n    319 Conn. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    123 A.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), this court recognized\n   a cause of action for loss of parental consortium. The court did not decide, however, the outer limits of that claim. See, e.g., id., at 46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    123 A.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We did not determine whether a stepchild, who has not been legally adopted by his or her stepparent, would be permitted to bring such a claim if the stepparent is injured.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In addition, we left open whether the cause of action extends to parental type relationships in which the parental figure is not a biological or legal parent of the child.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   created some degree of uncertainty as to the extent of liability in certain tort cases. This type of uncertainty, however, is to be expected, and is tolerable, particularly in common-law adjudication, where incremental development of the law is preferred. The uncertainty created by\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and evinced by Justice Palmer's concurring opinion in the present case, however, is of a different kind and degree. Due to the meandering reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   members of the legislature, as well as this court, are uncertain of what, if any, authority the legislature has to enact a capital felony statutory scheme in the future. This uncertainty is intolerable and imposes significant costs on our system of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    Santiago's\n   </em>\n   Tax on Our Constitutional Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Closely related to the cost of this uncertainty are the costs\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   places on our constitutional order. When a judicial decision erroneously immunizes an issue from majoritarian control and mistakenly allocates power to the judiciary, when such allocation cannot be corrected by majoritarian action, it taxes our constitutional order\n   greatly. See K. Lash, supra, 93 Va. L.Rev. at 1458, 1460-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   I will first address\n   <em>\n    Santiago's\n   </em>\n   specious immunization of capital punishment from majoritarian control. I will explain how the court has created a constitutional right\n   when none existed. It will then be necessary, due to the contorted reasoning of the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   to consider whether the issue of capital punishment has been removed from majoritarian control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In concluding that the death penalty is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   created a right that is not grounded in Connecticut's constitution. As I explained in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   a cursory textual analysis of the constitution reveals numerous references to capital punishment and capital offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at 353-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J.,\n   </em>\n   dissenting). The entrenchment of these references in our state constitution suggests that the people of Connecticut have conferred on their government the power to impose the ultimate punishment. More specifically, they bestowed that authority on the legislature. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Darden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529219\" index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/171/677/#p679\">\n    171 Conn. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679-80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20A.2d%2099\">\n    372 A.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) (\"the constitution assigns to the legislature the power to enact laws defining crimes and fixing the degree and method of punishment ... within the limits and according to the methods therein provided\"). The majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   swept away those textual references by suggesting they were \"incidental\" and \"merely acknowledge that the penalty was in use at the time of drafting ... [and] do not forever enshrine the death penalty's constitutional status as standards of decency continue to evolve....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 131,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so doing, however, the majority ignored two important events. First, the delegates to the 1965 constitutional convention expressly rejected a proposed amendment that would have made capital punishment unconstitutional. Journal of the Constitutional Convention of Connecticut 1965, p. 111. Second, in 1972, article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution was amended to provide that \"no person shall,\n   <em>\n    for a capital offense,\n   </em>\n   be tried by a jury of less than twelve jurors without his consent.\" (Emphasis added.) Conn. Const. amend. IV. In light of these events, it cannot be said that the constitutional references to capital punishment are merely incidental. Together, the textual references to capital punishment and capital crimes, and the rejection of the proposed abolition of the death penalty at the 1965 constitutional convention, entrench capital punishment in our state constitution, thereby requiring a constitutional amendment to make the death penalty unconstitutional under all circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, by embedding the death penalty in the state constitution, the people expressed their opinion that the punishment is not, and cannot be, per se unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Although it is clear that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   created a right not provided by the constitution, it is less clear whether it immunizes capital punishment from majoritarian control. As I discussed previously in this part of my opinion, the precise holding of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is uncertain. In that case, the majority seemed to suggest that whether the death penalty could be imposed remained subject to majoritarian decision. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   86 n. 88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]e express no opinion as to the circumstances under which a reviewing court might conclude ... that capital punishment again comports\n   with Connecticut's standards of decency\"). In the present case, however, Justice Palmer, along with two other justices, suggests that, under\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   the death penalty may be per se unconstitutional and that perhaps capital punishment may be reinstated through constitutional amendment only. See text accompanying footnote 21 of Justice Palmer's concurring opinion. If this latter reading is correct, preserving the error in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   will impose significant costs on the constitutional order because it has removed from the political process a matter that the constitution has expressly left to that process. If, on the other hand, the former reading is correct, and capital punishment can be reinstated by the legislature-for example, by repealing P.A. 12-5-then the costs of this court's error, although still existent, are less significant. This uncertainty surely has a chilling effect on the legislature. Even if the legislature has the authority to reinstate the death penalty, it may be reluctant to do so for fear that such action is unconstitutional under the majority's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   This chilling effect increases the costs that arise from continued adherence to\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Regardless of whether\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   immunizes capital punishment from majoritarian control, it does impose allocation costs on the constitutional order. Moreover, the allocation error cannot be corrected through majoritarian action and, therefore, levies substantial costs on the constitutional order. As I just explained, the people have enshrined capital punishment with constitutional status. Furthermore, defining crime and fixing punishment are part of the legislative, not judicial, power. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Darden,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529219\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/171/677/#p679\">\n    171 Conn. at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20A.2d%2099\">\n    372 A.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, by conferring the legislative power on the General Assembly, the people determined that it is that body who shall define capital crimes. See Conn. Const. art. III, \u00a7 1 (\"[t]he legislative power of this state shall be vested in ... the general assembly\"). It is true that\n   the General Assembly, when defining crime and fixing punishment, must act within the limits of the constitution;\n   <em>\n    State v.

In sum, the people have determined that capital punishment is, at least in certain circumstances, constitutional. They expressed such belief in our constitution. Moreover, the people granted the General Assembly the power to define capital crimes. At the same time, however, the people implicitly prohibited the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment, a prohibition enforced by the Judicial Branch. Even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that the constitutional provision generally prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment is inconsistent with the enshrining of capital punishment with constitutional status, it is rudimentary that we read conflicting provisions of statutes and of the constitution, so far as is possible, to\n   be consistent and to give effect to every word and provision thereof. Thus, the most probable reading of these seemingly conflicting commands is that the people determined that capital punishment is a constitutional punishment for the most heinous of crimes. In so doing, they determined that there are particular situations in which the death penalty is a constitutional punishment. Thus, under our current constitution, the death penalty cannot be held unconstitutional in all cases and under all circumstances. In addition, the people left for the legislature the decision of which crimes shall be capital crimes. Of course, in the exercise of that power, the legislature could determine that it will not impose the death penalty as a punishment for any crime. Moreover, the legislature's power is checked by our duty to enforce\n   the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In this context, our duty is limited to determinations of whether the death penalty is unconstitutional as applied to certain crimes or certain persons, or as carried out, and not whether the death penalty, in and of itself, is cruel and unusual. In\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   we exceeded the outer bounds of this duty by determining that the death penalty no longer comports with the state's contemporary standards of decency and by concluding that it thus can never be imposed. Our decision was not limited to an as applied determination. Thus, we have usurped the power of the legislature to define capital crimes and to fix the appropriate punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   To compound our affront to the legislature's power, this court's power grab cannot be corrected through majoritarian action. Even if it is assumed that the legislature could reinstate the death penalty by, for example, repealing P.A. 12-5, it appears that the ultimate decision regarding whether the constitution permits the imposition of capital punishment rests with this court. The majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   stated: \"We express no opinion as to the circumstances under which\n   <em>\n    a reviewing court\n   </em>\n   might conclude ... that capital punishment again comports with Connecticut's standards of decency and, therefore, passes constitutional muster.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   86 n. 88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"553\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, in the present case, a plurality of justices suggests that reinstating the death penalty may require a constitutional amendment, but it reserves that question for another day. See footnote 21 and accompanying text of Justice Palmer's concurring opinion. The majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   contorted our constitutional order by concluding that this court will decide when the death penalty, in and of itself, is again constitutional. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 86 n. 88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"554\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As I have explained, our constitution enshrined capital punishment with constitutional status and left to the legislature decisions\n   regarding if and when it should be imposed, subject to limited, as applied, review by this court. Now, however, the legislature cannot reinstate a capital punishment scheme\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   without the approval of this court or perhaps, as the plurality states, only through a constitutional amendment. This is an intolerable seizure of legislative power by this court, an error that apparently can be corrected through constitutional amendment only. Thus, the only reasonable conclusion I can reach is that continuing to follow the erroneous decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   will levy great costs on the constitutional order of Connecticut because, in that decision, this court altered the balance of power created by the people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Costs of Correcting\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   Are Likely Significant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Finally, I turn to the difficulty of error correction and the costs it imposes. Erroneous constitutional decisions create greater costs than erroneous statutory or common-law\n   decisions because of the difficulty in correcting such error. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Agostini v. Felton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    521 U.S. at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stare decisis \"is at its weakest when [a court] interpret [s] the [c]onstitution because [its] interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling [its] prior decisions\"). When we improperly interpret the constitution, that error can be corrected only by constitutional amendment or by decision of this court. E.g.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p235\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   When, on the other hand, we improperly interpret or apply a statute or common-law rule, the legislature can correct our mistake through simple, majoritarian action. Thus, because\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is a constitutional decision, perpetuation of its error will impose a significant cost. Even if the legislature could reinstate the death penalty notwithstanding our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   the damage caused by the decision would remain. Without a constitutional amendment or\n   the overruling of\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   the reasoning of that case will remain intact. If the reasoning remains, so does the usurpation of legislative power, because, in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   the majority indicated that\n   <em>\n    a reviewing court\n   </em>\n   would serve as the arbiter of whether and when capital punishment will again comport with contemporary standards of decency in Connecticut. The difficulty of correcting our error, therefore, is significant, particularly given the restrictive method of constitutional amendment in Connecticut. See footnote 15 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Step Four: Weighing the Benefit and Costs of Affording\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   Stare Decisis Effect\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The imbalance between the reliance interests that would be protected and the costs that would result from adhering to\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is so clear that I almost need not express it. The weighing in the present case is akin to using an elephant (costs of giving stare decisis effect to\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ) as a counterweight for a mouse (reliance interests). In all actuality, using a mouse to represent the reliance interests at stake is far too generous. Not a single individual or institution, including this state's government, has acted in reliance of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   In fact, that decision's legitimacy was placed on shaky ground from the beginning because we questioned its precedential effect before the judgment in that case was final; see\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra, 319 Conn. at 935,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20520\">\n    125 A.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying state's motion for stay of judgment); and, therefore, even if there had been any reliance on\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   it would have been unreasonable. The costs of adhering to that decision, however, are astronomical. First, and most significant,\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   has upset the balance of governmental power created by our constitution. In that case, this court took for itself a power that\n   always has resided in the legislature. Moreover, the only way to restore the equilibrium of governmental power is by amending the state constitution, which is no easy task. Second, the ultimate holding of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is unclear. Third, that decision may or may not have immunized capital punishment from majoritarian control, despite the people's intention, expressed through the constitution, to allow the democratic and political processes to determine if and when the ultimate punishment might be imposed. Finally, if this court does not now overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   a constitutional amendment is the only certain way to correct this court's overreaching. On balance, it is clear that the costs far outweigh the benefit of applying stare decisis to\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and therefore, that decision should be overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   THE COURT'S INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   In their concurring opinions, Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson focus primarily on concerns over this court's legitimacy. Chief Justice Rogers argues that overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   within one year of deciding that case simply because there has been a change in court membership would call into question the integrity of\n   this court and our commitment to the rule of law. Similarly, Justice Robinson concludes that the present case turns on the \"stare decisis considerations of this court's institutional legitimacy and stability....\" Text accompanying footnote 2 of Justice Robinson's concurring opinion. He continues by stating that, if this court were to now overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   it would appear that an important constitutional case was retracted simply due to a change in court personnel. I am not unsympathetic to my colleagues' concerns over the legitimacy of the court. Indeed, I agree that it would be a travesty if we were to overrule our previous cases simply because they no longer comport with the personal and ideological beliefs of a majority of the justices of this court. That, however, is not this case. Moreover, the idea that we may subordinate our oath to uphold the constitution to concerns about this court's public appearance is incomprehensible. See Conn. Const. art. XI, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The arguments in the concurring opinions of Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson rest on faulty premises. First, they both seem to suggest that overturning court precedent is inconsistent with the rule of law. For example, Chief Justice Rogers apparently feels bound by\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   because of her \"respect for the rule of law,\" and Justice Robinson concludes that we should follow\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   because to do otherwise \"would imperil our state's commitment to the rule of law....\" Second, and far more bizarre, Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson contend that the change in court membership is an insufficient reason to overturn\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   in the present case. Of course, I agree that a change in court personnel cannot justify overruling an earlier decision; that fact, however, would not serve as the basis for overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   Instead, we would overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   because, one, the reasoning of the majority opinion in that case was inherently flawed and led to an erroneous conclusion, and, two, a weighing\n   of the benefit and costs of applying the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that it should not be applied to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   I will further expound on the flaws in both of these premises, but, before I do, I will briefly explain from what source the court derives its legitimacy. This court's legitimacy arises from the willingness of the people of Connecticut to accept and obey the court's decisions and is \"a product\n   of substance and perception....\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

Stated differently, the court receives and maintains its legitimacy by deciding cases through the objective and dispassionate application of the law and by ignoring how such cases will be perceived by the public.

They take the argument one step further, however, and conflate stare decisis with the rule of law. To be sure, at times, adherence to precedent serves the ideals of the rule of law,\n   but, as I discussed in part I A of this opinion, blindly following precedent can also result in a great cost on the rule of law. I can think of no case in which this reality has been more readily apparent than in the present case. In her dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   Chief Justice Rogers stated: \"[B]ecause there is no legitimate legal basis for finding the death penalty unconstitutional under either the federal or the state constitution, I can only conclude that the majority has improperly decided that the death penalty must be struck down because it\n   <em>\n    offends the majority's subjective sense of morality.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Then, in dissent to this court's denial of the state's motion for argument, which the state had filed after we issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   she wrote: \"By denying the state's motion for argument and reconsideration, the majority merely reconfirms my belief that it has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   engaged in an objective assessment of the constitutionality of the death penalty under our state constitution.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of Chief Justice Rogers' belief that the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was driven by the individual predilections of the justices who had joined that opinion, her contention in the present case that the rule of law binds her to that decision, as Justice Scalia might say, \"taxes the credulity of the credulous.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Insofar as it is perception that Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson are worried\n   about, the answer is simple. To prevent the appearance that we are a court driven by the whim of a majority of the justices, we must carefully obey the rule of law. We do so by applying an objective and transparent standard to weigh the benefit and costs of giving\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   stare decisis effect. Applying objective standards in a neutral way, and then articulating the reasons for our holding, will placate any appearance that this court is governed by people rather than by laws. After all, the rule of law, at its essence, is governmental decision-making within a framework of\n   <em>\n    laws.\n   </em>\n   As Professor Daniel A. Farber so aptly put it in a slightly different context, it is understandable for justices to be troubled by the perception that they are acting, not on the basis of their interpretation of the law but, rather, on the basis of the personal proclivities of a majority of the justices. See D. Farber, \"The Rule of Law and the Law of Precedents,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"578\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Minn.%20L.%20Rev.%201173\">\n    90 Minn. L.Rev. 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1197 (2006). \"The proper response, however, is for those [j]ustices to consider the merits of the case with particular care, to guard against any unconscious influences from political pressures [or personal belief] one way or the other, and then to explain their reasoning with clarity to the public.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Minn.%20L.%20Rev.%201173\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   As I have already discussed, the careful application of an objective stare decisis standard clearly dictates that this court should not uphold\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   on the basis of stare decisis. To do otherwise would disserve, and not enhance, the integrity of this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   I now turn to the second premise of Chief Justice Rogers' and Justice Robinson's contentions, namely, that the change in this court's membership between\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   and the present case\n   <em>\n    is the reason\n   </em>\n   we would\n   overturn\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their reasoning suffers from the logical fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc, or \"after this, therefore resulting from it.\" Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at p. 1355; see also id. (defining \"post hoc ergo propter hoc\" as \"[t]he logical fallacy of assuming that a causal relationship exists when acts or events are merely sequential\"). Their reasoning is simple. Because the present appeal has been decided after a change in the court's membership, the change in the membership is the reason to overturn\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   The flaw in this argument should be evident. If this court now were to overturn\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   it would not be because Justice Robinson replaced Justice Norcott. Certainly, the change in court membership may be a circumstance under which the overruling occurs, but it is nothing more\n   than pure happenstance. Instead, the actual reasons for overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   as I have already stated, would be, one, a majority of the justices believes that decision is not supported by the law and, two, after\n   weighing the benefit and costs of stare decisis, a majority of the justices concludes that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is not deserving of stare decisis effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Even more troubling than the fallaciousness of this argument is its suggestion that this court is bound, now and forever, to follow any decision, right or wrong,\n   unless the panel that decided the previous case is identical to the panel that wishes to overrule that case. Such a rule would completely ignore the past practice of this court. In fact, I have yet to uncover, despite considerable research, a case in which a panel overruling a previous decision of this court was identical to the panel that decided the case being overruled. This has held true even when we have overruled a decision only shortly after it was released. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v. DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713810\" index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/418/#p437\">\n    288 Conn. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"581\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), we overruled a conclusion we reached seven weeks earlier in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Despite the passage of such little time, the panels in both cases were not identical.\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino\n   </em>\n   was decided by Chief Justice Rogers and Justices Norcott, Katz, Palmer, and me. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Sanseverino,\n   </em>\n   supra, 287 Conn. at 608,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"586\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201156\">\n    949 A.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Justices Vertefeuille and Sullivan, however,\n   were also members of the panel in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v. DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 418,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"587\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perhaps some might argue that the panel change did not impact our decision to overrule\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino,\n   </em>\n   but that fact is of no legal significance. It has likewise been observed that many overruling decisions in the United States Supreme Court were issued after a change in court membership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In response, I imagine that Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson would echo the arguments made by\n   one of our colleagues at oral argument in the present case. At oral argument, it was suggested that some change in circumstances or law, other than a change in court personnel, is necessary to justify overruling a prior decision. Perhaps they would justify this court's previous departures from precedent, despite the changes in court composition, by explaining that \"[e]xperience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    George v. Ericson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237147\" index=\"588\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/312/#p318\">\n    250 Conn. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"589\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20A.2d%20889\">\n    736 A.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). And, of course, this justification would undoubtedly explain some of our past overruling decisions. It does not, however, explain why we should be restrained from overruling a case that was demonstrably wrong when decided, has not engendered any reliance, and imposes significant costs on society simply because a justice who decided it has been replaced.

Instead, the\n   majority in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   merely concluded that\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino\n   </em>\n   was wrong. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

If a change in court membership could prevent a subsequent court from considering a previous court's decision, \"segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the [g]overnment could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"605\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    558 U.S. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"606\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Surely, such a rule is not sound policy.\n   Perhaps realizing the illogicality of a rule that would prohibit this court from overruling an erroneous decision simply because a member of the majority that reached such decision has left the court, Chief Justice Rogers suggests that we employ an even more unreasonable test. See footnote 2 of Chief Justice Rogers' concurring opinion. She acknowledges that a manifestly incorrect decision that has engendered no reliance may be overturned. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"607\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In determining whether a prior decision is manifestly incorrect, however, she is guided not by what a majority of the current justices thinks but by what the majority of the justices in the prior decision thinks, or might think if they still occupied a seat on our bench.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"608\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p379\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, the salient question\n   in the present appeal becomes: \"What would Justice Norcott do?\" And the current court is required to divine an answer. Surely, the reader does not need me to call his or her attention to the theoretical flaw in this idea. Under such a test, our decisions will turn on pure speculation regarding how a former justice, or justices, would decide a current case if they were still on the court. In addition, justices who have reached the constitutionally required retirement age, and in some cases, who have passed away, will continue to rule supreme in this institution, not because of the decisions they wrote, and the reasoning therein, but simply\n   because they happened to vote with the majority in a case that is subsequently under reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Normally, I accept what my colleagues have written and do not attempt to uncover a delitescent meaning\n   or ulterior motive, and I will not do so in the present case. I have trouble accepting, however, that it is the institutional integrity of this court that truly concerns Chief Justice Rogers. First, she largely agrees with the stare decisis analysis I have presented in this opinion. See footnote 2 of Chief Justice Rogers' concurring opinion. Second, she does not refute my argument that this court's legitimacy comes from a fidelity to the rule of law; overruling prior cases is, in many instances, consistent with the rule of law, and any appearance that we are driven by the rule of individuals can be placated by the application of an objective stare decisis test. Third, in the recent past, neither this court nor Chief Justice Rogers has expressed concern about overruling a prior decision after a change in court membership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chief Justice Rogers also expresses concern that overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would send the message that a challenge to any four to three decision may be mounted when a member of the original majority leaves the court. My response is concise and simple: So what. This has been, and will always be, the case, unless we make stare decisis an inexorable command. A challenge may, at any time, be mounted against any of our previous decisions, whether they are four to three, five to two, six to one, or unanimous. That is part of our constitutional system. For a period of more than thirty years, criminal defendants repeatedly and consistently attacked this court's interpretation of the state's kidnapping statutes. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Luurtsema,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653132\" index=\"609\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/179/#p200\">\n    262 Conn. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200, 202,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"610\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20A.2d%20223\">\n    811 A.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    State v. Salamon,\n   </em>\n   supra, 287 Conn. at 513-14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"615\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court decided to adopt the interpretation the criminal defendants had been advocating for years. Moreover, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   did not seem troubled at all by the fact that various earlier compositions of this court had repeatedly rejected such an interpretation.\n   This court need not stand blindly by an earlier decision simply because it was reached on the narrowest of votes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, what is important is that the court objectively apply the legal rules that govern each case and decide, on the basis of a neutral application of a principled stare decisis doctrine, whether the dictates of stare decisis require us to continue to adhere to an earlier, erroneous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In sum, the argument that the integrity and legitimacy of this court would be undermined by overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is faulty. First, the rule of law does not bind us to erroneous precedent. Instead, it requires us to neutrally apply an objective stare decisis framework and to decide whether the benefit of affording\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   stare decisis effect is outweighed by the costs. Second, if the entire court were to reexamine our holding in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and, after such examination, a majority of the justices were to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is wrong, it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be because there has been a change in the court's membership.\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In closing, I want to note an astute observation once made by Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes, when he was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. In response to the argument that dissent weakens the court's institutional prestige, Justice Hughes wrote: \"When unanimity can be obtained without sacrifice of conviction, it strongly commends the decision to public confidence. But unanimity [that] is merely formal, [that] is recorded at the expense of strong, conflicting views, is not desirable in a court of last resort, whatever may be the effect [on] public opinion at the time. This is so because what must ultimately sustain the court in public confidence is the character and independence of the judges. They are not there simply to decide cases, but to decide them as they think they should be decided, and while it may be regrettable that they cannot always agree, it is better that their independence should be maintained and recognized than that unanimity should be secured through its sacrifice.\" C. Hughes, The Supreme Court of the United States: Its Foundation, Methods and Achievements-An Interpretation (1928) pp. 67-68. The observation of Justice Hughes is equally applicable in the present case. What will ultimately sustain this court's legitimacy is a prudent and independent exercise of the judgment of each individual justice, guided, of course, by our constitution and our laws. Just as it may be regrettable when the justices do not all agree, it may also be regrettable that our public appearance may temporarily be tarnished when we overrule a previous decision in short order. Far greater, and more important, than such regret, however, is our oath to uphold the constitution and our\n   duty to objectively interpret that law. I am troubled by the suggestion that we must adhere to a decision, despite our belief that such a decision is unconstitutional, for no reason other than the appearance that we have changed our mind due to a change in court personnel. I cannot, in good conscience, join the court in such action. I believe the oath we take requires more of us.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    Given that my dissenting opinion does not address his concurring opinion, it is puzzling that Justice Palmer feels the need to respond to my dissent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    I observe that unlike Chief Justice Rogers, Justice Robinson does not embrace the notion that there are any circumstances when stare decisis requires the court to adhere to a clearly wrong decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-333\">\n    See Black's Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) (noting Latin phrase post hoc, ergo propter hoc is translated as \" 'after this, therefore because of this,' \" and defining phrase as \"relating to the fallacy of assuming causality from temporal sequence; confusing sequence with consequence\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-334\">\n    The similarity in case names between\n    <em>\n     State v.

That irony is not lost on me. This overruling, however, is justified under the analysis I set forth subsequently in this opinion. Briefly, there is no doubt that our stare decisis doctrine has been relied on by individuals and the branches of government. See part I A 1 of this opinion (addressing reliance interests in stare decisis). In fact, each time an individual or government agency, including a court, relies on a decision of this court, it is implicitly relying on stare decisis and the belief that we will not overrule such a decision. Those interests, however, are outweighed by the costs of adhering to our current jurisprudence on this point. First, and most important, our current doctrine is unworkable and unpredictable. See footnotes 3 and 30 of this opinion; see also part I A 2 c of this opinion (explaining cost of unworkability and uncertainty). Second, it is likely that only this court can bring order to the chaos in our stare decisis jurisprudence. See part I A 2 a of this opinion (discussing cost of error correction). Because the doctrine is, in essence, a principle of judicial decision-making, it seems unlikely that the General Assembly could legislate on the matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-294\">\n    I acknowledge that this court's past practice may not have required that we first decide whether the previous decision was correct. As I will explain in this part of my opinion, however, deciding the merits question as a threshold matter, and keeping such determination independent of the stare decisis analysis, provides a more objective, and therefore principled, approach to stare decisis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    I recognize that, previously in this opinion, I criticized Chief Justice Rogers for overlooking the clearly wrong exception to our stare decisis jurisprudence. I did so, however, to point out this court's inconsistent application of stare decisis, not to suggest that a previous decision's wrongness should continue to be part of this court's stare decisis calculus.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-296\">\n    I acknowledge that Justice Robinson does not agree that the merits and stare decisis analyses are distinct and separate. Instead, he considers the degree of a precedent's wrongness to be a component in deciding whether a prior decision should be given stare decisis effect. He gives two reasons why he cannot agree with a stare decisis framework, such as the one presented in this opinion, that does not consider a precedent's relative degrees of wrongness. I will address each of these concerns in turn but first note that this court's decisions are either right or wrong. To what degree a decision is wrong does not, in the end, change the fact that it is wrong. This point is particularly important in constitutional adjudication, such as in the present case. Our constitution is the supreme law of this state, and all judges have sworn an oath to uphold it. If a case purporting to expound on the constitution is wrong as to its meaning or application, that case is in conflict with the constitution, and the mere fact that the case might be only slightly wrong, whatever that might mean, does not save it. This is why the degree to which a precedent is wrong is irrelevant to the stare decisis calculus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    With respect to Justice Robinson's concerns, he first states that the stare decisis analysis set forth in this opinion \"appears to be receptive to overruling precedent in a way that undercuts the salutary features with respect to promoting stability in the law.\" Footnote 5 of Justice Robinson's concurring opinion. This point highlights a theoretical difference in our views. Justice Robinson, it appears, believes that stability in the law, in and of itself, has some normative value worthy of protection. Thus, if a prior decision of this court is only slightly wrong, he might sustain it for the sake of preserving stability. In my view, however, stability has no normative value independent of the protection of actual reliance interests, as I explain in part I A 1 of this opinion, and, therefore, it is the degree of reliance, not wrongness, that I consider to be important in a stare decisis analysis. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     State v. Salamon,\n    </em>\n    supra, 287 Conn. at 520,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"649\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n     949 A.2d 1092\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that adherence to precedent and, thereby, in my view, stability, \"is not an end in and of itself\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Insofar as Justice Robinson might be suggesting that stability in our case law is important because it engenders public reliance on our decisions, I submit that such an interest is equally protected by a stare decisis analysis focused on assessing the reliance a decision has garnered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    Second, Justice Robinson argues that my approach \"overrule[s] certain well established principles of stare decisis, namely, that: (1) the prior decision must be shown to be '\n    <em>\n     clearly wrong\n    </em>\n    ' with a 'clear showing that an established rule is incorrect and harmful' ... and (2) 'a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the\n    <em>\n     most cogent\n    </em>\n    reasons and\n    <em>\n     inescapable logic\n    </em>\n    require it.' \" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) Footnote 5 of Justice Robinson's concurring opinion. I have acknowledged this irony and have explained why our stare decisis jurisprudence should be overruled. See footnote 6 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    This natural tension is less apparent and problematic when this court considers stare decisis in the context of the common law, because the source of the common law is precedent, and not a written constitution or code. Moreover, the common law has developed incrementally and overtime.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-300\">\n    Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson both claim that maintenance of the court's legitimacy is also a benefit of stare decisis. Perhaps at a superficial level they are correct, but, upon deeper reflection, it becomes clear that the court's legitimacy comes from fidelity to the rule of law. See part II of this opinion. At times, the rule of law will counsel us to follow precedent, and, in such cases, adherence to the dictates of stare decisis does contribute to the court's institutional legitimacy. Other times, however, fidelity to the rule of law will require us to depart from erroneous judicial decisions. In such cases, after fair and careful consideration and impartial application of the applicable law, this court's legitimacy is not harmed simply because it has decided to depart from a previous erroneous ruling. Thus, for these reasons, I do not believe that this court's legitimacy is an appropriate factor to be considered in the stare decisis calculus. Moreover, if Chief Justice Rogers and Justice Robinson were right, we could rarely, if ever, overrule precedent. See part II of this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-301\">\n    In the past, we have also cited the conservation of resources and judicial efficiency as justifications for stare decisis. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Conway v. Wilton,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197658\" index=\"650\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/238/653/#p658\">\n     238 Conn. at 659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"651\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20242\">\n     680 A.2d 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It seems to me that these benefits, however, are reasons to adhere to precedent in general and not justifications for the continued adherence to wrong decisions specifically. In the words of then Judge, later Justice, Benjamin N. Cardozo, \"the labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.\" B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921) p. 149. Thus, following precedent conserves resources and fosters efficiency because it prevents the court from having to consider every possible issue, in every case. For example, if a criminal defendant claims that he has been tried and convicted in violation of the state constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy, he need not first argue that the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution prohibits double jeopardy. Instead, he may rely on our cases holding to that effect. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     State v. Gonzalez,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170488\" index=\"652\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/302/287/#p314\">\n     302 Conn. 287\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 314-15,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"653\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20A.3d%20648\">\n     25 A.3d 648\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). Thus, adherence to precedent creates efficiency and conserves resources by allowing litigants to rely and build on our past decisions in order to frame their arguments and focus our attention on the unique issues that arise in their case, rather than having to start from ground zero. When we decide to reexamine a previous decision, however, as we have in the present case, little efficiency results from adherence to stare decisis after briefs are filed and arguments are heard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-302\">\n    <em>\n     Salamon\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Conway\n    </em>\n    are but two examples in which this court has decided to revisit and overrule its prior decisions because the discarded cases had not conjured any meaningful reliance.

First, any legislator may propose an amendment. See Conn. Const. amend. VI. The proposed amendment must be approved either by three fourths of the members of each house of the General Assembly or by at least a majority of the members of each house in two successive sessions of the General Assembly. Conn. Const. amend. VI. Once so adopted, the amendment is presented to the people for their approval at the next general election. Conn. Const. amend. VI. To become effective, it must receive the support of a majority of the electors voting on the amendment. Conn. Const. amend.

A constitutional convention can be called by either the General Assembly or the people. See Conn. Const. art. XIII, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. The General Assembly may convene a constitutional convention by a two-thirds vote of the members of each house. Conn. Const. art. XIII, \u00a7 1. A convention can be convened in this way at any time not earlier than ten years since the convening of a prior convention. Conn. Const. art. XIII, \u00a7 1. Alternatively, every twenty years, the people are presented, at a general election, with the question of whether a constitutional convention shall be convened. See Conn. Const. art. XIII, \u00a7 2. If a majority of the electors voting on such question call for a convention, a convention will be convened. See Conn. Const. art. XIII, \u00a7 2.

XIII, \u00a7 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-307\">\n    As is evident from the foregoing discussion, amending the Connecticut constitution is no easy task. It requires supermajoritarian or successive majoritarian action by the General Assembly, accompanied by approval of a majority of the state's citizens. If the General Assembly does not propose constitutional amendments or call a constitutional convention for that purpose, the citizens have the opportunity to call such a convention and to propose amendments only once every twenty years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-308\">\n    I acknowledge that not all scholars and historians believe that Reverend Hooker's sermon was political in nature or that it inspired the Fundamental Orders of 1639. See M. Besso, \"Thomas Hooker and His May 1638 Sermon,\" 10 Early Am. Stud. 194, 197, 207 (2012). There have been many interpretations of Reverend Hooker's sermon. Some historians have suggested it pronounced and advocated new principles for government, which later appeared in the Fundamental Orders. See id., at 202-206. Others have argued that Reverend Hooker's ideas were not original but representative of local practices, and that the sermon's ultimate goal was to advocate for a form of civil government. See id., at 206-207. Still other historians suggest that Reverend Hooker's sermon was not politically motivated at all but espoused a religious message. See id., at 207. Whether Reverend Hooker's sermon was the catalyst for the Fundamental Orders, simply reflected popular understanding of government at the time, or was a religious message is unimportant for present purposes. What is important is that it embodied the spirit and beliefs of the time, and those beliefs embraced the principles of popular sovereignty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    In 1662, the Fundamental Orders were supplanted by the Charter of 1662 granted by King Charles II, although the structure of government was left largely unchanged. See H. Cohn, supra, 64 Conn. B.J. at 337-39. The Charter of 1662 remained in effect at least until the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, except for a short, eighteen month period in the 1680s when Connecticut was annexed as part of the Dominion of New England. See id., at 340-42; see also W. Horton, \"Connecticut Constitutional History: 1776-1988,\" 64 Conn. B.J. 355, 357 (1990).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-310\">\n    In 1776, Connecticut, along with the other colonies, declared its independence from England. W. Horton, \"Connecticut Constitutional History: 1776-1988,\" 64 Conn. B.J. 355, 357 (1990). Rather than abandoning the Charter of 1662 for a new constitution, however, the General Assembly simply removed any reference to the English monarch and declared that the government established by the Charter would remain the \"civil constitution of this state....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-311\">\n    In the years after declaring independence from England and leading up to the constitutional convention of 1818, whether Connecticut had a constitution became a contentious issue. See R. Purcell, Connecticut in Transition: 1775-1818 (1918) pp. 177-80, 243-46, 249-50, 259-61. The arguments that the state had no constitution sounded in theories of popular sovereignty. See id., at pp. 177-80, 243-46. For example, if the people were the fountain of power, which was the belief in Connecticut, the Charter of 1662, it was argued, could not be the state's constitution because it was adopted by the General Assembly, not the people. See id., at 177-80. John Leland stated in 1802: \"The people of Connecticut have never been asked, by those in authority, what form of government they would choose; nor in fact, whether they would have any form at all. For want of a specific constitution, the rulers run without bridle or bit, or anything to draw them up to the ring-bolt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at p. 245. Moreover, the General Assembly could amend or revoke any law it wanted, including those set forth in the Charter. Id., at pp. 255-56.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-312\">\n    Likewise, those who argued that there was a constitution in Connecticut also relied on popular sovereignty. Judge Zephaniah Swift wrote: \"Indeed no form of government could have been valid, unless approved, and adopted by the people in convention, or in some other way.\" 1 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1795) p. 57. In fact, Judge Swift acknowledged that once Connecticut ratified the Declaration of Independence, thereby severing its ties with England, the people had the right to establish a new form of government, if they had seen fit. Id. Nonetheless, Judge Swift believed that the Charter of 1662 continued as the constitution of Connecticut. See id., at pp. 56-57. He theorized that the real legitimacy of state government arose, not so much from the Charter, but from the people's assent to be governed as described by the Charter. See id., at pp. 57-58. Even if the Charter was the sole basis of the government's power, Judge Swift argued, it still remained valid. See id., at p. 58. Although the Charter, and the government it established, would have become invalid after Connecticut declared its independence from England, \"the subsequent conduct of the people, in assenting to, approving of, and acquiescing in the acts of the legislature,\" established the validity of the Charter's continuation. Id.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-313\">\n    Whether a constitution existed in Connecticut between 1776 and 1818 is unimportant for present purposes. What is important is that the debate on that issue illustrated the prominence of popular sovereignty in Connecticut in the years leading up to the 1818 constitutional convention. Moreover, this debate was the impetus, at least in part, for that convention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-314\">\n    Examples of what I view as this court's overreach abound.

See footnote 8 of Justice Robinson's concurring opinion. As a \"cautionary tale,\" he refers to a recent decision of the Kansas Supreme Court, namely,\n    <em>\n     State v.

In that case, which was released April 22, 2016, the Kansas Supreme Court overruled three of its \"prior\" decisions, all also released April 22, 2016.\n    <em>\n     State v.

Arguments in the three prior decisions had been heard approximately one year before argument in\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard,\n    </em>\n    by a panel that contained a trial judge who was sitting by designation of the Chief Justice while a vacant seat on the court was filled. That seat was filled, and the new panel heard\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard,\n    </em>\n    reaching, as Justice Robinson notes, the opposite conclusion. Justice Robinson then notes that \"the rapid overruling was ... widely noticed, and primarily attributed to the change in personnel of the Kansas Supreme Court.\" Footnote 9 of Justice Robinson's concurring opinion. Justice Robinson does not refer to any evidence, however, that the public is outraged or has lost confidence in the court due to this overruling. Instead, he refers to a few legal scholars who observe the panel change and concurrent change in the court's position. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"719\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201612851\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    The brunt of the consternation noted by the scholars and the dissenting justices in\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard,\n    </em>\n    however, seems to be over the court's decision to delay the release of the three overruled cases for approximately eight months in order to draft the opinion in\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard,\n    </em>\n    which overruled those cases, thereby delaying the relief afforded the individual defendants and depriving similarly situated individuals of the benefit of the holding of the three overruled cases. In fact, the dissenting justices in\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard\n    </em>\n    do not even allude to stare decisis or the dangers of overruling a recent decision when the only change is in the composition of the panel. Thus, I respectfully disagree that\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard\n    </em>\n    illustrates why this court should refrain from overruling\n    <em>\n     Santiago.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    Finally, in response to a concern that Justice Palmer raises in his concurring opinion, I would like to note that\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard\n    </em>\n    provides an example of a court of last resort quickly reversing its own constitutional ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    Professor Thomas R. Lee, in discussing factors that might explain the United States Supreme Court's tendency to overrule prior decisions, stated: \"One statistical study has suggested, for example, that the [c]ourts that have disproportionately altered precedent have been characterized by significant changes in membership.... A familiar example is the Hughes Court, which overturned [fifteen] precedents during its last nine years after the [c]ourt's entire membership was transformed between 1937 and 1941.... Similarly, most of the Warren Court's decisions overruling precedent were handed down after Justice [Felix] Frankfurter's retirement in 1962, while most of the Burger Court's overruling decisions came after [Justice] Douglas' retirement in 1975.\" (Citations omitted.) T. Lee, supra, 52 Vand. L.Rev. at 650 n. 14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    There is a great irony in Chief Justice Rogers' reasoning that gives me pause. While she is occupied with explaining that she, Justice Espinosa, and I have already espoused, \"at great length,\" why we think\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is incorrect; footnote 2 of Chief Justice Rogers' concurring opinion; noting that Justices Palmer, Eveleigh, and McDonald continue to believe that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    was correctly decided, and speculating about how Justice Norcott would rule, she overlooks the elephant in the room: What does Justice Robinson,\n    <em>\n     a current member of this court sitting on this case,\n    </em>\n    think?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    Of course, this is not the only problem that stems from Chief Justice Rogers' reasoning, although it is the most important. She correctly notes the obvious, namely, that stare decisis does not require this court to stand by a manifestly incorrect decision that has not been relied on. See id. She then states: \"In\n    <em>\n     Santiago,\n    </em>\n    however, [she], Justice Espinosa and I explained at great length why we believed that the majority decision was incorrect ... and we were unable to persuade the majority.\" (Citations omitted.) Id. Isn't this a curious notion? Apparently, when determining whether a previous decision of this court was manifestly incorrect, we consider whether the dissenting justices in the prior case successfully persuaded the majority justices that they, the majority, had reached a manifestly incorrect decision. If the dissenting justices had prevailed in the prior decision, would the outcome not have been different? Obviously, it would have been, so Chief Justice Rogers must mean something else. Perhaps, what she is trying to suggest is that she, Justice Espinosa, and I must now come up with a\n    <em>\n     new\n    </em>\n    reason that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is incorrect. Why, if\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    was incorrect when decided for the reasons that we then stated, would it not still be incorrect for the same reasons today? After all, as Chief Justice Rogers has observed, it has been less than one year since we decided\n    <em>\n     Santiago.\n    </em>\n    Moreover, I am again back to that vexing question, what does Justice Robinson think? That seems like a particularly important question under the current circumstances when three of the current members of the court think\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is correct and three others have explained why it is demonstrably wrong. If Justice Robinson could offer a different explanation for why\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is erroneous, would that get us past Chief Justice Rogers' unique test?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    Finally, Chief Justice Rogers notes that those justices who were in the majority in\n    <em>\n     Santiago,\n    </em>\n    and join in the per curiam opinion in the present case, continue to believe that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is correct, almost as to suggest that, if only one of them had changed his mind, perhaps we would then be permitted to overrule\n    <em>\n     Santiago.\n    </em>\n    Again, she leaves the reader to create his or her own explanation. Unfortunately, I can be of no help. I cannot think of any constitutional, statutory, or common-law rule that bestows greater authority on a justice who was in the majority of a prior decision when that decision is being reconsidered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    During Chief Justice Rogers' tenure on this court, we have overruled prior precedent in twenty-five cases.

I do note, however, that it is hardly surprising that the majority has decided to issue its opinion as a terse and dismissive per curiam, suggesting that the state's arguments in favor of overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   do not merit serious consideration. This is particularly troubling considering the importance of the issue presented in this appeal. It is this court's duty to give full consideration to the claims of the parties who come before it. In many cases less significant than the present one, the court as a matter of courtesy and respect answers all the claims raised by the parties, even when the court may believe that such claims lack merit. Dismissing the state's arguments in the present case in a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   opinion creates the appearance that the outcome was predisposed, and that oral argument was allowed merely to avoid the perception that the state was being treated unfairly. Indeed, Mark Rademacher, the assistant public defender who argued this appeal, stated that the purpose of granting the state's motion for oral argument was \" '[to make] the state feel good about losing.' \" J. Charlton, \"Connecticut High Court Revisits Death Penalty,\" Fox 61, January 7, 2016, available at http://fox61.com/2016/01/07/Connecticut-high-court-to-revisit-death-penalty/ (last visited May 16, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   I write to address the concurring opinion of the Chief Justice who frames the issue presented in this appeal in this manner: May the court overrule a recently established precedent solely because there has been a panel change since the now challenged decision? Taking that as her starting point, the Chief Justice voices the concern that overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would call into question the integrity of this court because doing so: (1) would create the appearance that the court is governed by the whims of individual justices rather than the rule of law; (2) would create the public perception that the result\n   of a case depends on the composition of the panel; and (3) would undermine the stability and predictability of the law, on which litigants rely. The short answer to those concerns is that they are unjustified and irrelevant when the prior precedent at issue is clearly wrong. As I explain in this dissenting opinion, this is particularly true when the clearly wrong, recently decided case has violated the doctrine of stare decisis-under those circumstances, that doctrine\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   that the prior precedent be overruled.\n   <em>\n    Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"801\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p234\">\n    515 U.S. 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"802\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p234\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"803\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p234\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). The position of the Chief Justice in the present case, therefore, is irreconcilable with her position in her dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   that the decision was clearly wrong. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"804\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%201\">\n    318 Conn. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"805\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This court's appearance as an impartial decision-making body, governed by the rule of law rather than the proclivities of individual panel members, is vital. No one disputes that, nor does anyone question the integral role that stability and predictability play in our legal system. But the protestations of the Chief Justice are predicated on a straw man that employs post hoc reasoning and finds no support in our stare decisis jurisprudence. In this dissent, I consider these two flaws in the analysis of the Chief Justice, and\n   thereby illustrate the central flaw in her opinion-it overlooks the overarching stare decisis principle of which even playwrights are aware-a clearly wrong decision is dangerous, because it will be relied on as precedent. As this court frequently has noted, \"[i]t is more important that the court should be\n   right upon later and more elaborate consideration of the cases than consistent with previous declarations.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Conway v.

By formulating the issue in that manner, she erects a straw man. Obviously, if this court were to overrule a decision merely\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   the panel had changed, the court would do damage to the rule\n   of law. That causal connection exists, however, only in the opinion of the Chief Justice, who certainly finds herself more than capable of knocking down the proposition she has put forward. But the mere fact that a decision overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would have occurred after the panel changed does not necessitate the conclusion that the panel change would have\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   the court to overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   and is nothing more than a logical fallacy, an example of \"post hoc, ergo propter hoc\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   On another level, what the Chief Justice appears to suggest is that, because the panel in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would have been unwilling to overrule that decision, the current panel is prevented from doing so. She even goes so far as to tally the unchanged votes of the remaining three members of the majority panel from\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   that are on the panel for this appeal, counting that as support for her decision to accord stare decisis effect to\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   She appears to suggest, therefore, that if one of the members of the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   had come\n   to the realization that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was clearly wrong, a majority of the panel in the present case would be justified in overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago.\n   </em>\n   First, if that notion does not create the appearance that the personally held beliefs of individual justices govern the outcome of the present appeal, I do not know what would. Second, the Chief Justice does not give her own vote, or the votes of the other two original dissenting justices, sufficient weight. By my tally, those votes also totaled three.

The exception to the doctrine of stare decisis for decisions that are \"clearly wrong\" is perhaps the oldest and most well established, dating back to William Blackstone, who explained: \"[I]t is an established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points come again in litigation.... Yet this rule admits of exception, where the former determination is\n   <em>\n    most evidently contrary to reason;\n   </em>\n   much more if it be contrary to the divine law.... The doctrine of the law then is this: that precedents and rules must be followed,\n   <em>\n    unless flatly absurd\n   </em>\n   or unjust: for though their reason be not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a deference to former times as not to suppose they acted wholly without consideration.\" (Emphasis added.) 1 W.

As explained by D. Arthur Kelsey, now a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, when \"a court overrules a more recent case that, itself, violated stare decisis and thus represented a divergence from settled precedent ... the court\n   does not flout stare decisis by overruling the anomalous case.

She explained: \"[B]ecause there is no legitimate legal basis for finding the death penalty unconstitutional under either the federal or the state constitution, I can only conclude that the majority has improperly decided that the death penalty must be\n   struck down because it offends the majority's subjective sense of morality.\" Id., at 276-77,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"860\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was a classic example of a court giving no effect or even consideration to the principle of stare decisis, and represented a drastic departure from our death penalty jurisprudence. Inevitably, such decisions are, as the Chief Justice expressed eloquently, \"based on a house of cards, falling under the slightest breath of scrutiny.\" Id., at 233,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"861\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201\">\n    122 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, such decisions inevitably are clearly wrong and destroy the fabric of the law. Stare decisis requires that such decisions be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   In the present case, accordingly, the question is not whether the court should overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago because of\n   </em>\n   a panel change. The question that the Chief Justice should be asking is whether stare decisis principles support the conclusion that a panel change\n   <em>\n    prevents\n   </em>\n   this court from being able to overrule a clearly wrong, recently decided case that constitutes an abrupt departure from well established precedent. And the clear answer to that question is no; stare decisis requires that the fabric of the law be restored by overruling the anomalous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Chief Justice cannot point to a single case to support the proposition that a panel change prevents\n   the court from overruling clearly wrong precedent, because none exists.

The Chief Justice's stated concern in her concurring opinion in this case, that overruling\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would raise questions \"about the court's integrity and the rule of law in the state of Connecticut,\" cannot be reconciled with the number of times this court has overturned its prior decisions without even considering whether doing so would be consistent with the doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   These recent decisions also call into question the assertion of the Chief Justice that stare decisis must be adhered to in the present case because \"neither the factual underpinnings of the prior decision nor the law has changed....\" She contends that one of these changes is necessary before a court may overrule a decision. Presumably, because she recognizes no exception for clearly wrong decisions despite its well\n   established roots in our law, and because she obviously believes that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was clearly wrong; see\n   <em>\n    State v.

The justification provided by the court in\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   for overruling\n   <em>\n    Mendillo,\n   </em>\n   which had been decided by an en banc panel before the court adopted that practice for all cases, is illuminating: \"Upon reconsideration of the relevant considerations, including the five factors that this court found determinative in\n   <em>\n    Mendillo,\n   </em>\n   we now agree with the concurring and dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mendillo\n   </em>\n   that the public policy factors favoring recognition of a cause of action for loss of parental consortium outweigh those factors disfavoring recognition.\"\n   <em>\n    Campos v.

In other words, the panel in\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   simply disagreed with the conclusion arrived at by the panel in\n   <em>\n    Mendillo,\n   </em>\n   so\n   <em>\n    Mendillo\n   </em>\n   was overruled. Nothing in the factual underpinnings or the law had changed in the more than seventeen years since\n   <em>\n    Mendillo\n   </em>\n   was decided. The court in\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   relied on many of the identical authorities on which the court in\n   <em>\n    Mendillo\n   </em>\n   had relied, but the court in\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   arrived at a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   One would expect, considering the Chief Justice's claim that the court is bound by the doctrine of stare decisis in the present case, that she would have expressed similar concerns regarding the risk that the court might appear to be deciding cases on the basis of the personal moral beliefs of individual justices, and that\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   would include an extensive and considered discussion of why stare decisis should not apply to\n   <em>\n    Mendillo.\n   </em>\n   Not so. Not only did\n   <em>\n    Campos\n   </em>\n   restrict its passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis to a brief footnote, but it also misstated one of the basic principles underlying the doctrine.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1023\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 57 n. 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1024\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20854\">\n    123 A.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, as I have explained in this dissenting opinion, the exception to the doctrine of stare decisis for clearly wrong decisions is well established. That exception, however, is quite narrow, and does not apply to a decision when a current panel concludes merely that, although the original decision was \"wrong,\" reasonable jurists could disagree. We have therefore limited the application of the \"clearly wrong\" exception to stare decisis to those instances when overruling prior precedent is compelled by \"the\n   <em>\n    most cogent\n   </em>\n   reasons and\n   <em>\n    inescapable\n   </em>\n   logic....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Conway v.

This is particularly noteworthy for several reasons. First, as I have observed, the dissent expressly pointed out the fact that\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   was released at a whiplash-inducing speed after\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I,\n   </em>\n   which was controlling precedent as to the appropriate remedy for less than two months before the court changed its mind.

The opposite conclusion, the majority explained, was compelled by the most \"inescapable logic....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1045\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This basis, that\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I\n   </em>\n   was not merely wrong, but indisputably so, is the very same basis that the Chief Justice now asserts is somehow insufficient to overrule\n   <em>\n    Santiago,\n   </em>\n   despite her very public and very obvious belief that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   is clearly wrong. Lastly, I observe that because so little time passed between the publication of\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   absolutely nothing had changed between the two decisions. This is particularly ironic, given the Chief Justice's insistence in the present case that in order for this court to overrule prior precedent, there must have been some subsequent change in the facts or the law, and\n   that the conclusion that a decision was clearly wrong, on its own, is insufficient to justify a departure from stare decisis. One wonders what the Chief Justice might have responded in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   had the dissent pointed out, quite accurately, that \"the only change that has occurred [since\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I\n   </em>\n   was decided] is a change in the makeup of this court....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Do not misunderstand me to suggest that\n   <em>\n    State v. DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   supra, 288 Conn. at 418,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1046\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%2045\">\n    953 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was wrongly decided. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   is perfectly consistent with\n   the doctrine of stare decisis, because\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I,\n   </em>\n   supra, 287 Conn. at 608,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1047\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201156\">\n    949 A.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had ignored prior precedent. The panel in\n   <em>\n    DeJesus,\n   </em>\n   therefore, was required by the doctrine of stare decisis to overrule the portion of\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I\n   </em>\n   that contravened well established precedent, regardless of how recently\n   <em>\n    Sanseverino I\n   </em>\n   had been decided, and regardless of whether there was a panel change.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   repaired the fabric of the law. And\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   did so as quickly as possible, before the errant decision could do damage. That is precisely what we are asked to do in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The position of the Chief Justice, that when there has been a panel change, stare decisis precludes the court from overturning a recent, clearly wrong decision that flouted established precedent, conflicts with a fundamental principle underlying the doctrine of stare decisis, namely, that the doctrine, although grounded in stability and consistency,\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be rigid. Otherwise, consistency and stability would require the court to follow precedent regardless of how wrong it may be. See\n   <em>\n    Conway v. Wilton,\n   </em>\n   supra, 238 Conn. at 660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1048\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20242\">\n    680 A.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Stare decisis is not an inexorable command.... [A]lthough [s]tare decisis is a doctrine developed by courts to accomplish the requisite element of stability in court-made law, [it] is not an absolute impediment to change.... [S]tability should not be confused with perpetuity. If law is to have a current relevance, courts must have and exert the capacity to change a rule of law when reason so requires.\" [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ). As this court has stated on many occasions, it is more important to be right than to be consistent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1049\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20242\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   The two \"rules\" that the Chief Justice focuses on in her concurring opinion in the present case are: (1) this court cannot overrule a decision following a panel change; and (2) this court cannot overrule a recently decided case. As to the first supposed rule, she points\n   to no instance in which this court overruled prior precedent, where there had not been an\n   <em>\n    intervening panel change.\n   </em>\n   She also fails to cite to a single decision by this court declining to overrule a prior precedent on the basis that it was too recently decided. Assuming, however, for purposes of discussion, that these two rules bar the court from overruling prior precedent, her rigid application of these principles, if carried out in the manner that they suggest is appropriate, would guarantee that a clearly wrong decision would stand uncorrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   An excellent illustration of this principle is this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tileston v.

Because the women at issue in the appeal were all married, any child born as a result of a so-called \"illegitimate pregnancy\" would not actually be \"illegitimate\"; putative father laws would prevent that. The purpose of the statutes, accordingly, was to protect the \"virility\" of husbands by preventing them from being made into cuckolds!

If a slightly different panel than the one in the present case had decided yesterday that physicians could be prosecuted for providing contraception to female patients, I have no doubt that the Chief Justice would voice no concerns that the rule of law or integrity of this court would be imperiled by overruling that clearly wrong decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Of course, the best evidence that the Chief Justice improperly relies on the doctrine of stare decisis to justify her conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   should not be overruled is\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   itself. That is, the overwhelming irony is that the Chief Justice relies on the doctrine of stare decisis in declining to overrule a decision that she herself recognized tramped merrily over this court's entire\n   body of death penalty jurisprudence, in complete disregard of that doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   rewrote\n   history, contorted both this court's legal precedent and the legislative history of No. 12-5 of the 2012 Public Acts (P.A. 12-5), and blatantly substituted its own moral judgment for that of the people of this state. Good jurisprudence, not the present doctrinal disposition of a slightly different panel, would justify overruling such an abuse of judicial power. As the Chief Justice notes in her concurring opinion, the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   \"raise[d] legitimate concerns by the people we serve about the court's integrity and the rule of law in the state of Connecticut.\" We now have the opportunity to restore the faith of the people of this state in this court's respect for the rule of law. The doctrine of stare decisis requires that we take that opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Overturning\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   would not require justices to decide the present case according to their personal moral beliefs. The Chief Justice explained in her dissenting\n   opinion in that case that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   was decided and governed by \"the majority's subjective sense of morality\";\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even a jurist who is deeply, morally opposed to capital punishment, however, has a duty to follow the law. I agree with the Chief Justice that the majority in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ignored that duty, and resolved the appeal on the basis of their personal, moral opposition to the death penalty.

Overruling that decision now, not after the decision has been \"on the books\" long enough to be relied on as precedent, is the best way to adhere to the principle of stare decisis and repair the damage that has been done to the rule of law. The United States Supreme Court has made clear that when a court is called upon to overrule a recent decision that has violated stare decisis, the doctrine of stare decisis requires that the prior decision be overruled. See\n   <em>\n    Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

By focusing on the panel change, rather than the damage that\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   inflicted on the rule of law, the Chief Justice loses sight of what needs to be done in the present case-the fabric of the law must be repaired.

Justice Norcott then continued to participate in deliberations as a member of that panel, including consideration of the state's subsequent motions for reconsideration and to stay, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 51-198(c). Justice Norcott's vote to join the slender majority in\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    ended a career on this court in which he had been a leading voice against the constitutionality of the death penalty.

Justice Zarella's test does not, however, accommodate for degrees of wrong, insofar as he observes that, \"[i]n addition to placing too little value on precedent, the wrongness of a previous decision should not factor into the stare decisis calculus because it is difficult to quantify or measure the degree of a particular decision's wrongness,\" noting that \"the merits determination is independent of, and has no impact on, the stare decisis analysis.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-276\">\n    I respectfully disagree with Justice Zarella's refusal to consider the relative degree of \"wrong\" in engaging in his stare decisis analysis. First, with no qualitative control other than the balancing of costs of maintaining versus eliminating a prior decision, it appears to be receptive to overruling precedent in a way that undercuts the salutary features with respect to promoting stability in the law. Second, this approach ironically appears to overrule certain well established principles of stare decisis, namely that: (1) the prior decision must be shown to be \"\n    <em>\n     clearly wrong\n    </em>\n    \" with a \"clear showing that an established rule is incorrect and harmful\"; (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)\n    <em>\n     Conway v.

Burton, \"The Conflict Between Stare Decisis and Overruling in Constitutional Adjudication,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Cardozo%20L.%20Rev.%201687\">\n     35 Cardozo L.Rev. 1687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1703-1704 (2014) (describing threshold factors to examine before deciding merits of whether to overrule precedent, including: \"[1] notice and predictability; [2] legal developments that make the precedent anomalous; [3] the precedent's workability; [4] reliance on the precedent; [5] the quality of the precedent court's reasoning; and [6] changes in factual circumstances that erode the precedent's justification\" [footnotes omitted] ). Without the benefit of the lessons learned from watching a precedent's value evolve over time, I would require a far greater showing of error-near akin to that required to justify reconsideration of a decision under Practice Book \u00a7 71-5-to justify the overruling of a decision of extremely recent vintage, wherein nothing has changed other than the parties and the composition of the court. In my view, such an overruling would be appropriate only if the original decision evinced a complete misunderstanding of the governing legal principles, particularly if compounded by lack of meaningful adversarial input from the parties to the earlier case.

One scholarly commentator, Professor David Post, described the Kansas Supreme Court's action in\n    <em>\n     Petersen-Beard,\n    </em>\n    which required \"all other ... sex offenders in the state with convictions before 2011\" to register, while sparing the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Doe, Redmond,\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Buser,\n    </em>\n    as \"seem [ing] to violate the very fundamental notion, embedded in our idea of 'due process of law,' that like cases are to be treated alike-someone in precisely the same situation ... will have to register ... while [the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Doe, Redmond,\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Buser\n    </em>\n    ] will not.\" D.

This indicates to me that overruling\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    would present the risk of shaking our citizens' confidence in our court as an institution, betraying it as a collection of individuals who make seemingly arbitrary decisions. As I stated previously, the majority's analysis in\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    is not so unreasonable or fundamentally flawed as to justify taking that risk in the public's confidence in this court, and the judiciary as a whole.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-286\">\n    Thus, I find wholly unpersuasive the state's arguments that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    \"is no obstacle to this court issuing a correct legal decision on the question of whether capital punishment violates the state constitution,\" and that \"the only result in [this case] that could undermine the public faith in the integrity of this court ... would be an affirmance of\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    ... based on the principle of stare decisis. If [this] court believes that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    ... properly decided that capital punishment violates the Connecticut constitution, then it should so hold. But if a majority of this court believes that\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    ... is incorrect, justifying affirmation of that breach through a statement that the court believes it tied its own hands would have a deleterious effect ... on the public's perception of the procedural fairness of the criminal justice system and diminish public confidence in the rule of law.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In my view, any concerns in the public's confidence about this court's technical fidelity to the adversarial appellate decision-making process in\n    <em>\n     Santiago\n    </em>\n    -a matter on which the majority and dissent in that case disagreed energetically-are drastically outweighed by the public perception of arbitrariness that would result from the defendant in that case, Eduardo Santiago, getting to live, and the defendant in the present case facing the prospect of lethal injection, for no reason beyond the fact that Santiago's case happened to come up first on this court's docket and was heard by a slightly different panel of this court.

The stakes in capital cases are high-life or death-and it is unlikely that any justice of this court will be unsure of the constitutional status of the ultimate punishment, whether he or she believes that it is constitutional or unconstitutional. It seems that the best decision-making policy in this arena, in which our holdings are of great constitutional, moral, and practical magnitude, is to allow each justice to reach an independent judgment regarding the death penalty's constitutionality, while giving little weight to stare decisis. In the present case, however, the concurring justices heavily weigh stare decisis and thereby prevent each justice from reaching an independent judgment regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-289\">\n    See also\n    <em>\n     State v.
