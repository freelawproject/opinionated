Following the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner requested certification to appeal, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"Faced with a habeas court's denial of a petition for certification to appeal [under \u00a7 52-470(g) ],\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Simms v.
