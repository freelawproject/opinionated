In reaching its conclusion, the Appellate Court noted that, although\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   established an indigent defendant's right to counsel for the purpose of determining whether a sound basis exists for a motion to correct, it did not address the requirements of \"sound basis\" review, in particular, what steps appointed counsel must take in advising a defendant and the trial court of his or her determination that no sound basis exists for the filing of the motion to correct, and the steps the trial court must take to validate that determination.

[The Appellate Court reasoned that] Lorenzen's failure to\n   explain his findings to either the defendant or the court beyond a mere conclusory statement, as well as the court's failure to perform its own independent, second tier of review of the record in light of controlling legal authorities to make its own determination as to whether the defendant's claims were wholly frivolous, violated the minimum requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   ... and the defendant's right to appointed counsel [in connection with] his motion under \u00a7 51-296(a).\" Id., at 590,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20A.3d%201059\">\n    86 A.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the state challenges the conclusion of the Appellate Court that a motion to correct an illegal sentence is sufficiently similar to a direct appeal that the same procedures must govern the appointment of counsel in both contexts.

According to the state, the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   procedure is not necessary to safeguard the statutory right to counsel in the limited context of a motion to correct and will serve only to complicate and delay the resolution of a motion that was intended to be an expeditious mechanism for correcting an illegal sentence. Finally, the state claims that any deficiency in the process surrounding the trial court's denial of the defendant's request for counsel was harmless because the defendant's motion to correct was subsequently denied by that court on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although we agree with the state that the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   procedure is not needed to safeguard the statutory right to counsel in the context of a motion to correct an illegal sentence, our review of the record reveals that the trial court did not appoint counsel to represent the defendant even for the limited purpose of determining whether a sound basis existed for him to file his motion. We further conclude that this error was harmful to the defendant, and, consequently, the case must be remanded to the trial court so that counsel may be appointed to represent the defendant as required by\n   <em>\n    Casiano.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our analysis of this issue is guided by several well established principles. First, it is axiomatic that \"[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner....\" Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. A motion to correct an illegal sentence \"constitutes a narrow exception to the general rule that, once a defendant's sentence has begun, the authority of the sentencing court to modify that sentence terminates.... Indeed, [i]n order for the court to have jurisdiction over a motion to correct an illegal sentence after the sentence has been executed, the sentencing proceeding [itself] ... must be the subject of the attack.... Therefore, the motion is directed to the sentencing court, which can entertain and resolve\n   the challenge most expediently.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

It goes without saying that\n   direct appeals are an essential and critical stage of a criminal proceeding, intended to ensure that any errors committed at trial did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Gaines v.

Claims that may be brought on direct appeal involve every aspect\n   of the underlying proceeding, from arraignment to sentencing and virtually everything in between. To effectively prepare for such an appeal, therefore, appellate counsel must engage in an in-depth review of the entire record and applicable law, screening for all possible errors-including sentencing errors-that may have prejudiced the defendant and compromised his right to a fair trial.
