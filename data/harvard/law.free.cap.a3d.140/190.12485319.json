More specifically, we must decide whether a volunteer must satisfy the predominant\n   \"remuneration test\" used to resolve similar federal causes of action or Connecticut's common-law \"right to control\" test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This certified appeal arises out of a complaint filed with the plaintiff, the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, by Brenda Puryear (Brenda), on behalf of her then minor daughter Sarah Puryear (Sarah).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged that the defendants, Echo Hose Ambulance and the city of Shelton, had discriminated and retaliated against Sarah on the basis of her race and color in violation of CFEPA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (Title VII). The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the commission's administrative appeal from the decision of the commission's human rights referee, who had struck the complaint on the ground that Sarah was not an employee under the remuneration test. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's judgment;\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities v. Echo Hose Ambulance,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20239\">\n    156 Conn.App. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20463\">\n    113 A.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; and Sarah appealed to this court. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, as alleged in the complaint, and procedural history. Echo Hose provides ambulance transport and other services to the city. Sarah, who is African-American, was accepted into a \"precepting program\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Echo Hose, which\n   required her to ride in an ambulance for one shift each week and to participate in other activities. While taking part in that program, and after completing it, Sarah \"was treated differently due to her race and color and ... was subject to discipline that other individuals ... were not.\" Specifically, Sarah was subjected to comments about Africa and the \" 'ghetto,' \" was suspended without good cause, and was terminated without good cause. Although Sarah's termination\n   was later overruled, such that she was able to complete the precepting program, members of Echo Hose voted against making Sarah a member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brenda thereafter filed a complaint with the commission alleging violations of CFEPA and Title VII. The complaint did not allege that Sarah had been paid or had received other benefits in conjunction with her activities with Echo Hose. The city moved to strike the complaint, claiming that Sarah was not an \"employee,\" a factual predicate to an action under either CFEPA or Title VII, because she could not satisfy the remuneration test that determines such a status. Brenda objected to the motion, claiming that the proper test for determining who is an employee under CFEPA is the \"right to control test,\" which Sarah satisfied. The referee determined that the remuneration test applied to both Title VII and CFEPA and that Sarah could not satisfy that test. The referee therefore struck the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the referee declined to rule on motions for reconsideration filed by the commission and Sarah regarding Sarah's claim under CFEPA, the commission brought this administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 and 46a-94a. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The trial court concluded that the referee properly had applied the remuneration test and dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sarah then appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities v.

The bill subsequently enacted as P.A. 15-56 was introduced prior to the Appellate Court's decision in the present\n   case but was not enacted until shortly after that decision was issued. The legislature, through P.A. 15-56, amended CFEPA to include interns as a separate class of persons to whom the protections of CFEPA applied. General Statutes (Supp.2016) \u00a7 46a-51 (8). An \" '[i]ntern' \" is defined in part as \"an individual who ... is not entitled to wages for the work performed;\" General Statutes (Supp.2016) \u00a7 31-40y (a)(3)(B) ; in contrast to an \" '[e]mployee,' \" which is defined as \"any individual engaged in service to an employer in a business of such employer and receives compensation\n   for such service....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes (Supp.2016) \u00a7 31-40y (a)(1). In testimony before the Labor and Public Employees Committee prior to the Appellate Court's decision in this case, Senator Martin M. Looney, one of the sponsors of the bill enacted as P.A. 15-56, explained to his colleagues that the need for the bill stemmed from the fact that \"Connecticut does not currently protect interns from harassment, discrimination, or retaliation in our statutes because they are not considered to be employees under our state law.\" Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 2015 Sess., p. 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Public Act 15-56 and its legislative history yield the following considerations. First, the legislature did not hold the view that the right to control test applied to CFEPA because, if that test had applied, interns would not have been categorically excluded from CFEPA. Second, adopting the right to control test for CFEPA would create tension between CFEPA and P.A. 15-56, the latter plainly turning on the question of compensation and other factors not directly related to the right to control. Creating such tension would be inconsistent with the principle that we read \"the legislative scheme as a whole in order to give effect to and harmonize all of [its] parts.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

Because neither case directly addressed or analyzed the question of who is an employee under CFEPA, we read them as simply assuming, without deciding, that volunteers\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   protected under CFEPA, a proposition that we do not dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sarah's contention that, by enacting P.A. 15-56, the legislature clarified the law to protect individuals in her position, is unsupported by its plain language. Public Act 15-56 expands protections for one narrowly defined class of persons-unpaid interns-to which Sarah does not belong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sarah's argument that applying the remuneration test would lead to unfair results, contrary to the public policy of protecting workers from discrimination, is similarly unpersuasive.

For all the reasons previously discussed, we are persuaded that the application of the remuneration test would be its intention. Moreover, the legislature's use of the term \"employee\" instead of a more general term; cf. General Statutes \u00a7 53-450(b) (\"[a]ny person ... shall have a right of action against any person\"); is itself an expression of public policy to impose some limit on the scope of CFEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Thibodeau v.
