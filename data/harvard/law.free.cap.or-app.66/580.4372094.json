In granting the permit, the Board interpreted one of its zoning ordinances, which it considered ambiguous, favorably to Jones. In CA No. A25438 (LUBA No. 82-011), LUBA dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal as moot, because the Board had granted petitioner\u2019s request for a rehearing after the LUBA appeal had been filed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On rehearing, the Board affirmed its original decision to grant the building permit, and the second appeal, LUBA No. 82-043, followed. LUBA concluded that the ordinance was sufficiently ambiguous that it should defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own ordinance. LUBA\u2019s deference was proper. We also defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own zoning ordinance, <em>Cascade Broadcasting Corp. v.
