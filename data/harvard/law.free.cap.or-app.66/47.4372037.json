Plaintiffs appeal from judgments on jury verdicts for defendant. They contend that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the emergency doctrine when no evidence existed to support the giving of the instruction and in failing to reinstruct the jury omitting the emergency instruction after it was withdrawn by defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Although they make two assignments of error, plaintiffs\u2019 primary contention is that the trial court erred in failing to reinstruct the jury after it had given an instruction that defendant\u2019s attorney and the trial court agreed was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Plaintiffs correctly assert that they timely excepted to the trial court\u2019s instruction. <em>See </em>ORCP 59H. Defendant\u2019s attorney stated that the instruction had been included inadvertently in his requested instructions. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cMR. VELURE [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: We would respectfully except to the Court\u2019s giving the right-of-way instruction for the reasons we have previously stated. We feel it\u2019s abstract and the evidence does not support the submission of that specification of contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cLikewise, we would respectfully except to the Court\u2019s submission and instructing on. the other specification of contributory negligence in the John Oliver case, and these last two exceptions are only in the John Oliver case. The emergency-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, I understand. They apply to both cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">\u201cMR. VELURE: On the ground that we feel it\u2019s abstract and the evidence does not support it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Fine, you may have those exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE [defendant\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, the only exception I would have would be I don\u2019t recall the Court advising the jury that the same nine have to answer each of the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-14\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s \u2014 if that\u2019s a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: That has its problems, all right, but \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: And I would request we poll the jury when they \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, I will certainly do that, and I think probably it\u2019s proper \u2014 that same nine thing bothers me in some instances but I think it\u2019s proper that they be instructed, in that respect, and I will bring them back in and do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: And I would withdraw the requested instruction of emergency if the Court wanted to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I have rung a bell on it. I will tell them to disregard it but I think I would just ring the bell a second time if I do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: It was an oversight. I know we ended up requesting that and it was a mistake from my point of view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I have the feeling it\u2019s not going to have any effect upon the verdict but \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201cMR. VELURE: I have no objections, Your Honor, if you just wanted to go into the jury room with the reporter and tell them the same nine have to agree \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: I wouldn\u2019t object to that. I think it might be more expeditious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">\u201cMR. VELURE: I don\u2019t even think we need a record on it. As far as the parties are concerned I think we can stipulate the Court can just go into the jury room and tell them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will tell them that and \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-13\">\u201cMR. ORMSBEE: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, then that will take care of that problem. I won\u2019t mention the emergency one, though, however.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">The trial court proposed a procedure designed to cure any error, and plaintiffs acquiesced. They did not object to the proposed procedure, nor did they renew their request that the jury be reinstructed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-16\">\u201c* * * [Ajppellate courts require a litigant to make known his objection in the lower tribunal in order to urge the objection on appeal. The purpose of this rule is to allow the tribunal to correct any error and obviate the necessity of reversal and remand for additional proceedings.\u201d <em>Bentley v. </em>SAIF; 38 Or App 473, 479, 590 P2d 746 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>See also State v. Linthwaite, </em>295 Or 162, 175, 665 P2d 863 (1983) (parties restricted on appeal to claims presented to trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Plaintiffs voiced no objection to the judge\u2019s statement that he would not mention the emergency instruction to the jury in his reinstruction. They cannot now be heard to complain. <em>See Allan &amp; Leuthold, Inc. v. Terra Investment Co., </em>271 Or 335, 337-38, 532 P2d 218 (1975) (failure to object to court\u2019s procedure for disposing of claims constitutes waiver for purposes of appellate review.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
