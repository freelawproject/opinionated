J.</author>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Petitioner US Market #180, LLC,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks review of a final order of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) that suspended licensee\u2019s license to sell alcoholic beverages. Specifically, licensee challenges the OLCC\u2019s conclusion that, when one of licensee\u2019s employees sold beer to a minor without successfully verifying the minor\u2019s age using age-verification equipment, licensee violated OAR 845-005-0355(5) by failing to comply with a restriction on its license. Reviewing the order for legal error, ORS 183.482(8)(a), we agree with petitioner that the OLCC reached that conclusion under an erroneous understanding of the license restriction, and, accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We take the pertinent facts, which are undisputed, from the OLCC\u2019s final order and the record supporting the order. Licensee owns US Market #180 \u2014 a convenience store in Albany \u2014 and a number of other small markets for which licensee holds licenses to sell alcohol. As a result of numerous violations for selling alcoholic beverages to minors at some of those other stores, the OLCC placed the following restriction, among others, on the license for US Market #180:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\u201cLicensee has age verification equipment, as defined in OAR 845-009-0140(l)(b)[,] installed at all of its locations and will install age verification equipment at any new locations at the time of licensure. <em>Licensee will require that all individual employees or licensees use age verification equipment to verify </em>the age of any patron who reasonably appears under the age of 26 who attempts to purchase alcoholic beverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">(Emphasis added.) Roughly a month after the license restriction went into effect, the OLCC and the Albany Police Department conducted a minor decoy operation at US Market #180 to test whether Westling, the store clerk working at the time, would sell alcohol to deRueda, who was 19 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">After grabbing a six-pack of beer from a cooler, deRueda approached the counter to purchase it and gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Westling his driver\u2019s license. In accordance with the store\u2019s policies requiring that she check the age of anyone attempting to purchase alcohol who appeared to be less than 30 years old, Westling took the driver\u2019s license and used the age-verification machine to scan it. The screen of the machine displayed that deRueda was only 19 years old \u2014 information that Westling did not notice \u2014 and, for some reason, that an alcohol sale to deRueda was \u201capproved.\u201d Despite the indications from the machine and on deRueda\u2019s license that he was less than 21 years old, Westling, relying on the \u201capproved\u201d designation, sold him the beer. Shortly thereafter, an Albany Police Officer issued a citation to Westling for selling alcohol to a minor. Because Westling had used the age-verification machine and relied on the machine\u2019s erroneous \u201capproved\u201d designation, licensee decided to suspend rather than fire her, which, under licensee\u2019s policy, was the default consequence for her failure to verify deRueda\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">As a result of the incident, the OLCC proposed can-celling the license for US Market #180 based on licensee\u2019s violation of two agency rules: (1) a violation of OAR 845-005-0355(5) because licensee had not complied with the license restriction when Westling failed to verify deRueda\u2019s age with the age-verification equipment and (2) a violation of OAR 845-006-0335(1) because Westling had failed to verify deRueda\u2019s age \u2014 independently of the license restriction\u2014 before allowing him to buy the beer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The critical issue throughout the ensuing contested case proceeding and the determinative issue on judicial review is whether the license restriction, by its terms, imposes on licensee an obligation to require: (1) under licensee\u2019s proffered interpretation of the restriction, that licensee\u2019s employees use age-verification equipment during particular alcohol sales or (2) under the OLCC\u2019s proffered interpretation, that licensee\u2019s employees use age-verification equipment and, in doing so, successfully verify that the person attempting to purchase alcohol is old enough to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed in her proposed order with licensee\u2019s interpretation of the restriction and concluded that the OLCC had not met its burden of proving that licensee had not complied with it. Conversely, the OLCC agreed in its final order with the agency\u2019s interpretation of the restriction and concluded, in light of the conflicting results from the <em>scan </em>\u2014 viz., the \u201capproved\u201d designation and the indication that deRueda was 19 years old \u2014 and the fact that the discrepancy did not cause Westling to rerun the driver\u2019s license, that Westling had not verified deRueda\u2019s age, and, hence, licensee had not complied with the restriction and, thereby, violated OAR 845-005-0355(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Licensee seeks judicial review, reprising its argument that the restriction merely imposed an obligation on licensee to require that its employees use the age-verification equipment. In response, the OLCC maintains that it properly construed the restriction. As explained below, licensee has the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In ascertaining the purpose of the license restriction, and thereby determining the proper interpretation of it, a brief discussion of the pertinent OLCC administrative rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>regarding age verification for alcohol sales provides important context. The OLCC adopted OAR 845-006-0335(1) to create a generally applicable age-verification requirement for its licensees as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to prevent the sale of alcoholic beverages to people who are less than 21 years old. To accomplish that goal, the rule has three subsections that impose separate, but related, requirements. The first, OAR 845-006-0335(1)(a), reinforces a licensee\u2019s statutory age-verification obligation under ORS 471.130<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and explains that \u201creasonable doubt\u201d under that statute \u2014 which triggers the obligation to verify a person\u2019s age for an alcohol sale \u2014 \u201cexists if the person appears to be under the age of 26.\u201d Importantly, even though OAR 845-006-0335(1)(a) only addresses a licensee\u2019s obligation, a licensee may also violate the rule if the licensee\u2019s employee fails to verify a person\u2019s age when the obligation to do so is triggered, because, under OAR 845-006-0362,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> responsibility for the employee\u2019s failure may be imputed to the licensee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second subsection, OAR 845-006-0335(1)(b), addresses the procedure that must be followed to comply with subsection (a). Finally, the third subsection, OAR 845-006-0335(1)(c), encompasses a freestanding requirement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201c[\u00a1licensees <em>must require </em>all their employees who sell, serve, oversee or control the sale or service of alcoholic beverages <em>to verify </em>age as subsection (a) of this section requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>By its terms, particularly its concluding reference to subsection (a), the objective of subsection (c) is to create an additional layer of administrative regulation of licensees to supplement the general, independent age-verification requirement under subsection (a) by compelling licensees to clearly instruct their employees to comply with the age-verification requirement. Accordingly, if the OLCC were to bring an enforcement action against a licensee for a violation of subsection (c) and not subsection (a), then the agency would not need to prove that the licensee or its employee had failed to verify the age of a person attempting to purchase alcohol who appeared to be less than 26 years old. Rather, the OLCC would need to establish only that the licensee had failed to require its employees to comply with subsection (a) before completing an alcohol sale, regardless of whether the employees did, in fact, comply with subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">If a licensee violates OAR 845-006-0335(1), then the OLCC has authority under OAR 845-005-0355(l)(b) to impose a specific restriction on the licensee\u2019s license in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the conduct that led to the violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Importantly, OAR 845-005-0355 does not expressly limit the OLCC\u2019s discretion as to the content of the restriction; in other words, the OLCC enjoys wide latitude in deciding what restriction to place on the license and how to phrase the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the wording of the license restriction chosen by the OLCC in this case. Again, the pertinent part of the restriction, which was imposed as a result of earlier violations of the general age-verification requirement in OAR 845-006-0335(1) at licensee\u2019s other stores, states: \u201cLicensee <em>will require </em>that all individual employees or licensees <em>use </em>age verification equipment to verify the age of any patron who reasonably appears under the age of 26 who attempts to purchase alcoholic beverages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The purpose of the restriction, in light of the previous violations that spawned it, is to create an additional layer of administrative regulation to supplement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the general age-verification requirement, which continues to operate independently of the restriction, by compelling licensee to ensure that its employees use age-verification equipment. To accomplish that objective, the OLCC chose the emphasized phrasing, which is akin to the phrasing used to create the supplemental requirement in OAR 845-006-0335(l)(c). Similarly to that rule, the restriction <em>specifically refers </em>to <em>licensee\u2019s </em>obligation <em>vis-a-vis </em>its <em>employees </em>\u2014 viz., that licensee ensure that the employees use age-verification equipment \u2014 and both the rule and the restriction conclude with references to the requirement that they supplement, <em>viz., </em>the general age-verification requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Moreover, the OLCC\u2019s decision to choose a license restriction involving age-verification equipment as a means to prevent future violations of OAR 845-006-0335(l)(a) by licensee is not a surprising one. OAR 845-009-0140 (2008)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201c(2) For the first or second violation of [OAR] 845-006-0335(1) in a two-year period, the licensee may choose to purchase age verification equipment in lieu of the standard first level * * * sanction * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">* <em>* </em>Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201c(6) The licensee <em>must use </em>the equipment at every point of sale used to sell alcoholic beverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">(Emphasis added.) Put differently, in order to avoid the sanction that would otherwise result from a violation of OAR 845-006~0335(l)(a), the offending licensee could purchase and use age-verification equipment. The use requirement under OAR 845-009-0140(6) (2008) encompassed both individual licensees and, through OAR 845-006-0362, the licensee\u2019s employees. Accordingly, a licensee that decided to comply with OAJEt 845-009-0140(6) (2008) and hopes to maintain that compliance will likely require that its individual licensees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>employees use the age-verification equipment when making an alcohol sale. The terms of the license restriction in this case reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Therefore, contrary to the OLCC\u2019s argument, we conclude that the license restriction, by its terms, imposes an obligation on licensee only to require that licensee\u2019s employees use age-verification equipment when the employee, during a sale of alcoholic beverages, is fulfilling his or her <em>freestanding </em>age-verification obligation under OAR 845-006-0335(l)(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the OLCC reached its conclusion that licensee had violated OAR 845-005-0355(5) based on an erroneous understanding of the license restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> Consistently with the designation of the parties in the contested case proceeding, we refer to petitioner US Market #180, LLC, and its members, individually and collectively, as \u201clicensee\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\"> OAR 845-005-0355(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cA licensee or permittee who has a restricted license or permit must exercise license or permit privileges only in compliance with the restriction(s).
