The board concluded that petitioner\u2019s challenge to individual restrictions on his trading activities in the Oregon Savings Growth Plan (plan) was moot. On review, petitioner contends that the board erred in failing to provide him the \u201crights of a party to a contested case hearing\u201d and in dismissing his request for a contested case hearing as moot. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s assignments of error are moot and dismiss the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We take the facts from the unchallenged findings in the board\u2019s order, supplemented by additional evidence in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995) (holding that \u201cunchallenged findings of fact are the facts for purposes of judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s final order\u201d). Petitioner has been a participant in the plan since at least 1983. In 2002, the plan began imposing trading restrictions on plan participants that had \u201cmade more than two trades per month in a three-month consecutive period\u201d in the International Stock investment option (IS option). In March 2002, the plan\u2019s deferred compensation manager (manager) determined that petitioner was engaged in excessive trading and, accordingly, limited petitioner to one redemption per month from the IS option. In December 2004, the board adopted a policy (2004 policy) giving the manager</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cthe authority to implement reasonable trading restrictions in the [plan] as needed to prevent increases in administrative costs or fees; negative investment performance; or detrimental effects that would arise or be imposed on the [p]lan as a whole or members in general because of excessive member trading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Pursuant to that policy, in 2005 and 2006, the manager imposed a series of further restrictions on petitioner\u2019s ability to trade in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">On March 14, 2006, the manager imposed a final set of individual restrictions on petitioner\u2019s trading activities. In May 2006, petitioner requested that the PERS director review the manager\u2019s imposition of those restrictions as a staff determination pursuant to OAR 459-001-0030 (Jan 1, 2002), which provides for PERS director review of a staff action or determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a June 2006 letter to petitioner, the PERS director affirmed the staff determination, finding that the manager had appropriately exercised her authority under the 2004 policy to impose the restrictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cI am responding to your request that PERS lift the trading restrictions placed on your Oregon Savings Growth Plan (OSGP) account by the Deferred Compensation Manager. Your May 11, 2006 letter, which was received on May 15, 2006, was referred to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cDETERMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\u201cThe PERS\u2019 Board has given the Deferred Compensation Manager authority to implement reasonable trading restrictions in the OSGP as needed to prevent increases in administrative costs or fees, negative investment performance or other detrimental effects that would arise or be imposed on the Plan as a whole or members in general because of excessive member trading. Because it was reported that your trading activity exceeded normal and expected frequency and dollar amounts, the Deferred Compensation Manager exercised her authority to impose restrictions on your trading activity. Therefore, I must deny your request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Petitioner then requested a contested case hearing pursuant to OAR 459-001-0035 (June 26, 2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>August 9, 2006, letter requesting that hearing, petitioner requested that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201cthe Decision [by the director] be reversed because the Manager did not have authority to impose the restrictions upheld in the Decision and the imposition of those restrictions violate the terms of my Contract and my constitutional rights. If that request is denied, I request that the restrictions in the Decision be changed to those in proposed OAR 459-050-0037, or those restrictions contained in the final rule, if they are less restrictive than those in the proposed rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In a letter dated August 11, 2006, PERS acknowledged \u201creceipt of [petitioner\u2019s] August 9, 2006[,] letter requesting a contested case hearing\u201d and granted that request. Later that month, PERS referred the case to an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In January 2007, while the contested case was pending, the PERS board adopted OAR 459-050-0037 (May 1, 2007), which imposed trading restrictions on all participants in the plan, including petitioner, and granted the manager the authority to establish additional temporary restrictions. On April 11, 2007, the manager informed petitioner by letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>that, \u201c[o]nce the new restrictions [in OAR 459-050-0037] are in place, all current restrictions on your account will be removed and the new restrictions will apply.\u201d OAR 459-050-0037 became effective on May 1,2007. On that date, the manager removed the individual restrictions on petitioner\u2019s account. Shortly thereafter, PERS moved for summary determination and dismissal of petitioner\u2019s request for a contested case hearing. PERS asserted that \u201cthe issues posed by petitioner [were] rendered moot\u201d because petitioner had already received the relief that he had requested in his request for a contested case hearing \u2014 removal of the individual restrictions \u2014 and no further relief was available to him in the contested case forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In response, petitioner agreed that \u201csome of [his] original arguments may be moot.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, petitioner argued that he had originally requested \u201cto have the former restrictions rescinded,\u201d and that that relief had not been provided. He also argued that his alternative request for relief\u2014 that the individual restrictions be changed to conform to those reflected in the proposed version of OAR 459-050-0037 or the final version of that rule, whichever was least restrictive \u2014 had not been provided because he was subject to the more restrictive final rule. Additionally, he raised new claims for the recovery of damages, declaratory relief, and an award of costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The board, which affirmed and adopted the proposed order issued by the ALJ, granted summary determination and dismissed petitioner\u2019s request for a contested case hearing, concluding, in part, that \u201cPERS\u2019s implementation of rules restricting trading within the plan renders moot [petitioner\u2019s] challenge to the previous individual restrictions placed on his account.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cWhen PERS referred this case to the Office of Administrative Hearings, the issue was whether the manager of the Plan had improperly imposed individualized trading restrictions on [petitioner\u2019s] ability to trade among various investment options in the Plan. The agency granted [petitioner\u2019s] request for a contested case hearing in that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cThe decision to impose trading restrictions on [petitioner] was a determination made by the deferred compensation manager, and, as such, was a staff determination. Arguably, this matter could have been the subject of a contested case hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201cBut, in the meantime, the situation changed. The manager no longer places individualized restrictions on a member\u2019s ability to trade. The agency adopted OAR 459-050-0037, which imposes trading restrictions on Plan participants in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cAn over-arching principle of law is that when a matter is moot, there is no longer an issue to be entertained. One of the definitions of \u2018moot\u2019 in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) is, \u2018to deprive of practical significance.\u2019 In <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402[, 848 P2d 1194] (1992), the Court found that where a patient had been discharged from the jurisdiction of PSRB, the possibility that the state might try to recover the costs of the patient\u2019s care at some future point was too speculative. A determination by the agency would therefore have no practical effect. Here, a determination [regarding] the individual restrictions on [petitioner\u2019s] ability to trade within the Plan would have no practical effect, because individualized restrictions no longer exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">\u201c[Petitioner] argued that the issues are not moot because he must exhaust his administrative remedies, including asking for a declaratory judgment to get a ruling about the validity of the restrictions placed on him individually. If an issue is moot, jurisdiction is not continued merely because a determination might be relevant in a future tort action. <em>Keeney v. University of Oregon, </em>178 Or App [198, 36 P3d 982] (2001), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 327 (2002). The contested case proceeding of the APA is not meant for the purpose of giving advisory opinions. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201c[We] hold that petitioner\u2019s claim that there was no authority for the manager to place individual restrictions on his ability to trade among the investment options was rendered moot by the adoption and implementation of the general restrictions in OAR 459-050-0037.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On review, petitioner raises two assignments of error. First, he contends that the board erred in failing to provide him the procedural \u201crights of a party to a contested case hearing,\u201d including proper notice, discovery, and an eviden-tiary hearing. Second, he contends that the board erred in dismissing his request for a contested case hearing as moot. Specifically, petitioner argues that the concept of mootness, as a component of justiciability, does not apply to administrative agencies and, therefore, that the board erred by relying on it. Petitioner further argues that a contested case hearing already existed by definition and that, in any event, his \u201cclaims for damages, declaratory relief, costs, and attorney fees under state and federal law and constitutional provisions did not become moot.\u201d Petitioner seeks a remand to the board with instructions to provide him the \u201cnotices and other rights of a party to a contested case hearing prior to considering a motion to dismiss or the merits of [his] claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">As to petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error, the board responds that it \u201cprovided petitioner all of the notices and rights required under its own rules and under the [Administrative Procedures Act].\u201d As to petitioner\u2019s second assignment, the board concedes that the concept of mootness does not apply to administrative agencies. <em>See Thunderbird Hotels, LLC v. City of Portland, </em>218 Or App 548, 556, 180 P3d 87 (2008) (\u201c [M]ootness\u2019 is a term of art concerning the authority of the courts to exercise the judicial power conferred by Article VII (Amended) of the Oregon Constitution and * * *, as an aspect of justiciability, it applies only to the courts and not to local governments or administrative agencies.\u201d). However, the board argues that that particular argument is unpreserved. Further, the board argues that it properly \u201cexercised its discretion not to proceed with a full contested case hearing because petitioner had already received all of the relief the Board could lawfully grant him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the contested case forum \u2014 namely, removal of the individual trading restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">We conclude that the review proceeding before this court is moot. <em>See Cyrus v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>226 Or App 1, 5, 202 P3d 274 (2009) (\u201cThis court has an independent obligation to determine whether a case is justiciable, and mootness is part of that inquiry.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted.)). As we explained in <em>Starrett v. City of Portland, </em>196 Or App 534, 538, 102 P3d 728 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cUnder traditional principles, a case is justiciable if the parties have adverse interests and the court\u2019s decision in the matter will \u2018have some practical effect on the rights of the parties to the controversy.\u2019 <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 405, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). The requirement that the court\u2019s decision have a practical effect on the party invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction must remain satisfied throughout the litigation. <em>Utsey v. Coos County, </em>176 Or App 524, 540, 32 P3d 933 (2001), <em>rev dismissed, </em>335 Or 217 (2003). Thus, a case that is \u2018otherwise justiciable, but in which a court\u2019s decision no longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties, will be dismissed as moot.\u2019 <em>Brumnett, </em>315 Or at 406.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In this case, the relief available to petitioner on review is a remand to the board. Petitioner acknowledges that the manager has removed the individual restrictions from his account, but suggests that, on remand, the board could additionally provide him with declaratory and compensatory relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, in order to determine whether exercising judicial review will have a practical effect on petitioner, we must first determine whether, on remand, the board could provide petitioner additional relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">As explained, petitioner sought review of the director\u2019s determination denying his request that the individual restrictions be removed from his account. Petitioner did so by filing a petition for a contested case hearing pursuant to OAR, 459-001-0035. That rule requires that a petition for a contested case hearing address certain enumerated criteria. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Specifically, OAR 459-001-0035(3) requires that a petition include, among other things, a \u201cstatement of the action the petition seeks.\u201d Following receipt of a petition, PERS may grant or deny the request for a contested case hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> OAR 459-001-0035(5). It necessarily follows, then, that the scope of a contested case hearing \u2014 including the relief available\u2014 is limited to that specified in the initial petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In his petition for a contested case hearing, petitioner requested that \u201cthe Decision [by the director] be reversed.\u201d That, in effect, was a request that the board remove the individual restrictions from his account. Because those individual restrictions have since been removed by the manager, petitioner has obtained the relief that he requested in his petition for a contested case hearing. On remand, even if the board were to agree with petitioner\u2019s contentions that the individual restrictions were improperly imposed, the board could not provide him additional relief. Accordingly, no practical effect would result from a determination by this court regarding whether the board erred in failing to address the merits of petitioner\u2019s claims or in failing to provide petitioner certain rights associated with a contested case hearing. <em>See, e.g., Thunderbird Hotels, LLC, </em>218 Or App 548 (concluding, in part, that no practical effect would result from a determination by this court of whether the Land Use Board of Appeals, which had invalidated an expired city ordinance, erred in failing to address a party\u2019s alternative arguments supporting the invalidity of the ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Petition for judicial review dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> Petitioner does not assign as error the accuracy or completeness of the board\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> All citations to OAR 459-001-0030 reference the version that was in effect at the time petitioner requested that the PERS director review the manager\u2019s imposition of trading restrictions.
