J.</author>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) seeks reconsideration of our opinion in <em>DCBS v. Zurich American, </em>246 Or App 702, 268 P3d 671 (2011), contending (1) that we were wrong to conclude that the worker-leasing company, Northwest Staffing Services (NW Staffing), was the proper employer for the director\u2019s noncompliance determination and (2) that our conclusion, in <em>dictum, </em>that the director had authority under ORS 656.307(3) to order Zurich American (Zurich) to reimburse Sedgwick Claims Management Services (Sedgwick) for the costs that Sedgwick had incurred in processing claimant\u2019s claim should have led us to reverse rather than affirm the board\u2019s order that rejected such a reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">DCBS has not offered any argument that is an appropriate reconsideration argument on the central issue in this <em>case </em>\u2014 viz., whether On-Time Delivery (On-Time) and the company from which it leased workers, NW Staffing, could simultaneously be noncomplying employers. In fact, DCBS has not chosen to address the analysis that led us to conclude that only NW Staffing could be a noncomplying employer in this case. DCBS\u2019s persistent thesis is that both a worker-leasing company and its client are noncomplying employers whenever the requirements imposed by ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 have not been met by either of them. We explained at some length in our opinion why the applicable statutes contradict that thesis. 246 Or App at 712 n 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">For example, ORS 656.850(3) relieves a worker-leasing company of the obligation to comply with ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 for the workers that it leases to a client if the client \u201chas proof of coverage on file with the director that extends coverage to subject workers employed by the client and any workers leased by the client.\u201d In other words, in that circumstance, the worker-leasing company is relieved of the statutory obligation to comply with the proof of coverage requirements <em>for its subject workers </em>who have been leased to the client; only the client has to fulfill that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The statute goes on to provide that, \u201c[i]f the client allows the coverage to expire and continues to employ subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>workers or has leased workers, [then] the client shall be considered a noncomplying employer unless the worker leasing company has\u201d provided notice to the director that it is providing workers to the client and workers\u2019 compensation coverage for those workers. ORS 656.850(3), (5). That provision would be superfluous if DCBS were correct about the operation of the statutes. According to its thesis, the client has an unvarying and independent obligation to comply with ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 for its subject workers without regard to whether it is a client of a worker-leasing company. Hence, it would not be necessary for ORS 656.850(3) to provide, as it does, that <em>the client </em>will be considered to be a noncomplying employer for <em>its </em>subject workers if the client allows its workers\u2019 compensation coverage to lapse while it is a client of a worker-leasing company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In a related vein, ORS 656.850(5) requires a worker-leasing company to give notice to the director if it is providing workers to a client and workers\u2019 compensation coverage for those workers. However, if, as provided by ORS 656.850(3), the client provides workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the leased workers, then the worker-leasing company does <em>not </em>have the obligation to provide coverage for them and does <em>not </em>have to comply with the proof of coverage requirements for those workers. If the client allows the coverage for those workers to lapse, then the client will be considered to be a noncomplying employer for those workers, that is, for workers for which it is <em>not </em>a subject employer, and the worker-leasing company will <em>not </em>be a noncomplying employer for them, because it did <em>not </em>undertake to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for them. The client undertook that responsibility, and, concomitantly, it is the client, not the worker-leasing company, that is obligated to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 for those workers. <em>See </em>ORS 656.850(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Finally, DCBS asserts in its reconsideration petition that, consistently with its understanding of the statutes, Zurich, not DCBS, should be required to pay On-Time\u2019s attorney fees in this proceeding because On-Time proved that, pursuant to ORS 656.850(3), Zurich, as NW Staffing\u2019s insurer, provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage for On-Time\u2019s subject workers. DCBS\u2019s position on that point further illustrates the fundamental flaw in its analysis. ORS 656.740(6)(b) requires an insurance company to pay a noncomplying employer\u2019s attorney fees if the insurer failed to fulfill its independent obligation under ORS 656.419 to timely file proof of coverage of the noncomplying employer\u2019s subject employees. Zurich did <em>not </em>have a contract with On-Time to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage for On-Time\u2019s subject employees, and <em>it did not fail </em>to fulfill its obligation under ORS 656.419 to file proof of coverage for On-Time\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Zurich did have a contract with NW Staffing, and nothing in the record suggests that Zurich failed to file proof of coverage under its insurance contract with NW Staffing. Therefore, had the director issued a noncomplying employer order against NW Staffing \u2014 rather than On-Time \u2014 and NW Staffing been found to be a noncomplying employer\u2014 because it did not satisfy, by filing the required notice under ORS 656.850(5) or otherwise, the requirements imposed by ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 for On-Time\u2019s subject workers \u2014 Zurich would not have been required to pay NW Staffing\u2019s attorney fees in that proceeding. That is so because NW Staffing would not be able to prove that <em>Zurich </em>had failed to fulfill <em>its </em>obligation under ORS 656.419 to timely file proof that it provided insurance coverage for the employees for whom NW Staffing was required to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage. In other words, the only party that could have failed to fulfill its statutory obligations in this context is NW Staffing. It makes no sense to impose on Zurich or anyone else any liability for NW Staffing\u2019s failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In summary, as we explained in our opinion, the workers\u2019 compensation coverage requirement and the concomitant obligation to comply with ORS 656.017 and ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>656.407 for a client\u2019s leased and subject employees are imposed on the worker-leasing company or the client, depending on the circumstances, but not on both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The only argument that DCBS advances on reconsideration that we did not expressly reject in our opinion\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that our decision \u201cunnecessarily burdens [DCBS\u2019s] ability to enforce the statutory obligations of subject employers and thereby undermines the efficient administration of the workers\u2019 compensation program\u201d \u2014 is one that should more properly be addressed to the legislature rather than to us in a petition for reconsideration. Moreover, the purported burden does not withstand scrutiny. It appears that the only change that the director would have to make in enforcing the law against noncomplying employers is to ask employers whether they have leased workers and, if they do, whether the employer has filed with the director proof of workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the employer\u2019s leased and subject workers. The answers to those questions (which could easily be verified) would determine whether the noncomplying employer order should be issued to the employer or to its worker-leasing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">With regard to the second issue raised by DCBS in its reconsideration petition, <em>viz., </em>the director\u2019s authority to order reimbursement between Zurich and Sedgwick, we conclude that we erred in concluding that the director has authority under ORS 656.307 to order such a reimbursement. The ALJ concluded in her order that, \u201c[b]ecause Zurich is responsible for the claim, it must assume responsibility for the claim and provide reimbursement <em>pursuant to ORS 656.054.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Zurich appealed the ALJ\u2019s order \u2014 which, under ORS 656.740(5)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was the director\u2019s final order \u2014 to the board, arguing that there was no legal basis for the director to order that reimbursement. Although the board agreed with the ALJ\u2019s responsibility conclusion, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>reversed the director\u2019s order that required Zurich to reimburse Sedgwick pursuant to ORS 656.054. The board went on to propose that the director might have authority to order such a <em>reimbursement </em>\u2014 viz., one directly between two insurers \u2014pursuant to ORS 656.307, notwithstanding that none of the parties had argued to the board that ORS 656.307, rather than ORS 656.054, applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">DCBS sought judicial review of the board\u2019s order, contending, contrary to the board\u2019s reimbursement conclusion, that the director <em>had </em>authority to order the reimbursement under ORS 656.054 and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201c[t]he board relied on an inapplicable statute in reversing the ALJ\u2019s order requiring Zurich to reimburse the Fund. ORS 656.307 does [not] compel reversal. Indeed, it has no relevance to this case at all. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201c[ORS 656.307] was not the basis of the ALJ\u2019s order here. This case did not present facts requiring the application of ORS 656.307.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">(Record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We flatly rejected DCBS\u2019s contention that ORS 656.054 gave the director authority to order the responsible insurer of an alleged noncomplying employer to reimburse the assigned claims agent. 246 Or App at 715. However, we went on to consider the board\u2019s alternative source of authority for the director to order reimbursement between the insurers \u2014 ORS 656.307. We conclude that we erred in doing that. <em>See, e.g., Speciality Risk Services v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>213 Or App 620, 631, 164 P3d 300 (2007) (concluding that ORS 656.307(3) does not provide authority for director to order reimbursement between insurers outside the context of a responsibility proceeding under ORS 656.307(1) and, hence, that ORS 656.307 does not constitute an administrative remedy that replaced the insurer\u2019s civil restitution remedy against another insurer for compensation benefits paid by former insurer that should have been paid by the latter).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Therefore, we modify our original opinion by deleting from it the following passage at 246 Or App at 715-16, 715 n 15:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cRather, in the context of a responsibility determination among insurers, ORS 656.307(3) provides, as relevant, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c \u2018[w]hen a determination of the responsible paying party has been made, the director shall direct any necessary monetary adjustment between the parties involved. Any monetary adjustment not reimbursed by an insurer or self-insured employer shall be recovered from the Consumer and Business Services Fund.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u201cThat provision is the source of the director\u2019s authority to make any necessary monetary adjustments between the responsible insurer of an alleged noncomplying employer and the assigned claims agent for the costs that the latter has incurred in processing a referred claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, although Zurich is responsible for claimant\u2019s claim, the board correctly concluded that it lacked the authority to order Zurich to reimburse Sedgwick for the costs that Sedgwick had incurred in processing claimant\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-5\"> Conversely, if the worker-leasing company provides notice to the director under ORS 656.850(5) that it is providing leased workers to the client and workers\u2019 compensation coverage for them, then the client will <em>not </em>be considered to be a noncomplying employer. In other words, the client\u2019s status as a noncomplying employer would not depend, as DCBS contends, on its compliance with ORS 656.017 and ORS 656.407 because the notice provided by the worker-leasing company to the director would prevent the client from \u201cbe[ing] considered to be a noncomplying employer\u201d even though the client has subject workers and has allowed its workers\u2019 compensation coverage for them to expire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> ORS 656.740(5)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding ORS 183.315 (1), * * * orders declaring a person to be a noncomplying employer or the assessment of civil penalties pursuant to this chapter, the conduct of hearings and the judicial review thereof shall be as provided in ORS chapter 183, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c(a) The order of an Administrative Law Judge in a contested case shall he deemed to be a final order of the director.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201c15 DCBS\u2019s argument that Sedgwick is merely an assigned claims agent and not an insurer for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, including ORS 656.307(3), is directly contradicted by the statutory definition of\u2018insurer\u2019 in ORS 656.005(14), which is \u2018the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation or an insurer authorized under ORS chapter 731 to transact workers\u2019 compensation insurance in this state or <em>an assigned claims agent selected by the director under ORS 656.054.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
