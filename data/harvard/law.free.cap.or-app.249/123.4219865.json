J.</author>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In this dependency case, father appeals from a judgment of the juvenile court ordering that he undergo a psychological evaluation. We review the juvenile court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law and its findings for any evidence, <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The underlying facts are largely procedural and undisputed. The child was born in late January 2010, and has been within the protective custody of the juvenile department since July 14, 2010. Father has been incarcerated since before the child\u2019s birth and has had no contact with her. In February 2011, father stipulated to the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction of the child based on allegations that (1) he did not have a parental relationship with the child, had not presented himself as a parenting resource, and needed the assistance of a child caring agency to establish a meaningful relationship with the child; and (2) he was unavailable to parent due to incarceration. DHS originally also alleged that father presented a risk of harm to the child based on his criminal history (\u201cburglary, robbery, and assault\u201d), but that allegation was dismissed by stipulation of both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It is undisputed that father\u2019s incarceration is based on convictions for assault and riot. Father is scheduled to be released from prison on July 14,2012. At a permanency hearing on July 11, 2011, the state requested that the court continue the permanency plan of reunification. The state also requested that the juvenile court order father to participate in a psychological evaluation to assist the department in determining what services to provide father upon his release from prison. The department explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201cWe would also request that [father] undergo a psychological evaluation to get some professional input as to what types of services [father] would need upon his release, and the approximate time frames that [father] will need to successfully engage in those services before we could be sure he would be a safe person to be around the child, whether that be visiting or placement resource.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Father objected, contending that a psychological evaluation is not rationally related to the bases for jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u2018Your Honor, excuse me, but I think I really should add something on behalf of [father] because * * * [the child\u2019s counsel] reminded me * * * about the psychological evaluation request as to [mother]. That has shown up in the letter of expectation for [father] as well. I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a basis for that and * * * without some indication that it\u2019s, there\u2019s jurisdiction based on a mental health issue, I don\u2019t believe it would be proper to require that and I think it\u2019s inappropriate for DHS to be asking for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The state replied that, because father was in prison for violent crimes, it was appropriate to conduct a psychological evaluation to determine whether father was a safe visitation or placement resource for the child. The state disagreed with father\u2019s assertion that, in order to require a mental health evaluation, the basis for jurisdiction would have to have included a mental health issue. Father countered that ordering a psychological evaluation would be error without \u201cthe state establishing a rational relationship between that request and [father\u2019s] circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The juvenile court decided to order the psychological evaluation, based on the fact that the record reflected that father\u2019s incarceration was for riot and assault \u2014 two offenses involving violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found that DHS needed a psychological evaluation to develop an appropriate case plan to address the safety risk presented by father\u2019s circumstances. The court explained, \u201cit\u2019s only reasonable that DHS would have some information about the gentleman and * * * his mental health status, regarding whether there\u2019s going to be unsupervised visits or anything like that. * * * [Tjhey\u2019d be remiss in not requesting it.\u201d The court concluded that there was a rational basis for requiring the evaluation. The court noted further that a report in the record indicated that father had been disciplined while incarcerated due to negative behaviors, and found that that was another reason to require the psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Father appeals, contending that, after taking jurisdiction of the child, the juvenile court was authorized under ORS 419B.337(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ORS 419B.343<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to make <em>only </em>those orders for services that bear a rational relationship to the jurisdictional findings that brought the child into the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Father relies on <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. G. L., </em>220 Or App 216, 223, 185 P3d 483, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 158 (2008), where this court held that ORS 419B.343 requires a rational connection between the service to be provided and the basis for jurisdiction. In father\u2019s view, the requirement that father undergo a psychological evaluation does not bear any relationship, let alone a rational relationship, to the factual bases for jurisdiction. Father focuses on the fact that the stipulated bases for jurisdiction were (1) father\u2019s lack of a relationship with the child and (2) his unavailability due to incarceration. He contends that a psychological evaluation is not related to either one of those factual bases for jurisdiction, because there is no evidence that father\u2019s lack of relationship with the child, incarceration, or unavailability are circumstances that would pose a safety risk to the child when he is released, and having a psychological evaluation will not assist father in establishing a relationship with the child. Father contends, further, that, to the extent that the juvenile court concluded that a psychological evaluation was rationally related to the underlying conduct that had resulted in father\u2019s incarceration, it was incorrect, because the state did not present any evidence in support of its argument that father had been convicted of assault and riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The state responds that the bases for father\u2019s incarceration are in the record and are also a matter of public record. The state is correct. The state further contends that the ordered psychological evaluation is rationally related to the reason for father\u2019s unavailability \u2014 his conviction and incarceration for crimes involving violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We agree with the state. Father is correct that the ordered services must bear a rational relationship to the bases for the finding of jurisdiction; however, a \u201crational relationship\u201d is a minimal threshold of justification. It is true that the bare allegations that formed the bases for jurisdiction do not disclose in and of themselves any reason why father might pose a risk to the child; but the court was not required to turn a blind eye to the record before it. That record discloses that father was incarcerated \u2014 a stipulated allegation \u2014 as well as the cause of that incarceration. The court found that the reasons for father\u2019s lack of relationship with the child, unavailability, and imprisonment were his convictions for assault and riot. The court further found that father posed a risk to the child. The court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and we are bound by them. <em>C. </em>Z., 236 Or App at 442. DHS put on evidence that a psychological evaluation would aid DHS in assessing father\u2019s safety risk and determining what services DHS should provide. The court concluded that \u201ca psychological evaluation would be rationally related in this case to determine whether he\u2019s going to be safe around the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Further, even if the court\u2019s expressed reason for ordering a psychological evaluation was somehow inadequately related to the stipulated allegations \u2014 which, we repeat, it was not \u2014 the order was correct for another, equally valid, reason: Due to the fact that father has never met the child and has no relationship with her, he will benefit from services to help him establish a relationship with her, and the psychological evaluation will help DHS decide what services are best suited to that need.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We conclude that the juvenile court did not err in concluding that a psychological evaluation to determine the appropriate services necessary to ensure that father can establish a safe relationship with the child is rationally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>related to the bases for jurisdiction, viewed in the context of the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> Indeed, a DHS protective custody report stated that father has an extensive criminal conviction history, dating back to 2002, that includes four assault convictions, as well as convictions for theft, burglary, disorderly conduct, harassment, criminal mischief and riot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-4\"> ORS 419B.337(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cThe court may specify the particular type of care, supervision or services to be provided by the Department of Human Services to wards placed in the department\u2019s custody and to the parents or guardians of the wards, but the actual planning and provision of such care, supervision or services is the responsibility of the department.
