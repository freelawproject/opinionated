A., a Delaware corporation. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Delaware\u2019s three-year statute of limitation applied and barred plaintiffs suit. Plaintiff appeals the resulting judgment of dismissal, arguing that Oregon\u2019s six-year statute of limitation applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In its first assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the court erred in separating Delaware\u2019s three-year statute of limitation from Delaware\u2019s tolling statute, which tolls the statute of limitation until a defendant is amenable to suit in Delaware. As a result of the tolling statute, plaintiff contends, application of the Delaware statute of limitation would create an indefinite limitation period, effectively depriving defendant of any statute-of-limitation defense in Oregon. Therefore, plaintiff asserts, because Delaware\u2019s statute of limitation differs substantially from Oregon\u2019s comparable statute and would impose an unfair burden on defendant in defending against plaintiffs claim, the court should have applied Oregon\u2019s statute of limitation. ORS 12.450. Plaintiffs claim was timely under Oregon\u2019s statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The outcome of plaintiffs first assignment of error is governed by our recent decision in <em>CACV of Colorado v. Stevens, </em>248 Or App 624, 274 P3d 859 (2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>circumstances very similar to those presented here, we concluded that application of Delaware\u2019s statute of limitation, and, as required by ORS 12.440, Delaware\u2019s tolling statute, would impose an unfair burden on the defendant by effectively depriving the defendant of any statute-of-limitation defense. As a result, we concluded that, pursuant to ORS 12.450, Oregon courts must apply Oregon\u2019s statute of limitation rather than Delaware\u2019s. 248 Or App at 638-40. Here, where plaintiffs claim was filed within six years of its accrual, it was timely. Consequently, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on his statute-of-limitation defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In its second assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the court erred in awarding attorney fees to defendant, arguing that Delaware law does not provide for an award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant in this type of action. In light of our resolution of plaintiffs first assignment of error, the attorney fee award is deemed reversed. ORS 20.220(3)(a) (providing that, when a party appeals a judgment to which an attorney fee award relates, \u201c[i]f the appellate court reverses the judgment, the award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements shall be deemed reversed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> As we explained in <em>CACV,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201cIn most contexts, <em>former </em>ORS 81.100 to 81.135 (2009), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 15.300 to 15.380 (2011), provides the framework to be used by an Oregon court in determining what state\u2019s law applies when the court enforces a contract. <em>Capital One Bank v. Fort, </em>242 Or App 166, 170 n 3, 255 P3d 508 (2011). Under <em>former </em>ORS 81.102, those statutes do \u2018not apply to any contract in which one of the parties is a financial institution, as defined by 15 U.S.C. 6827.\u2019 The legislature amended that provision in 2011 to limit its scope before renumbering it as ORS 15.035. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 129, \u00a7 1. The 2011 amendment does not apply to civil actions that were commenced before May 19, 2011, Or Laws 2011, ch 129, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and plaintiff filed this action on November 19,2007. Consequently, we apply the 2009 version of <em>former </em>ORS 81.102, and, because the cardholder agreement was originally entered into by defendant and Chase \u2014 a financial institution under 15 USC section <em>6827 </em>\u2014 former ORS 81.100 to 81.135 do not apply in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\"><em>CACV, </em>248 Or App at 629 n 6. Likewise, here plaintiff filed its action on March 6, 2008, before the 2011 amendment took effect, and the cardholder agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>entered into by defendant and Chase, a financial institution under 15 USC section 6827. Therefore, our analysis from <em>CACV </em>applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
