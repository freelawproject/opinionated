ORS 164.055. She asserts that the trial court erred in imposing restitution in the amount of $2,336.96, contending that that restitution award is not supported by sufficient evidence. Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is unpreserved; she acknowledges that she failed to \u201cspecifically object to the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution in the amount of $2,336.96.\u201d Nonetheless, defendant urges this court to conduct plain error review under ORAP 5.45Q).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Recently, in <em>State v. Gruver, </em>247 Or App 8, 17, 268 P3d 760 (2011), we acknowledged that \u201cthe imposition of a particular amount of restitution in the absence of <em>any </em>evidence in the record to support such an award can constitute \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) However, we held in <em>Gruver </em>that, where the prosecutor presents some evidence to support restitution of a particular amount, and the defendant does not raise an objection to the amount of restitution pursuant to ORS 137.106(5), the trial court does not plainly err in imposing restitution in that amount. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Here, as in <em>Gruver, </em>there was some evidence presented of the nature and amount of damages. Therefore, the trial court did not plainly err in imposing the restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> Pursuant to ORAP 5.45(1), \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * <em>*, </em>provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
