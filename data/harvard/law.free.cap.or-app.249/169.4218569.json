The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant on the ground that plaintiffs action was untimely under Delaware\u2019s three-year statute of limitation for contract claims. Plaintiff challenges that conclusion on appeal, contending that Delaware\u2019s statute would be indefinitely tolled under Delaware law. Because indefinite tolling of the Delaware statute would cause Delaware\u2019s limitation period to differ substantially from Oregon\u2019s comparable limitation period and would impose an unfair burden on defendant in defending against plaintiffs claim, plaintiff contends that, pursuant to ORS 12.450, the court should have applied Oregon\u2019s six-year statute of limitation \u2014 ORS 12.080\u2014 instead of Delaware\u2019s statute. Under the Oregon statute, plaintiffs claim was timely. We agree with plaintiff and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The legal issues in this case are governed by our recent decision in <em>CACV of Colorado v. Stevens, </em>248 Or App 624, 274 P3d 859 (2012). There, as here, the issue was whether Delaware\u2019s or Oregon\u2019s statute of limitation applied in an action to recover the balance owed on a credit card account, which was generally governed by Delaware law. We determined that Delaware\u2019s nonresident tolling statute would apply to Delaware\u2019s statute of limitation in such cases and would toll the Delaware limitation period until the defendant became a Delaware resident. As a result, Delaware\u2019s limitation period would be significantly different from Oregon\u2019s limitation period \u2014 an indefinite period versus a six-year period \u2014 and would impose an unfair burden on the defendant by effectively eliminating the statute-of-limitation defense. Under those circumstances, we concluded that ORS 12.450 requires Oregon courts to apply Oregon\u2019s statute of limitation instead of Delaware\u2019s statute. 248 Or App at 638-40. The effect of that conclusion in this case is that plaintiffs claim was timely filed under ORS 12.080, <em>viz., </em>it was filed within six years of its accrual, and, hence, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>erred in granting summary judgment to defendant on his statute-of-limitation defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-5\"> Because we reverse the judgment, the court\u2019s attorney-fee award to defendant is reversed as well. <em>See </em>ORS 20.220(3)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
