This court reviews the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8). On the basis of that review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">As background, we briefly outline some of the statutes and rules that govern the PPD-determination process. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law provides that, when an injured worker becomes \u201cmedically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability,\u201d the employer\u2019s insurer \u201cshall close the worker\u2019s claim * * * and determine the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability\u201d except in limited circumstances not present here. ORS 656.268(1). In the course of closing the claim, the insurer makes findings about the extent of the worker\u2019s permanent disability under standards promulgated by the director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS). ORS 656.268(5)(a). If the worker has lost the \u201cuse or function of a body part or system\u201d due to a compensable injury or disease, the extent of the worker\u2019s impairment is \u201cexpressed as a percentage of the whole person,\u201d and impairment benefits are determined accordingly. ORS 656.214(l)(a). As an initial matter, the extent of that impairment \u201cis established based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>on objective findings of the attending physician.\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(5). The insurer\u2019s notice of closure informs the worker of, among other things, \u201cthe amount of any further compensation, including permanent disability compensation to be awarded.\u201d ORS 656.268(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Either the worker or the insurer may seek reconsideration by the director of DCBS and, if the objection to the notice of closure is \u201cdisagreement with the impairment used in rating of the worker\u2019s disability,\u201d the director will refer the claim to a medical arbiter or medical arbiter panel. ORS 656.268(8)(a); <em>see </em>ORS 656.268(8)(c) (regarding medical arbiter panels). The medical arbiter\u2019s findings are \u201csubmitted to the director for reconsideration of the notice of closure.\u201d ORS 656.268(8)(g). When a medical arbiter (or panel) has been used on reconsideration, \u201cimpairment is established based on objective findings of the medical arbiter, except where a preponderance of the medical evidence demonstrates that different findings by the attending physician are more accurate and should be used.\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(5). Those findings will be used to determine the extent of impairment \u2014 that is, the findings will be <em>\u201crated\u201d </em>\u2014 except when \u201cthe physician [here, members of the arbiter panel] determines the findings are invalid and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid.\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(12).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dispute in this case centers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the meaning of that administrative rule, that is, what it means to \u201cexplain[ ]\u201d why findings are invalid \u201cbased on sound medical principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The historical facts are undisputed. Claimant com-pensably injured his shoulder in January 2007, when he attempted to pick up a hydraulic pump while at work. SAIF accepted a condition described as a \u201cright shoulder strain, glenoid labral tear, and long head of the biceps tear, right shoulder.\u201d Claimant had two surgeries for his injuries, but continued to experience severe pain and did not appear to improve with continuing therapy. In January 2009, after determining that claimant\u2019s condition was not likely to improve with further treatment, claimant\u2019s attending physician recommended that claimant have an independent medical evaluation (IME) to assist in claim closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">That IME was performed by Dr. Todd Lewis, in conjunction with a work capacity evaluation (WCE) by Susan Bottomley, on April 22, 2009. Diming both examinations, claimant reported that he avoided using his right arm for any functional activities because of pain. He specifically told Bottomley that he did not steer his car with his right hand. After claimant left their office, however, both physicians saw him walk with a symmetric arm swing, get into his car, \u201cplace the right arm on the top of the steering wheel,\u201d and pull out of a parking spot \u201csteering throughout the parking lot to exit while continuing to hold [a] cell phone to his left ear with [his] left arm and steering the truck solely with his right arm.\u201d Based on their observations of claimant\u2019s behavior during and as he left the evaluations, Lewis and Bottomley concluded that the range-of-motion findings that they had made during their examinations were invalid. Bottomley expressly opined in her report, \u201cIf there is any valid limitation it is obscured by the degree of dysfunction presented. Based upon this, valid restrictions can not be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Claimant\u2019s attending physician conducted a closing examination on May 26, 2009, and proclaimed claimant to be medically stationary as of that date. He reported that he did not fully concur with Lewis\u2019s and Bottomley\u2019s determinations and, upon further inquiry from SAIF, he opined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Bottomley\u2019s reported range-of-motion findings <em>were </em>valid for purposes of rating claimant\u2019s right shoulder impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">After the closing examination but before SAIF closed the claim, both Lewis and claimant\u2019s attending physician were shown a brief videotape of claimant walking to his car after the April 22 examinations, taken from a surveillance camera located outside Lewis\u2019s and Bottomley\u2019s office. Lewis asserted that the videotape supported his reported observations that claimant acted contrary to his described and demonstrated disability. The attending physician disagreed, opining that the videotape footage was \u201cvery brief and inconclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In September 2009, Dr. Lynne Bell conducted an insurer-requested review of claimant\u2019s medical history and examination of claimant. Bell reported that she was \u201cunable to determine the extent to which [claimant\u2019s] demonstrated range of motion of the right shoulder is an accurate reflection of his true abilities.\u201d She also stated that claimant \u201cexhibited inconsistencies and non-physiological findings on today\u2019s hand dynamometer testing and similar inconsistencies were found during the more extensive physical capacities evaluation performed by Susan Bottomley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Surveillance of claimant was also conducted by a SAIF investigator over the course of seven days between early June and early August, 2009. That surveillance resulted in two short videos of claimant walking with a symmetrical arm swing and using his right hand to unlock his vehicle. All of the physicians who had examined claimant were asked to comment on those videos. Lewis and Bottomley opined that the footage supported their observations during the April 22, 2009, examinations. Bell, however, opined that the \u201cvideo footage available to [her] did not depict [claimant] putting his shoulder through greater range of motion than that documented at the time of [her] own examination,\u201d and claimant\u2019s attending physician opined that the video did not change his opinion that Bottomley\u2019s range-of-motion findings should be rated.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">SAIF closed the claim on September 17, 2009. SAIF rated Bottomley\u2019s range-of-motion findings and awarded a total of 25 percent whole person impairment, accounting for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>work disability. SAIF immediately requested reconsideration before the Appellate Review Unit (ARU) of DCBS\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, with examination by a medical arbiter panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">A panel of three medical arbiters examined claimant on January 22, 2010. Based on that examination and its review of the record, the arbiter panel reported findings that showed reduced range of motion in claimant\u2019s right shoulder. Specifically, the arbiters found that claimant <em>\u201cis </em>significantly limited in the repetitive use of the right shoulder due to the accepted conditions and subsequent treatment,\u201d and that \u201cany valid findings of impairment are related to the accepted conditions.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The arbiter panel determined, however, that those findings were invalid for purposes of rating impairment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cIt is our impression that the ranges of motion seen on today\u2019s exam are not valid for the purpose of measuring permanent impairment. [Claimant] demonstrated significantly improved motion at prior exams and during surveillance video. There were some pain behaviors during the exam that suggest his motion may have been self-limited due to symptoms and fear of re-injury. For these reasons, it is our opinion that the ranges of motion seen today are not valid for the purpose of measuring permanent impairment[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In its order on reconsideration, the ARU stated that the arbiter panel\u2019s report was \u201cbased on sound medical principles and the most objective findings\u201d and that it was \u201cexpressed in clear and concise reasoning and provides an accurate history.\u201d The ARU then adopted the arbiter panel\u2019s determination that its range-of-motion findings were invalid and, accordingly, the ARU reduced claimant\u2019s total PPD award from 25 percent to 15 percent, deleting the amount that originally had been awarded for lost range of motion. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0007(12) (requiring that, when findings are determined invalid, the findings receive a value of zero).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Claimant requested a hearing, arguing that the ARU erred in not rating the arbiter panel\u2019s range-of-motion findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claimant relied on OAR 436-035-0007(12). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>noted, the pertinent portion of that rule requires that ratable impairment findings be rated, upon examination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\u201cunless the physician determines the findings are invalid and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Claimant contended that the arbiter panel\u2019s written opinion did not adequately explain why the arbiter panel\u2019s findings were invalid, and he asserted that the arbiter panel\u2019s range-of-motion findings should have been rated. The ALJ agreed and amended the ARU\u2019s order on reconsideration to award claimant a total PPD award of 26 percent. The board adopted the ALJ\u2019s order and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">SAIF seeks judicial review of the board\u2019s order. As an initial matter, we consider \u2014 and reject \u2014 SAIF\u2019s argument that the ARU implicitly interpreted OAR 436-035-0007(12) in its order on reconsideration and that the board erred in not deferring to that plausible interpretation. Under <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994), we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own administrative rule if that interpretation is plausible. In previous workers\u2019 compensation cases, we have deferred to the ARU\u2019s plausible interpretations of DCBS rules, reasoning that the ARU was the department\u2019s delegate for that purpose. <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Norton, </em>213 Or App 530, 535, 162 P3d 322 (2007); <em>SAIF v. Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App 173, 181-82, 96 P3d 1282 (2004). Consequently, if the ARU had interpreted OAR 436-035-0007(12) in the course of resolving SAIF\u2019s reconsideration request, we would defer to that interpretation if it was plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The ARU\u2019s order on reconsideration does not, however, include any rule interpretation that we can assess for plausibility. In adopting the arbiter panel\u2019s opinion that its range-of-motion findings were invalid, the ARU simply applied OAR 436-035-0007(12) to the pertinent facts; it did not <em>interpret </em>what that provision means when, for example, it requires a written opinion \u201cexplaining\u201d why the impairment findings are invalid. Consequently, there is no rule interpretation to which we could defer. <em>See ETU, Inc. v. Environmental Quality Commission, </em>343 Or 57, 68, 162 P3d 248 (2007) (an agency\u2019s \u201cad hoc determination\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>respondents\u2019 asserted \u201ccause\u201d for a late request for hearing \u201cwas not * * * beyond respondents\u2019 reasonable control\u201d was \u201cmerely an <em>application </em>of the agency\u2019s rule to a given set of facts,\u201d not a rule interpretation (emphasis in original)). <em>Compare Gienger v. Dept. of State Lands, </em>230 Or App 178, 186-87, 214 P3d 75 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 13 (2010) (agency interpreted rule in the course of applying it by recounting, in the order, two of its own regulatory definitions and discussing how they applied, in concert, to the facts of the case). We acknowledge that there are cases in which an agency order necessarily is premised on an implicit interpretation of its own rule. <em>See, e.g., Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App at 180-82 (in applying an ambiguous rule that had \u201ctwo possible meanings,\u201d the ARU necessarily interpreted the rule as having one of those two meanings, and not the other). This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Questions of deference aside, we are left to address SAIF\u2019s argument that the board misapplied OAR 436-035-0007(12). As quoted above, the arbiter panel opined that its range-of-motion findings were invalid because claimant \u201cdemonstrated significantly improved motion at prior exams and during surveillance video\u201d and his pain behaviors suggested that his motion was \u201cself-limited.\u201d In rejecting the panel\u2019s invalidity determination, the ALJ \u2014 and by adoption, the board \u2014 concluded that those comments lacked sufficient explanation, in part because the panel\u2019s opinion (1) did not identify the specific prior examinations during which claimant allegedly exhibited \u201csignificantly improved motion\u201d; (2) did not explain how claimant\u2019s movements in the video contradicted the panel\u2019s findings upon examination; and (3) failed to identify claimant\u2019s alleged pain behavior or describe specific observations made during the examination that suggested claimant was intentionally limiting his movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Given the board\u2019s disposition, the first question we address is what, as a matter of law, must be included in a medical report to satisfy OAR 436-035-0007(12)\u2019s requirement that the examining physician (here, the medical arbiter panel) provide a \u201cwritten opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>SAIF\u2019s view, that provision is satisfied if a physician\u2019s conclusion that findings are invalid \u201cis offered with reasons\u201d that are \u201cbased on doctrines or assumptions that are accurate and supported by knowledge or experience.\u201d As we read it, SAIF\u2019s argument turns on the premise that the medical report is sufficient as long as it cites a medical principle or observation that forms the basis for the physician\u2019s determination of invalidity, even if that determination is presented in the form of a bare conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">SAIF\u2019s interpretation of the rule overlooks the significance of the requirement in OAR 436-035-0007(12) that an arbiter provide an opinion not only \u201cbased on sound medical principles\u201d but also <em>\u201cexplaining </em>why the findings are invalid.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As relevant here, to \u201cexplain\u201d can mean: \u201cto make plain or understandable\u201d; to \u201cgive the meaning or significance of\u2019; to \u201cprovide an understanding of\u2019; or \u201cto show the logical development of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>801 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, in using the word \u201cexplaining,\u201d OAR 436-035-0007(12) contemplates that \u2014 in addition to being based on sound medical principles \u2014 a written opinion also must \u201cshow the logical development of\u2019 any conclusion that findings are invalid, in a way that makes the conclusion \u201cplain or understandable.\u201d Such an explanation need not be detailed but must, at a minimum, indicate not only <em>what </em>observations or other information led the examining physician to believe that his or her impairment findings were invalid, but also <em>how </em>those observations or information contradicted the findings, and <em>why </em>the contradictions are medically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">With that understanding in mind, we conclude that the board\u2019s application of OAR 436-035-0007(12) was not legally erroneous and that its interpretation of the arbiter panel\u2019s report was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>232 Or App 419, 425, 222 P3d 1097 (2009) (explaining standards of review). In applying OAR 436-035-0007(12), the board reasoned that the arbiter panel\u2019s written opinion was insufficient because it did not specifically identify which prior examination or examinations the arbiters had relied upon, did not explain how the arbiters\u2019 measured ranges of motion conflicted with those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>observed either in prior evaluations or on videotape, and failed to discuss the ways in which the arbiters both thought that claimant intentionally had limited his movement. That understanding of OAR 436-035-0007(12) is consistent with our conclusion that the rule required the arbiters both to identify the medical observations or information on which their invalidity determination was based and to discuss the <em>reasoning </em>\u2014 i.e., the logical analysis \u2014 that led them to conclude that those observations conflicted with their own range-of-motion measurements (or otherwise called those measurements into question) in a medically significant way.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">We also conclude that the record supports the board\u2019s conclusion that, as a factual matter, the arbiter panel\u2019s opinion was too conclusory to constitute an explanation of why its impairment findings were invalid. In completing its examination process, the arbiter panel reviewed the entire medical record, as well as surveillance videotapes obtained before claim closure. During the processing of the claim, claimant had an IME, a work-capacity evaluation, and an insurer-requested medical evaluation. Each evaluating physician prepared a report with range-of-motion findings and observations made during and after examination. Each of those physicians, as well as claimant\u2019s attending physician, also viewed three short surveillance videos \u2014 depicting claimant walking with a symmetrical arm swing and using his right hand to unlock his vehicle \u2014 and commented on whether what they observed in the videos was consistent or inconsistent with their range-of-motion findings. Significantly, some of the physicians contended that the surveillance video rendered impairment findings invalid, but some did not. Given that record, the board reasonably could find that the arbiter panel\u2019s reference to \u201cprior exams\u201d and \u201csurveillance video\u201d did not adequately identify which medical observations contradicted the arbiter panel\u2019s impairment findings, or in what medically significant way the observations and findings conflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In short, we conclude that the board\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence and that the board applied OAR 436-035-0007(12) correctly. We have considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>remaining arguments made by SAIF and employer, and we reject them without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\"> SAIF issued the notice of closure on September 17, 2009. Accordingly, we apply the version of OAR 436-035-0007(12) that was in effect on that date. <em>See </em>OAR 436-035-0003(1). All references to the Oregon Administrative Rules in this opinion are to the version in effect on September 17, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> The rule provides, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cValidity is established for findings of impairment according to the criteria noted in the <em>AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Ed., Rev., 1990, </em>unless the validity criteria for a particular finding is not addressed in this reference, is not pertinent to these rules, or is determined by physician opinion to be medically inappropriate for a particular worker. Upon examination, findings of impairment which are determined to be ratable under these rules are rated <em>unless the physician determines the findings are invalid and provides a written opinion, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are invalid. </em>When findings are determined invalid, the findings receive a value of zero. If the validity criteria are not met but the physician determines the findings are valid, the physician must provide a written rationale, based on sound medical principles, explaining why the findings are valid. For purposes of this rule, the straight leg raising validity test (SLR) is not the sole criterion used to invalidate lumber range of motion findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">OAR 436-035-0007(12) (emphasis added). In this case, employer and SAIF have asserted that the <em>AMA Guides </em>\u201cdo not provide any particular validity criteria for z-ating the shoulder impairments.\u201d Claimant has not disputed that assertion.
