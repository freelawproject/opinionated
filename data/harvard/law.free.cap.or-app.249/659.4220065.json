J.</author>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Petitioners DK Entertainment, LLC, and David Kiraz, its managing member, (collectively, \u201clicensee\u201d) seek review of a final order of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) that cancelled licensee\u2019s license to sell alcoholic beverages, raising three assignments of error. We write to address only one of licensee\u2019s assignments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>viz., </em>that the OLCC erred in concluding that licensee permitted unlawful activity on its premises when one of licensee\u2019s dancers and one of its patrons allegedly engaged in an act of prostitution and, consequently, that licensee, through the actions of the dancer, had violated OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree with licensee and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We take the pertinent facts, which are undisputed, from the OLCC\u2019s final order and the record supporting the order. Licensee owns the Cabaret Lounge in downtown Portland and holds a license to sell alcohol there. A patron of the Cabaret Lounge paid one of licensee\u2019s dancers for a private erotic dance, during which the patron performed consensual oral sex on her. One of licensee\u2019s managers and another dancer both witnessed the sexual contact, and, after the dancer performing the dance had finished and collected the money from the patron, the manager removed the patron from the premises and told the dancer to leave because her dance had violated licensee\u2019s policy against sexual contact with patrons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Once outside, the patron waved down Portland Police Officer Schmautz and complained to him about having been physically removed from the club. Schmautz investigated the complaint, and, in the course of the investigation, the patron admitted to paying the dancer for a dance that included sexual contact and the dancer admitted to accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>his payment and allowing him to perform oral sex on her. Schmautz charged the dancer and the patron with prostitution \u2014 charges that were eventually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">After investigating the incident, the OLCC charged licensee with violating OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a) by permitting unlawful activity on the licensed premises when its dancer engaged in an act of prostitution. The OLCC consolidated that alleged violation with several others and proposed that, as a result of the all of the violations, licensee\u2019s license to serve alcohol be cancelled. The administrative law judge (ALJ) in licensee\u2019s ensuing contested case proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that licensee had committed all of the alleged violations and that cancellation of the license was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Shortly thereafter, the OLCC issued a final order that was consistent with the ALJ\u2019s proposed order, including the cancellation penalty. Specifically, as to the violation of OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a), the OLCC concluded that licensee had violated the rule, reasoning as follows: (1) To prove that licensee permitted unlawful activity, the evidence in the case had to satisfy two elements, <em>viz., </em>that licensee knew of the unlawful activity and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent or control it. (2) Under OAR 845-006-0362,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the knowledge and conduct of a servant, agent, or employee of a licensee may be imputed to the licensee to determine whether the licensee had the requisite knowledge and failed to take reasonable preventive action. (3) Therefore, because the evidence established that the dancer had engaged in an act of prostitution while working for licensee at the licensed premises, her knowledge of and failure to prevent her own unlawful activity was properly imputed to licensee, and, hence, licensee permitted the act of prostitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>On judicial review, licensee argues, among other things, that the OLCC\u2019s analysis, in which the agency attributed licensee\u2019s dancer\u2019s unlawful conduct to licensee to establish that licensee knew of the conduct and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent it, is not consistent with earlier OLCC decisions, and, therefore, under ORS 183.482(8)(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the OLCC must explain the inconsistency. As explained below, licensee\u2019s premise that the OLCC acted inconsistently with its precedent is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In <em>Don Juan\u2019s, </em>OLCC Final Order OLCC-88-V-003 (1988), the OLCC charged the licensee with violating a precursor rule that is equivalent to OAR 845-006~0347(3)(a) based on the actions of an on-duty bartender at Don Juan\u2019s who had delivered cocaine in the bar\u2019s parking lot to an undercover police officer. After setting out the two elements that had to be proved to establish that a licensee had permitted proscribed activity on the <em>premises </em>\u2014 viz., knowledge and failure to take reasonable preventive action \u2014 the OLCC explained the application of those elements when an on-duty employee is the person who has engaged in the proscribed activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">As to the knowledge element, the OLCC recognized that, under its precedent and rules, it \u201cmay impute to the licensee the knowledge of the licensee\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Therefore, notwithstanding the licensee\u2019s lack of actual knowledge of the cocaine sale, the bartender\u2019s participation in the sale proved that the bartender knew of the criminal activity, which the OLCC imputed to the licensee. <em>Id. </em>at 7. As to the licensee\u2019s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the criminal activity, the OLCC explained that, under its precedent and rules, a \u201clicensee is responsible where the licensee\u2019s employees fail to take such steps.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the bartender participated in the cocaine sale \u2014 and, therefore, <em>by definition </em>had not taken reasonable steps to prevent it \u2014 the OLCC concluded that the agency had established that element as to the licensee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the OLCC concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>that the licensee had permitted proscribed activity on its premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">More recently, in <em>Jiffy Mart, </em>OLCC Final Order OLCC-04-V-027 (2005), the OLCC charged the licensee with violating OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a) because an on-duty cashier at Jiffy Mart had sold marijuana in the store to an informant for the Tillamook County Drug Task Force. After recounting that the OLCC may impute a licensee\u2019s employee\u2019s knowledge to the licensee in determining whether the licensee permitted unlawful activity on its premises, the OLCC synthesized the principle running through its prior decisions regarding a licensee\u2019s failure to take reasonable preventive steps when an employee is the person who has engaged in the proscribed <em>activity </em>\u2014 viz., the OLCC \u201cneed not consider whether the wrongdoer took steps to prevent [his or her] own wrongful act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. In other words, the fact that a licensee\u2019s employee engaged in the unlawful activity is sufficient to prove that the licensee failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the unlawful activity. Accordingly, the OLCC concluded that the agency had proved that the licensee had permitted unlawful activity on its premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Notwithstanding the consistency of those two decisions, licensee contends that other OLCC decisions have applied an analysis that conflicts with the analysis in <em>Don Juan\u2019s </em>and <em>Jiffy Mart. </em>We conclude that none of those decisions conflicts with <em>Don Juan\u2019s </em>and <em>Jiffy Mart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">For example, licensee argues that <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill, </em>OLCC Final Order OLCC-09-V-027 (2009), is a conflicting decision. The OLCC charged the licensee in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill </em>with permitting unlawful activity on its premises because one of the licensee\u2019s security personnel had provided security services without the required certification to do so. In February 2008, 10 months before the incident involving the licensee\u2019s employee, an OLCC inspector had contacted the licensee to discuss whether all of the licensee\u2019s security personnel were properly certified. The licensee subsequently left a voice message with the inspector indicating that not all of the personnel were certified but that the licensee would promptly correct that.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In its final order, the OLCC laid out the operative principles consistently with those stated in <em>Don Juan\u2019s </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Jiffy Mart. </em>However, the OLCC then went on to analyze whether <em>the licensee </em>had known of the unlawful activity <em>in </em>February 2008 and had taken reasonable steps to prevent noncertified security personnel from providing security services at the bar <em>after </em>February 2008, concluding that the licensee had had the requisite knowledge in February 2008 and had failed to take reasonable preventive steps thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Licensee focuses on that aspect of the analysis, arguing that, under a consistent application of the principles in <em>Don Juan\u2019s </em>and <em>Jiffy Mart, </em>the OLCC in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill </em>should not have had to analyze whether <em>the licensee </em>had taken reasonable preventive steps because the licensee\u2019s on-duty employee was the wrongdoer. According to licensee\u2019s premise, if the OLCC were acting in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill </em>consistently with its earlier decisions, then it would simply have imputed the licensee\u2019s employee\u2019s knowledge and conduct to the licensee. Licensee, however, mistakes the OLCC\u2019s choice in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill </em>to focus on the licensee with an inconsistent application of the agency\u2019s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The facts in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill </em>markedly differed from those in other OLCC decisions involving violations of OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a). In <em>Interstate Bar &amp; Grill, </em>the licensee recognized that there were noncertified security personnel working on the premises 10 months before the OLCC learned of a specific instance of that proscribed activity. Based on the evidence proving that the licensee had permitted unlawful activity on the premises in February 2008, the OLCC did not have to impute the employee\u2019s knowledge and conduct to the licensee to prove the violation. And, given the permissive wording of OAR <em>845-006-0362 </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201c[e]ach licensee <em>may </em>be held responsible\u201d for its employees\u2019 actions (emphasis added) \u2014 the OLCC was free to rely in that situation on the licensee\u2019s knowledge and actions rather than those of the licensee\u2019s employee. Further, and most importantly, the OLCC contended that the licensee should receive a <em>greater penalty </em>based on the aggravating factor that the licensee had allowed the employee to work without certification \u2014 and thus violated OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a) \u2014 roughly 10 months <em>after </em>the licensee had become aware that its employees needed to be certified. Therefore, contrary to licensee\u2019s argument, the OLCC\u2019s choice in <em>Interstate Bar &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Grill </em>to focus on the licensee\u2019s knowledge and conduct is not inconsistent with its decisions in <em>Don Juan\u2019s </em>and <em>Jiffy Mart. </em>Licensee\u2019s proffered inconsistencies in another OLCC decision are similarly unavailing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the OLCC did not apply in this case an understanding of the term \u201cpermit\u201d in OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a) that is inconsistent with its application of the term in prior cases in which a licensee\u2019s on-duty employee has engaged in proscribed activity on licensed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> We reject licensee\u2019s other assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> OAR 845-006-0347(3)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">\u201cNo licensee or permittee will permit any unlawful activity on the licensed premises or in areas the licensee controls that are adjacent to or outside the premises.
