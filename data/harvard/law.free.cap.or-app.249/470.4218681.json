On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of a compensatory fine of $102,413.04, arguing that the amount of the fine is not supported by the evidentiary record. We disagree and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. After his retail shoe store went out of business, Savoy put his inventory\u2014 over 1,500 pairs of new shoes \u2014 in a warehouse. He planned to sell the shoes to another retailer. In the meantime, Savoy allowed defendant to sell small quantities of the shoes on an Internet auction site, and he allowed defendant access to the warehouse for that purpose. When Savoy brought a retailer to the warehouse to inspect the shoes as a prospective buyer, Savoy discovered that all of the shoes were gone. Defendant had taken the shoes and had sold them to secondhand stores. Some of the stolen shoes were recovered from the secondhand stores and returned to Savoy, but they had been removed from their original packaging and, as a result, could no longer be sold as new shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The state sought restitution for Savoy, as well as for the secondhand stores from which shoes were recovered. At the restitution hearing, the state presented Savoy\u2019s inventory records to establish the value of the shoes. The records showed the wholesale price Savoy had paid for each pair of shoes, as well as the final retail price Savoy had set for each pair before his store went out of business. According to the records, the wholesale prices Savoy had paid for the shoes totaled $106,024.29, and the retail prices he had set for the shoes totaled $175,202.20. Because Savoy was no longer in the retail shoe business, he testified that the wholesale prices of the shoes reflected the value of the shoes at the time they were stolen. That is, he testified that the shoes were worth what he had paid for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Savoy testified that, as a general matter, shoes tend to lose value over time, but he did not testify as to how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>quickly or how much, nor did he testify that the shoes in his inventory \u2014 all of which were less than a year old \u2014 had lost value. Instead, he reiterated, \u201cAll I have to go by is what I paid for these shoes. We can\u2019t argue that [they have] less or more value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">As mentioned, Savoy had a prospective buyer for his inventory. But because defendant stole the shoes before the buyer came to inspect them, the buyer never made an offer for the shoes. Savoy did not testify about how much he expected the offer to be. He did, however, testify that, after his store went out of business, he was \u201ctrying to move the shoes in any way possible,\u201d which included allowing defendant to sell a few pairs of shoes at a time on the Internet auction site for \u201canything we could get.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Based on Savoy\u2019s testimony and records, the state asked the trial court to order defendant to reimburse the amount Savoy had paid for the shoes. Specifically, the state argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201c[T]he crime that took place here resulted in economic damages to Mr. Savoy. Nobody disputes that Mr. Savoy paid $106,000 for those shoes. That\u2019s the best indicator of the value of his inventory, $106,000. Perhaps he\u2019d have sold them for 106. * * * Perhaps he would have sold them for 100. Perhaps he would have gotten the deal of his life and sold them for 200,000. That\u2019s not the * * * issue for today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cThe issue for today * * * is that to make Mr. Savoy whole, he requires a restitution amount of $106,000. That was the value of his * * * property at the time it was stolen. That\u2019s what he paid for it. And he had every intention of reselling it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Defendant countered that the court should not use Savoy\u2019s purchase price because the shoes had lost value and Savoy would not have been able to sell them for the same amount that he had paid for them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201c[W]hat we\u2019re asking you to impose is the fair market value of the merchandise that was taken. I know it\u2019s a hard figure to get to. I think that there\u2019s some indication that these shoes did have a value and that they may not have as much value as when they were bought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cI think that according to Mr. Savoy, over time the value declined. If he was going to get some kind of sale to another company for the retail, it would have been less than what he had paid [for them], I think [that] would be clear just from any kind of business knowledge. There\u2019s no way that you\u2019re getting back everything \u2014 the exact amount that you paid for those.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The trial court agreed with the state and determined that the amount Savoy had paid for the shoes, $106,024.29, reflected the value of the shoes at the time they were stolen. Because some of the shoes were recovered from the secondhand stores, the court determined that Savoy had not lost the full value of all the shoes; the recovered shoes still had some value, even though they could not be sold as new shoes. As the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201c[n]ow, as I understand it, a certain number of shoes were returned. Mr. Savoy says those shoes have no resale value. They obviously have some value. They\u2019re shoes. Whether they\u2019re donations and you can get a write-off or you can sell them on eBay for ten cents on the dollar, they have some value * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201c* * * I don\u2019t know what the value of those shoes are other than the amount that the [secondhand stores] said they were worth, and that is what they paid for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201cAnd so I am going to deduct that $3,600 from the 106, and my simple math comes to $102,400.1 realize there are some pennies that I\u2019m probably not accounting for, but that\u2019s a rounded figure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">In response to the court clerk\u2019s inquiry as to whether it would \u201cbe restitution or compensatory,\u201d the trial court answered, \u201cCompensatory fine. It\u2019s restitution to the [secondhand] stores and compensatory fine to Mr. Savoy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of the compensatory fine. As in the trial court, defendant does not dispute that Savoy suffered economic damages; he disputes only the amount of those damages. He asserts that, as a general matter, a court cannot order a defendant to pay a victim a compensatory fine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>exceeds the victim\u2019s economic damages, and he further asserts that, in this particular case, the compensatory fine that the court ordered him to pay Savoy exceeds Savoy\u2019s economic damages. According to defendant, to calculate Savoy\u2019s economic damages, the court needed to determine the market value of the shoes at the time they were stolen, and the court erred in doing so because, by relying on the price Savoy had paid for the shoes, it failed to account for both the shoes\u2019 depreciation and Savoy\u2019s eagerness to sell them. He argues that the market value of the shoes at the time they were stolen</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">\u201cwould have been significantly less than [the] amount [Savoy had] paid for the shoes. [Savoy] himself testified that * * * shoes lose value over time and that he had been \u2018trying to move the shoes in any way possible\u2019 and for \u2018anything [he] could get\u2019 after the closure of his store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In response, the state argues that, although a victim must have suffered economic damages in order to receive a compensatory fine, the amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages does not limit the amount of the compensatory fine that the victim may receive. In other words, according to the state, a trial court can order a defendant to pay a victim a compensatory fine that exceeds the victim\u2019s economic damages. In the state\u2019s view, \u201c[o]nce the existence of economic damages [has] been established, [a court is] free to impose a compensatory fine up to the maximum amount allowable for the offense for which defendant was convicted.\u201d The statutory maximum fine for defendant\u2019s crime of conviction \u2014 aggravated theft, a Class B felony \u2014 is $250,000. ORS 164.057(2); ORS 161.625(l)(c). Therefore, the state argues, the trial court could have imposed a compensatory fine of up to $250,000, regardless of the amount of Savoy\u2019s economic damages. Alternatively, the state argues that, even if the amount of a compensatory fine is limited by the amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages, the compensatory fine the trial court imposed did not exceed Savoy\u2019s economic damages. According to the state, \u201cthere was ample evidence that [Savoy] suffered economic damages \u2014 and that those damages were in the amount the court imposed as a compensatory fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As explained below, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that Savoy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>economic damages were $102,413.04, and therefore, even assuming that those damages limited the amount of the compensatory fine that the trial court could impose, imposition of the $102,413.04 compensatory fine was not error. Accordingly, we do not reach the state\u2019s argument that the court could have imposed a compensatory fine in any amount up to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">We begin our analysis with the relevant statutes. ORS 137.101(1) governs compensatory fines. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">\u201cWhenever the court imposes a fine as penalty for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the person injured by the act constituting the crime has a remedy by civil action, unless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided in a civil case arising out of the same act and transaction, the court may order that the defendant pay any portion of the fine separately to the clerk of the court as compensatory fines in the case. The clerk shall pay over to the injured victim or victims, as directed in the court\u2019s order, moneys paid to the court as compensatory fines under this subsection. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Thus, a trial court may order a defendant to pay a compensatory fine to a victim if the defendant\u2019s crime resulted in an injury for which the victim has a remedy by civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">ORS 137.103(4)(a) defines \u201cvictim,\u201d as relevant here, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201c[t]he person against whom the defendant committed the criminal offense, if the court determines that the person has suffered economic damages as a result of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u201cEconomic damages,\u201d in turn, are defined by ORS 137.103(2), which, with exceptions not relevant here, incorporates the definition in ORS 31.710(2)(a). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">\u201c \u2018Economic damages\u2019 means objectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to reasonable charges necessarily incurred for medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services, burial and memorial expenses, loss of income and past and future impairment of earning capacity, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for substitute domestic services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>recurring loss to an estate, damage to reputation that is economically verifiable, reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property and reasonable costs incurred for repair or for replacement of damaged property, whichever is less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u201cIn light of those statutes, we have held that the prerequisites for imposition of a compensatory fine are: (1) criminal activities, (2) economic damages, and (3) a causal relationship between the two.\u201d <em>State v. Haines, </em>238 Or App 431, 436, 242 P3d 705 (2010) (citing <em>State v. Donahue, </em>165 Or App 143, 146, 995 P2d 1202 (2000)). As mentioned, defendant does not dispute that he engaged in criminal activities that caused Savoy economic damages; he disputes only the amount of the economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Economic damages are damages that would be \u201crecoverable against the defendant in a civil action.\u201d <em>State v. Barkley, </em>315 Or 420, 438, 846 P2d 390, <em>cert den, </em>510 US 837 (1993) (so holding with respect to \u201cpecuniary damages\u201d (now \u201ceconomic damages\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>)); <em>State v. Dillon, </em>292 Or 172, 182, 637 P2d 602 (1981) (the term \u201cpecuniary damages\u201d encompasses two requirements; the damages \u201cmust be special, not general, and they must be damages which could be recovered against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting defendant\u2019s criminal activities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Savoy would have a civil action for conversion against defendant. <em>See Mustola v. Toddy, </em>253 Or 658, 663, 456 P2d 1004 (1969) (\u201cConversion is an intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel which so seriously interferes with the right of another to control it that the actor may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>justly be required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). \u201cThe measure of damages for conversion of personal property is the reasonable market value [of the property] at the time it was taken.\u201d <em>State v. Wise, </em>150 Or App 449, 455, 946 P2d 363 (1997); <em>see also State v. Callaghan, </em>33 Or App 49, 58, 576 P2d 14, <em>rev den, </em>284 Or 1 (1978) (in a criminal theft case, the relevant \u201cmarket value\u201d is \u201cthe value in the market in which the goods were being traded, namely, the price at which they probably would have been sold in the regular course of business at the time when and place where they were stolen\u201d). Therefore, to properly calculate Savoy\u2019s economic damages, the trial court had to first determine the market value of the shoes at the time that defendant stole them.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The market value of an item can be established through an owner\u2019s testimony, \u201cunless it is shown that he has no knowledge of the market value of his property in spite of his ownership.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Worldwide Imports, Inc., </em>238 Or 580, 587, 395 P2d 922 (1964). It can also be established through evidence of the asking price of the item. <em>Callaghan, </em>33 Or App at 58. Evidence regarding the market value of property need not be exact; for example, we have held that evidence that an item of property had a value between $18,000 and $22,000 was sufficient for a trial court to find that the property had a value of $18,000 and to impose restitution in that amount. <em>State v. Yocum, </em>247 Or App 507, 514, 269 P3d 113 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">As described above, the trial court determined that the market value of the shoes at the time defendant stole them was the price that Savoy had paid for them. Defendant argues that the record is insufficient to support that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The market value of property is ultimately a factual matter, and we review a trial court\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are \u201csupported by evidence in the record.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 138.222(5)(a). More specifically, when reviewing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>trial court\u2019s factual finding regarding the value of stolen property, our task is to determine whether the finding is supported by \u201cany\u201d evidence in the record. <em>Yocum, </em>247 Or App at 514; <em>see also Helmer v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., </em>279 Or 457, 464, 569 P2d 10 (1977) (where the trial judge is the trier of fact, \u201cthe award of damages must be affirmed if it finds any support in the evidence\u201d); <em>Eden Gate, Inc. v. D &amp;L Excavating &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>178 Or App 610, 619, 37 P3d 233 (2002) (reviewing the amount of compensatory damages in a civil case for \u201cany evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Defendant argues that \u201cthe state offered no evidence of the actual market value of the shoes.\u201d We disagree. The undisputed evidence was that Savoy planned to sell the shoes to another shoe retailer; thus, the trial court could reasonably infer that the shoes were in the wholesale market and that the price Savoy had paid for the shoes when he bought them in that market continued to represent their value in that market. Indeed, Savoy \u2014 as the owner of the shoes \u2014 testified that the price he had paid for the shoes represented their value. On the record in this case, that testimony alone was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination of Savoy\u2019s economic damages. <em>Lewis, </em>238 Or at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In arguing that it was error for the trial court to rely on the price that Savoy had paid for the shoes as their market value, defendant emphasizes the fact that Savoy himself testified that, as a general matter, the value of shoes declines over time. But, as mentioned, Savoy did not testify how quickly shoes tend to lose value, nor did he testify that any of the shoes in his inventory had, in fact, lost value. Thus, nothing in the record compels a finding that the shoes defendant stole \u2014 all of which were less than a year old \u2014 would have declined in value. In other words, Savoy\u2019s general testimony that shoes decline in value over time did not preclude the trial court from relying on Savoy\u2019s specific testimony that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>price he had paid for the shoes represented their value at the time they were stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Defendant also emphasizes the fact that Savoy was eager to sell the shoes. As we understand it, defendant\u2019s argument is that the trial court erred in finding that the market value of the shoes was their wholesale market value, as opposed to their liquidation market value. We reject that argument because the court could find, based on Savoy\u2019s testimony, that Savoy intended to reintroduce the shoes into the wholesale market and that the value of the shoes in that market had not changed since he bought them.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In sum, there was evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the market value of the stolen shoes was what Savoy had paid for them and, therefore, the court did not err in concluding that Savoy suffered economic damages in that amount (minus the market value of the shoes that were recovered) and imposing a compensatory fine for those economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> In the judgment, the court imposed a compensatory fine of $102,413.04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\"> In 2005, the legislature amended the definition of victim \u2014 found at ORS 107.103(4) \u2014 for purposes of the compensatory fine statute to refer to a person who suffered \u201ceconomic damages\u201d as a result of the defendant\u2019s offense. Or Laws 2005, ch 564, \u00a7 1. Before those amendments, that definition referred to \u201cpecuniary damages,\u201d which were defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201call special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities and shall include, but not be limited to, the money equivalent of property taken, destroyed, broken or otherwise harmed, and losses such as medical expenses and costs of psychological treatment or counseling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">ORS 137.103(2) (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> To be clear, a trial court\u2019s finding of the value of property is a factual matter, resulting from the application of a legal test. Whether a court employed the correct legal test is a question of law, which we review for errors of law. Barkley, 315 Or at 438 (the trial court erred in imposing a compensatory fine for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>child-victim\u2019s mother where there was no theory of civil liability under which the mother could recover her lost wages from the defendant); <em>State v.

In this case, the parties and court focused on the correct legal test: the market value of the shoes at the time they were stolen. <em>See Wise, </em>150 Or App at 455 (stating that legal test).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
