In exchange for his plea, the trial court dismissed two charges of first-degree theft that alleged that defendant had improperly claimed unemployment benefits while he was employed. The court later entered a supplemental judgment under ORS 137.106(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ordering defendant to pay restitution in the amount of the unemployment benefits that he had unlawfully received and, pursuant to ORS 657.310, 12 percent interest on the judgment for that amount. Defendant appeals the supplemental judgment, contending that the court erred in ordering him to pay 12 percent interest on the judgment because that is not part of the economic damages that the victim \u2014 the Oregon Employment Department \u2014 suffered as a result of his actions. The state concedes the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The concession is well taken. For purposes of determining \u201cthe full amount of [a] victim\u2019s economic damages\u201d under ORS 137.106(l)(b), the court may consider the \u201cdamages recoverable in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting [the] crime [for which the defendant was convicted].\u201d <em>State v. Carson, </em>238 Or App 188, 192, 243 P3d 73 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the damages that can be awarded to a victim in a civil action and the economic damages recoverable as restitution are not necessarily coextensive. <em>See State v. Dillon, </em>292 Or 172, 179, 637 P2d 602 (1981) (\u201c[Restitution was clearly not intended to be the equivalent of a civil award.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ORS 657.310(4) and (5) provide that a judgment entered in a civil action brought by the Director of the Employment Department against a person who has improperly received employment benefits shall include an award of one percent monthly interest on the judgment. However, the economic damages that can be awarded as restitution are limited to \u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses\u201d resulting from defendant\u2019s actions. <em>See </em>ORS 31.710; ORS 137.103(2)(a). The interest that the department would be entitled to receive under ORS 657.310(4) and (5) on a judgment against defendant is not such a loss. Accordingly, the court erred in ordering defendant to pay 12 percent interest as part of the restitution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\"> ORS 137.106(1) provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court * * * evidence of the nature and amount of the damages.
