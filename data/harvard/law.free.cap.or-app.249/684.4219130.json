First, defendant argues that the court was required to deny the state\u2019s restitution request because the state failed to present sufficient evidence from which the court could determine the amount of the insurance companies\u2019 actual economic damages, if any. Second, defendant argues that, even if the trial court was not required to deny the request, it was required to continue the restitution hearing until the state could present sufficient evidence of the amount of the insurance companies\u2019 actual economic damages, if any. Because we conclude that defendant did not preserve her appellate arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The relevant facts are few. While under the influence of controlled substances, defendant \u201cweaved into the oncoming lane of traffic and crashed head-on into the victim, [Allen].\u201d Allen was injured, and the car she was driving was damaged. Defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010, and fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160. At sentencing, the trial court ordered restitution in an amount to be determined within 90 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">At the restitution hearing, the state presented evidence that Allen personally incurred expenses of $2,489.25. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The state also presented a payment ledger and a letter indicating that Farmers Insurance and State Farm Insurance had advanced payments totaling $49,392.23 and $10,000, respectively, for Allen\u2019s medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Defendant\u2019s attorney told the court that defendant was willing to stipulate to an order of restitution for the expenses that Allen personally had incurred, \u201cbut not as to State Farm and Farmers, which ought to be resolved through * * * the civil system.\u201d He later reiterated that defendant was willing to reimburse Allen\u2019s expenses, but that \u201cthe Court ought to let the civil system handle\u201d State Farm\u2019s and Farmers\u2019 expenses. He argued that, although State Farm and Farmers were \u201cvictims\u201d under the restitution statutes, <em>see </em>ORS 137.103(4)(d), the court should not order defendant to pay restitution to them because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cwe don\u2019t have any evidence here. They haven\u2019t even asked for restitution. We have some payment ledgers from them. But they\u2019re in the business of collecting premiums and paying out on claims. If they don\u2019t do that they\u2019re out of business. That\u2019s just part of the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Defendant\u2019s attorney also pointed out that there were ongoing negotiations between defendant\u2019s insurance company and the victim\u2019s insurance companies, and he asserted that the proper approach was to have \u201cthe insurance company Inter-Company Arbitration System handle this, and not have it ordered as restitution to State Farm and Farmers, paid out of my client\u2019s pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">When asked by the trial court, the prosecutor confirmed that defendant\u2019s insurance company was still negotiating with the victim\u2019s insurance companies. The prosecutor added that, if there were to be an insurance payment after the restitution hearing, the restitution order could be amended to reflect the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">At the end of the hearing, the trial court noted that the restitution statute required it to order restitution in the full amount proved by the state unless the victim \u201cconsents otherwise.\u201d ORS 137.106(1)(c)(B). The court further noted that there was no \u201cconsent from the insurance companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>otherwise.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered restitution in the amounts requested by the state. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">\u201cI am reluctant * * * to order an amount now that is going to change the negotiating power of the insurance companies, because they pretty much deal with each other at arm\u2019s length and equal bargaining strength, and that really * * * is the preferable way to * * * resolve this kind of thing. But, under the statute, I just don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">As mentioned, defendant appeals, arguing that, for two reasons, the trial court erred by imposing restitution. First, defendant argues that the trial court erred by imposing restitution because the state failed to present sufficient evidence from which the court could conclude that the victim\u2019s insurance companies had actually suffered economic damages in the amounts sought as restitution. Second, and alternatively, defendant argues that the trial court erred by imposing restitution instead of continuing the restitution hearing. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that defendant\u2019s appellate arguments are unpreserved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As we understand it, defendant\u2019s sole argument below was that the trial court should not order restitution to the victim\u2019s insurance companies but, instead, should \u201clet the civil system\u201d handle the victim\u2019s insurance companies\u2019 losses. Thus, defendant\u2019s argument concerned the proper mechanism for reimbursement to the victim\u2019s insurance companies, not the amount of that reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">That argument is materially different from defendant\u2019s first argument on appeal, which is that, because defendant\u2019s insurance company was still negotiating with the victim\u2019s insurance companies at the time of the restitution hearing, \u201cthe amounts due to [the victim\u2019s insurance companies]\u201d were \u201cmatters of pure speculation.\u201d In other words, according to defendant, the amounts due \u201cto those companies [were] * * * simply unknowable\u201d at the time of the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Defendant\u2019s attorney did not make that argument in the trial court. Although he asserted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>evidence here,\u201d he conceded that \u201c[w]e have some payment ledgers from [the insurance companies].\u201d He did not argue that the information reflected in the payment ledgers was legally insufficient to determine the amount of the insurance companies\u2019 economic damages. He did not argue that the amount of their economic damages was speculative or unas-certainable. Instead, he argued only that settlement of those damages should be handled by \u201cthe civil system,\u201d and, in support of that argument, he noted that defendant\u2019s insurance company was already working with the victim\u2019s insurance companies within that system. Thus, although defendant\u2019s attorney referred to the ongoing negotiations, we do not understand that reference to have been an argument that the court could not determine the victim\u2019s insurance companies\u2019 economic damages \u2014 and, therefore, could not impose restitution \u2014 until the negotiations were complete. Thus, we conclude that defendant\u2019s first argument on appeal is unpreserved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We readily reach the same conclusion with respect to defendant\u2019s second argument on appeal, which, as mentioned, is that the trial court erred by not continuing the restitution hearing until after the insurance companies\u2019 negotiations were complete. We do so because defendant never asked the trial court to continue the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Defendant contends that, because the trial court knew that the insurance companies were in negotiations, it was on notice that it could not determine the amount of restitution, if any, due to the victim\u2019s insurance company. But, as explained, defendant did not argue that the amount of restitution due to the victim\u2019s insurance companies was speculative or unknowable until the negotiations were complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> As relevant to this case, ORS 137.106 provides that, if a court finds that a defendant has committed a crime that has resulted in economic damages to a victim, the court shall require the defendant to pay the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages unless the victim consents to payment of a lesser amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> The restitution hearing was held more than 90 days after the plea hearing. Defendant objected, arguing that the state had failed to establish good cause for the late hearing as required by ORS 137.106(l)(b). The trial court overruled the objection. On appeal, defendant does not assign error to that ruling. Therefore, we do not review it. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cA question or issue to be decided on appeal shall be raised in the form of an assignment of error.\u201d); <em>Confederated Tribes (Siletz) v. Employment Dept., </em>165 Or App 65, 81 n 8, 995 P2d580 (2000) (declining to consider an argument advanced in a footnote in the appellant\u2019s brief because, \u201c[i]n order to preserve the alleged error, [the appellant] was required to assign error in its opening brief to [the ruling at issue]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> In addition, we reject, without discussion, defendant\u2019s arguments that the alleged errors are reviewable as plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> Furthermore, the trial court did not understand defendant\u2019s attorney to argue that, at the time of the restitution hearing, the companies\u2019 economic damages were speculative and unascertainable because of the ongoing negotiations. As the trial court understood it, the ongoing negotiations were relevant to whether the companies might consent to less than full restitution, not whether they were entitled to full restitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
