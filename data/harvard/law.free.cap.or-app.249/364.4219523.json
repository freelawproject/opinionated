J.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of third-degree rape. ORS 163.355.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in permitting the investigating detective to comment on the credibility of defendant and the complainant. We agree with defendant that the trial court plainly erred and that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The case arises out of allegations that defendant, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was 14 years old. Based on that allegation, defendant was charged with third-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">During the trial, both defendant and the complainant testified. The complainant described the events on the day in question and stated that she and defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse. Defendant, on the other hand, testified that he had not engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant. Staples, a detective who investigated the case, also testified. According to Staples, in his interview with the complainant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c[she] told me that she knows [defendant] and that she has known him for a couple of years and that on May 3rd, 2009, that she saw him down at the Salem Center Mall. They started talking \u2014 this was about 3 p.m. or so \u2014 they started talking, hanging out together as she described this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201cShe stated eventually throughout the day, gotten into the evening about 8 o\u2019clock or so, they walked down to where the stern-wheeler is docked, started walking down under the ramp. And they had a conversation about whether * * * or not she wanted to have sex. She agreed to have sex with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201cThey went under the * * * dock and had sexual intercourse. She stated that [defendant] wore a * * * condom and that after the intercourse, he told her not to say anything to any of his friends. And I asked why, and she said she was\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>because of her age, basically. And that after the intercourse, they continued to hang out together and eventually went to a friend\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">With regard to the interview, the prosecutor asked Staples to \u201cdescribe [the complainant\u2019s] demeanor while she was talking about this\u201d and whether there was \u201canything that kind of raised any flags for\u201d Staples. He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cThat raised any flags, no. She was somewhat giddy about this and felt that he was going to be her new boyfriend. She was somewhat excited about this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Staples also testified regarding his interview with defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cHe stated that [on Sunday, May 3] they hung out together in the downtown mall area for approximately an hour. He stated that he then left and didn\u2019t remember what they did after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did he indicate to you when he left whether or not [the complainant] was with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">\u201cA. He said they only hung out for about an hour and then that was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. So then what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">\u201cA. I asked him if he had ever had sexual intercourse with her and he said, no, he didn\u2019t. I asked him if he went down to the \u2014 to where the stern-wheeler was docked, that area at the park, and he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">\u201cI then asked him if he was sure because we possibly had video of him down there at that area, which we did not; it was a ruse to try and see if he would admit to being there. He then said that he didn\u2019t really remember where he was at and he was not sure if he was in the park or not. I then asked again if he had, in fact, had sexual intercourse with her, and he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\"><em>% </em>\u00ed|\u00ed <em>ifc</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">\u201cQ. Okay. So at this point, then, what was your impression about his honesty in the investigation so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-16\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t think that he was being very honest and upfront.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">\u201cQ. Okay. So what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cA. At this time I * * * asked him again, you know, did you have sex with her, and he stated: I swear to God I didn\u2019t have sex with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cTo me that\u2019s an indication that somebody is not being truthful. I\u2019ve gone to several classes on interview and interrogation and there are certain phrases that are said and that\u2019s one of the phrases of an indication if somebody is being less than truthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cQ. Is that consistent with your experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cA. Yes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Later, when the detective informed defendant that he was under arrest, \u201c[h]e started yelling and * * * crying. Basically saying all I did was smoke dope with her; that he did not have sexual relations with her.\u201d Throughout the entire interview, defendant \u201cdenied any type of sexual contact or activity altogether.\u201d Ultimately, defendant was found guilty and convicted of third-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Staples to comment on the credibility of the complainant and defendant. He asserts that Staples\u2019s statement that nothing about complainant\u2019s statement \u201craised any flags\u201d was an impermissible comment on her credibility. Additionally, he contends that the detective\u2019s statements regarding his view of defendant\u2019s honesty were \u201ca direct comment on * * * credibility\u201d and should have been excluded. Defendant concedes that he failed to preserve his assignments of error before the trial court but asks us to review them as plain error under ORAP 5.45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state responds that the trial court did not commit plain error and, in the alternative, that we should decline to exercise our discretion to address defendant\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">An error is plain if it is a legal error that is obvious or not reasonably in dispute and the court need not go outside the record or select among competing inferences to discern it. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). If we conclude that an asserted error is plain, we must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>whether to exercise our discretion to address the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that the trial court committed plain error in admitting Staples\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s credibility and, therefore, do not discuss the detective\u2019s comments relating to the complainant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Under Oregon law, \u201ca witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983); see <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629-30, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (\u201c[t]he assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact\u201d and an \u201copinion that a person is not deceptive, could not lie without being tripped up, and would not betray a friend\u201d is tantamount to an opinion on credibility and inadmissible); <em>see also State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 285, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (\u201c[A] witness may not testify about the credibility of another witness.\u201d). \u201cApplying that principle is a straightforward matter when one witness states directly that he or she believes another witness, or that the other witness is honest or truthful. However, statements that fall short of such overt vouching also may be impermissible.\u201d <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 357, 234 P3d 117 (2010); <em>see also State v. Ferguson, </em>247 Or App 747, 271 P3d 150 (2012) (witness\u2019s statement that he would not have called the police if he had not believed complaining witness was an impermissible comment on credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Here, at least with respect to the detective\u2019s statements relating to defendant, the testimony constitutes a direct comment on defendant\u2019s credibility. Indeed, the state does not dispute that Staples\u2019s statement regarding defendant was a comment on credibility. Instead, the state asserts that the admission of that testimony does not qualify for plain error review because the court would have to choose between competing inferences \u2014 \u201cone of which is that defendant made a conscious decision not to object\u201d to the testimony \u2014 to decide the issue. <em>See State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 169-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (where the record raises an inference that a defendant may have chosen not to object for strategic reasons, there is no plain error). According to the state, among other things, the cross-examination of the detective regarding \u201cwhy a suspect might lie during a police interview,\u201d defendant\u2019s attempts during trial to \u201cdraw the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>attention to the [complainant\u2019s] tendency to exaggerate feelings about defendant and other people,\u201d and the cross-examination of the complainant regarding \u201cwhether she was making things up\u201d support the inference that defendant made a strategic choice not to object to the detective\u2019s statements regarding his credibility. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">None of the portions of the record to which the state refers supports an inference that defendant had a strategic reason for failing to object. Rather, the cited portions constitute only attempts to explain the inconsistent parts of defendant\u2019s statements to Staples during the interview and to discredit the complainant\u2019s version of the facts. As we stated in <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 512, 228 P3d 688 (2010), \u201c \u2018competing inferences,\u2019 for purposes of plain error analysis, must be plausible \u2014 and the inference that the state posits is not plausible.\u201d In sum, we agree with defendant that admission of the detective\u2019s comments on defendant\u2019s credibility constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In determining whether to exercise our discretion to correct such an error, we consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cthe competing interest of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Here, the gravity of the error and the ends of justice require that we exercise our discretion to correct the error. The state asserts that we should decline to do so because defendant testified that he had lied to Staples and, therefore, the detective\u2019s testimony was cumulative and \u201clikely had little if any effect on the verdict.\u201d We disagree. Defendant did not, in fact, testify that his entire statement to Staples was a lie, nor did he state that he lied when he repeatedly denied having engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant. Instead, defendant testified that, when the detective questioned him about how long he had been with the complainant on the day in question, defendant wanted to \u201ckeep [him]self away from the park\u201d because he knew he had \u201csmoked weed around a minor * * * and [he] was afraid [that he] was going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>to get in trouble for it.\u201d None of defendant\u2019s testimony regarding being untruthful with the officer during the interview related to his statements that he did not have sex with the complainant. Staples\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, was that he believed that defendant was lying to him and that, based on Staples\u2019s training and experience, defendant\u2019s statement that he \u201csw[ore] to God\u201d that he did not have sex with the complainant clearly indicated that he was being untruthful. In a case that boiled down, in large part, to a credibility contest between the complainant and defendant, evidence commenting on the credibility of either was likely to be harmful. That the officer\u2019s testimony was couched in terms of his expertise in identifying untruthfulness \u2014 that he had attended \u201cseveral classes on interview and interrogation\u201d and, based on that training and experience, he could identify the phrasing used by defendant as indicating that defendant was lying when he denied having sex with the complainant\u2014 only increases the significant risk that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected. Furthermore, the impact of possible erroneous conviction is significant. A conviction for third-degree rape is a felony that carries with it, among other things, the consequence that defendant must register as a sex offender pursuant to ORS 181.594 to 181.596. In light of those considerations, we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in admitting that testimony. <em>See State v. Gonzales, </em>241 Or App 353, 360-61, 250 P3d 418, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 571 (2011) (exercising discretion to correct error in admitting evidence that constituted impermissible vouching for complaining witnesses under Lupoli); <em>see also Milbradt, </em>305 Or at 630 (\u201cWe suggest in the future that if counsel attempts to elicit [testimony commenting on the credibility of a witness] the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it.\u201d); <em>State v. McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 520, 776 P2d 1304 (1989) (\u201c[T]he trial court had a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>not to allow testimony which commented on a witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Pursuant to ORS 163.355(1), \u201c[a] person commits the crime of rape in the third degree if the person has sexual intercourse with another person under 16 years of age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\"> We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s assignment of error raised in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Under ORAP 5.45(1), \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b392-5\">EDMONDS, S. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In this case, Detective Staples commented directly on the credibility of defendant\u2019s prearrest statements without objection from defendant. Based on existing precedents, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the failure of the trial court to <em>sua sponte </em>strike Staples\u2019s testimony commenting on defendant\u2019s credibility is error apparent on the face of the record. However, as amplified below, I write separately to express my discomfort with a rule of law that appears to require trial courts to intervene <em>sua sponte </em>and strike testimony without the benefit of an objection or a motion from a party in order to avoid error and the reversal of a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">As defendant acknowledges, the claim of error made on appeal was not preserved in the trial court. But for the \u201cplain error\u201d exception in ORAP 5.45(1), defendant\u2019s claim of error would not be reviewable. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cplain error\u201d exists on the record before us in light of the language in <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), and <em>State v. McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 776 P2d 1304 (1989). In <em>Milbradt, </em>the court emphasized, \u201cWe suggest in the future that if counsel attempts to elicit similar testimony [(counsel had asked a psychologist what evidence of deception the witness discerned from the witness\u2019s evaluation),] the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it.\u201d 305 Or at 630. In <em>McQuisten, </em>the defendant moved to strike statements made by an officer that the complaining witness was telling the truth. The trial court denied the motion, and, on reconsideration, we reversed and remanded for a new trial. Relying on <em>Milbradt, </em>we pointed out that \u201cthe trial court had a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>to not allow testimony which commented on a witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>McQuisten, </em>97 Or App at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">What makes the application of the foregoing precedents uncomfortable is that defendant admitted in his opening statement that he had lied to the officer. In that statement, defense counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate you being here. The first thing Mr. Lowell would like you to know is that he did not have sexual intercourse with [the complainant]. This is going to be a case that there\u2019s not going to be any physical evidence. What you will hear today is that indeed Mr. Lowell did initially lie to the police, but in his mind, he had good reason to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cHe was with [the complainant] and he was smoking pot. And he knew that was illegal and he knew he should not be doing it. You are going to hear all about that from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cFurther, the thing that he wants you to know is that he has remained consistent in his assertion that he did not have sex with her. The officer questioned him over and over and over again, and he remained consistent that he did not have sex with her * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cIn fact, you will hear in an audiotape where he asserts that over and over and over and over. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to hear today is Mr. Lowell telling you over and over and over again that he did not have sex with [the complainant].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Based on defendant\u2019s opening statement, the state argues that it is reasonable to infer that defendant made a strategic decision not to object to Staples\u2019s testimony. As further support for that argument, the state points to defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Staples about why a suspect might lie during a police interview and of the complainant regarding her credibility. In closing argument, defendant again reiterated his position that the complainant had fantasized or lied about having sex with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The state\u2019s argument is predicated on the legal proposition that, where there are competing inferences \u2014 one of which is that a party made a conscious decision not to object \u2014 then the \u201capparent error on the record\u201d exception is inapplicable and should not be utilized by a reviewing court. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 130 P3d 780 (2006). The majority rejects the state\u2019s argument, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cNone of the portions of the record to which the state refers supports an inference that defendant had a strategic reason for failing to object. Rather, the cited portions constitute only attempts to explain the inconsistent parts of defendant\u2019s statements to Staples during the interview and to discredit the complainant\u2019s version of the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">249 Or App at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">I agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning. It cannot be reasonably inferred that, by attempting to minimize the effect on the jury of his inconsistent statements to Staples, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>defendant\u2019s strategy was to not object to Staples\u2019s comments regarding defendant\u2019s credibility. That said, however, it is apparent from a reading of the entire record that both parties considered it fair game to offer any evidence that was probative of whether the complaining witness or defendant was telling the truth about whether sexual intercourse occurred. Indeed, Staples testified, at one point without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. So at this point, then, what was your impression about his honesty in the investigation so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t think that he was being very honest and upfront.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. So what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cA. At this time, I \u2014 I asked him again, you know, did you have sex with her, and he stated: I swear to God I didn\u2019t have sex with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cTo me, that\u2019s an indication that somebody is not being truthful. I\u2019ve gone to several classes on interview and interrogation and there are certain phrases that are said and that\u2019s one of the phrases of an indication if somebody is being less than truthful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">If defendant had made a timely objection to the above testimony, the trial court could have explored with the lawyers why they believed that the testimony was properly admissible or inadmissible. Defendant\u2019s failure to object and his silence in this case prevented the trial court from making an assessment or a record regarding whether the testimony should have been admitted in light of the opening statement and all the other evidence in the case. In general terms, the application of the \u201cplain error\u201d rule under these circumstances permits defendants to lie in ambush and to obtain reversal based on a claim of error regarding an issue that apparently neither party cared about at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In summary, this court is an \u201cerror-correcting\u201d court, and its obligation is to follow precedents as established by the Supreme Court. Moreover, the state does not advance any persuasive reason why the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, as defined by its existing construct, does not apply. Nonetheless, my ultimate point is that the Supreme Court should refine the \u201cplain error\u201d rule by establishing specific parameters so that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>limited to circumstances where it can be demonstrated by the proponent of the use of the rule that the rule\u2019s underlying policy is served by its use. Under the current state of the law, it behooves defendants to insert error into the record at the trial level by remaining silent in order to avoid any curative efforts by trial courts or to benefit from their own ignorance of the law in order to assert a claim of plain error for the first time on appeal as a basis for reversal. The court should revisit the policies underlying preservation and \u201cplain error\u201d and define them clearly for the benefit of bench and bar. It is that belief that is at the core of my discomfort and has prompted the writing of a separate opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
