Jurisdiction was based on allegations that father had left the child with his paternal grandmother without communicating with the Department of Human Services (DHS) \u2014 which had \u201ctemporary custody\u201d of the child \u2014 and that he was unwilling to work or communicate with DHS. Father argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred in asserting jurisdiction because the state failed to prove that the child was endangered as a result of those conditions or circumstances. The state concedes the error. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. ORS 419B.100(l)(c) (authorizing jurisdiction where the juvenile\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the [juvenile] or of others\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse on that basis and do not address father\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
