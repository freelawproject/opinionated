ORS 161.435. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal and its admission of testimony from a state\u2019s witness who invoked his privilege against self-incrimination during cross-examination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Because the case arises, in part, from defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 658 n 1, 239 P3d 226 (2010). Defendant was arrested for, among other things, attempting to run over Clackamas County Deputy Sheriff Moss with his car. Moss was the only witness to that incident. While in custody at the Clackamas County Jail, defendant met Piatt, who at the time was a member of a motorcycle gang called the Outsiders Motorcycle Club (the Outsiders). The Outsiders derives its income from illicit activities. Piatt was an \u201cenforcer,\u201d who enforced the Outsiders\u2019s rules and \u201cstraightened out\u201d people who were violating its guidelines. After learning that Piatt would be released from jail soon, defendant, who knew of Piatt\u2019s role in the Outsiders, solicited Piatt to murder Moss so she would not testify at his trial. Unbeknownst to defendant, Piatt was a police informant and notified Clackamas County detectives about defendant\u2019s solicitation. Piatt\u2019s conversation with detectives was recorded onto a DVD.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Moss testified against defendant at trial, and defendant was subsequently convicted of various charges that are unrelated to this appeal. After that trial, the state charged defendant with one of the crimes pertinent to this case, solicitation to commit aggravated murder of Moss. Piatt testified before the grand jury, and his name was listed as a witness on defendant\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Defendant also learned about the DVD showing Piatt\u2019s interview with the detectives. While awaiting trial for the solicitation charge, defendant met another inmate, Van Alstine, who was scheduled for release. Defendant repeatedly talked to Van Alstine about Piatt being in a biker gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and how Piatt had \u201cratted him out\u201d at his previous trial. Those conversations took place over several days, until defendant asked Van Alstine if he would retrieve and deliver to the Outsiders the indictment showing Piatt\u2019s name as a witness and the DVD showing detectives interviewing Piatt. Defendant told Van Alstine that, once the Outsiders saw the video, \u201cthey were going to take care of their own.\u201d Defendant told Van Alstine that the Outsiders \u201cwould take care of Barry Piatt\u201d and would \u201cget rid\u201d of him. Defendant explained to Van Alstine that he wanted the Outsiders to have the DVD \u201cso Barry Piatt doesn\u2019t show up to court.\u201d Defendant promised to give Van Alstine his sports car as payment if Van Alstine made the requested delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Unbeknownst to defendant, Van Alstine was also an informant who notified the Clackamas County sheriffs department of his conversations with defendant. As a result, the state charged defendant with two counts of solicitation, solicitation to commit aggravated murder and to commit assault of Piatt, in addition to the earlier charge of solicitation to commit aggravated murder of Moss. All of the solicitation charges against defendant were tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Before trial, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction arising from his attempt to run over Moss. At trial, the state introduced the facts above. Piatt testified that he had prior convictions for assault and was an \u201cenforcer\u201d for the Outsiders. He admitted that he committed criminal acts as an enforcer. He also testified that a member who cooperates with police as an informant risks being killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Outside of the jury\u2019s presence, defendant\u2019s attorney asked Piatt whether he had ever killed anybody. Piatt refused to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Defendant moved to strike all of Piatt\u2019s testimony, arguing that he would not have an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Piatt, thus depriving him of his confrontation rights under both the United States and Oregon constitutions. The court denied the motion, and defendant moved for a mistrial, which was also denied. Despite Piatt\u2019s invocation of his constitutional right, defendant\u2019s attorney cross-examined Piatt on a variety of issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>including Piatt\u2019s prior assaults and drug convictions, his plea agreement, the motorcycle culture, his motivations for testifying, the conversations that he had with defendant while in jail, and his conversations with detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on Counts 2 and 3\u2014 solicitation to murder Piatt and solicitation to assault Piatt\u2014 arguing that the state failed to present evidence that defendant solicited Van Alstine to do anything illegal and that no solicitation occurred because the solicitee, the Outsiders, never received the DVD. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant ultimately was convicted on all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On appeal, defendant renews his arguments, assigning as error the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal, to strike Piatt\u2019s testimony, and for mistrial. In a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, defendant argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of his prior conviction, which we reject on the basis of OEC 404(3), without further discussion. We discuss each of his other assignments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on Counts 2 and 3 for solicitation of Van Alstine. When reviewing a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we determine whether, after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 498, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001). When the facts are not in dispute, as in this case, we review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal as a question of law. <em>State v. Nollen, </em>196 Or App 141, 144, 100 P3d 788 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The state charged defendant with soliciting Van Alstine to \u201cunlawfully and intentionally cause the death of Barry Piatt\u201d or \u201cunlawfully and intentionally and knowingly cause serious physical injury to Barry Piatt.\u201d Defendant contends that, because he did not ask Van Alstine personally to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>murder or harm Piatt, he should have been acquitted of those counts. Defendant\u2019s argument requires us to interpret the solicitation statute, ORS 161.435(1). When reviewing a statute, our task is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We first look at the text and context of the statute, and will consider legislative history if it appears useful to the court\u2019s analysis. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 172, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Solicitation is defined in ORS 161.435(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201cA person commits the crime of solicitation if with the intent of causing another to engage in specific conduct constituting a crime punishable as a felony or as a Class A misdemeanor or an attempt to commit such felony or Class A misdemeanor the person commands or solicits such other person to engage in that conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The statute thus provides that a person is guilty of solicitation if that person \u201ccommands or solicits\u201d another person to engage in specific criminal conduct that is either a felony or a Class A misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Defendant argues that, under <em>State v. Lee, </em>105 Or App 329, 804 P2d 1208, <em>rev den, </em>311 Or 427 (1991), he could not be convicted of solicitation because the Outsiders never received the DVD or indictment. In <em>Lee, </em>the police intercepted a letter that the defendant sent to his friend soliciting him to commit a robbery. We vacated the solicitation conviction because \u201ca completed communication is required to prove the crime of solicitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333. In defendant\u2019s view, his conviction should also be vacated because he did not complete a communication with the Outsiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The state responds by arguing that <em>Lee </em>does not apply, and the issue here is whether defendant engaged another to perform a criminal act, even if the details of how the crime was to be committed were not specified. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>202 Or App 478, 485, 123 P3d 304 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 158 (2006). We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Lee </em>is misplaced. We agree that defendant did not complete a communication with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Outsiders and cannot be convicted for soliciting it or its members. However, the state did not charge defendant with soliciting the Outsiders. Rather, the state charged defendant with, and the jury convicted him of, soliciting Van Alstine to cause Piatt\u2019s death or injury. We reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that he placed his request in the hands of a messenger, an intermediary, to simply deliver a message to a third party. Although an intermediary who unknowingly delivers a message soliciting criminal acts would not commit a crime, the intermediary becomes liable as an accomplice to the crime when he carries a message of solicitation of that crime, knowing that the message will further that crime. <em>See State v. Fitzgerald, </em>14 Or App 361, 367-68, 513 P2d 817 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In <em>Fitzgerald, </em>an inmate had a jail cell between the defendant and the defendant\u2019s accomplice. Even though the inmate had no desire to escape, we held that his \u201cact of passing [a] hacksaw back and forth between [the accomplice] and defendant amounted to aiding and abetting the attempted escape[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. The jury could infer the inmate\u2019s intent \u201cto promote or facilitate\u201d the defendant\u2019s crimes within the meaning of ORS 161.155(2)(b), which addresses liability for aiding and abetting the criminal conduct of another person,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the inmate knew that delivering the hacksaw between the defendant and his accomplice would further the defendant\u2019s escape. <em>Id. </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Likewise, when an intermediary knows that the message or documents he is delivering to a third party will further a crime, the intermediary aids and abets that crime. An intermediary who aids or abets a crime becomes criminally liable for that crime. ORS 161.155(2)(b). Hence, when a person solicits that intermediary to deliver the message and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tells the intermediary the consequences of the delivery, the person is soliciting the intermediary to engage in \u201cspecific conduct constituting a crime\u201d under ORS 161.435(1), namely, aiding and abetting the target crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The commentary concerning the crime of solicitation accompanying the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s final draft is consistent with our conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cPursuant to this section where A solicits <em>B </em>to commit a crime specified by A (or where A solicits <em>B </em>to solicit <em>C </em>to commit such crime), A\u2019s act constitutes the crime of solicitation whether or not <em>B </em>(or <em>C, </em>as the case may be) actually commits the crime or attempts to commit the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 57,56 (July 1970) (italics in original). Therefore, we hold that, as a matter of law, a person commits the crime of solicitation when that person solicits an intermediary to procure a third party to commit the intended crime so long as the intermediary is aware of that intended crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Applying those principles to the facts in this case, a reasonable jury, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, could find defendant guilty of solicitation of Van Alstine. Defendant never directly asked Van Alstine to murder or injure Piatt, but solicited him to deliver a DVD and indictment to the Outsiders. Throughout the course of their conversation, defendant told Van Alstine that, once the Outsiders saw the DVD, \u201cthey would take care of Barry Piatt,\u201d \u201chandle their own,\u201d and \u201cget rid\u201d of Piatt. Van Alstine could infer from defendant\u2019s statements that, had he delivered the DVD and indictment, the Outsiders would \u201ctake care of Barry Piatt\u201d by murdering or injuring him. Had Van Alstine delivered the requested materials, he would have aided and abetted in the crimes the Outsiders would have or could have committed as a result. Based on those facts, a jury could find defendant guilty of soliciting Van Alstine to cause the murder or injury of Piatt. Therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error. Defendant assigns as error the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>denial of his motion to strike the entirety of Piatt\u2019s testimony and his motion for mistrial, but he makes one combined argument with respect to those assignments of error. Specifically, defendant contends that he was prejudiced when Piatt invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, which then precluded defendant from adequately cross-examining Piatt.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to strike Piatt\u2019s testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cox, </em>337 Or 477, 490, 98 P3d 1103 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>546 US 830 (2005). Trial courts have broad discretion to control the presentation of evidence, including the \u201cdiscretion to strike the testimony of a witness who refuses to answer questions on cross-examination or to impose a less onerous sanction when appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of a mistrial is also for abuse of discretion because the trial court is in \u201cthe best position to assess and to rectify the potential prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Pratt, </em>316 Or 561, 574, 853 P2d 827, <em>cert den, </em>510 US 969 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In defendant\u2019s view, had Piatt denied killing anybody, it would have been apparent that defendant had no reason to approach Piatt and to ask him to murder Moss. Therefore, according to defendant, Piatt\u2019s answer to defendant\u2019s question directly related to the subject matter of the case and to whether he had committed the crime of soliciting Piatt to kill the deputy, thereby requiring all of Piatt\u2019s testimony to be stricken. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument hinges on whether Piatt\u2019s invocation of privilege prevented defendant from adequately cross-examining him. When a witness refuses to answer questions on cross-examination that are <em>necessary </em>to test the witness\u2019s direct testimony, the trial court has discretion to strike the witness\u2019s testimony because it undermines the trier of fact\u2019s ability to rely on the witness\u2019s direct testimony. <em>Cox, </em>337 Or at 493. Whether the court should strike the witness\u2019s testimony depends on whether the question directly relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019s direct examination or relates to a collateral matter. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike all of Piatt\u2019s testimony. First, defendant\u2019s question to Piatt as to whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>had ever killed anybody was of limited relevance to defendant\u2019s theory that he had no reason to ask Piatt to murder Moss or to ask Van Alstine to deliver the indictment and the DVD showing Piatt\u2019s interview with detectives to the Outsiders. Given that Piatt had not testified that he had killed anyone and instead testified to committing assaults, even after the exclusion of the question, defendant maintained the ability to argue that there accordingly was no evidence from Piatt that any of the Outsiders or Piatt himself had killed anyone, or that defendant believed that Piatt or the Outsiders had done so. Second, defendant\u2019s question to Piatt also was not necessary to prove defendant\u2019s theory because the trial court allowed ample opportunity for defendant to elicit testimony to bolster his defense without Piatt invoking his constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination. When the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike, it told defendant that it had no intention of limiting defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Piatt to certain subjects. That allowed defendant to ask Piatt other questions to suggest why defendant had no reason to believe that Piatt was capable of murdering Moss or that the Outsiders were capable of murdering Piatt or any other witness. Given the attenuated relevance of the proposed question and possible answer and defendant\u2019s otherwise unfettered ability to cross-examine Piatt, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the question did not require it to strike all of Piatt\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Defendant also argues that, because he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine Piatt about committing murder, Piatt\u2019s testimony as a whole cannot be admitted under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause precludes admission of out-of-court testimonial statements, unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54. The Confrontation Clause guarantees only the \u201c <em>\u2018opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>State v. Sullivan, </em>217 Or App 208, 213, 174 P3d 1095 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 539 (2008) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 US 15, 20, 106 S Ct 292, 88 L Ed 2d 15 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">There are at least two problems with defendant\u2019s argument. First, Piatt\u2019s trial testimony was not an out-of-court statement, so <em>Crawford </em>does not apply to it. Second, Piatt was available for cross-examination and was, in fact, cross-examined about his direct testimony. And, as we discussed above, whether Piatt ever killed anyone was a collateral matter. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike Piatt\u2019s testimony and his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> The conviction on Count 2, solicitation to commit aggravated murder, merged with Count 3, solicitation to commit assault in the second degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> ORS 161.155 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>person is criminally liable for the conduct of another person constituting a crime if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\"><em>*. t. </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201c(2) With the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\u201c(b) Aids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person in planning or committing the erime[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-5\"> At trial, defendant raised his confrontation clause argument under both the United States and Oregon constitutions.
