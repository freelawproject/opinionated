As explained below, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, mother\u2019s challenge to the jurisdictional allegations pertaining to father is properly before us; further, we agree with mother that the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support jurisdiction over K.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In this case, \u201cour task is to review the facts found by the juvenile court to determine whether they are supported by any evidence, and then to determine whether, as a matter of law, those facts together with facts implicitly found by the juvenile court, provide a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(1)(c).\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhere findings are not made on disputed issues of fact and there is evidence from which those facts could be decided more than one way, we will presume that they were decided in a manner consistent with the juvenile court\u2019s ultimate conclusion.\u201d <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 655, 238 P3d 53 (2010). We relate the facts consistently with that standard, supplementing our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>narrative with additional, uncontroverted facts from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Mother was diagnosed as developmentally disabled as a young child and receives adult developmental disability services at the present time. Mother is eligible for 100 hours per month of services to assist her with daily living skills; she typically uses 50 hours of services per month. Berg, the person who provides case management services to mother in relation to her developmental disability, testified that the types of services that mother receives are based on the needs identified in her individual support plan and are \u201cprimarily up to her and her support team.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201c[Mother has] identified services in her home to help keep her home clean and safe, services to attend doctors\u2019 appointments, if needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201cIf there\u2019s [sic] questions that she has, she can have her support staff go with her. Access to community resources such as WIC, CAPECO, things like that. Some of the recreational activities we do as a group she can be part of. And it really depends on what she needs at that time and what she\u2019s asking for of the services that we provide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Berg testified that mother</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\u201cin the past has generally had about 50 hours per month of support that she\u2019s requested. She likes to have support more outside of her home to do activities, and she has chosen primarily to be more independent in her home than to have a provider come in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">When asked her opinion \u201cregarding [mother\u2019s] ability to take care of herself without the services provided by [her] organization,\u201d Berg, who has worked with mother in various capacities for a total of six years, replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">\u201c[Mother] has done a fairly good job. She has often chosen to not have a provider for extended periods of time. She has managed to meet her Lifeways appointments. Her home \u2014 you know, she has food in her home, she is able to get her medications, things like that, and that she\u2019s done with the support system that she has. She\u2019s very able to access services and tell people when she needs support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Berg explained that the services mother is eligible for \u201ccannot go to provide support for another person,\u201d but \u201c[w]hat we can do is provide support to [the eligible person] to learn the skills or to access services to be able to get those skills from somebody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Father suffers from an unspecified \u201cseizure disorder\u201d for which he takes medication. He receives Social Security disability payments, although it is unclear whether those payments are related to his seizure disorder. Father was in special education as a child. At some point, father applied for developmental disability services and was denied; he did not follow up with the additional testing that was required to determine his eligibility. Father is supportive of mother and recognizes that she needs services but, at times, he has had difficulty with some of the service providers who have been at the home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the month before K\u2019s birth, mother had not been receiving in-home services for approximately a month because of parents\u2019 difficulties with some of the service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">K was born on May 19, 2011, the first child for both mother and father. About eight hours after the birth, Anderson, a child protective services worker with the Department of Human Services (DHS), visited mother in the hospital.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Anderson observed mother with K for about one and one-half to two hours; she also talked to the doctor who provided medical care at K\u2019s birth and the nurses who were caring for mother and K. Mother had been given pain medication for childbirth and, as advised by her doctors, had not been taking during her pregnancy, the medications used to treat her disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the visit, Anderson observed that mother had \u201ca lot of difficulties and needed to be coached through the whole process\u201d of wrapping K in a blanket. Anderson also observed that mother \u201ceasily gave up\u201d when trying to feed K, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>even after she was coached in \u201chow to keep the baby engaged in the feeding process,\u201d and that the nurse eventually took the baby and finished feeding her. Mother similarly needed \u201cconstant coaching\u201d in how to change the baby\u2019s diapers. Anderson further explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">\u201c[a]t one point[, as mother] was holding the baby, the baby\u2019s head was flopping to the side. They talked to her about how important it was to support the baby\u2019s head, and helped her to understand how important that was. She needed those reminders numerous times while she was holding the baby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Anderson observed mother again the following day, for about an hour. However, she did not testify as to any concerns that arose during that visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Anderson also met with father the day that K was born, but she did not see father interact with K. Both mother and father acknowledged to Anderson that they lacked education and skills in caring for a newborn. Anderson later learned that they had received \u201csome coaching [on] parenting\u201d from Healthy Start before the birth of the baby. Mother and father identified family members and others as resources for them, but Anderson determined that none of those people was available to move into the home to assist parents in caring for K.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Based on Anderson\u2019s assessment, DHS took protective custody of K. The next day, as K was being discharged from the hospital to be placed in foster care, Anderson observed that \u201cneither parent knew how to put the baby in the car seat and how to secure the baby in the car seat, and needed a lot of coaching on how to do that safely.\u201d Mother also indicated to Anderson that she thought K was already recognizing father\u2019s voice because K stopped crying when father yelled at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The state then filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that K was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cthe child\u2019s condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the child\u2019s welfare, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201ca. The mother is developmentally delayed, has mental health concerns and requires the assistance of care providers to maintain the home and personal responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201cb. The mother is not able to meet the basic needs of the child, due [to] her delays and medications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cc. The father has not presented himself as a parenting resource.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cd. The father has mental health concerns, anger control issues, at times subjecting the mother to domestic violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201ce. The father has not demonstrated that he is able to provide the infant with the necessary care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201cf. The home is unsafe and unsanitary for the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The jurisdictional hearing took place on July 6,2011. During the period before the hearing, mother and father had two-hour visits with K three times per week. Corey, the DHS caseworker who was assigned the case after the dependency petition was filed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> observed parents with K during approximately five of those visits; each observation lasted \u201cjust maybe a couple [of] minutes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Corey reported that parents \u201clacked just basic parenting skills.\u201d When asked to elaborate, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201cFor example, when I first viewed them when the baby was first \u2014 you know, one of the first visits, just basic [sic] how to hold the baby, to support the neck, and how important that is to, you know, to support her neck. She\u2019s got a very strong neck and she was really moving her head a lot, and so we had to work with the family a lot with that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">She also visited parents\u2019 home, talked with mother and father, and \u201cjust * * * observed where their developmental disabilities come into play and where that might be a concern for them to safely parent the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In closing arguments, mother and father each contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish jurisdiction as to them; mother further argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">\u201cThis is not a case where we have somebody who is disabled who has no support and poses a threat to the child, this is a situation where she is receiving services through the Brokerage. She has been receiving those services, and she has the assistance of the father, who has no disability on this record, and who is not incapable of helping her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cSo they have significant resources. They also have a stepmother who has been very vocal and communicative with the agency and who can also help assist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cSo on this record we don\u2019t have a lack of assistance, we have abundant assistance. What we really have is a rush to judgment about these parents because of disabilities and just an assumption and conclusion that they can\u2019t parent. And that\u2019s not adequate to take jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The court concluded that jurisdiction was warranted, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201c[B]ased on the credible evidence before the court, the court is going to take jurisdiction concerning the child, but not concerning the issue of domestic violence or the unsafe and unsanitary [condition] of the home. So that will be (A), (B), (C), and the amended (D),<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> and (E).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cThe plan is going to be to get the child returned to the home. I do have hope here that with mom getting back on her meds, or maybe she is right now, and DHS is going to continue to work with you, even in-home services to try to see if the child can be safely with you. The court has concerns right now, but I do have hope that it will work out, that the child can \u2014 that you can care for the child safely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The court subsequently entered a judgment finding K within the jurisdiction of the court based on the allegations in paragraphs a through e of the amended petition, making K a ward of the court and placing her in the legal custody of DHS for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>continued placement in substitute care. As noted above, only-mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We begin with a discussion of the relevant statutory provisions. ORS 419B.100 governs the juvenile court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in dependency cases. In particular, as relevant in this case, ORS 419B.100(1)(c) establishes exclusive original jurisdiction in the juvenile court \u201cin any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and * * * [w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others[.]\u201d The requirements of ORS 419B.100(l)(c) are satisfied if, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App 401, 405, 122 P3d 116 (2005) (citing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Smith, </em>316 Or 646, 652-53, 853 P2d 282 (1993)). To endanger the child\u2019s welfare, the condition or circumstances must create a current \u201cthreat of serious loss or injury to the child\u201d and \u201cthere must be a reasonable likelihood that the threat will be realized.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. F., </em>243 Or App 379, 386, 259 P3d 957 (2011); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. D. M., </em>248 Or App 683, 686, 275 P3d 971 (2012) (formulations in <em>Smith </em>and A. <em>F. </em>\u201ccomplement each other and correctly state the standard\u201d for juvenile court jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(1)(c)). The burden is on the state to prove facts sufficient to warrant jurisdiction. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. B. L. J., </em>246 Or App 767, 773, 268 P3d 696 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The statutes contemplate that ORS 419B.100(1)(c) brings <em>the child </em>whose condition or circumstances are as described in the statute within the jurisdiction of the court, <em>see, e.g., </em>ORS 419B.809(1) (any person may file a petition alleging that a child is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100); ORS 419B.310(3) (facts alleging that a child is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B. 100(1) must, unless admitted, be proved by a preponderance of competent evidence); ORS 419B.328(1) (court shall make child found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100 a ward of the court); ORS 419A.010(33) (defining \u201cward\u201d to mean \u201ca person within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100\u201d), and the courts also frame it in those terms, <em>see, e.g., Smith, </em>316 Or at 650 (\u201cThis court has not previously considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>what conditions or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of a child <em>over whom juvenile court jurisdiction is sought.\u201d </em>(Internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; emphasis added.)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, under ORS 419B.803(1), a juvenile court having subject matter jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 generally also has personal jurisdiction over the <em>parents </em>of the child or ward. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the court may order a parent to participate in treatment or training if the court finds \u201cthat treatment or training is needed by a parent to correct the circumstances that resulted in wardship or to prepare the parent to resume the care of the ward\u201d and if \u201cthe participation is in the ward\u2019s best interests.\u201d ORS 419B.387.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">A ward \u2014 that is, a child found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100 \u2014 is subject to the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction until:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201c(a) The court dismisses the petition concerning the ward;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201c(b) The court transfers jurisdiction over the ward as provided in ORS 419B.127, 419B.130 and 419B.132;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\u201c(c) The court enters an order terminating the wardship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201c(d) A judgment of adoption of the ward is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">\u201c(e) The ward becomes 21 years of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">ORS 419B.328(2). We note that jurisdiction and physical custody are separate concepts; the court may have jurisdiction under ORS 419B. 100(1) \u201ceven though the child is receiving adequate care from the person having physical custody of the child.\u201d ORS 419B.100(2); see <em>also </em>ORS 419B.331 (court may place the ward under \u201cprotective supervision,\u201d including in the legal custody of the ward\u2019s parents, if the court determines to do so would be in the \u201cbest interest and welfare\u201d of the ward); ORS 419B.337(1) (\u201cWhen the court determines it would be in the best interest and for the welfare of a ward, the court may place the ward in the legal custody of [DHS] for care, placement and supervision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">With those principles in mind, we turn back to mother\u2019s appeal. Before addressing the merits of mother\u2019s arguments, we first must address the state\u2019s contention that, because father has not appealed the jurisdictional judgment, the allegations pertaining to him contained in that judgment \u201care conclusively established\u201d and mother may not challenge them. As explained below, under the circumstances of this case, particularly where the juvenile court\u2019s findings as to mother are dependent, at least in part, on the soundness of its findings as to father, we conclude that mother can challenge all of the jurisdictional findings on appeal, including those that pertain to father.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In this case, the state\u2019s theory of jurisdiction as alleged in the petition is, essentially, that parents <em>in combination </em>are unable to safely parent K given their \u2014 and particularly, mother\u2019s \u2014 cognitive impairments. <em>State v. R. H., </em>237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Or App 245, 251, 239 P3d 505, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 480 (2010) (\u201cThe allegations in a petition are viewed as a whole, with each one potentially conditioned or amplified by the others.\u201d). As the state explains, \u201cmother and father both lack parenting skills and[,] potentially, the mental capacity to learn those skills without special assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In short, the question before the juvenile court was whether the allegations regarding mother and father <em>together </em>were sufficient to prove that, in the totality of the circumstances, K\u2019s welfare was endangered.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., B. L. J., </em>246 Or App at 773 (\u201c[T]here is no legal requirement that a parent be able to care for his or her children independently.\u201d). Accordingly, the juvenile court properly considered parents as a unit in determining that jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(1)(c) was warranted. As a result, on appeal, the sufficiency of the allegations as to mother are necessarily intertwined with the sufficiency of the allegations with respect to father. That is so because mother\u2019s ability to safely parent K must be evaluated in light of all of the circumstances, <em>Smith, </em>316 Or at 652-53 (court must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a child is endangered), and those circumstances necessarily include the participation of father in caring for K. And that, in turn, compels consideration on appeal of the sufficiency of the court\u2019s findings pertaining to father.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">We turn to those findings, the totality of which can be summarized as follows: father is not available as a parenting resource, he has mental health concerns and anger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>control issues, and he is unable to provide K with the necessary care. Those findings are simply not supported by the record.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, there is no evidence indicating that father is not a parenting resource for K. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that mother and father live together and are jointly parenting K: father was in the hospital the day that K was born; he was helping when K was discharged from the hospital; and he participated, with mother, in visiting K after she left the hospital and was placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Similarly, the record does not support a finding that father has current \u201cmental health concerns.\u201d Rather, the evidence shows only that father was in \u201cspecial education\u201d as a child and that he applied for, <em>but was denied, </em>eligibility for developmental disability services.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The same is true of the court\u2019s finding that father has \u201canger control issues.\u201d Anderson testified that father \u201cwas not happy with\u201d some of the people who provided in-home services to mother for her developmental disability and that mother and father at times did not allow service providers into the home; similarly, Berg testified that, \u201c[a]t times[, father] has had difficulty with some of the providers that have been at the home.\u201d However, there is nothing in the record to indicate that father reacted angrily to those service providers, let alone that he had difficulty controlling his anger in that or any other setting. Mother also related to Anderson that the baby once stopped crying when father \u201cyelled\u201d at her; however, that, without more, is insufficient to evince an \u201canger control issue[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">That leaves the court\u2019s finding that father is unable to provide K with the necessary care. The sole evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that regard is the following: Anderson observed that father did not know how to put the baby in a car seat when she was being discharged from the hospital the day after her birth and that he \u201cneeded a lot of coaching on how to do that safely.\u201d And, during one of the first visits with K after she was discharged from the hospital, DHS \u201chad to work with the family a lot with\u201d how to hold the baby and support her neck. That was the extent of it. As explained in more detail below in our discussion of the allegations pertaining directly to mother, that evidence cannot support the conclusion that K was exposed to a \u201creasonable likelihood of harm\u201d as a result. In short, the state has failed to prove the jurisdictional allegations pertaining to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">That said, we reject mother\u2019s categorical assertion that, if the factual allegations \u201cas to\u201d father are legally insufficient, jurisdiction necessarily fails regardless of any deficiencies that mother may have. As explained above, juvenile court jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(1)(c) is predicated on the <em>risk </em>of harm to the child. <em>Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App at 405 (jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(1)(c) is warranted if \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood of harm\u201d to the child). Thus, even if the allegations as to father are unfounded, it does not necessarily follow that K could not still be at risk of harm \u2014 and thus under the court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 due to mother\u2019s condition or circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">We turn, then, to the allegations relating to mother. We conclude, first, that there is evidence in the record to support the juvenile court\u2019s findings that mother is developmentally delayed, requires the assistance of care providers to live independently, and takes medications for her disability. However, as explained below, we also conclude that the court\u2019s finding that mother is <em>\u201cnot able </em>to meet [K\u2019s] basic needs\u201d (emphasis added) is not supported by the record and that the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the court\u2019s conclusion that, in the totality of the circumstances, there is a \u201creasonable likelihood of harm\u201d to K\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We note that this case is made more difficult because the record contains very little evidence regarding the nature and extent of mother\u2019s disability. Specifically, the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>court could discern from the evidence presented only that mother generally needs 50 hours of adult developmental disability services per month to assist her with daily living tasks \u2014 mostly outside of the home \u2014 and that she takes unspecified medications, the effects of which are also unspecified on this record. Beyond that, the record is devoid of evidence, expert or otherwise, regarding developmental disabilities in general or mother\u2019s mental capacity in particular, much less how that disability and the medication she takes for it might affect her ability to care for a newborn. Anderson testified that she spoke with the doctors and nurses caring for mother, \u201cDD Services,\u201d and parents\u2019 extended family, but the record does not disclose the details of what that investigation yielded. Similarly, Corey testified that she visited parents\u2019 home, talked with mother and father, and \u201cjust * * * observed where their developmental disabilities come into play and where that might be a concern for them to safely parent the child.\u201d But, with the exception of a single incident discussed below, Corey did not relate any particular safety concerns that were identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Thus, the bulk of the state\u2019s evidence that mother lacks, and is unable to learn, the necessary parenting skills to safely parent a newborn consists of behavior observed by Anderson eight hours after mother had given birth to K and while she was taking medication for pain. Anderson testified that mother had difficulty learning how to wrap K in a blanket, change her diapers, and feed her, and that mother needed \u201ca lot\u201d of coaching in performing some of those tasks. Significantly, however, there is no evidence in the record that mother\u2019s difficulties with those skills persisted even into the next day, let alone at the time of the jurisdictional hearing several weeks later. The same is true of the state\u2019s evidence that, the day after K was born, mother and father needed coaching in how to safely secure K in a car seat. <em>See A. </em>F., 243 Or App at 386 (reversing ground for jurisdiction based on the father\u2019s possession of pornography where the state failed to present evidence that there was a current risk of the children being exposed to pornography at the time of the hearing); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. D. T. C., </em>231 Or App 544, 554-55, 219 P3d 610 (2009) (reversing judgment of jurisdiction where there was insufficient evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>father\u2019s alcohol abuse problem created a reasonable likelihood of harm to the children at the time of the dependency hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">According to Anderson, parents had had some \u201ccoaching\u201d concerning parenting before K was born; however, without farther details as to the nature and extent of that interaction, it would be speculative to infer from that evidence that mother lacks the mental capacity to learn those skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Of greater concern is the evidence that mother failed to properly support K\u2019s head and neck while holding her. Unlike with mother\u2019s other perceived deficiencies, there is evidence that that behavior persisted \u2014 at least to some extent \u2014 after mother left the hospital. Anderson testified that, during her initial observation of mother on the day that K was born, mother needed reminders \u201cnumerous times while she was holding the baby\u201d about how important it was to support the baby\u2019s head. Corey, who observed mother interact with K after K was placed in foster care, also testified that on one of the first visits, they had to \u201cwork with the family a lot with that.\u201d The difficulty with that evidence is that it lacks essential context. For example, with regard to Anderson\u2019s testimony, we cannot tell from the record if mother was holding the baby the entire visit, which lasted approximately two hours, or whether she was holding the baby only for a few minutes. Obviously if it were the latter, then the need for \u201cnumerous\u201d reminders would be more of a concern. Corey\u2019s testimony indicates that the deficiency was observed at only one visit \u2014 indeed, only at one of the <em>first </em>visits parents had with K after leaving the hospital \u2014 and the record does not disclose how many days elapsed between mother\u2019s instruction at the hospital and that visit. We also emphasize that there is no evidence that the problem continued at the time of the hearing almost two months later. Our point is that, without those details \u2014 particularly when combined with the lack of evidence regarding mother\u2019s cognitive abilities generally \u2014 it is impossible to determine that mother lacks the capacity to learn the necessary skills without \u201cspecial assistance,\u201d which is the theory upon which jurisdiction was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Moreover, the evidence is undisputed that mother is eligible for 100 hours per month in adult developmental disability services and that those services can be used to help mother \u201clearn the skills or * * * access services to be able to get those skills from somebody else.\u201d The record further discloses that mother is \u201cvery able to access services and tell people when she needs support.\u201d Mother also has the assistance of father who, on this record, we have determined is not incapable of safely parenting K. We are not unmindful of K\u2019s particular vulnerability due to her extremely young age; however, considering all of the above circumstances, we conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that mother is \u201cnot able to meet the basic needs of the child, due [to] her delays and medications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In sum, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that K\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger [her] welfare.\u201d ORS 419B.100(1)(c). As we have recently emphasized, \u201cthe burden is on the state to show that harm is, in fact, present[,]\u201d <em>C. Z., </em>236 Or App at 443, and the state failed to meet that burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> Although ORS 419B.100 was amended by the 2011 legislature, <em>see </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 291, \u00a7 5, those amendments have no bearing on our analysis in this case; we therefore cite to the current version of the statute throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> As we explain below, <em>see </em>249 Or App at 87 n 15, given that disposition, we need not address mother\u2019s unpreserved argument that the petition\u2019s framing of the allegations as to father improperly shifted the burden of proof away from the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> Mother does not ask that we exercise our discretion to review the case <em>de novo, </em>and we do not do so. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (providing that <em>de novo </em>review is now discretionary in most dependency cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"> The record shows that mother and father live together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> DHS had received referrals that mother \u201cwas pregnant and was to deliver\u201d a few months before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> Anderson indicated that mother may have been started back on one of her regular medications after K was born, but the trial court did not attach any significance to that fact \u2014 perhaps because the record contains no evidence regarding what mother\u2019s regular medications were, their intended effects, or how long they must be taken before they become effective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\"> The court indicated in the judgment that it had considered the testimony of Anderson, Berg, and Jones, a mental health therapist who evaluated father at the request of DHS, in making its decision.

We need not address that argument, however, because we agree with mother\u2019s alternative argument that, even reading those paragraphs broadly as alleging, instead, that father is not available as a parenting resource (paragraph c) and not capable of providing K with the necessary care (paragraph e), \u201cthe evidence regarding the allegations as to father does not support a basis for jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\"> It is not apparent from the record that father\u2019s unspecified seizure disorder, or the fact that he takes medication for that condition, is a \u201cmental health concern\u201d; however, to the extent that the court relied on that evidence, without more information about father\u2019s condition, it is insufficient in any event to support a conclusion that there is a reasonable risk of harm to K as a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
