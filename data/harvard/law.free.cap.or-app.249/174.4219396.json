On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on both counts, because the evidence did not demonstrate that there was more \u201cusable\u201d marijuana at his address than he and his cousin, also a registered medical marijuana user at that address, could together lawfully possess as cardholders under the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act. <em>See </em>ORS 475.309(1); ORS 475.320. The state concedes that the trial court should have granted the motion for a judgment of acquittal as to both counts. We agree, accept the concession, and reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
