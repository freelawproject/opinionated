We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s unpreserved contention that the trial court committed plain error in failing to grant a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>due to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument. The state concedes that defendant is correct in his second, preserved, contention that the guilty verdict for one conviction of assault in the fourth degree (Count 10) must merge into one of the guilty verdicts for first-degree assault (Count 6). The state\u2019s concession is well-founded, ORS 161.067; <em>see State v. Sanders, </em>189 Or App 107, 74 P3d 1105 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 657 (2004) (merger of convictions required where the offenses involved the same act of violence against a single victim and the merged conviction is a lesser included of the more serious offense), and we accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Reversed and remanded with instruction to merge conviction for fourth-degree assault (Count 10) into the conviction for first-degree assault (Count 6); remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
