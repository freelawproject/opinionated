J.</author>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Plaintiff, State of Oregon through the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), appeals a judgment in a writ of review proceeding that reversed and remanded defendant Linn County\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determination that Eugene and Viola Glender have a vested right to complete development of a 16-lot residential subdivision in compliance with county and state waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, DLCD contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that, because the Glenders \u201cincurred none of the costs put toward the project,\u201d there is nothing in the numerator of the expenditure ratio and, for that reason, the Glenders cannot establish a vested right to complete the subdivision as a matter of law. The Glenders cross-appeal contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the writ of review court erred in determining that the county misconstrued the applicable law by failing to include the cost of the construction of residences when determining total project costs for purposes of the denominator of the expenditure ratio.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">As explained below, while this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>351 Or 219, 264 P3d 1265 (2011) <em>(Friends II), </em>which clarified the vested rights analysis that applies in cases such as this. In light of <em>Friends II, </em>we conclude that, although the writ of review court properly determined that the county erred by failing to include the cost of constructing residences in determining the total project cost, the writ of review court erred when it assumed a \u201chypothetical cost\u201d of $100,000 per residence in calculating the total project cost. Those legal errors require reversal and a remand to the county for reconsideration because, contrary to DLCD\u2019s assertion, the Glenders did incur development costs applicable to the numerator of the expenditure <em>ratio </em>\u2014 viz., the value of the land the Glenders dedicated to the county for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>a road in the subdivision. Accordingly, we affirm on appeal and, on cross-appeal, reverse and remand the writ of review court\u2019s judgment with instructions to reverse and remand the county\u2019s decision for reconsideration in light of <em>Friends II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The material facts are uncontroverted. The Glenders own 24.8 acres of property in Linn County. In 2005, David and Lois Irvine (the developers) executed an option agreement for the purchase of the Glenders\u2019 property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the Glenders obtained Measure 37 waivers from the state and the county that allowed them to develop their property into a 16-lot residential subdivision. Expenditures were incurred, primarily by the developers.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On December 5, 2007 \u2014 the day before Ballot Measure 49 (2007) became effective \u2014 the county recorded the Glenders\u2019 final subdivision plat. As part of the subdivision plat, the Glenders dedicated property to the county for purposes of constructing a road in the subdivision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gary Brown, a real estate broker, rendered the opinion that the real market value of the dedicated property was $53,040.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Thereafter, the Glenders and the developers applied for a determination from the county that they had a common law vested right to complete and continue the use described in the waivers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the county\u2019s Planning and Building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Department (the department) determined that a vested right to complete the subdivision did not exist, the Glenders and the developers appealed to the Linn County Board of Commissioners (the board).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">DLCD submitted comments to the board in support of the department\u2019s determination. Specifically, DLCD asserted that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence that the Glenders had incurred substantial costs * * * related to development of the property\u201d and that, without evidence concerning the cost of constructing residences, \u201cit is not possible to apply the vesting analysis factors * *</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In determining whether the Glenders had a vested right to continue and complete the subdivision, the board considered the equitable factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Clackamas Co. v. Holmes, </em>265 Or 193, 508 P2d 190 (1973).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, with regard to the expenditure ratio, the board included, among other expenditures, approximately $53,000 \u2014 which represented the value of the land that the Glenders dedicated to the county \u2014 in the numerator. Further, the board determined that the expenditures were \u201cconsistent with the normal course of development\u201d and that there was \u201cno information to suggest that any expenditure or conduct * * * was made in bad faith.\u201d However, the board did not include the cost of constructing residences when calculating the total project cost for purposes of the denominator of the expenditure ratio, noting that the Glenders\u2019 Measure 37 claim [was] for compensation for <em>buildable home sites, </em>not for the homes themselves.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ultimately, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>board determined that the Glenders \u201chave a vested right to continue to develop the 16-lot subdivision * * * with one home site on each lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">DLCD sought review of the county\u2019s decision in circuit court by way of writ of review. On review, the court reversed and remanded the county\u2019s decision based on an analysis that focused on asserted deficiencies in the county\u2019s understanding and on application of the expenditure ratio. As pertinent to the dispositive issues on appeal, the court determined that, because the Glenders\u2019 land dedication\u2014 which occurred after the passage of Measure 49 but before it became effective on December 6 \u2014 was not made in good faith, the county had inappropriately included the value of that dedication in the <em>numerator </em>of the expenditure ratio.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court further determined that the county had erred in failing to determine the cost of constructing residences when calculating the <em>denominator </em>of the expenditure ratio (i.e., total project cost). Finally, and notwithstanding the county\u2019s failure to determine the actual cost of residential construction and to include that cost in the denominator, the court concluded that, even assuming a \u201chypothetical cost [of construction] as low as $100,000 per house,\u201d the resulting expenditure ratio (with the land dedication expense excluded from the numerator) could not support the county\u2019s vesting determination for the entire 16-lot project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>DLCD appeals the resulting judgment, and the Glenders cross-appeal. Of the myriad contentions raised on appeal and cross-appeal, we address only those described below because they are dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We begin with the Glenders\u2019 contention on cross-appeal that the writ of review court \u201cerred in requiring the [county] to make findings regarding the total project costs\u201d for purposes of calculating the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Because the Supreme Court addressed that issue in <em>Friends II, </em>we describe its reasoning in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Friends II, </em>the Supreme Court explained that, although \u201call the <em>Holmes </em>factors may not apply in a given case and * * * the extent to which they do apply will presumably vary with the circumstances of each case,\u201d the expenditure ratio \u201cprovides the necessary starting point in analyzing whether a landowner has incurred substantial costs toward completion of the job.\u201d 351 Or at 242-43. Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201cthe county [in <em>Friends </em>II] misapplied the governing law in failing to decide the ratio between the costs that [the landowner] had incurred and the projected cost of constructing the residential subdivision.\u201d 351 Or at 245. Specifically, the court explained that the county\u2019s determination of the total project cost \u2014 that is, the denominator in the expenditure ratio \u2014 was inadequate because it \u201cfailed to find the estimated cost of building the homes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. Further, the court noted that the county\u2019s assumption that each residence might cost $450,000 to construct was an insufficient substitute. <em>Id. </em>at 247. In other words, the cost of completion of a residence must be established in the record and cannot be assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>In sum, the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201cthere is no bright line for determining when an expenditure will be substantial enough to establish a vested right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Ultimately, the court cautioned that the expenditure ratio \u201cis not the sole factor to be considered, nor will it necessarily be the dispositive factor; that is, there is not some specific percentage which must always be present before the right to complete construction will vest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, in determining whether a common law vested right existed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cthe county needed to find the \u2018ultimate cost\u2019 of completing construction and also the ratio between the costs that [the landowner] had incurred and the cost of the project. Without those findings, the county was in no position to determine whether [the landowner\u2019s] expenditures, in light of all the <em>Holmes </em>factors, were substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Based on the reasoning in <em>Friends II, </em>the county and the court in this case misconstrued the applicable law in determining the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Although the writ of review court properly determined that the county erred by failing to include the cost of constructing residences in determining the total project cost, the writ of review court erred when it assumed a \u201chypothetical cost\u201d of $100,000 per residence in calculating the total project cost. Rather, the cost of construction must be based on an actual determination, not a hypothetical assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">That legal and methodological error would ordinarily require a reversal and remand to the county for reconsideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, however, there is an additional twist: If DLCD is correct in its appellate contention that the Glenders \u201cincurred <em>none </em>of the costs put toward the project\u201d \u2014 and, thus, that there is <em>nothing </em>in the numerator of the expenditure ratio \u2014 the Glenders could not establish a vested right in all events. (Emphasis added.) If that were the case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>proper disposition would be simply to direct the writ of review court to reverse the county\u2019s vesting decision without a remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Friends II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The short and complete answer is that DLCD\u2019s premise is incorrect. Regardless of whether any other expenditures are properly included in the numerator, the county determined that the Glenders did, in fact, dedicate land to the county in connection with the proposed development, and the value of that land was includable in the numerator of the expenditure ratio. <em>See Friends of Polk County v. Oliver, </em>245 Or App 680, 693, 264 P3d 165 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 586 (2012) (reasoning that value that the claimant gave up as part of the settlement of a condemnation action that was attributable to a particular phase of the development was properly included in the numerator of the expenditure ratio). That is so regardless of whether the Glenders could successfully vacate the dedication if it were later determined that they lacked a vested right to complete the subdivision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">As previously noted, 249 Or App at 542, 542 n 8, the writ of review court excluded the value of the land dedication from the numerator because the dedication occurred after the passage of Measure 49 but before its effective date. In other words, the court determined as a categorical matter that the expenditure was not made in good faith.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, in <em>Friends II, </em>the Supreme Court rejected that type of categorical approach. Specifically, the Supreme Court explained that Measure 49</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cleaves it to the trier of fact, as the common law did, to determine the good or bad faith of the landowner in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>expenditures. Specifically, the trier of fact could find that expenditures made, after the voters adopted Measure 49, to \u2018thwart the legislative act\u2019 were made in bad faith. Conversely, nothing precludes a trier of fact from finding that expenses planned before the voters approved Measure 49 but incurred after its passage but before its effective date were not made to thwart the measure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">351 Or at 241-42. Moreover, as the Supreme Court in <em>Friends II </em>made clear, it is the trier of fact rather than the reviewing court that determines whether an expenditure was made in good faith. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In sum, we have concluded that the value of the land that the Glenders dedicated to the county is includable in the numerator of the expenditure ratio and that the county and writ of review court erred in determining the denominator of the ratio. Accordingly, we must reverse the writ of review court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to enter a judgment reversing the county\u2019s decision and remanding for reconsideration in light of the analytical construct that the Supreme Court described in <em>Friends II.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Affirmed on appeal; on cross-appeal, reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment reversing the county\u2019s decision and remanding for reconsideration in light of <em>Friends of Yamhill County v.

Friends of Linn County and Mouille had intervened in the writ of review proceeding in support of DLCD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> The terms of the option itself and any related agreements between the Glenders and the developers are not part of the record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> Specifically, the subdivision plat contained the following declaration of the Glenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201cKnow all persons by these presents know that Eugene C.

The street is being granted to the public without reservation or restriction whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">(Some capitalization omitted.) <em>See generally </em>Linn County Code 926.350(K) (providing, in part, that \u201c[alpproval of a final plat by Linn County shall constitute an acceptance by the public of the dedication of any road shown on the plat\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\"> As pertinent, section 5(3) of Measure 49 provides that claimants who had filed Measure 37 claims before June 28, 2007, had an entitlement to just compensation as provided in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">\u201c[a] waiver issued before the effective date of this 2007 Act [December 6, 2007] <em>to the extent that </em>the claimant\u2019s use of the property complies with the waiver and <em>the claimant has a common law vested right on the effective date of this 2007Act to complete and continue the use described in the waiver.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> Specifically, in <em>Holmes, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201cThe test of whether a landowner has developed his land to the extent that he has acquired a vested right to continue the development should not be based solely on the ratio of expenditures incurred to the total cost of the project. We believe the ratio test should be only one of the factors to be considered. Other factors which should be taken into consideration are the good faith of the landowner, whether or not he had notice of any proposed zoning or amendatory zoning before starting his improvements, the type of expenditures, i.e., whether the expenditures have any relation to the completed project or could apply to various other uses of the land, the kind of project, the location and ultimate cost. Also, the acts of the landowner should rise beyond mere contemplated use or preparation, such as leveling of land, boring test holes, or preliminary negotiations with contractors or architects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">265 Or at 198-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\"> With respect to the noninclusion of the value of the land dedication in the numerator, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cA fair reading of <em>Holmes </em>is that one who incurs expenses after knowing of an imminent change in the law \u2014 in this case the enactment of Measure 49 \u2014 does so at the risk that such additional expenses may not be considered in determining whether substantial costs have been incurred toward completion of the project. The Court does not find that the Glenders acted with a sinister or dishonest motive. Rather, the Court finds that whatever costs they may have incurred after the passage of Measure 49 were not incurred with the reasonable expectation that such expenses would be included in determining whether costs to that point were \u2018substantial.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">M* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cIn any event, * * * there is very little question but that the Glenders would be successful in accomplishing a rescission of the property dedication should the County be unable or unwilling to allow home construction on these lots.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> The county sought input from the court concerning the scope of any remand. In particular, the county requested that \u201cthe matter be remanded for consideration of whether or not the Glenders have vested a lesser number of lots\u201d and that the court \u201corder that the subdivision be re-platted to coincide with the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>dwellings vested and authorized, and that any lots not found to be vested be vacated.\u201d The court sought input from all the parties as to the issues of \u201cpartial vesting\u201d and the status of the 16-lot subdivision. Although the court stated that it was remanding the case \u201cfor a determination of the number of additional lots [that] may be developed,\u201d the court essentially declined to resolve the issues concerning the propriety of partial vesting and the status of the subdivision. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cThe only matter before the Court was and is the question whether the Glenders had acquired a vested right to develop a certain number of lots. It is up to the County, on remand, to decide how many lots may be developed. Whether the \u2018subdivision\u2019 must be re-platted is a decision for the County and not for this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> <em>See, e.g., Friends II, </em>351 Or at 244 (reasoning that, if \u201cthe county improperly construed the law in determining that [the landowner] had a vested right to complete his subdivision, then the Court of Appeals correctly reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remanded for further proceedings before the county\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 245 (\u201cWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the county misapplied the governing law in failing to decide the ratio between the costs that [the landowner] had incurred and the projected cost of constructing the residential subdivision.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> We note that many of the parties\u2019 contentions concern the proper calculation of the numerator of the expenditure ratio <em>(e.g., </em>disputes regarding the values properly assigned to the various expenditures or whether certain expenditures are properly includable in the numerator).
