We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in 2005. <em>State v. Sager, </em>199 Or App 417, 112 P2d 1204, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 445 (2005). In 2009, defendant moved for a corrected judgment pursuant to ORS 137.754.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a document entitled \u201cJudgment of Conviction and Sentence,\u201d the trial court denied the motion for entry of a corrected judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant appeals the denial of his motion. The issue presented is whether the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend pursuant to ORS 137.754 is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In <em>State v. Hart, </em>188 Or App 650, 72 P3d 671, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 126 (2003), we held that the denial of motion to correct a judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is not appeal-able under ORS 138.053(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We stated that, \u201c[u]nder that subsection, only post-judgment orders that impose a sentence, suspend imposition or execution of a sentence, or affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>probation can be appealed.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>188 Or App at 653. However, a trial court\u2019s order denying entry of a corrected judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083 does not come within any of the listed categories: \u201cIt did not alter defendant\u2019s sentence; it instead left it untouched.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">There is no meaningful distinction between a denial of a motion for corrected judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083 and the denial of a motion for a corrected judgment under ORS 137.754. In either case, the court\u2019s denial of the motion does not alter the defendant\u2019s sentence. Instead, the original conviction and sentence are \u201cleft untouched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. Accordingly, in light of our holding in <em>Hart, </em>the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to ORS 137.754 is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> Pursuant to ORS 137.754, \u201ca sentencing court retains authority after entry of a judgment of conviction to comply with the requirements of ORS 137.750 or 137.752 * * *.\u201dHere, defendant asked the court to correct the judgment to \u201cindicate that Defendant is eligible for time credits under ORS 137.750 and 421.121[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> Although the document was so titled, it did not, in fact, convict defendant or impose a sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> ORS 138.083(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cThe sentencing court shall retain authority irrespective of any notice of appeal after entry of judgment of conviction to modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment.
