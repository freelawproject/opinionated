Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress that evidence. Defendant acknowledges that he was initially lawfully stopped by the police for violating a TriMet smoking regulation, but he contends that the stop became unlawful when the officers asked him if he possessed any weapons. The state contends that there was no constitutionally significant additional restriction on defendant\u2019s freedom and, alternatively, that any restriction was justified by officer safety concerns. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s findings, which are supported by evidence in the record. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 10, 115 P3d 908 (2005). Officers Humphreys and Dauchy were on patrol at around 4:00 p.m. at the Milwaukie Transit Center. They saw defendant smoking in a bus kiosk in which a \u201cno smoking\u201d sign was posted, a violation of TriMet Code 28.15(A)(2). Humphreys got out of the patrol car and approached defendant while Dauchy parked the car. Defendant, who had stepped out of the kiosk, saw Humphreys and got on his bicycle as if to ride off. Humphreys stepped in front of him and told him to \u201chold on.\u201d Defendant stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Humphreys told defendant that he had stopped him for smoking in the kiosk. Humphreys immediately noted that defendant seemed extremely nervous and that he kept bouncing his left leg, which was resting on the pedal of his bicycle. According to Humphreys, defendant was \u201cunkempt [with] kind of a ruddy appearance, indicative to me of somebody who uses methamphetamine * * *.\u201d Humphreys asked defendant for identification. He said he did not have any, so Humphreys asked for his name and date of birth. Defendant gave him the information, which Humphreys wrote in his notebook. During this exchange, Dauchy arrived and stood at defendant\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>After telling Humphreys that he did not have identification, defendant reached for his jacket pocket. Humphreys was concerned that defendant could be reaching for a weapon, so he told defendant to keep his hands where Humphreys could see them. He then asked defendant, \u201cDo you have any weapons on you or anything that might cause me concern, that might poke or stick me?\u201d Defendant replied that he had a syringe and began to reach for his pants pocket with his left hand. Humphreys \u201cgrabbed his hand and stopped him from going all the way to his pocket.\u201d He asked defendant whether the syringe was capped. Defendant said that it was and then volunteered that he had found the syringe on the ground and was going to take it to the Milwaukie Police Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">At that point, based on his observations, Humphreys suspected that defendant was in possession of illegal drugs. He asked whether defendant had any drugs on his person. Defendant said that he had two baggies in a wallet that he had found on the street and began to reach behind him toward his right rear pocket. Dauchy grabbed defendant\u2019s hand and stopped him. Humphreys asked if he could get the wallet out of defendant\u2019s pocket and look at the baggies, and defendant consented. After Humphreys retrieved the wallet, Dauchy placed defendant\u2019s hand back on the handlebars of his bicycle. Humphreys handed the wallet to Dauchy, who found two baggies containing a small amount of what appeared to be methamphetamine. The officers placed defendant under arrest. A minute to a minute and a half had passed between the time the officers initially contacted defendant and the time they arrested him. The officers then searched defendant\u2019s backpack and discovered child pornography. A subsequent investigation revealed more child pornography on defendant\u2019s computer. Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, two counts of failure to report as a sex offender, and 13 counts of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Defendant asked the court to suppress the evidence, arguing, as pertinent to this appeal, that Humphreys\u2019s inquiry about weapons had constituted an unlawful seizure. Defendant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cNow, you can ask officer safety questions under <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Bates, </em>[304 Or 519, 524, 747 P2d 991 (1987),] during the violation stop, if the officer has reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulate facts that the citizen might pose an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the officer or other officers or others, and they may take reasonable steps to protect themselves. So that essentially is the standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">\u201cNow, was there any question \u2014 at no time during this two days that we have had this hearing did the officers ever say that [defendant] ever posed any immediate threat of serious physical injury, which is the standard under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">\u00abHi ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201cSo that\u2019s where the inquiry should end, because in this case, where they first ask the name; he gives them his name. The next question, the second thing they ask immediately, according to the officer\u2019s testimony is: Do you have any weapons or kind of items of concern or drugs or things that poke? Basically an officer safety question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cSo at that point, even though they only asked one single question, even though there is no way [defendant] can go anywhere * * * There is no way there is a concern for officer safety when they ask that question about whether he has any weapons or items on him at that juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u00abHi ^ * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cThe question for the weapons is improper. And it is that very point in the stop that everything kind of flows from that. They are trying to bring \u2014 you know, kind of probable cause in this case to say: Well, from weapons we get to needles; from needles we get to drugs in wallet. From drugs in wallet we get to backpack; and backpack we get to search the computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u201cAnd the inquiry should stop right at that get-go where they are not allowed to ask about weapons, because they don\u2019t have any reasonable suspicion whatsoever that this is going to lead to any kind of serious, you know, harm whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion and, following a trial to the court, defendant was convicted of most of the charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Defendant renews his arguments on appeal. He concedes that he was lawfully stopped after the officers observed him smoking in the TriMet kiosk, but argues that the \u201cvalid stop turned into an unlawful seizure at the point Officer Humphreys asked him if he had any weapons, or anything that could poke or stick Humphreys.\u201d Defendant contends that \u201c[t]hat question, combined with the two officers\u2019 show of authority, was a significant limitation on defendant\u2019s freedom of movement and was not justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or officer safety concerns.\u201d Defendant also argues, in the alternative, that Humphreys\u2019s question about weapons \u201cunlawfully extended the duration of the otherwise valid stop.\u201d Accordingly, defendant concludes, his consent to the search of his wallet and backpack was the product of that unlawful seizure, and the challenged evidence should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The state replies that this case is controlled by <em>State v. Amaya, </em>176 Or App 35, 29 P3d 1177 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or 616, 89 P3d 1163 (2004), and <em>State v. Simcox, </em>231 Or App 399, 220 P3d 98 (2009). Based on those decisions, the state reasons that, because defendant was already lawfully stopped, Humphreys\u2019s question about weapons did not constitute a separate, unlawful seizure. Alternatively the state argues that Humphreys\u2019s question was justified under the officer safety doctrine articulated in <em>Bates. </em>Because we agree with the state that <em>Amaya </em>and <em>Simcox </em>are controlling, we need not reach the parties\u2019 alternative arguments concerning the officer safety doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We begin with preservation. An issue is preserved for appellate review if the trial court had the opportunity to \u201cidentify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). To preserve a claim that a trial court improperly denied a motion to suppress evidence as a result of an unlawful seizure, a defendant must present an argument to the trial court explaining why a specific action of an officer constituted a seizure. <em>Amaya, </em>336 Or at 630. A defendant who \u201cfailed to make any argument to the trial court that [an officer] stopped * * * [the defendant] when he took [the defendant\u2019s] license\u201d does not preserve for appellate review an argument that the taking of the defendant\u2019s license constituted an unlawful stop. <em>Id. </em>at 628. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the requirement that a defendant present each discrete legal theory could lead to problems \u201cif the preservation onion is sliced too thinly.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Here, of the two discrete legal theories defendant advances on appeal, he presented only one to the trial court\u2014 that is, that Humphreys\u2019s question constituted an unlawful seizure that was not authorized by the officer safety doctrine. Defendant did not argue that the question impermissibly <em>extended </em>the stop. Because defendant failed to preserve his argument that the officer unlawfully extended the duration of the encounter, we do not address the merits of that argument. <em>See State v. Amador, </em>230 Or App 1, 9-10, 213 P3d 846 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 533 (2010) (defendant, in arguing that officer unlawfully expanded the scope of a traffic stop, did not preserve the argument that officer had unlawfully extended the duration of the stop). <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>We now turn to defendant\u2019s argument that Humphreys\u2019s question constituted an unlawful seizure. In <em>Simcox, </em>an officer was on patrol in the early morning hours and observed three people in a park that was closed for the night, which the officer knew to be a violation of a city ordinance. 231 Or App at 401. The officer stopped his car and turned and walked toward the people. The three people also walked toward the officer. One of the three, the defendant, initiated a conversation with the officer, stating that she was lost. The officer asked the defendant if she knew that the park was closed. The defendant replied that she did not, then added that she had been in court earlier that day and that her \u201cwarrant had been released.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer then asked the defendant for her name, which she told him. The officer gave the defendant\u2019s name to another officer because he suspected, based on what she had said and on his recollection that he had seen her name on a warrant list the previous week, that there might be an outstanding warrant for her arrest. Because the defendant and her companions appeared to be nervous, the officer asked her if she had any weapons or contraband, and she said that she did not. The officer then asked if he could search the defendant, and she consented to a search. During that search, the officer found drugs. During the search, the officer also received information from the dispatcher that the defendant was on probation but had no outstanding warrants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The defendant moved to suppress that evidence, and the trial court denied her motion. <em>Id. </em>at 402. On appeal, the defendant argued that several of the officer\u2019s actions, including his question to her regarding drugs or weapons, had constituted an unlawful stop. We rejected those arguments, explaining that the officer\u2019s initial encounter with the defendant had been lawful, because the officer had probable cause to investigate her presence in the park after hours. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the encounter was lawful because the comment that the defendant made about having a warrant for her arrest \u201creleased,\u201d coupled with the officer\u2019s \u201crecollection that he had seen [the] defendant\u2019s name on a warrant list,\u201d made it reasonable to suspect \u201cthat a warrant might still be outstanding for [the] defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Having concluded that the defendant had been lawfully stopped, we rejected her argument \u2014 based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Kirkeby, </em>220 Or App 177, 185 P3d 510 (2008), <em>aff'd sub nom State v. Rodgers </em>/Kirkeby, 347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010) \u2014 that the officer had unlawfully expanded the stop or extended its duration. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201cThe first problem with defendant\u2019s argument is that, other than certain appellate court decisions involving the application of ORS 810.410 to traffic stops (and not applicable to the present circumstances), <em>no authority supports the proposition that an officer cannot, during the course of a stop that is supported by reasonable suspicion or probable cause, inquire whether the stopped person is carrying weapons </em>or contraband. <em>See State v. Amaya, </em>176 Or App 35, 44, 29 P3d 1177 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or 616, 89 P3d 1163 (2004) (questioning during a lawful stop on a matter unrelated to the basis for that stop does not require independent reasonable suspicion). The second problem with defendant\u2019s argument is that the record does not support a determination that [the officer] extended the duration of the stop when he inquired about weapons and contraband and requested consent to search; rather, the record indicates that those events transpired before [the officer] received the communication from dispatch concerning defendant\u2019s warrant status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Simcox, </em>231 Or App at 403. (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we concluded that, \u201cregardless of when [the] defendant was stopped, the stop was lawful, and [the officer\u2019s] questions that led defendant to consent to a search were permissible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The same result obtains here. Humphreys\u2019s question regarding whether defendant had any weapons or \u201cor anything that might cause me concern, that might poke or stick me\u201d was asked during the course of a lawful stop. Accordingly, that question did not constitute an unlawful seizure of defendant. The trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> The court acquitted defendant of both counts of failure to register as a sex offender and two counts of encouraging child sexual abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> Defendant also argues on appeal that the encounter was unlawfully extended under <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010). As explained below, defendant failed to preserve that argument in the trial court; accordingly, we decline to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> At this juncture, it is worth pointing out that defendant does not argue that the officers\u2019 actions <em>after </em>Humphreys\u2019s question regarding weapons constituted additional unlawful seizures. For example, defendant does not argue that Humphreys\u2019s order to him to \u201ckeep his hands where I could see them,\u201d or Humphreys\u2019s or Dauchy\u2019s acts of grabbing defendant\u2019s arm to prevent him from reaching his pockets, in and of themselves, constituted unlawful seizures. Defendant\u2019s argument before the trial court and on appeal is simply that Humphreys\u2019s question concerning weapons <em>alone </em>constituted an unlawful seizure. As we explain below, it did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> In the course of orally ruling on defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court stated that the officers had not \u201cinappropriate[ly] lengthenfed]\u201d the encounter. Defendant said nothing regarding that statement. The trial court\u2019s passing reference to an \u201cinappropriate lengthening\u201d argument not being made by defendant at trial cannot render that argument preserved for use by defendant on appeal. <em>See </em>Amador, 230 Or App 1, 9 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
