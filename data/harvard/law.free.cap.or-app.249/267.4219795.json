Defendant advances six assignments of error, arguing that the trial court erred by (1) excluding evidence of bias by one of the victims who testified at trial; (2) prohibiting defendant from offering certain expert testimony; (3) failing to grant a judgment of acquittal on the charges of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse; (4) failing to do the same on the charge of compelling prostitution; (5) failing to declare a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s comments and body language during closing arguments; and (6) not merging the verdicts for encouraging child sexual abuse into a single conviction. We reject defendant\u2019s first two assignments (exclusion of evidence) and fifth assignment (mistrial) without discussion. And, for the reasons that follow, we also affirm the convictions for first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, but we reverse the conviction for compelling prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse based on forensic evidence of child pornography seized from his home computer. Under ORS 163.684(l)(a)(A) (2009), a person commits first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse if the person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201c[k]nowingly develops, <em>duplicates, </em>publishes, prints, disseminates, exchanges, displays, finances, attempts to finance or sells <em>any photograph, motion picture, videotape or other visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child </em>or possesses such matter with the intent to develop, duplicate, publish, print, disseminate, exchange, display or sell it * * * \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">(Emphasis added.) The state presented evidence that defendant installed a software program on his home computer that allowed him to access a peer-to-peer file-sharing network via <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>his Internet connection. Defendant used that software to search the network for files related to child pornography, selected file names from his queries by highlighting them with his cursor, and then double-clicked on the file names to initiate a download request. The downloaded files, including two videos of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct, were saved to the hard drive of his home computer. The state also presented evidence that defendant had attempted to delete the files from his hard drive but that, with special forensic software, the files (or parts of them) were recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the state failed to prove that he actually \u201cduplicated\u201d the videos at issue within the meaning of ORS 163.684, let alone \u201cknowingly duplicated\u201d them. According to defendant, duplication, at least for purposes of ORS 163.684, refers to those who <em>produce </em>and <em>distribute </em>child pornography, and \u201cnot those who merely possess it without that intention.\u201d Moreover, he argues, there is no evidence that he knew (1) that, by highlighting and double-clicking on the files, they would create a duplicate on his computer or (2) that the files he highlighted and double-clicked would actually contain child pornography \u2014 in defendant\u2019s words, \u201cthe name of an electronic file, even strongly <em>indicative </em>of child pornography\u201d does not show that the file itself will <em>\u201cnecessarily </em>contain child pornography.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendant concedes that he did not advance those contentions below, but he urges us to review them as plain error. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The state, meanwhile, argues that, whatever the merits of defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201cknowingly duplicate\u201d under ORS 163.684, the matter is not beyond reasonable dispute \u2014 one of the prerequisites of plain error review. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (for error to be plain, (1) it must be an error of law; (2) it must be \u201capparent,\u201d meaning the legal point must be obvious, that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) it must appear on the record, meaning that the court need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to identify the error). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>agree with the state; the error in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on the charges of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, if error at all, was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Defendant initially contends that, for purposes of ORS 163.684, \u201cduplicating\u201d child pornography requires more than simply downloading such a video from a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. According to defendant, \u201c \u2018[downloading,\u2019 just like picking up a magazine, allows the user to view an image,\u201d whereas \u201cduplication\u201d refers to \u201cthose who \u2018produce\u2019 and \u2018distribute\u2019 pornography.\u201d (Citing <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 718, 160 P3d 983 (2007) (explaining that ORS 163.684 prohibits persons \u201cfrom knowingly committing a series of acts regarding child pornography (and also from possessing child pornography with the intent to commit those acts),\u201d which \u201cDJogically * * * divide into two categories: <em>producing </em>child pornography and <em>distributing </em>it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The question whether a person \u201cduplicates\u201d child pornography within the meaning of ORS 163.684 by downloading videos from a peer-to-peer network is one of first impression in Oregon \u2014 and the answer is not beyond dispute. To begin with, defendant\u2019s analogy is unhelpful; downloading a file from a peer-to-peer network is not like simply picking up a magazine. Rather, there is evidence in this record that, when defendant double-clicked on the file names that resulted from his queries, he requested and received digital copies of videos that were present on other computers in the peer-to-peer file-sharing network. That is, after he downloaded the videos, he had his <em>own copies </em>of them, which he could then display on his own computer whenever he wanted, or could share with others. That type of a file download from a peer-to-peer network is, at least arguably, more than \u201cviewing\u201d and instead constitutes \u201cduplication\u201d within the ordinary meaning of the term. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>702 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cduplicate\u201d as \u201cto make double or twofold\u201d and \u201cto be or make a duplicate, copy, or transcript of\u2019). Furthermore, there is a credible argument that downloading a video to a personal computer, which can then be viewed independently of the original video or shared with others in the peer-to-peer network, is precisely the type of proliferation of child pornography that the legislature intended to combat in ORS 163.684.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Nor are we persuaded by defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the state\u2019s proof regarding his mental state, <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement in ORS 163.684. In short, the evidence of defendant\u2019s intentions and awareness of the downloading process on a peer-to-peer network is not nearly as thin as he suggests. A trier of fact could infer that defendant was a sophisticated enough user of the file-sharing software program, which he installed on his computer, to understand its most basic feature: the ability to share files with other users. In other words, a trier of fact could infer on this record that defendant knew he was searching for, and downloading to his home computer, someone else\u2019s videos of children engaged in sexual activity. If the bar for \u201cknowingly\u201d in ORS 163.684 is set higher than that, it is not obvious to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions involving second-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, <em>State v. Ritchie, </em>349 Or 572, 248 P3d 405 (2011), and <em>State v. Barger, </em>349 Or 553, 247 P3d 309, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>350 Or 233, 253 P3d 1030 (2011), are not to the contrary. In <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Barger, </em>the court held that the defendants\u2019 acts of searching for and viewing child pornography on Internet sites were insufficient to prove that those defendants knowingly \u201cpossesse[d] or controlled]\u201d the digital images. <em>Ritchie, </em>349 Or at 584-85; <em>Barger, </em>349 Or at 566-67; <em>see also </em>ORS 163.686 (a person commits the crime of second-degree encouraging child sexual abuse if the person \u201cknowingly possesses or controls\u201d child pornography). The court reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions notwithstanding digital copies of the images that were found in the unallocated space of the defendants\u2019 hard drives. <em>Ritchie, </em>349 Or at 578-79; <em>Barger, </em>349 Or at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Barger, </em>however, are distinguishable from this case both legally and factually. One obvious difference is that <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Barger </em>construe different statutory language. Whereas those cases involved the meaning of \u201cpossess\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d under ORS 163.686, this case involves the meaning of the term \u201cduplicate\u201d in ORS 163.684. But if that difference were not enough, the cases also involve materially different factual records. The conduct at issue in <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Barger </em>was limited to displaying digital images on a computer screen; to the extent that there were copies made, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>was an automatic \u201ccaching\u201d function of the computer\u2019s web browser, a function that would not necessarily be known to \u201c[c]omputer users with ordinary skills.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Barger, </em>349 Or at 556. Indeed, as Chief Justice De Muniz emphasized in his concurrence in <em>Barger,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\u201cthe prosecution made a choice in both these cases not to argue that the legislature had intended that the \u2018possession or control\u2019 element of ORS 163.686 could be satisfied by <em>the storage </em>in the computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache, and later in the unallocated space in the computer\u2019s hard drive, of the digital images that each defendant had viewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">349 Or at 568 (De Muniz, C. J., concurring) (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, there is evidence that defendant installed and used a file-sharing program that allowed him to save copies of the videos to his own computer, which he could then access whenever he wished. Neither <em>Ritchie </em>nor <em>Barger </em>addresses that type of conduct. For that reason, and the others set forth above, we conclude that the trial court did not plainly err in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on the charges of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Alternatively, defendant argues that, even if he was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the two counts of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, the trial court nonetheless erred in entering two separate convictions. Defendant did not preserve that contention either, and is thus limited to arguing plain error. According to defendant, the only possible \u201cvictim\u201d of the crime of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse is the state. Consequently, he argues, Oregon\u2019s antimerger statute, ORS 161.067, is not applicable at all, <em>see State v. Camarena-Velasco, </em>207 Or App 19, 22, 139 P3d 979 (2006) (\u201c[T]he state is not a \u2018victim\u2019 for purposes of ORS 161.067.\u201d), and even if the statute were to apply when the state is the victim, the alleged \u201cduplication sessions\u201d were not separated by a sufficient pause to support separate convictions for the two videos, ORS 161.067(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We have previously held that defendant\u2019s premise\u2014 namely, that the \u201cvictim\u201d in ORS 163.684 is the state and not the child in the image or video \u2014 is a matter reasonably in dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cThe issue raised by the parties\u2019 arguments is how many victims were involved in defendant\u2019s crimes. That is, it is not clear whether \u2014 when multiple charges are based on images of different children- \u2014 ORS 163.684 contemplates that there was one victim or more than one victim, or whether the statute is intended instead to promote the general welfare of children, rather than to address a criminal act committed against a particular person. Because ORS 163.684 is subject to all of the above interpretations, it is not clear which subsection of ORS 161.067, if any, governs the merger issue in this case. No Oregon case has addressed that issue, and the answer is not obvious. Because that point of law is reasonably in dispute, the trial court did not commit plain error in entering separate convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>State v. Betnar, </em>214 Or App 416, 433, 166 P3d 554 (2007). We are still of that view and therefore reject defendant\u2019s unpreserved merger arguments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We turn, next, to defendant\u2019s unpreserved argument regarding his conviction for compelling prostitution. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>state charged defendant with violating ORS 167.017(1) (2009),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which makes it a crime to (a) use force or intimidation to compel another to engage in prostitution, (b) induce or cause a person under 18 to engage in prostitution, or (c) induce or cause the person\u2019s spouse, child, or stepchild to engage in prostitution. The state presented evidence that defendant provided gifts and money to a child victim in exchange for sexual contact. Defendant now argues that the state failed to prove a violation of ORS 167.017(1), which applies to third-party promoters of prostitution rather than patrons. <em>State v. Vargas-Torres, </em>237 Or App 619, 627, 242 P3d 619 (2010) (\u201c[T]here is no evidence that defendant acted as a third-party promoter, and that is what is required for compelling prostitution.\u201d). Defendant requests that we exercise our discretion to correct the error by reversing his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The state concedes that, in light of <em>Vargas-Torres, </em>which was decided after defendant\u2019s trial, the evidence in this record \u2014 that defendant offered gifts and money in exchange for sexual contact \u2014 is plainly insufficient to support a conviction for <em>compelling </em>prostitution. Nonetheless, the state argues that the record is sufficient to support a conviction for prostitution, ORS 167.007, a crime involving \u201cpay[ing] or offering] or agreeing] to pay a fee to engage in sexual conduct or sexual contact.\u201d <em>See Vargas-Torres, </em>237 Or App at 626 (\u201cPatrons are subject to prosecution for prostitution, under ORS 167.007.\u201d). Thus, the state argues, \u201c[t]his court should vacate the conviction for compelling prostitution, and remand for a conviction of the lesser-included offense of prostitution and for resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The state offers no explanation or authority for its assertion that prostitution is a lesser-included offense of compelling prostitution. Nor is that a self-evident proposition. In <em>Vargas-Torres, </em>we explained that the crime of compelling prostitution, ORS 167.017, \u201cis one of three statutes, enacted as part of the 1971 Criminal Code, to criminalize prostitution-related activities\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cThe statutes define three different, and increasingly serious, crimes. The first statute, ORS 167.007, defines prostitution, and it applies to prostitutes and patrons. The second statute, ORS 167.012, defines promoting prostitution, and, according to the commentary to the criminal code, it applies to persons engaged in \u2018conduct characteristic of prostitution <em>carried on as a commercial enterprise.\u2019 </em>Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 251, 241 (July 1971) (emphasis added). \u2018It is designed to reach the typical \u201cpanderer,\u201d \u201cpimp\u201d and \u201cmadam.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>The third statute, ORS 167.017, which is the statute at issue in this case, defines the crime of compelling prostitution. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">\u201c* * * [T]he context and legislative history establish that promoting prostitution and compelling prostitution (as an aggravated form of promoting prostitution) are intended to apply to those engaged in prostitution \u2018carried on as a commercial enterprise,\u2019 that is, \u2018panderer,\u2019 \u2018pimp,\u2019 and \u2018madam.\u2019 They apply to third-party promoters, not patrons. Patrons are subject to prosecution for prostitution, under ORS 167.007.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">237 Or App at 624-26 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In other words, for purposes of the statutory scheme, compelling or promoting prostitution are different in kind, not degree, from engaging in prostitution itself. Here, the state did not prove that defendant committed a lesser-included offense of the crime charged; if anything, it proved an entirely different offense. Under those circumstances, where the state failed to prove the alleged crime, the correct remedy on appeal is reversal of the conviction. <em>E.g., Vargas-Torres, </em>237 Or App at 627 (reversing conviction for compelling prostitution where the defendant induced the victim to engage in prostitution with the defendant rather than with others).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In sum, we conclude that defendant\u2019s conviction for compelling prostitution was not supported by sufficient evidence in the record. We further conclude that it is appropriate under the circumstances \u2014 particularly, our intervening decision in <em>Vargas-Torres </em>\u2014 to exercise our discretion to correct the now-plain error by reversing the conviction. <em>See State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 51, 243 P3d 862 (2010) (\u201cAlthough the failure to move for a judgment of acquittal is ordinarily fatal to an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that, given the intervening elucidation of controlling legal principles * * *, the entry of convictions for criminal mistreatment on this record constitutes plain error, and we affirmatively exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, </em>Inc., 312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to address and remedy that error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In Case No. 09C42021, conviction for compelling prostitution reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.
