A detailed recitation of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. On appeal, respondent contends that the record lacked sufficient evidence to establish an objectively reasonable basis for petitioner to have felt alarmed or coerced. We agree and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B) provides that a court may enter an SPO against a person if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The evidence submitted to the court was legally insufficient to establish the requisite objectively reasonable alarm on petitioner\u2019s part. Thus, the trial court erred in entering an SPO against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
