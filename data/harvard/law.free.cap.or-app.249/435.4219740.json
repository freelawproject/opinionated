Kurokawa-Lasciak, </em>351 Or 179, 263 P3d 336 (2011) <em>(Kurokawa-Lasciak II)- </em>In our original opinion, <em>State v. Kurokawa-Lasciak, </em>237 Or App 492, 498, 239 P3d 1046 (2010) <em>{Kurokawa-Lasciak I), </em>we held that a law enforcement officer\u2019s warrantless search of defendant\u2019s van, leading to the discovery of various controlled substances, did not violate Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, because the search fell within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement \u2014 the so-called \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d Because we held that the search was valid under that exception, we did not reach the state\u2019s alternative argument that the search was also valid because defendant\u2019s companion consented to it. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the search did <em>not </em>fall within the automobile exception, and remanded the case for us to consider the state\u2019s argument that the police had valid consent. <em>Kurokawa-Lasciak II, </em>351 Or at 193. We now conclude that defendant\u2019s companion lacked authority to consent to a search of the vehicle and, for that reason, the search was unlawful. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s suppression of evidence that the search disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The following facts are consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings and its decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>State v. Meharry, </em>342 Or 173, 175, 149 P3d 1155 (2006) (stating standard). Defendant, his companion Campbell, and their three children were at the Seven Feathers Casino, where defendant was gambling. A casino employee monitoring defendant\u2019s conduct noticed that he would buy chips with small-denomination bills, play casino games, and then cash in the chips for large-denomination bills. The employee suspected that defendant was engaged in money laundering. As a result, the casino barred defendant from further cash transactions and posted his photograph in the cashiers\u2019 cages. When a cashier later refused to carry out a cash transaction for defendant, he reached through the cage, grabbed his photo, and left the casino. A casino employee telephoned a state trooper, Bennett, and reported that defendant had stolen casino property \u2014 the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Shortly thereafter, a different officer, Wohls, detained defendant for questioning in the casino parking lot as defendant was walking away from a van. Bennett, the trooper, arrived at the scene and also spoke to defendant. He asked defendant about the van and whether it contained drugs. When defendant did not respond, Bennett arrested him for disorderly conduct and third-degree theft; he also asked defendant for consent to search the van. Defendant refused. Bennett then told defendant that he could either consent to a search of the van or be taken to jail for disorderly conduct and theft. Defendant responded that he did not believe that Bennett\u2019s offer was sincere. Bennett then repeated his request to search the van, and also requested consent to search defendant\u2019s pockets and the room at the casino where defendant was staying. The Supreme Court related the remaining facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201cDefendant said that he wanted to talk to a lawyer. Bennett told defendant that he was impounding the van and that he would get a search warrant. Wohls interjected that Bennett must inventory the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cAt approximately 10:14 a.m., Wohls took defendant to the Douglas County Jail, leaving defendant\u2019s van parked at the casino. Neither Wohls nor Bennett impounded the van, inventoried its contents, or made efforts to obtain a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201cInstead, Bennett continued his investigation and learned that defendant had given the van\u2019s keys to his girlfriend, Laura Campbell, and instructed her to lock the van, take care of the family dog, go to the casino\u2019s restaurant to eat, and stay put until he returned. At approximately 10:28 a.m., Bennett went into the restaurant to speak with Campbell. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201cBennett asked Campbell whether the van contained a large amount of money or drugs. Campbell replied that she did not know of any. Bennett then asked whether there was marijuana in the van; Campbell said that there was. Bennett asked whether the amount of marijuana was over or under an ounce; Campbell replied, \u2018It is probably under, but it could be over a little bit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cBennett asked Campbell if she would consent to a search of the van. Campbell hesitated and told Bennett that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>she was not sure if she could consent because she was not listed on the rental agreement. Campbell told Bennett that she had the keys to the van and that it may be her intention to leave. However, Campbell agreed to meet Bennett outside the restaurant, by the van, when she and her children finished their breakfast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">\u201cAt approximately 11:00 a.m., Campbell met Bennett at the van and recorded his conversation with her. Bennett asked for Campbell\u2019s consent to search, and Campbell told Bennett that she was feeling \u2018badgered.\u2019 Bennett denied that he was badgering Campbell and continued to talk with her. Bennett allowed Campbell to take the dog out of the van and make a telephone call. At approximately 11:15 a.m., Campbell signed a \u2018consent to search\u2019 form. Bennett searched the van and found the evidence that was the subject of the later motion to suppress: 77 grams of marijuana, 56 grams of hashish, electronic scales, and approximately $48,000 in cash.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Kurokawa-Lasciak II, </em>351 Or at 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Based on those facts, defendant was charged with delivery of a controlled substance, ORS 475.840, possession of marijuana, ORS 475.864, money laundering, ORS 164.170, third-degree theft, ORS 164.043, and second-degree disorderly conduct, ORS 166.025. He moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the search, citing Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. The trial court granted the motion, reasoning that, under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 US 103, 126 S Ct 1515, 164 L Ed 2d 208 (2006), Campbell lacked authority to consent to the search of the van after defendant had previously refused permission. In <em>Randolph, </em>547 US at 106, the Court held that \u201ca physically present co-occupant\u2019s stated refusal to permit entry prevails\u201d over the voluntary consent of the other occupant. On the state\u2019s appeal, this court determined that the warrantless search was permitted by the automobile exception. <em>Kurokawa-Lasciak </em>1,237 Or App at 499. We therefore did not reach the state\u2019s contention that the search was permitted based on Campbell\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The Supreme Court disagreed with our conclusion that the search was permitted under the automobile exception, explaining that the automobile exception did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>because the vehicle was not mobile at the time police first encountered it in connection with a crime. <em>Kurokawa-Lasciak II, </em>351 Or at 194. The court remanded the case to us for consideration of the state\u2019s alternative argument that the warrantless search was authorized by Campbell\u2019s consent. We now address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Randolph, </em>and whether it extends to consent obtained over the refusal of a <em>nonpresent </em>co-occupant of a <em>vehicle </em>instead of a dwelling, is relevant in this case only if we decide that defendant\u2019s rights were not protected under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. For that reason, we begin our analysis with the state constitutional question. <em>Sterling v. Cupp, </em>290 Or 611, 614, 625 P2d 123 (1981) (when state\u2019s law protects person\u2019s rights, no federal question arises).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because, as explained below, we conclude that the search in this case violated Article I, section 9, we affirm the trial court without reaching the federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The general rule governing third-party consent has not changed significantly since 1983, when the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>State v. Carsey, </em>295 Or 32, 44, 664 P2d 1085 (1983), adopted the rule from <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 US 164, 94 S Ct 988, 39 L Ed 2d 242 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cThe <em>Matlock </em>rule rests upon the premise that one who jointly occupies premises assumes the risk that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>co-occupant \u2018might permit the common area to be searched.\u2019 <em>Matlock, </em>415 US at 171 n 7 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201c* * * Before police can search premises in reliance upon the consent of a third person, they should ascertain that the defendant and the consenting party have a common use, access, or control of the premises to be searched.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\"><em>Carsey, </em>295 Or at 44-46. Although <em>Carsey </em>was decided under the Fourth Amendment, we subsequently adopted the same rule under Article I, section 9, holding that \u201ccommon authority to validly consent to a search \u2018rests on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Will, </em>131 Or App 498, 504, 885 P2d 715 (1994) (quoting <em>Matlock, </em>415 US at 171 n 7). The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the consenting person has the requisite authority. <em>City of Portland v. Paulson, </em>98 Or App 328, 330, 779 P2d 188 (1989). We defer to the trial court\u2019s express and implicit findings of fact, but whether those facts support a conclusion that the consenting person had authority is a legal question. <em>State v. Beylund, </em>158 Or App 410, 417, 976 P2d 1141, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 594 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The rule from <em>Carsey </em>onward has derived principally from the idea that one joint occupant of premises has for most purposes assumed the risk that another occupant might permit a search of those premises. <em>Matlock, </em>415 US at 171 n 7; <em>Carsey, </em>295 Or at 44; <em>State v. Fuller, </em>158 Or App 501, 506, 976 P2d 1137 (1999) (\u201cCentral to search and seizure law is whether an individual has, in some way, assumed the risk that a third party may legally consent to a search of that individual\u2019s property.\u201d); <em>Beylund, </em>158 Or at 418 (\u201c[Defendant legally assumed the risk that [his tenant], the person he placed in charge of his property, would consent to a search.\u201d). Consequently, we have repeatedly held that the scope of a person\u2019s authority depends on the level of access that the co-occupants have agreed on. Thus, when there is no evident agreement to the contrary, one co-occupant is presumed to have completely assumed all risk that the other will consent to a search; the other has a full quantum of authority. For example, in <em>Beylund, </em>158 Or App at 418, we held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>defendant \u201clegally assumed the risk\u201d that his tenant would consent to a search because the tenant \u201chad full access to the shop basement and entered it regularly to tend the marijuana plants. <em>There is no contrary evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Likewise, in <em>State v. Surface/Hurley, </em>183 Or App 368, 374-75, 51 P3d 713 (2002), we held that the defendants expressly gave house-sitters full control of \u201cthe household and everything pertaining to it,\u201d and, consequently, the house-sitters had \u201cactual authority\u201d over the defendants\u2019 freezer and \u201ccould lawfully consent to a search of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Conversely, we have also held that, where a defendant has expressly or by implication limited a co-occupant\u2019s authority, the resulting consent depends on whether the search is within that limited authority. In <em>Carsey, </em>295 Or at 43, for example, the Supreme Court held that police could not rely on a grandmother\u2019s consent to search her grandson\u2019s room in the house that they shared because the evidence indicated that the defendant had not granted his grandmother control over the room. In <em>Fuller, </em>158 Or App at 506, we held that, although the defendant and his girlfriend shared not only a house but a bedroom, and the girlfriend had authority to consent to a general search of the premises, the evidence indicated that she did not have authority to consent to a search of the defendant\u2019s nightstand. Even within a parent-child relationship, we have held, \u201cthe presence or absence of common authority hinges, necessarily, on the particular agreement between parent and child. Thus, whether defendant\u2019s parents had common authority to consent to the search of the garage here turns on their specific agreement with defendant regarding his use of the garage.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>179 Or App 92, 101, 39 P3d 868, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 632 (2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Under these precepts, the consent issue in this case reduces to the question of whether defendant and Campbell had an understanding that Campbell had common access to and control of the van when she gave Bennett consent to search it. The trial court, relying on a federal case under the Fourth Amendment <em>(United States v. Morales, </em>861 F2d 396 (3rd Cir 1988)), ruled that Campbell had authority to consent (although, as noted, the court also ruled that that consent was superseded by defendant\u2019s refusal). We do not find <em>Morales </em>helpful. The only issue in that case was whether a person who is the driver, but not the lessee, of a rental car, can consent to a search of the entire car, and the court based its decision on the fact that Morales, as the nonlessee driver, had immediate possession of and control over the car: \u201cBy giving Morales control over the car, [the actual lessee] conferred on Morales power to consent to a reasonable search of it <em>Lid. </em>at 399. No such delegation of control exists on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only evidence that Campbell had control of defendant\u2019s van was the fact that he had given her the key. However, as we have previously held, mere possession of the key to premises does not necessarily indicate complete access or control. <em>Fuller, </em>158 Or App at 506 (consenting co-occupant had key, but nonetheless lacked authority to consent to search of nightstand).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The evidence in this case establishes that, although defendant gave Campbell the key to the van (and to that extent gave her control and access) the control and access were very narrowly limited \u2014 so much so that we conclude without difficulty that the access and control did not encompass consent to search. As Campbell and Bennett both testified, defendant gave Campbell the key after defendant had refused consent to search, after he was arrested, and when he knew that he was being taken away from the casino. Under those circumstances, he told Campbell to, \u201clock the van, take care of the family dog, go to the casino\u2019s restaurant to eat, and stay put until he returned.\u201d <em>Kurokawa-Lasciak II, </em>351 Or at 183. Regarding those instructions, Campbell testified, \u201cHe gave me the keys, and he said, \u2018[c]ome check on the dog, lock it up, and don\u2019t go anywhere, just wait for me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201cQ: And you knew you were in a rental vehicle, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">\u201cA: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cQ: And did you know whether or not you were authorized to exercise control over that car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cA: Yeah. I knew I didn\u2019t have \u2014 I wasn\u2019t on the rental agreement. I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cQ: Did you know you were not insured to drive the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\u201cA: Right. I knew I didn\u2019t have insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201cQ: And was there any doubt in your mind about what [defendant] meant when he said, \u2018Stay here. Lock it up. Wait for me to come back\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">\u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">\u201cQ: [Was there] ever a time when you kind of reached a decision and decided to go ahead and consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">\u201cA: There wasn\u2019t. There was not \u2014 I said no probably twice. Like in the restaurant, I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t have the authority.\u2019 Like, \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 And then [Bennett] said, \u2018Well, you have the keys. You do have the authority.\u2019 We went out of the restaurant and I met him again. I was like, \u2018Well, I really don\u2019t think I can just because I don\u2019t have the authority. And again he assured me, \u2018Well, you do have the authority.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-15\">\u00ab\u00edK \u2021 &gt;f\u00ed sji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-16\">\u201cQ: The prosecutor suggested to you that you could come and go as you please, and that you had the keys to the van. What did [defendant] tell you? What were his specific directions to you when he handed you the keys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-17\">\u201cA. He said, \u2018Come back and check [on] the dog, and wait here. Don\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll be back. Wait for me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-18\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you to lock the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-19\">\u201cA. Yeah, he said to lock it, keep it locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-20\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you to stay there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-21\">\u201cA. Yeah. \u2018Don\u2019t go anywhere,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just wait here for me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201cQ. And when he told you that, did you take that to mean lock the vehicle and leave it locked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cA. Yeah. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cQ. Was he at all hazy or ambiguous about that, or was it very, very clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cA. No. It was clear to keep it locked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Until Bennett persuaded her to the contrary, Campbell clearly believed that she did not have authority beyond extracting the family dog, locking the van, and keeping it locked. We conclude that her belief was correct; defendant\u2019s instructions, in light of his circumstances, can only be construed as imposing strict limitations on Campbell\u2019s access to the van, and those limitations did not encompass consenting to a search. Put another way, if defendant had ever assumed the risk that Campbell might have consented to allow a police officer to search the van, he negated that assumption with his instructions to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">We therefore conclude that, when Bennett obtained consent to search, that consent was not authorized. Because the search of the van was not lawful under the automobile exception or the consent exception and the state suggests no other justification, the evidence that was seized from the van was unlawfully obtained. The trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"> In <em>State v. Carsey, </em>295 Or 32, 34 n 1, 664 P2d 1085 (1983), the Supreme Court decided a \u201cthird party consent\u201d case under the Fourth Amendment, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cAs we have often stated, we normally consider Oregon constitutional questions before any federal constitutional question because the state does not deny any right claimed under the federal constitution when the claim before the court is fully met by state law. We would do so in this case if the case had not been briefed and argued under the federal constitution and the defendant had claimed that his rights under the state constitution are different from and greater than his rights under the federal counterpart. Not having been raised, however, and because we agree with the Court of Appeals that the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the defendant is entitled to greater protection under Article I, section 9, of the Constitution of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">(Citations omitted.) This court as well recently considered a third-party consent case under the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Caster, </em>236 Or App 214, 234 P3d 1087 (2010). This case, however, was presented to the trial court as arising under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and we perceive no reason to deviate from our policy of examining state questions before federal ones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> <em>State v. Lambert, </em>134 Or App 148, 894 P2d 1189 (1995), is not to the contrary. In that case, a visitor in a house gave police authority to search the defendant\u2019s room. The defendant argued that the visitor lacked authority because she had no relationship with the landlord. We held that the visitor\u2019s authority did not derive from her relationship with the landlord; we did not address the question whether her authority derived from her relationship with the <em>defendant. </em>Had there been evidence that the defendant had expressly told the visitor to stay out of his room, we would likely have reached a different outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-5\"> Further, of course, <em>Morales </em>is a federal case under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
