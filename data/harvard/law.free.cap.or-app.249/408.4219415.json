She raises six assignments of error. We reject five of mother\u2019s assignments of error without discussion and write only to address her sixth assignment of error, in which she contends that the trial court erred in awarding retroactive child support for a period of 60 days prior to the entry of the supplemental judgment. After entry of the supplemental judgment, the trial court issued a letter opinion indicating that it agreed with mother\u2019s assertion that retroactive child support should not be awarded in this case and instructing father\u2019s counsel to \u201cimmediately submit an amended supplemental judgment correcting the time for commencement of the payment of child support.\u201d On appeal, father does not contend that the retroactive support award was proper in this case, but asserts that in light of the trial court\u2019s letter opinion, \u201cthe court ruled in [mjother\u2019s favor, and the issue is moot.\u201d Father acknowledges, however, that \u201can amended supplemental judgment was not submitted to the trial court for signature * * * because [mjother had previously filed her [n]otice of [a]ppeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s determination that retroactive support should not have been awarded in this case, the judgment on appeal provides for payment of retroactive support. Accordingly, mother\u2019s sixth assignment of error is not moot. <em>See Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 406, 848 P2d 1194 (1993) (a case is moot when \u201ca court\u2019s decision no longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to correct the retroactive child support award; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
