The appellants are not, within the meaning of the statute, \u201c persons aggrieved by the order, sentence, decree or denial of the judge of probate.\u201d Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>83, \u00a7 34. They have no interest in the questions which the judge of probate decided. At the time their conveyances were made, the note was personal estate, and the mortgage only an incident to it. Although by the foreclosure the assets have assumed the form of real estate, that real estate is held in equity for the benefit of the same persons who would have been entitled to a distributive share of it, if it had remained personal estate. The security follows the debt. If a partition of it were made by order of the court of probate among the next of kin, these appellants could only take as trustees for the persons to whom they had assigned the beneficial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">It is true that the conveyance created only an equitable assignment; but such an.assignment the law will recognize and protect. And although it may be true ihat all legal remedies for the violation of such an equitable right must be prosecuted in the name of the assignor, yet courts of justice will allow the assignee to use the name of the assignor without his consent, and even against his will, in seeking the remedy,' and will not permit the assignor to assert his legal title against the wifi of the assignee. <em>Grover </em>v.
