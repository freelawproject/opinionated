The declaration contained two counts; one for forcibly entering the plaintiff\u2019s close in Woburn, and taking and carrying away his dog and destroying it, and converting it to the defendant\u2019s own use; and the second count differing only in not alleging a breach of the plaintiff\u2019s close. The defendant in the answer denied all the facts alleged, except the killing of the dog; and alleged that, acting under the orders of a deputy, residing in that town, of the sheriff of Middlesex, he killed the dog, because it was going at large, and not registered and numbered and wearing a collar, as required by <em>St. </em>1858, <em>c. </em>139.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">At the trial in the court of common pleas in Middlesex at June term 1859, the defendant proved the facts alleged in the answer; and that the defendant upon the 24th of September 1858, finding the dog outside of the plaintiff\u2019s close, followed it into the plaintiff\u2019s house without his leave, and carried away the dog and killed it. It was agreed that the dog was three months old upon said 24th of September, and that its value was fifty cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">Upon these facts, <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. instructed the jury that the defendant had no right to go upon the plaintiff\u2019s close and kill the dog; and directed a verdict for the plaintiff for fifty cents, which was returned; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-10\"><em>J.M. Randall, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANS\">to the point that the dog was lawfully killed, cited Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>58, \u00a7 12; <em>St. </em>1858, <em>c. </em>139, \u00a7 1; 3 Bl. Com. 213; <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>18 Pick. 262; and <em>Pierret </em>v. <em>Moller, </em>3 E. D. Smith C. P. 576; and contended that, although the defendant went upon the plaintiff\u2019s close without his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>leave, yet, as the jury had assessed no damages for the trespass, it was not an issue in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\"><em>E. </em>D. <em>Hayden, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABs\">We are of opinion that the defendant was not authorized by <em>St. </em>1858, <em>c. </em>139, to enter the plaintiff\u2019s house, without his leave, for the purpose of taking away his dog. The entry into the house was a trespass, and the subsequent killing of the dog unjustifiable, even if the killing would otherwise have been lawful. We have not considered the question, whether a dog three months old in September is required by <em>St. </em>1858 to be registered and numbered, and to wear a collar, before the first day of the next May.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Though the defendant was liable to damages, on the first count, for entering the house, as well as for the killing of the dog, yet it is not for him to take the exception that no damages were assessed for such entry. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
