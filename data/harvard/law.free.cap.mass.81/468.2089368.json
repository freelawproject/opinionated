Isaac Woodward &amp; another <em>vs. </em>Same.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b478-8\">A superintendent of alien passengers appointed under <em>St, </em>1837, <em>c. </em>238, went upon a vessel arriving with alien passengers on board, and, showing the statute to the owner, told him that he was liable to pay head money for each alien passenger landed, (as he was indeed required to do by an unconstitutional and therefore void clause of the statute,) but used no force and made no threats. The owner, through fear that, if he refused to pay, his passengers would not be 'allowed to land and his business would be broken up, promised to pay the money, and did pay it when called upon after the landing of the passengers, and, if he had refused to pay according to his promise, would not after-wards have been permitted to land any alien passengers. <em>ITeld, </em>that the payment was voluntary and not under duress, even if the superintendent told the owner -at their first interview that he would not be allowed to land his alien passengers until the law had been complied therewith, and that he was there to enforce the law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-9\">Actions of contract to recover back sums of money paid to the superintendent of alien passengers of the city of Boston at different times between the 20th of May 1843 and the 8th of May 1848, for alien passengers brought to Boston from the British provinces in steamboats owned by the plaintiffs. The <em>St. </em>of 1837, <em>c. </em>238, under which these payments were made, was held unconstitutional by the supreme court of the United States in <em>Norris </em>v. Boston, 7 How. 283, reversing the judgment of this court in 4 Met. 282. Each case was submitted to the decision of the court upon facts agreed, which in the <em>first </em>case were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-10\">\u201c The alien passengers so brought by the plaintiff were landed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>in the city, and for each of them the plaintiff paid two dollars to the superintendent of alien passengers. The money in every instance was paid after the passengers were landed, in pursuance of the plaintiff\u2019s promise made to the superintendent before they were landed. The superintendent always went on board the plaintiff\u2019s boats, (in some instances before they came to the wharf,) took from the clerk his list of passengers, called over their names and required them to answer. He examined them whenever he deemed it necessary, and, while on board, made known to the plaintiff the amount of head money which he required him to pay. This amount the plaintiff promised to pay, and did in fact pay when called upon. The superintendent was accustomed to furnish the master of the boat with a copy of the law under which he acted, and to say to him that he, as also the owners and consignees, were liable to pay two dollars for each alien passenger landed. No force was used, nor were any threats made by the superintendent. The plaintiff yielded to the demand of the superintendent through fear that, if he refused to pay, his passengers would not be allowed to land, and that his business would be broken up. If he had refused to pay according to his promise, he would not afterwards have been permitted to land any alien passengers till he had paid the head money. The payments were made without protest and without notice by the plaintiff that he should seek to recover back the money. No demand was made on the city before the commencement of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The facts stated in the <em>second </em>case were similar, except that \u201c the superintendent, the first time he went on board the boat, said to one of the plaintiffs that he would not be allowed to land his alien passengers unless the requirements of the law were complied with, and that he was there to enforce the law; \u201d that \u201c one of the plaintiffs, before making the payment, told the superintendent that he considered the law unconstitutional; \u201d and that \u201c the plaintiffs paid the money because they felt themselves in honor bound to the superintendent, and because they feared that, if they refused to pay, they would be sued and their boat attached, and that they would not again be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>land their passengers until they had actually paid the money.\u201d These cases were argxred at March term 1859.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-5\"><em>R.
