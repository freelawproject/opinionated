At the trial in the superior court before <em>Lord, </em>J., the plaintiff\u2019s counsel fully-opened his case to the jury; called four witnesses, who were sworn generally in the case; proceeded to examine them, in the first instance, to the court, for the purpose, as he said, of showing the existence and loss of the mortgage deed, and of thus laying the foundation for the introduction of secondary evidence of its contents; and stated that he should further examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the same witnesses as a part of such secondary evidence. The witnesses were all cross-examined by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and questions were put to them by the judge, who, after hearing the testimony, refused to admit secondary evidence of the execution and contents of the mortgage; and, on the plaintiff's request and to enable him to procure additional evidence, postponed the further hearing of the case for four days, but did not discharge the jury. At the end of the time granted, the plaintiff introduced additional evidence; but the judge did not change his ruling. The plaintiff proposed to become nonsuit, claiming to do so as a matter of right; but the judge refused to permit it, a verdict was taken for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-5\"><em>6. </em>Walker, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABc\">The evidence offered was only to the court upon a question which the jury were not competent to pass upon. The plaintiff, not having submitted evidence to the jury, or proceeded with his cause before them, had a right to become nonsuit. <em>Haskell </em>v. Whitney, 12 Mass. 48. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>16 Mass. 317. <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>2 Woodb. &amp; Min. 531, The jury heard nothing, and so the record that they find their verdict \u201c after hearing all matters and things in the premises \u201d is false. <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>4 Cush. 418. By the English practice the plaintiff may become nonsuit at any time before verdict. 3 Chit. Gen. Pract. 910. So in this commonwealth, unless injustice be thereby done to defendant. Howe\u2019s Pract. 268. <em>Means </em>v. <em>Welles, </em>12 Met. 361. See also U. S. Dig. 1852, Nonsuit, pl. 7, 21; 1853, Nonsuit, pl. 9,10.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-6\"><em>C. Delano, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b582-7\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AimE\">These exceptions must be overruled on the authority of <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>16 Mass. 317. In that case it was decided that after a cause is opened to the jury, and is begun to be proceeded in before them, the plaintiff has not a right, of his mere pleasure, to discontinue his suit or to become nonsuit. Mr. Justice Jackson had previously expressed an opinion to the like effect in <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>12 Mass. 48, 49. Such therefore is now the law of this commonwealth, whatever it may be elsewhere, or may have been here under the colonial ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of 1641, which is found in Anc. Chart 46. And this law seems to us to be eminently just. As a nonsuit.is no bar to another suit for the same cause of action, a plaintiff might harass a defendant by unlimited litigation, if the court had no authority, in any case, to prevent a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The action of the judge, at the trial of this case, having been an exercise of his judicial discretion, cannot be supervised by as. Nor is the question before us whether he rightly decided that there was not sufficient proof of the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage to warrant paroi proof of its contents. A nonsuit was refused, and a verdict taken, solely \u2014 so far as the exceptions show \u2014 because the plaintiff did not produce legal proof of the mortgage which was necessary to the maintenance of his action, although the court had granted him all the time that he asked for to procure such proof. <em>jExceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
