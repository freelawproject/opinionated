The wood sold to the defendant was expressly reserved in that agreement, and assented to by the plaintiff. An oral license to enter and take away wood under an agreement for its sale, while standing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>growing on land, is valid, and, until revoked, is a justification of any entry made for the purpose of executing the contract of sale. <em>Claflin </em>v.
