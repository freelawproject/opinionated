The jury returned a verdict of death, which the trial court imposed. In 2011, the California Supreme Court reversed Johnson's convictions and remanded for retrial. Before the second trial, the People investigated other murder and attempted murder cases from the early 1990s in which Johnson had been a suspect. Ultimately, they added four new charges to the case pending against him-for the capital murders of Albert Sutton, Georgia Denise (\"Nece\") Jones, and Tyrone Mosley, and the attempted murder of\n   Kim Coleman-all of which occurred in the early 1990s, and for two of which the People had previously tried and failed to convict Johnson. Where Johnson had been convicted of two capital-murder charges before his successful appeal, he now faces five capital-murder charges and an attempted murder charge-plus newly added gang enhancements-in the same case. Johnson challenged the filing of the new charges in a motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution. Although the trial court agreed that Johnson made a prima facie showing sufficient to raise a presumption of vindictiveness, it determined the People rebutted the presumption, and denied the motion to dismiss. Johnson petitioned this court for writ of mandate/prohibition and we issued an order to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that the court erred in denying Johnson's motion to dismiss the new charges concerning Jones, Mosley, and Coleman. We therefore grant Johnson's petition as to those crimes and direct the court to dismiss counts 2, 5, 6, and their related enhancements. We conclude that the court properly denied Johnson's motion to dismiss the Sutton charges, however, and deny Johnson's petition as to that crime. As for the gang enhancements added to the Beroit and Loggins counts, we remand for an evidentiary hearing to allow the People to present evidence to rebut the presumption of vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case concerns six casualties of the gang wars between the Bloods and the Crips in the early 1990s. Johnson was a high-ranking member of the 89 Family Swans, a small, Bloods-affiliated gang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 5, 1991, Johnson told fellow gang member Michael Allen to shoot Peyton Beroit, a member of a rival Crips gang who was getting his car washed in 89 Family territory. Witnesses testified that Allen shot Beroit and Donald Ray Loggins as they sat in a parked car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 14, 1991, Freddie Jelks, another 89 Family member, alerted his colleagues that the rival 97 East Coast Crips were having a party nearby. Johnson, Jelks, and another member of their gang drove to the party and shot at the group. Tyrone Mosley was killed. Kim Coleman and Kenneth Davis were injured but survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 12, 1992, Albert Sutton, a drug dealer and member of the 89 Family Bloods, took his brother to Johnson's house. Sutton's brother was a member of a rival Crips gang. A shootout ensued, and Sutton's brother was shot; he survived but lost the use of one eye. The police arrested three men, including Johnson. Sutton spoke to the police about the shooting, and Johnson was subsequently charged with attempted murder. Sutton planned to testify against Johnson at trial. When it became clear Sutton could not be dissuaded from testifying, Johnson ordered his cousin Leon Johnson (Leon) to kill Sutton. On September 16, 1992, Leon fatally shot Sutton in the back of the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1994, the LAPD and FBI formed a joint task force to investigate the 89 Family. That spring, Charles Lafayette, a member of an allied gang, was brought to trial for the 1993 murder of Willie Bogan. Nece Jones testified that she saw Lafayette shoot and kill Bogan. On June 6, 1994, the case ended in a mistrial, and a second trial date was set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two days later, members of the task force went to Ironwood State Prison, where they spent two hours interviewing Johnson. Detectives told Johnson they had\n   formed a task force to investigate crimes committed by the 89 Family. They asked him \"about murders that the LAPD was investigating[,]\" and specifically asked about the Sutton killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   About an hour after detectives left the prison, Johnson called Reco Wilson and explained the task force investigation. He told Wilson to \"clean up\" and to \"lock everything down around there.\" Johnson continued, \"[T]hem three smokers out there? Put a leash around their ass. By any means necessary.\" \"Smoker\" is street slang for someone who smokes rock cocaine. Jones was such a person. The prosecution argued Johnson's statement was a command to Wilson to kill Jones-and indeed, Jones was murdered one week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The task force investigation bore fruit in the late 1990s when, over the course of four trials, the People prosecuted a series of defendants for the crimes now at issue. In January 1997, Wilson was convicted of murdering Jones and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole; the People's theory was that Wilson killed her on Johnson's orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September 1997, Johnson and co-defendant Allen were convicted of murdering Beroit and Loggins and were sentenced to death; the People's theory was that Allen killed them on Johnson's orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 1998, after the jury was unable to reach a verdict, a mistrial was declared in Leon's trial for the Sutton murder; Leon later pled guilty and was sentenced to 18 years to life. The People's theory was that Leon killed Sutton on Johnson's orders. Finally, in September 1999, another hung jury led to a mistrial in Johnson's trial for the drive-by murder of Mosley and attempted murders of Coleman and Davis. In February 2000, the People dismissed those charges under Penal Code section 1382 (failure to proceed within the statutory period).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, after an automatic appeal, the California Supreme Court reversed Johnson's and Allen's guilt and penalty judgments for the Beroit and Loggins murders, and remanded for retrial of both defendants. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

The People immediately began investigating other cases from the early 1990s in which Johnson had been a suspect. On March 2, 2012, the People notified Johnson of their intent to offer evidence of the Sutton, Jones, Mosley, and Coleman shootings at retrial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b).) At some point, Johnson offered to plead guilty to the Loggins and Beroit murders, but the People declined to extend an offer of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In April 2014, Johnson moved to dismiss the still-pending Beroit and Loggins charges for outrageous government misconduct. The day the motion was set to be heard, the People moved to dismiss the original indictment in the Beroit/Loggins case (No. BA105846) and re-file the charges by criminal complaint under a new case number (No. BA424006). The court granted the motion over defense objection, and on April 25, 2014, the People filed a new complaint alleging five counts of capital murder (Loggins, Beroit, Sutton, Jones,\n   and Mosley) and one count of attempted murder (Coleman). In addition to the special circumstances, the People also alleged various firearm and great bodily injury enhancements to four of the counts, and alleged a gang enhancement to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Johnson was held to answer on the new charges, and the information in the new case (No. BA424006) was filed on May 13, 2014. The new information charged Johnson with five counts of premeditated murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)) for the deaths of Sutton (count 1), Jones (count 2), Loggins (count 3), Beroit (count 4), and Mosley (count 5), with multiple-murder special-circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)) and street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)) allegations for each count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to count 4, the information also alleged Johnson had furnished a firearm for the purpose of aiding or abetting a felony (\u00a7 12022.4). As to count 5, the information alleged Johnson had personally used a firearm to commit the offense (\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (a)(1); \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). The information also charged Johnson with one count of attempted murder of Coleman (\u00a7 664/187, subd. (a); count 6) and alleged great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)), personal use of a firearm (\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (a)(1); \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)), and gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)) enhancements for that count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Johnson argued the new charges constituted vindictive prosecution and moved to dismiss them. After a contested hearing, the court concluded Johnson made a prima facie showing sufficient to raise a presumption of vindictiveness. Additional briefing followed. After a second hearing, the court found the People had rebutted the presumption of vindictiveness and denied Johnson's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Johnson filed a timely petition for writ of mandate/prohibition in this court, and we issued an order to show cause.

But they argue that as a matter of law, there can be no presumption of vindictiveness in this case because they did not increase the original charges against Johnson. This argument takes two forms. First, the People argue that the new charges stemmed from different conduct than that at issue in the original case, and the new charges do not amount to an increase unless they concern the same conduct as the original counts. Second, they argue that they have not increased the charges because the new charges do not subject Johnson to additional punishment-he was already facing the ultimate punishment. Therefore, the People contend, Johnson has not made a prima facie showing sufficient to raise a presumption of vindictiveness. The People then argue they rebutted any presumption of vindictive prosecution because \"useful statements from witnesses became both legally and practically available\" after Johnson's successful appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To determine whether Johnson raised a presumption of vindictiveness, we first consider the limits of prosecutors' charging discretion at various stages in the proceedings. We conclude the presumption of vindictiveness is triggered most easily after a conviction is overturned on appeal and the matter is set for retrial. We next examine the presumption itself. We conclude the People can \"increase the charges\" against a criminal defendant by charging him with new crimes if they do so under circumstances that would appear vindictive to other criminal defendants. And although we agree with the People that both the potential for increased punishment and the connection between the original and new charges are relevant to whether their actions appear vindictive, we conclude these factors are not dispositive. Based on a review of all the facts, we hold it would appear to other defendants that the People charged Johnson with the additional crimes and enhancements in response to his successful appeal. Therefore,\n   Johnson has presented sufficient evidence to raise a presumption of vindictive prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Johnson met his initial burden, we also examine whether the People have justified the addition of four new charges and six new gang enhancements by some objective change in circumstances or in the state of the evidence that legitimately influenced their charging process. We also examine why the People waited until after Johnson's appeal was granted before filing the new charges and gang enhancements against him. Because the People have neither explained the importance of their new evidence, nor discussed in any meaningful way why the new evidence or changed circumstances legitimately affected their charging decision, we hold they did not rebut the presumption of vindictiveness as to the Jones, Mosley, or Coleman charges. We are satisfied, however, that Leon's testimony is both newly available and sufficiently important to justify the People's reevaluation of their previous decision not to charge Johnson with the Sutton murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

That is, while\n   <em>\n    Kellett\n   </em>\n   and double jeopardy may well be relevant to the ultimate burden-shifting analysis, they are not dispositive. First, because the defendant bears the initial burden of proof in a claim of vindictive prosecution, the People's proposed test would effectively require the defendant, at an early stage of the proceedings, to prove the charged crimes\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   related. Obviously, since the prosecution has the burden of proof at trial, the defendant will not know what specific evidence the People will offer to support the charges. Yet under this rule, defendants would have to address the cross-admissibility of evidence and the extent to which the new and original charges require \"separate proofs\" simply to meet their initial burden. (See\n   <em>\n    Valli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 187 Cal.App.4th at pp. 797-802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20335\">\n    114 Cal.Rptr.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Such a rule would unfairly burden defendants by requiring them to produce evidence they may not have and to make arguments about the relatedness of criminal charges that may be adverse to their interests. In other words, to raise a vindictive prosecution claim, defendants would have to help the State prosecute them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, although the vindictive-prosecution doctrine stems from the Due Process Clause, which is concerned with \"fundamental fairness,\" the People's approach would require courts to evaluate vindictive-prosecution claims using narrower rules like the statutory rule of mandatory joinder and the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See 2 Modern Constitutional Law (3rd ed.) \u00a7 30:1 [discussing due process protections for criminal defendants].) \"However, due process has always been understood to encompass more than the sum total of the other related constitutional guarantees. It promises fundamental fairness in the criminal justice process, whether or not another clause in the Constitution also addresses the question before the courts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Rochin v.

We have not found any published California case addressing the specific question and unique facts before us: Can a criminal defendant raise a presumption of vindictiveness where the \"increased charges\" are for different conduct than the original charges, but the People have had most of the evidence underlying the newly added charges for years and only added them to the defendant's pending retrial following a successful appeal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To evaluate the People's contention notwithstanding the lack of California authority to support it, we turn to the federal courts for guidance. In doing so, we must reconcile the prosecutor's broad discretion to file charges when there is probable cause to believe that someone has committed a crime with our duty to protect a criminal defendant's unfettered right to appeal. As we shall explain, we hold that the People \"increase the charges\" against a criminal defendant when they bring new charges against him under circumstances that would appear vindictive to other criminal defendants-and those new charges may involve different facts, crimes, or victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.1 Appearance of vindictiveness versus realistic likelihood of actual vindictiveness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The presumption of vindictiveness \"is a legal presumption which arises when the prosecutor increases the criminal charge against a defendant under circumstances [that] are deemed to present a 'reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Bower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal.3d at p. 879,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20267\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20P.2d%201269\">\n    700 P.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But what circumstances should be \"deemed to present\" such a likelihood and thereby warrant application of the presumption? To answer that question, the federal courts have adopted a variety of competing secondary tests. While these tests can appear ad-hoc, they can be grouped into two broad categories. One set of courts has emphasized the need to avoid an appearance of vindictiveness that may deter future defendants from exercising their rights. A second set of courts has emphasized the need to protect individual defendants from actual retaliatory conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Courts in the First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits belong to the first group and apply a presumption of vindictiveness when the prosecution's actions are likely to have a chilling effect on other defendants.

Thus, that court has concluded that the mere appearance of vindictive prosecutorial behavior offends due process. (\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hence, the mere appearance of vindictiveness is enough to place the burden on the prosecution.\"].) As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The prophylactic rule is designed not only to relieve the defendant who has asserted his right from bearing the burden from 'upping the ante' but also to prevent chilling the exercise of such rights by other defendants who must make their choices under similar circumstances in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case, the defendant was \"apprehended twice for attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border while driving a vehicle containing undocumented aliens. Both times, Jenkins stated that she had been paid to drive the car across the border. She was not charged with any crime. Almost three months later, Jenkins was apprehended while attempting to cross the border as a passenger in a vehicle containing marijuana. She stated that she had been paid to drive the car, which she believed contained illegal aliens, across the border. Jenkins was charged with importation of marijuana. At trial, she testified in her own defense and maintained that she believed the vehicle in which she had been a passenger contained illegal aliens because she had been paid on two previous occasions to smuggle aliens. While the jury was deliberating, the government filed alien smuggling charges against Jenkins [in a separate case] in connection with her first two border apprehensions. [\u00b6] The district court found that the prosecutor's conduct created the appearance of vindictive prosecution because the alien smuggling charges were brought only after Jenkins exercised her right to testify in her own defense at her separate marijuana smuggling trial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 697.) The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court concluded that because the government exercised its discretion not to prosecute Jenkins for alien smuggling until \"she presented her theory of defense at the marijuana smuggling trial, the timing of the charges created the appearance of vindictiveness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Like the federal circuits in the first group, California courts are primarily concerned with the prophylactic nature of the vindictive-prosecution doctrine. Accordingly, California courts have adopted the approach favored by these courts-an appearance-of-vindictiveness test. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Twiggs\n   </em>\n   Court framed the presumption of vindictiveness as relating to the appearance of vindictiveness and emphasized that \"the principles discussed in this opinion are designed to relieve the defendant of the 'apprehension of vindictiveness.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Twiggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.3d at p. 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20152\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20P.2d%201165\">\n    667 P.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 369-370, 371, 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20152\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20P.2d%201165\">\n    667 P.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

First, such a requirement provides inadequate due process protection by straying too far from\n   <em>\n    Blackledge\n   </em>\n   's concerns about the chilling effect on other criminal defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Blackledge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 417 U.S. at p. 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519987\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/21/#p27\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"The rationale of our judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Pearce\n   </em>\n   case ... was not grounded upon the proposition that actual retaliatory motivation must inevitably exist. Rather, we emphasized that 'since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation....' \"].) Second, an emphasis on actual vindictiveness places courts in the untenable position of policing prosecutors' subjective motivations. If defendants must prove a realistic likelihood of\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   retaliatory motivation, a court must explicitly find prosecutorial bad faith before it can dismiss the improper charges. As explained in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 633 F.2d at pp. 454-455, under that test, \"a trial judge would have the Hobson's choice of either not barring the extra charge or of saying that a prosecutor acted wrongly. In some cases, a trial judge would, in effect, be calling a prosecutor a liar where the prosecutor claimed inadvertence and the judge ruled against him. We do not think that such confrontations before the judiciary and the executive branch are desirable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We therefore hold that one way the People \"increase the charges\" is by bringing new charges against a defendant under circumstances that appear vindictive. As we discuss below, whether the circumstances appear vindictive is assessed by reviewing all the facts-even if the new charges stem from different events, conduct,\n   or victims than those in the original case. (See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Krezdorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 718 F.2d at pp. 1364-1365.) Our holding accounts for the concerns emphasized by the California Supreme Court and allows the courts to dismiss charges in appropriate situations without the need to find the prosecutor acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    1.3.2 Relatedness and the Totality of the Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Having decided the People \"increase the charges\" when they bring new charges against a defendant under circumstances that would appear vindictive to other criminal defendants, we next examine whether the new charges must relate to the same criminal conduct at issue in the original trial. Since it is the appearance of vindictiveness that triggers the presumption, the People's argument comes down to this: It can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   appear vindictive for the prosecution to add new counts, for decades-old crimes, to a defendant's pending case when that defendant is retried after exercising his right to appeal. Because the appearance-of-vindictiveness standard is incompatible with such a bright-line rule, we reject the People's proposal. Instead, under the totality-of-the-circumstances approach favored by the Ninth Circuit and the California Supreme Court, we hold that the addition of new charges based on different facts, conduct, and victims does not preclude a finding of vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Federal courts that apply an appearance-of-vindictiveness test typically perform a fact-intensive analysis based on the totality of the circumstances. For example, the Fifth Circuit has explained that the \"judicial history of decisions involving judicial and prosecutorial vindictiveness is now clear enough to teach that it is a mistake to measure cases in this area of the law against fixed gauges. The proper solution is not to be found by classifying prosecutorial decisions as changing or adding charges, as amending decisions already made, as covering the same basic conduct or spree of activity, or as being made pre- or post-trial. Nor is it determinative whether the procedural matrix is appeal and error or trial de novo. It is also unnecessary to seek to strike the delicate balance between the rights of defendant and prosecutor. The surer solution lies in applying a more familiar, less exact test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"If the defendant challenges as vindictive a prosecutorial decision to increase the number or severity of charges following a successful appeal, the court must examine the prosecutor's actions in the context of the entire proceedings. If any objective event or combination of events in those proceedings should indicate to a reasonable minded defendant that the prosecutor's decision to increase the severity of charges was motivated by some purpose other than a vindictive desire to deter or punish appeals, no presumption of vindictiveness is created.\" (\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Twiggs\n   </em>\n   , the trial court declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Rather than accept a plea bargain, the defendant exercised his right to a retrial. In response, the prosecutor amended the information to allege five additional prior-felony convictions.

The Court rejected that argument and concluded the circumstances raised a presumption of vindictiveness. Prosecutors knew about the defendant's prior convictions before the first trial, yet made no effort to verify them; the government developed no new facts at trial that could have legitimately influenced their charging decision; and the \"prosecution showed no interest in charging the additional prior convictions until the defendant insisted on a retrial[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 372,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20152\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20P.2d%201165\">\n    667 P.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) These circumstances, the Court concluded, \"plainly gave rise to a presumption of vindictiveness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Barajas v.

The People's proposal is considerably broader than those holdings, however. Their rule would allow the prosecution to respond to a defendant's successful appeal by charging him, in the just-reversed case, with an unlimited number of new counts and enhancements, as long as the new charges are not currently barred by\n   <em>\n    Kellett\n   </em>\n   , were not previously barred by double jeopardy, and do not increase the length of his potential sentence.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Bartow\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit affirmed a Wisconsin state court ruling that the presumption of vindictiveness applies only when the prosecution increases the charges against a defendant for the same conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Bartow\n   </em>\n   (7th Cir. 2007)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869482\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/492/\">\n    481 F.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Wisconsin court acknowledged the \"distinct possibility\" that a defendant would be chilled from exercising his appellate rights if he believed a successful appeal would result in a second trial on more serious charges, but concluded that concern was not present when the prosecutor brings charges based on different conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 501.) The court reasoned that the appeal does not create the opportunity to charge the defendant with additional crimes; the prosecutor may proceed on the separate charges whether or not the defendant appeals the original conviction. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) In the end,\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Bartow\n   </em>\n   does not expressly hold that the presumption of vindictiveness cannot apply when the State brings new charges for different conduct; it does conclude, however, that when the Wisconsin state court reached that conclusion, it did not unreasonably apply established federal precedent.

Instead, in light of California's and the Ninth Circuit's fact-intensive approach based on the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the prosecution's challenged action must be viewed in context, taking into account when the crimes underlying the new charges were committed, when the defendant invoked a statutory or constitutional right, the nature of the protected right, when the prosecution added the new charges, and the nature, number, and severity of the new charges. Our approach is especially necessary in this case given the importance of a defendant's right to appeal, the high-profile nature of capital cases, and the need to guard against other defendants' fears of retaliation. While we agree with the People that the degree of overlap between the old and new charges is relevant to whether the prosecution can successfully rebut the presumption of vindictiveness, it is not dispositive at this stage, and a criminal defendant need not prove relatedness to raise the presumption in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In reaching our conclusion, we do not mean to suggest that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   new charge following\n   a successful appeal would raise a presumption of vindictiveness. For example, it would be difficult for a defendant to meet his initial burden if the new charge is for a crime committed in prison during or after his appeal. And we do not suggest-because the issue is not before us-that a presumption of vindictiveness would arise where the prosecution files new charges in a new case after a defendant is acquitted.

The State can therefore increase a criminal defendant's punishment without increasing the length of the sentence he actually serves-but in any event, as the court noted below, because attempted murder is not a capital offense, the Coleman count\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   subject Johnson to a lengthier sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Contrary to the People's claim, therefore, five death sentences are indeed \"more serious\" than two death sentences, notwithstanding the State can carry out that sentence only once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    1.4 Johnson met his initial burden.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We turn to the specific facts before us and view them in context of the entire proceedings. Here, after 14 years on death row, Cleamon Johnson won his appeal and was granted a new trial. But rather than returning to the status quo ante and receiving the fair trial that eluded him in 1997, Johnson found himself charged with three more capital murders, one attempted murder, and six new gang enhancements. All of the charges-old and new alike-were brought in the same pleading and would be resolved in the same trial, where they would result in one final judgment. The People have had most of the evidence underlying the new counts and enhancements for years as a result of a single investigation conducted decades ago. Indeed, they tested the evidence in four back-to-back trials in the late 1990s, where their theory was that Johnson ordered each killing. In every case, the People exercised their discretion not to charge Johnson with these crimes-initially or after a mistrial-until he won his appeal. In fact, the People admit they added the new charges and enhancements\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Johnson won his appeal, and because upon retrial \"there is a potential that there will be no justice in any sense.\" In light of these facts and admissions, we agree with the trial court that Johnson presented sufficient evidence that the prosecution \"increased the charges in apparent response to\" (\n   <em>\n    Twiggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.3d at p. 371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20152\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20P.2d%201165\">\n    667 P.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) his successful appeal \"under circumstances [that] are deemed to present a 'reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Bower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal.3d at p. 879,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20267\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20P.2d%201269\">\n    700 P.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   This is particularly so because we are especially concerned about prosecutorial\n   actions that may appear vindictive to-and have a chilling effect on-other criminal defendants.

They argue: \"When a defendant is already on death row, expending more resources to prosecute a defendant for other charges, charges that would add nothing to that punishment, does not make practical sense. Even considering the inherent justice that flows from guilty verdicts in the form of truth[,] validation and accountability ... alone do not necessarily overcome the consideration of expending large amounts of resources to deem someone again to be deserving of death, who is already facing a death sentence.\" Once the original convictions were reversed and he was no longer condemned to death, however, \"Johnson's change in status alone justified additional investigation and the subsequent decision to charge him with the murders of additional victims.\" That is, the People acknowledge they added the additional charges because Johnson's convictions were reversed, and contend the successful appeal itself is sufficient to establish changed circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This echoes their argument below, in which the People asserted they \"were under no obligation to re-investigate these additional murders after Johnson was convicted of the Loggins and Beroit murders and sentenced to death. Indeed, pursuing these cases would have put witnesses' lives at risk, expended limited resources, and could have resulted in no greater punishment than Johnson had already received on the Loggins and Beroit murders.\" In short, \"any further prosecution following Johnson's conviction and death sentence for the Loggins and Beroit murders would have been futile, and unnecessarily placed witnesses' lives in jeopardy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As we did above (see section 1.4,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   ) we reject the implication that the vindictive-prosecution doctrine does not apply to capital cases. We also reject the People's circular argument that a successful appeal itself establishes changed circumstances that allow them to add new charges; such an argument ignores the importance of the right to appeal. We express no opinion, however, about whether an acquittal in the Beroit-Loggins case would constitute a sufficient changed circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Next, the People argue the increase in charges was justified both by the discovery of new evidence and by a change in the law that rendered old evidence newly admissible. They note the court below \"was familiar with the facts of the murder charges because the trial court also sat as the magistrate during the preliminary hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The members of this panel, however, did not attend the preliminary hearing-and the People tell us little about the facts of any charged offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, it is difficult to discern whether the proffered evidence matters. Put another way, even assuming the People have established the existence of new, previously unavailable information for each new charge, they do not explain whether the new evidence \"legitimately influenced the charging process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Bower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal.3d at p. 879,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20267\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20P.2d%201269\">\n    700 P.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Burnaugh was also mistaken about the number of people present, the number of shots fired, and the number of victims.

Burnaugh lived with his mother directly across the street from the shooting. Detectives interviewed him on September 14, 1991, the night of the shooting.

However, the People contend his statement \"could not reasonably have been discovered\" sooner because detectives misspelled Burnaugh's name. The People do not account for any previous efforts to locate Burnaugh, explain why the misspelling frustrated those efforts, or explain why Burnaugh's address, phone number, height, weight, and date of birth were insufficient to find him. In short, the People simply do not explain why the prosecution could not reasonably have discovered this corroborating evidence at some point during the many years that elapsed between their first conversation with Burnaugh in 1991 and Johnson's trial for the Beroit and Loggins murders in 1997.

In September 1997, the prosecution introduced that evidence again in the penalty phase of the Loggins/Beroit trial. Central to both cases was a recorded phone call from Johnson to Wilson in which Johnson appeared to solicit Wilson to murder Jones. The People now claim their post-appeal reinvestigation uncovered new evidence-a statement Jones made to law enforcement in 1993-that placed existing evidence in an important new light and provided \"evidence of Johnson's motive to kill Jones.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   On March 9, 1993, over a year before she was killed, Jones told Detective Rosemary Sanchez that she had seen Johnson, Johnson's brother Timothy, and Sutton engaged in a shootout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson was arrested for the shooting, and as police were taking him into custody, Jones heard him threaten to kill Sutton-a statement the\n   arresting officers presumably heard as well.

Reco Wilson was convicted of killing Jones [;] with the new contextual information, the call provides evidence of Johnson's motive to kill Jones.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Since the phone call was played for juries in Johnson's trial and Wilson's trial-and since Sanchez testified for the prosecution in both cases-the evidence is certainly not new. Without conceding the point, the People contend the statement is newly admissible under Evidence Code section 1390 and thus provides \"new contextual evidence ... of Johnson's motive to kill Jones.\" But that evidence code section is irrelevant. The statement was always admissible as non-hearsay motive evidence. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Bolden\n   </em>\n   (1996)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4771423\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/44/707/#p714\">\n    44 Cal.App.4th 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714-715,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20485\">\n    52 Cal.Rptr.2d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [statement offered to prove motive is not hearsay].) Accordingly, the People have not dispelled the presumption of vindictiveness as to count 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    2.3 The People rebutted the presumption as to Sutton.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   On September 12, 1992, Albert Sutton, a drug dealer and member of the 89 Family, took his brother to Johnson's house. Sutton's brother, Danny Foster Glass, was a member of a rival Crips gang. Johnson was furious. He said, \"I can't believe you brought this fool to our hood. He's a Crip.\" Gunfire erupted and Glass was shot; he survived but lost the use of one eye. Nece Jones and Officer Miller both witnessed the shootout. The police took three men into custody, including Johnson and his brother Timothy, an 89 Family member known as \"Sinister.\" As police arrested them, Johnson and Sinister threatened to kill Sutton. Officers interviewed Sutton about the shooting, and Johnson was subsequently charged in case No. TA020639 with attempted murder. Sutton, angry that Johnson shot his brother, planned to testify against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In the days after the shooting, Sutton received two threatening phone calls, which he later discussed with his sister, Anita Terrell. Terrell overheard one call directly, and heard Sutton's side of the other call. Sutton explained to Terrell, \"[t]his fool Evil wants me not to testify, but I'm going to testify because he shot my brother.\" When it became clear Sutton could not be dissuaded from testifying, Johnson ordered his cousin Leon to kill Sutton. Sutton was killed on September 16, 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Leon confided his role in the killing to another gang member, who told the police. When police interviewed Leon in 1995, he admitted killing Sutton on Johnson's orders. He repeated the claim before he was sentenced in 1998 and at his parole hearing in 2008. Thus, as of 2008-three years before Johnson's convictions were overturned-Leon had directly implicated him at least three times. Other witnesses confirmed Leon's account. For example, Johnson's brother Earl Ray Johnson (\"Silent\") told an anonymous police source that Johnson told Leon to kill Sutton because Sutton was going to testify against Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leon's story did not change when police re-interviewed him in 2012, though his memory had faded in the 20 years since the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As Leon stood by his story throughout the years, his credibility increased. As recently as 2008, Leon continued to tell parole boards that Johnson had ordered him to kill Sutton-a position that conflicted with his attempts to gain release because an inmate's acceptance of responsibility and development of insight are \"significant factors\" in determining parole suitability. (\n   <em>\n    In re Shaputis\n   </em>\n   (2011)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050956\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/53/192/#p218\">\n    53 Cal.4th 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2086\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr.3d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20P.3d%20253\">\n    265 P.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (d)(3).) Put another way, by continuing to shift responsibility to Johnson while in prison, Leon increased the length of his incarceration-and his value to the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   While Leon's enhanced credibility is helpful to the prosecution's argument, the critical factor in the Sutton case is timing. Johnson was tried for the Beroit and Loggins murders in 1997. Leon was not brought to trial for Sutton's murder until 1998. Throughout 1997, Leon retained a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and the Confrontation Clause barred the prosecution's use of his out-of-court statements against Johnson. Under\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , testimonial hearsay is inadmissible unless the defendant has an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. (\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Since, under the Fifth Amendment, Leon could not be compelled to testify, Johnson did not have an opportunity to cross-examine him. Following his 1998 guilty plea, Leon could no longer assert his Fifth Amendment privilege-and could be compelled to testify about the Sutton murder. By then, however, Johnson had been convicted and sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   By the time the People decided to charge Johnson with Sutton's murder in 2014, they had key evidence that was not available to them when they brought Johnson to trial in the original case: Leon's guilty plea and his subsequent statements that Johnson ordered him to kill Sutton-statements that may have cost him an early release. The availability of the shooter's testimony-testimony that was not available to prosecutors when they tried Johnson in 1997-constitutes an \"objective change in ... the state of the evidence which legitimately influenced the charging process[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Bower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal.3d at p. 879,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20267\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=700%20P.2d%201269\">\n    700 P.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Given the timing of the charges and Leon's role in the Sutton murder, we are also satisfied that the prosecution could not have reasonably obtained this evidence when \"it exercised its discretion to bring the original charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Gang Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, we turn to the newly added gang allegations tethered to counts 3 and 4 for the Loggins and Beroit murders. We note that the People showed no interest in charging Johnson with any gang allegation for these crimes until his convictions were overturned on appeal. Below, the People stated that they \"decided to add the gang allegation because these are quintessential gang crimes and gang evidence had been introduced at all four original trials\" without explaining why they failed to do so when Johnson was first tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   After reviewing the supplemental briefing on this issue, since the gang allegations amount to \"an increase in charges\" (\n   <em>\n    Valli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20335\">\n    114 Cal.Rptr.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    People v.

After examining the competing approaches, we conclude that in California, circumstances \"are deemed to present\" such a reasonable likelihood if they would appear vindictive to other criminal defendants.

Martinez\n    </em>\n    (9th Cir. 1986)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565329\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/785/663/#p669\">\n     785 F.2d 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 669 (\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    ).) In support of that statement, the court cited to\n    <em>\n     United States v. Robison\n    </em>\n    (9th Cir. 1981)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1207212\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/644/1270/#p1272\">\n     644 F.2d 1270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1272 (\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    ). But\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    held just the opposite. It concluded that the fact the \"instant prosecution arose from events separate and distinct from those on which the earlier prosecutions were based [ ]\" was neither dispositive nor essential. (\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    , at p. 1272.) The Ninth Circuit noted this discrepancy in\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    , and explained that the defendants in both\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    had \"failed to demonstrate any connection between the exercise of procedural rights in prior prosecutions and the federal prosecution challenged\" in those cases. (\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 504 F.3d at p. 701.) In\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    , the second prosecution was initiated by a different sovereign; in\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    , the new charges were initiated by a different sovereign after an acquittal. Thus,\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    explained, \"we do not read\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    as holding that a presumption of vindictiveness can\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    arise when the second charge is unrelated to the first.\" (\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2948509\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/694/#p700\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at p. 701.) As\n    <em>\n     Robison\n    </em>\n    acknowledged, it is merely one of the factors. (See\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    , at p. 701 [\"The government itself recognizes that it brought the alien smuggling charges only because Jenkins admitted to them during the marijuana importation trial. Therefore, to the extent that we consider the relatedness of the charges important to our analysis, this factor does not foreclose application of the doctrine of vindictive prosecution.\"].)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The People put a finer point on this view at oral argument, where they contended the vindictive-prosecution doctrine does not apply to death penalty cases because \"practically speaking, you cannot give someone more than one sentence of death. 'Cause you only have one life to give.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    For example, Freddie Jelks was the chief prosecution witness at both of Johnson's trials. In the Mosley/Coleman case, Jelks testified for approximately 215 transcript pages over three days. Yet we have received only 18 non-consecutive pages-about eight percent-of that testimony. Nor does the record include transcripts or other evidence from Wilson's trial; the facts we have been able to glean about the Jones murder come from our colleagues' 1999 opinion in Wilson's appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    We take no position on whether evidence supporting counts 2, 5 and 6 is otherwise admissible in the retrial of the Beroit and Loggins counts.
