The issue is rooted in events that began in February 2003, when the Montgomery County Sheriffs Department served a domestic protective order on Mark Furda, appellant, and transported him for an emergency mental evaluation, based on a petition filed by Karen Furda, who was then appellant\u2019s wife. At about the same time, the sheriffs seized numerous weapons from appellant\u2019s home, including regulated firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">On July 26, 2005, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Furda pleaded guilty, as a subsequent offender, to one count of violating a domestic protective order issued in September 2004. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4-506 and 4-509 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code. The court sentenced Furda to a suspended one-year term of incarceration and two years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">On September 13, 2006, while on probation in the protective order case, Furda filed a \u201cMotion,\u201d pro se, in that case, seeking the return of his archery equipment and \u201cother related items\u201d that were seized in 2003. The court denied the motion, without prejudice, on November 1, 2006. On July 30, 2007, a few days after the expiration of his probation, appellant filed another pro se \u201cMotion,\u201d asking for the \u201crelease of all [his] property held for safe keeping by the Montgomery County Sheriffs Department.\u201d Then, on October 31, 2007, through counsel, and before the court had ruled on the July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>2007 Motion, appellant filed a \u201cMotion To Return Property,\u201d requesting return of the weapons that had been seized in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">After a hearing on November 7, 2007, the circuit court denied the Motion in an Order of the same date (docketed November 9, 2007). It concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant was prohibited from possessing firearms under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), because he had previously been \u201cinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution.... \u201d Appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, filed on December 3, 2007, was denied on January 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">This appeal followed on February 13, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant poses one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">1. Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion by not granting Mr. Furda\u2019s Motion to Reconsider because Mr. Furda was not barred by Federal, Maryland State, or Montgomery County law from possessing firearms as he had never been \u201ccommitted\u201d within the definition of Federal law, Maryland State law, or Montgomery County law; and he did not have an adequate opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s allegations concerning whether he has been \u201ccommitted\u201d when it was raised for the first time just before the November 7, 2007 Motion argument?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The State has filed a Motion to Dismiss the appeal, based on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall deny the State\u2019s motion, reverse the circuit court, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Appellant\u2019s former wife, Karen Furda, obtained a temporary protective order against appellant in February 2003. According to an \u201cIncident Report\u201d submitted on February 28, 2003, by a deputy in the Montgomery County Sheriffs Department,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Furda was served with \u201ca temporary Protection Order\u201d on February 27, 2003, at 11:00 p.m. <em>See Furda v. Furda, </em>Case No. 0601 SP006212003 (District Court for Montgomery County). He was also served with an order for an emergency mental evaluation, based on a petition filed by Ms. Furda.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to Ms. Furda\u2019s consent, the Sheriffs searched the Furdas\u2019 home and recovered approximately fifteen rifles, one handgun, a large quantity of miscellaneous ammunition, knives, a bow, and arrows.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In the early morning of February 28, 2003, Furda arrived at Montgomery General Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d). By the end of that day, he was transferred to Potomac Ridge Behavioral Health (\u201cPotomac Ridge\u201d) for \u201cinvoluntary admission,\u201d based on a certification by two physicians that \u201cthe individual presents a danger to the life or safety of the individual or of others.\u201d Furda was also described as having \u201ca mental disorder and need[ing] treatment.\u201d A hearing to determine whether appellant would be released or detained involuntarily was set for March 4, 2003, at 9:30 a.m. However, Furda was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>discharged from Potomac Ridge on March 4, 2003, at 10:56 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">According to the record, Ms. Furda obtained a Final Protective Order against Mr. Furda on March 6, 2003. It stated, in part: \u201cWhile this Protective Order is in effect you may be subject to a federal penalty under the 1994 amendment to the Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(8), for possessing, transporting, or accepting a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Ms. Furda obtained another protective order on September 21, 2004. Then, on February 1, 2005, she filed an \u201cApplication for Statement of Charges,\u201d claiming that Mr. Furda \u201cviolated the protective order repeatedly....\u201d Thereafter, on March 3, 2005, Furda was charged in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in a one-count Information with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGV\">failing] to comply with [the Protective Order] ... dated September 21, 2004, issued under Section <em>k-506 </em>of the Family Law Article, that ordered the respondent to refrain from contacting and attempting to contact Karen Furda, by contacting her in writing, and is a subsequent offender, in violation of Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article against the peace, government, and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">On July 26, 2005, appellant pleaded guilty to \u201cProtective Order \u2014 Fail to Comply/Subsequent Offender,\u201d for which he received a suspended one-year term of incarceration and two years of probation. <em>See State v. Furda, </em>Case No. 101933, Circuit Court for Montgomery County. We shall refer to the domestic violence proceedings collectively as the \u201cProtective Order Case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On September 13, 2006, while Furda was still on probation in the Protective Order Case, he filed a pro se \u201cMotion,\u201d seeking the return of his archery equipment and \u201cother related items.\u201d According to the docket entries, the court denied the Motion, without prejudice, on November 1, 2006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>80, 2007, just after appellant completed his two-year probation in the Protective Order Case, appellant filed another pro se \u201cMotion,\u201d asking for \u201cthe release of all of [his] property held for safe keeping by the Montgomery County Sheriffs Department.\u201d The State opposed the Motion. At a hearing on September 10, 2007, the court set October 31, 2007, as the deadline for filing memoranda, and scheduled a hearing for November 7, 2007.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">On October 31, 2007, through counsel, appellant filed a \u201cMotion To Return Property,\u201d with an accompanying Memorandum of Law. He asserted that \u201cthere is nothing in Maryland Law or Federal Law barring [appellant] from possessing firearms.\u201d In its opposition, the State said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">8. The Defendant is a prohibited person under Federal Law and therefore, cannot possess a Firearm. Title 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) prohibits <em>\u201ca person who has either been adjudicated as mental defective or have [sic] been committed to a mental institution.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. 922 does not state a set period of time that the person must be committed to such institution. (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">9. The State has sent subpoenas to Potomac Ridge Behavioral Health Center to bring certified copies of medical records of the Defendant\u2019s involuntary commitment via EPP [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] on February 28, 2003. Karen Furda, the Defendant\u2019s wife at the time, would testify that the Defendant was committed to Montgomery General Hospital on the 28th and was transferred later that day to Potomac Ridge where the Defendant remained until he was discharged on March 4, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The court held a hearing on November 7, 2007, at which non-testimonial evidence was presented. Appellant appeared at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel explained that appellant was seeking the return of all items seized by the Sheriff in 2003, with the exception of his \u201cBrowning 30-caliber,\u201d which the parties acknowledged was illegal for appellant to possess. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued that, given the expiration of both the probation and the protective order, \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely nothing in Federal law, State law, or local law that would bar him from owning, possessing firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Based on Mr. Furda\u2019s medical records, admitted without objection as State\u2019s Exhibit 1, the State urged the court to find that appellant was prohibited from possessing weapons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). Further, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFZ\">I don\u2019t believe the Court has jurisdiction at this time. The probation was fully terminated at the end of July, I think it was and I put in here July 26 was the end of his probation. Mr. Furda did not file this until July 30th. Now I know it\u2019s four days, but still, probation the case was done, so I believe that at that point there was no active criminal case and this was filed under the original Criminal Case of 101933 and therefore it was a closed case, the Court does not have jurisdiction. And I would ask that because of the fact he failed to file this within the appropriate time while there was still an active case, you do not have jurisdiction to make this decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">According to the State, \u201cMr. Furda was told on multiple occasions by Lieutenant Rhinestat ... from the Sheriffs Department that he had a certain procedure he had to follow to file for return of his guns.\u201d The State insisted that the required procedure \u201cwas to file a written application with the Sheriffs Department and then they would have to look to Federal and State law to determine if, in fact, he was allowed to have them back, and if he was, then they would give them back to him.\u201d The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">THE COURT: What is the statutory authority for the procedure that the Sheriffs Office follows that Lieutenant Rhinestat told Mr. Furda, this is what you have to do. Where is that set out statutorily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: I believe it\u2019s their own policy and again, I apologize for Lieutenant Rhinestat could not be here today, and I actually was going to have Lieutenant Bean here as well. It\u2019s my understand [sic] that there is just like Mr. Furda were to go to Gilbert Guns and apply, by Federal law they have to do a background' check, and that\u2019s what the Sheriffs Office would do. They would be essentially like Gilbert Guns. They would have to do a background check to determine if legally they can turn them over to him, and it would be my position and that was the second prong of the argument, that he would be prohibited from having them period under Federal law due to the fact he was put in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">THE COURT: Well I guess what I\u2019m asking is this, there\u2019s no statutory scheme that tells him, first you must go to the Sheriff, then once the Sheriff\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">THE COURT: Refuses to release the gun, then you can request judicial review of that decision either you know, in whatever court location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Sure. No, I don\u2019t believe in good faith that when he filed it, he wasn\u2019t relying on <em>the original decision that was that you held this open, the issue of the guns, </em>and two, he was told how to do this after his probation ended and he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">THE COURT: Well they weren\u2019t going to give them to him. So he would have ended up here sooner or later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well then maybe we cut to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">THE COURT: So we might as well look at the legal issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well that was his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">THE COURT: <em>And he was told ... by the State, he filed it prematurely. You have to wait until you\u2019re off probation, then you can come back to court and ask for these, so I think what we have to address is the merits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: <em>Sure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">THE COURT: Is he legally prohibited from getting these back and not about, sort of I\u2019d say, the technicalities of is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>his probation closed and was he a day late or, because he\u2019s been told that all along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">THE COURT: To get them back you\u2019re going to have to file for them because we\u2019re not giving them to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And again, Your Honor, I have to throw all my arguments out to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And that\u2019s why, then we look at the State law, is he a prohibitive [sic] person----[T]hen you look at the more serious level which is the Federal level and there it\u2019s very clear, they don\u2019t have a specific time period where the State is very clear on saying that a person must spend at least 30-days in a mental institution. The Federal law doesn\u2019t even refer to that altogether, it just says, a person who\u2019s either been adjudicated as mental defective, or has been committed to a mental institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that appellant was not \u201ccommitted\u201d under federal law. Rather, appellant was merely \u201cevaluated.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">The State countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">The fact was, is that he was transferred and was committed to Potomac Ridge and there was a diagnosis, and Ms. Furda ... could testify as to what the diagnosis of schizophrenia was. It is a commitment and the evaluation, as Mr. Booth is referring to, is from the Montgomery General Hospital and that point [sic], he was involuntary committed further for treatment for Potomac Ridge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">According to the medical records, admitted in evidence, Furda, then 37 years old, was brought to the Hospital at 2:30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>a.m. on February 28, 2003, based on a petition for an emergency evaluation filed by his wife. Appellant\u2019s \u201cThought Content\u201d at the Hospital was described as \u201cOrganized\u201d and his \u201cMood\u201d was described as \u201cFrustrated.\u201d His \u201cthinking\u201d was described as \u201cclear and logical,\u201d with \u201cno delusions/hallucinations.\u201d Under \u201cFormulation,\u201d the record noted that appellant was \u201cfound to be stable,\u201d although his wife reported that Furda was \u201csuicidal and homicidal____\u201d It also stated: \u201cPt is not willing to consent to voluntary admission for further evaluation and assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Doctor Behl examined Furda and \u201crecommended inpatient treatment with a provisional diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder.\u201d According to a Maryland form entitled \u201cInvoluntary Admission To Mental Health Facility Pursuant to [H.G.] 10-631, 10-632,\u201d two physicians certified that appellant\u2019s \u201cinvoluntary admission\u201d was sought because \u201cthe individual presents a danger to the life or safety of the individual or of others.\u201d A section of the Hospital record, entitled \u201cDisposition,\u201d stated:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMl\">Case transferred to Kevin Simms for completion after Dr. Behl [of the Hospital] has seen the pt. Addendum: 2/28/02. The patient was also assessed by Dr. Behl who also recommended inpatient treatment with a provisional diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. She signed one certificate. Four days of inpatient treatment was authorized by Stewart Smith of Magellan----Two [sic] Admit to Patomac [sic] Ridge on Two physicians certificates. KPS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">As discussed, appellant was then transferred to Potomac Ridge. Although a hearing was scheduled to determine whether appellant would be released or detained, the record does not reflect that a hearing ever took place. Appellant was discharged from Potomac Ridge on March 4, 2003, at 10:56 a.m.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Joseph Marnell, M.D., of Potomac Ridge, prepared a Discharge Summary that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The patient presents as extremely shallow but cooperated. His speech and thinking were pressured and paranoid. He was preoccupied and obsessed about his wife\u2019s infidelity. Nonetheless, he minimized his substance abuse and aggressive behaviors. He minimized any threats that he might have made to kill himself or his family, indeed, although he talked about holding a gun, he adamantly denied ever having threatened anyone with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">The patient refused to sign in on a voluntary basis. I was confronted with the dilemma of whether to try to pursue an involuntary commitment against him as the hearing was to occur on the day of discharge. The patient, throughout this hospital stay, was behaviorally appropriate. His mood had stabilized. His speech and thinking were better organized and were no longer pressured. He no longer demonstrated any paranoid thinking and was ruminating less about his wife\u2019s infidelity. He acknowledged a need for substance abuse rehab and agreed to go to IOP and to take Zyprexa for any residual effects of amphetamine-induced psychosis. I emphasized, however, that the patient presents as very shallow. His behavior and attitude seems to be geared more for getting out of the hospital than it is for true rehab. The patient and I reviewed how he is absolutely 100% responsible for his actions, including any consequences for behaviors that he does following his discharge. This includes any behavior linked to relapse and to substance abuse. Nonetheless, I have no grounds for detaining the patient at this time. There is no evidence of psychosis, confusion or withdrawal. He denies being suicidal or homicidal. He is behaviorally appropriate on the unit. His mood has stabilized. He is responsible for his actions. He knows the aftercare plan. He knows we will be contacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Child Protective Services. The police still have the weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The diagnosis on discharge included \u201cPsychosis, NOS, probably drug-induced. Amphetamine Dependence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">At the motion hearing on November 7, 2007, the court addressed the items that had been seized by the Sheriffs in 2003, as documented in the \u201cSeized Property/Evidence Log.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties agreed upon the release of various items that did not constitute prohibited \u201cfirearms.\u201d As to the remaining items, the court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On November 7, 2007, the court issued an \u201cOrder\u201d (docketed November 9, 2007) denying appellant\u2019s motion for the release of his personal property. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">The items at issue were seized at the time a Domestic Violence Protective Order was served on [appellant]____ The Protective Order is now expired and probation arising from a related criminal case is now closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">Upon the evidence presented, the Court finds that Defendant Mark Furda is considered a prohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) as a result of having been involuntarily committed to a mental institution and is thereby prohibited from possessing firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">On December 3, 2007, appellant filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion For Re-Consideration\u201d [sic], contending that his evaluation at Potomac Ridge did not constitute a commitment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). Furda insisted that \u201can evaluation is not an adjudication as a mental defective, nor is being temporarily held for purposes of evaluation, the equivalent of having been committed.\u201d Appellant also argued that his \u201ctime in the hospital and at Potomac Ridge also does not constitute a commitment under Maryland law.\u201d He noted that the doctor stated: \u201c T have no grounds for detaining the patient at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>time.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, no hearing was ever held, as required for an involuntary commitment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">On January 16, 2008, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Appellant filed an appeal in the Protective Order Case on February 13, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In the meantime, on January 24, 2008, appellant went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns and completed an application to purchase a regulated firearm. In the application, he represented, under oath, that he had never been committed to a mental institution. As a result, he was charged in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with perjury, in violation of Md.Code (2002, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 9-101(a)(2) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), and giving false information or making a material misstatement in a firearm application, in violation of Md.Code (2003, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 5-139(a) of the Public Safety Article (\u201cP.S.\u201d). <em>See State v. Furda, </em>Case No. 110008 (the \u201cPerjury Case\u201d). Following a bench trial in 2008, the circuit court convicted appellant of both charges and sentenced him to ten years\u2019 incarceration, with all but five years suspended. The Perjury Case is the subject of a companion appeal. <em>See Furda v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 1, 1 A.3d 528 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On October 29, 2008, the State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in the Protective Order Case, claiming that appellant was not entitled to a direct appeal because his appeal arose from a guilty plea. It said: \u201cAs such, the appropriate avenue for review is an application for leave to appeal, which Appellant neglected to pursue.\u201d Appellant responded that \u201cthis appeal is a civil appeal....\u201d On November 18, 2008, this Court denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In its brief, the State renewed and expanded its motion to dismiss the appeal. It argued that \u201cthe circuit court lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>jurisdiction to decide Mr. Furda\u2019s Motion To Return Property and motion for reconsideration,\u201d because \u201cthe criminal case to which Mr. Furda appended his motion terminated before he filed the motion.\u201d In addition, it maintained that appellant should have filed a replevin action in District Court. And, it maintained that appellant was required to seek leave to appeal. Alternatively, the State urged this Court to dismiss the appeal as moot, claiming appellant\u2019s convictions for perjury and false statement now render him ineligible to possess a firearm, without regard to the commitment issue. The State has also asked us to dismiss on the ground that appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in connection with seeking the return of his weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">As noted, the State has moved to dismiss the appeal on various grounds. Noting that appellant filed his motion for return of property on July 30, 2007, i.e., after the termination of his probation, the State asserts: \u201cTermination of the period of incarceration, parole, or probation divests the court of jurisdiction.\u201d The State also argues, for the first time on appeal, that appellant\u2019s motion for return of property was essentially an action for replevin, for which only a District Court has jurisdiction under Md.Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). It quotes <em>State v. Walls, </em>90 Md.App. 300, 305-06, 600 A.2d 1165 (1992), for the proposition that \u201c \u2018forfeiture is a civil <em>in rem </em>proceeding against property, unconnected with any criminal proceeding against the owner or holder of the property.\u2019 \u201d In the State\u2019s view, \u201cbecause Furda improperly filed his petition for return of property in the criminal action, the circuit lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In addition, the State argues that, even if the circuit court had jurisdiction, \u201cthis appeal is not properly taken\u201d because \u201c[i]n a case involving a guilty plea ... [t]he only avenue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>relief is an application for leave to appeal.\u201d It asserts: \u201cBecause Furda seeks review of a denial of a motion for reconsideration in his criminal case by direct appeal \u2014 without seeking leave \u2014 this appeal should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Further, the State alleges that, \u201c[e]ven if there were no jurisdictional or procedural barriers to Furda\u2019s appeal, the appeal should be dismissed as moot,\u201d because appellant\u2019s perjury and false statement convictions \u201crender him ineligible to possess firearms.\u201d Lastly, the State argues that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over Furda\u2019s motion because Furda was required first to pursue \u201cinformal\u201d administrative remedies under Md.Code (2001, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 13-201 through 13-206 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), governing forfeiture in gun cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In reply, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">[T]his is a collateral matter stemming from the criminal action. As a matter of clean hands, the [State\u2019s] position is unacceptable because on several occasions Mr. Furda by himself, as well as through his attorneys, raised the issue of the return of firearms and was told by both the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, as well as by the Judges of the Montgomery County Circuit Court, that as long as he was on probation he could not have a firearm, and therefore, completion of his probation would be the first opportunity for him to request their return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Furda also argues: \u201cMontgomery County Police retained the firearms through the probation period. Mr. Furda was informed that as soon as probation was over he should file the appropriate Motion (in the Circuit Court criminal case) to recover his property, and Mr. Furda proceeded in this manner as directed.\u201d Noting that the State never initiated forfeiture proceedings as to the weapons, he asserts: \u201cInstituting a forfeiture proceeding is not the job of the property holder; it is the duty of the State if they want to retain the property of one of its citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Furda also rejects the State\u2019s claim that he should have filed a replevin action in the District Court. He asserts: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201cThere is a statutory scheme for the recovery of firearms as contained in the regulated firearms section of the Maryland Code.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In addition, appellant maintains that he \u201cis not appealing his guilty plea pertaining to failure to comply with a Protective Order.\u201d Furda elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">[H]e is appealing a collateral matter to the guilty plea \u2014 the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration of the Order denying his [motion seeking the return of his personal property]. Mr. Furda did not even begin the process of attempting to recover his property until after the successful completion of his two years of probation (as he was directed by the Court); thus his Motion seeking the return of his firearms, and this subsequent appeal are unrelated to the guilty plea itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Disputing the State\u2019s claim that the matter is moot based on the perjury conviction, appellant responds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Mr. Furda maintains a property interest in this property. There is no doubt, and there is no argument by anyone, that these firearms are the property of Mr. Furda despite the fact that Mr. Furda is not in possession of the items. It is certainly not argued here (and was not argued below) that Mr. Furda possesses them or that the police do not possess them. Thus, his property interest has not been extinguished, and his attempt to get the property back is not moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Appellant also challenges the State\u2019s assertion that his perjury and false statement convictions precluded the court from providing him any relief. In his view, the State is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An4\">\u201cputting the cart before the horse.\u201d At the time of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration, Mr. Furda had not been convicted of perjury. This perjury conviction is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>entirely on the Order of November 9, 2007. To argue that the perjury conviction renders the first appeal moot, and then to turn around and use that very document to affirm Mr. Furda\u2019s perjury conviction puts him into a legal loop. The draconian result would be that the first appeal ... gets dismissed because he is now a convicted perjurer, and then the Order from the first appeal is used to convict him of perjury, and then <em>this </em>Court affirms that conviction ... based upon the validity of that Order. This presents Mr. Furda with a legal conundrum, and a classic \u201cCatch 22\u201d from which no Appellant could free himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Citing <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 863 A.2d 952 (2004), in which the Court recognized an owner\u2019s continuing interest in weapons that he could not possess, appellant argues that, as an alternative to obtaining the return of his firearms, \u201che certainly may have the property signed over to a licensed [gun] dealer ... and at least reap the financial benefits from a sale of his property.\u201d Moreover, appellant argues that, in the event of a remand, \u201c[t]he Circuit Court could review this issue and actually conduct a hearing with live testimony, real exhibits, and make a determination on the merits rather than on the basis of 15 minutes of argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Following oral argument on September 1, 2009, we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the jurisdiction issue. In his memorandum, appellant stated that he \u201cwas unable to find any statutory or case-law authority that would specifically grant a Trial Judge the direct authority to entertain\u201d a motion for the return of his weapons under the circumstances of this case. But, appellant noted that the court may be able to retain jurisdiction over this matter, \u201cpursuant to a Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis, Md.Code. Ann. Crim. Pro. \u00a7 7-106, and other post conviction relief, as long as collateral consequences remain as a result of the conviction.\u201d In addition, appellant argued: \u201c[T]he Court could also rely upon the general grant of authority as contained in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>McLCode, which asserts that the Circuit Court is a court of general jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">According to appellant, if we find \u201cthat none of the above provisions granted the Circuit Court authority; then, without full and proper authority, the Order of November 7, 2007 becomes null and void.\u201d He maintains that such a finding \u201cwould in essence, be granting Mr. Furda\u2019s appeal, because a primary contention of his Appeal in Case No. 3053, is that the Denial of the Motion for Return of Property in the Order of November 7, 2007 was not valid under Maryland law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In its memorandum, the State posited that C.J. \u00a7 4-401(2) and \u00a7 1-501 collectively \u201cvest[] exclusive jurisdiction of replevin actions in the district court ... [and] divest[ ] the circuit court of jurisdiction to hear\u201d this case. It argued that \u201cthe statutory scheme for forfeiture of handguns,\u201d found in C.P. \u00a7 13-201 through 13-206, \u201cspecifically provides for informal administrative review of claims for release of handguns, and, if warranted, subsequent judicial review----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The State acknowledged that dicta in <em>Mom v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>462 F.Supp.2d 675 (D.Md.2006), <em>aff'd in part, </em>519 F.3d 216 (4th Cir.2008), \u201csupports Furda\u2019s position that he could have moved to retrieve his firearms in the circuit court____\u201d But, according to the State, even if <em>Mora </em>stands for the proposition that the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction in certain cases where a person seeks return of property seized by the Government, this case is not one of them, \u201c[b]ecause Furda failed to follow the statutory judicial review requirements and Maryland Rules governing civil actions, and instead improperly filed a motion in a criminal case having nothing to do with the firearms he sought to retrieve .... \u201d In its view, \u201cthe circuit court did not possess jurisdiction to adjudicate his claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Moreover, the State asserts that Furda\u2019s motion was arguably a civil action for declaratory judgment for mandamus, for which the circuit court had to establish personal jurisdiction over the \u201cproper defendant, the Montgomery County Sheriff.\u201d It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Here, none of the requirements for instituting a civil action was satisfied. There was no complaint. No summons and complaint were served upon the custodian of the firearms, the Montgomery County Sheriff. Nor was process served upon any County representative.... Thus, there was no jurisdiction over the custodian of the firearms, and the circuit court had no authority to adjudicate Furda\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As we see it, the State\u2019s primary contention \u2014 that the court lacked jurisdiction because appellant\u2019s probation had come to an end \u2014 is the proverbial \u201cCatch 22.\u201d The State concedes that, \u201c[ajrguably, when Furda went before the court to seek return of his firearms in 2006, when Furda was still on probation, the circuit court <em>did </em>have jurisdiction to hear that motion.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Yet, at that time the State apparently took the position that the motion was premature, because Furda was still on probation. Evidently, it persuaded the court that such a motion had to await the conclusion of probation. Appellant abided by the State\u2019s position, and promptly filed another motion as soon as his probation ended. Then, the State claimed that the motion was too late, because appellant\u2019s probation had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">As the court below recognized, appellant was instructed to make his request at the end of his probation; that is what he did. At the very least, it seems disingenuous for the State to now complain about appellant\u2019s compliance with the State\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It is also disingenuous for the State to argue that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to decide the motion for return of property, given that the court\u2019s denial of that motion was central to the State\u2019s subsequent prosecution of Furda in the Perjury Case. If the court lacked jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s motion for the return of his weapons, it would seem that the court also lacked jurisdiction, in the very same case, to find that appellant had previously been committed. Yet, it is that ruling on which the State relies in urging us to uphold the Perjury Case. The State cannot have it both ways. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Cf. Roebuck v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 563, 593-94, 813 A.2d 342 (2002) (noting that in separate trials of co-defendants, the State took inconsistent positions with regard to the reliability of a custodial statement, and stating that the trial court should have considered the State\u2019s reliance on the statement in the one case when assessing the State\u2019s objection to that statement in the other case), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 Md. 84, 821 A.2d 371 (2003) .</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In any event, we are unaware of any authority that bars a court from returning property to a probationer after the probationer has complied with his conditions of probation. To be sure, \u201cin the absence of a probation violation, a court does not have jurisdiction to extend the term of probation after the original term of probation has expired.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 193, 214, 996 A.2d 948 (2010). But, this is not an extension of probation case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">We also reject the State\u2019s assertion that Furda filed his motions to obtain his firearms \u201cin a criminal case having nothing to do with the firearms he sought to retrieve.... \u201d The weapons were seized in connection with the temporary protective order issued in February 2003. The weapons had not been returned by the time appellant pleaded guilty on July 26, 2005, to a charge of violating another protective order. Moreover, the probation order in that case instructed him to \u201c[g]et permission from <em>the court </em>before owning, possessing, using, or having under your control any dangerous weapon or firearm of any description.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The State never initiated forfeiture proceedings as to the property in issue, and acknowledged below that there was no statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>scheme in place at the time that governed how appellant was to go about seeking return of the weapons.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In any event, we conclude that the circuit court had jurisdiction to decide appellant\u2019s Motion To Return Property, and that the motion is not moot. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">C.J. \u00a7 1-501 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u00a7 1-501. Jurisdiction and powers in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">The circuit courts are the highest common-law and equity courts of record exercising original jurisdiction within the State. Each has full common-law and equity powers and jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within its county, and all the additional powers and jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution and by law, except where by law jurisdiction has been limited or conferred exclusively upon another tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>By way of analogy, C.P. \u00a7 l~203(d)(l) expressly provides circuit courts and district courts with jurisdiction to entertain a motion for the return of property \u201cseized under a search warrant.\u201d It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">(d) <em>Return of property rightfully taken and wrongfully withheld. </em>\u2014 (1) A circuit court judge or District Court judge shall cause property rightfully taken under a search warrant to be restored to the person from whom it was taken if, at any time, on application to the judge, the judge finds that the property is being wrongfully withheld after there is no further need for retention of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In this case, of course, the weapons were not seized pursuant to a search warrant. But, the fact that a statute authorizes a court\u2019s consideration of a request if property is seized under a warrant does not mean that the lack of a statute precludes the court\u2019s consideration of a request for the return of property seized without a warrant. <em>Cf. State v. Smullen, </em>380 Md. 233, 248-49, 844 A.2d 429 (2004) (recognizing defense of battered child syndrome, despite the absence of a statute, by analogy to statutory defense of battered spouse syndrome). Indeed, in <em>Mora v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>462 F.Supp.2d 675, 695-96 (D.Md.2006), <em>aff'd in part, </em>519 F.3d 216 (4th Cir.2008), the federal district court recognized the appropriateness of extending the court\u2019s jurisdictional reach beyond the literal text of C.P. \u00a7 l-203(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In <em>Mora, </em>the plaintiff, a licensed gun collector, claimed he was subjected to an unlawful search and seizure, and that the many weapons that he lawfully possessed were taken from him without a warrant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 680-81. He sued the City of Gaithersburg, members of two police departments and the Sheriffs Department, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging depri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>vation of property without due process. <em>Id. </em>at 680. Of import here, the federal trial court said, <em>id. </em>at 695:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">In this case, the Court has concluded that Defendants have exceeded their authority under state law in detaining Mora\u2019s property. Even so, it is clear that at all times Mora has had recourse to Maryland\u2019s circuit courts and/or its district courts to secure return of his property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In rejecting Mora\u2019s claim of a denial of due process, Judge Messitte looked to the logical extension of C.P. \u00a7 1 \u2014 203(d)(1), and said, <em>id. </em>at 695-96:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">It can hardly be the case that an individual whose property was rightfully seized under a warrant and thereafter wrongfully detained would have access to a reasonable post-deprivation remedy for its return, while an individual whose property was seized without a warrant but pursuant to a valid search incident to an arrest or a consent search would have none. More to the point, it would be altogether anomalous that a party whose property was seized without a warrant would only have recourse to a federal civil rights action to vindicate his claim. In the end, warrantless searches validly conducted pursuant to a recognized exception to the warrant requirement essentially equate to searches conducted pursuant to a warrant. Certainly Maryland circuit courts, in the exercise of their general jurisdiction, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 1-501, or district courts in the exercise of their replevin jurisdiction, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4-401(2), could entertain Mora\u2019s claim and order immediate return of the detained property rightfully taken and wrongfully detained. Ml this is to say that, from the outset, prompt judicial review has been available to Mora, to consider his options, but \u201c[f]or his part ..., [he has] found it unnecessary even to enter upon, let alone travel the entire length of, that road.\u201d <em>Amsden v. Moran, </em>904 F.2d [748] at 755 [1990]. Because this avenue has been open (and still remains open), Mora cannot plausibly maintain that he has been denied the procedural process due him under the Constitution, even if Defendants have incorrectly acted beyond their authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>As to that issue, the Fourth Circuit agreed. It said, 519 F.3d at 230 n. 2 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">Besides his tort claims for trespass to chattels and conversion, Mora might invoke Maryland\u2019s statutory right to the return of property \u201crightfully taken under a search warrant\u201d but \u201cwrongfully withheld after there is no further need for retention of the property.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Criminal Procedure \u00a7 l-203(d)(l) (LexisNexis 2001). <em>Although this provision technically applies only where property was taken under a warrant, it seems unlikely that a court would refuse to apply it to property rightfully taken and wrongfully withheld under an exception to the warrant requirement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, according to the 2003 Incident Report, Ms. Furda consented to a search of the home for weapons. Numerous weapons were discovered in the basement of the house and were \u201ctransported to the [Office of the Montgomery County Sheriff] and stored in accordance with office policy.\u201d Quoting from <em>Mora, </em>\u201cwarrantless searches validly conducted pursuant to a recognized exception to the warrant requirement essentially equate to searches conducted pursuant to a warrant.\u201d <em>Mora, </em>462 F.Supp.2d at 695. Therefore, we are satisfied that \u201cMaryland circuit courts, in the exercise of their general jurisdiction ... or district courts in the exercise of their replevin jurisdiction ... could entertain\u201d Furda\u2019s claim for the return of the weapons. <em>Id. </em>at 695-96.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">For many of the same reasons, we also agree with appellant that he did not need to file an application for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>appeal under C.J. \u00a7 12-302(e) in order to pursue this issue on appeal. C.J. \u00a7 12-302(e) \u201cdoes not permit an appeal from a final judgment entered following a plea of guilty in a circuit court. Review of such a judgment shall be brought by application for leave to appeal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s appeal does not implicate his guilty plea to the charge of violating a Final Protective Order. Rather, he has appealed the court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration as to his request for the return of his weapons, which were held as a consequence of that case. The court denied his motion for the return of property because it found that appellant was a \u201cprohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) as a result of having been involuntarily committed to a mental institution.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Nor are we persuaded that appellant first had to pursue administrative remedies; the record does not reflect that the administrative process cited by the State was triggered. C.P. \u00a7 13-203 obligates the seizing authority to notify the owner of his right to apply for a review as to his qualification to possess a handgun. However, the State never introduced evidence that proper notice was furnished to appellant by the seizing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, we agree with appellant that the matter is not moot. Even if Furda\u2019s perjury conviction renders him ineligible to possess his firearms, <em>Serio, supra, </em>384 Md. 373, 863 A.2d 952, suggests that appellant retains a property interest in the firearms. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Serio was convicted of \u201cmanslaughter by automobile,\u201d a felony under Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 1998 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 388. <em>Id. </em>at 378, 863 A.2d 952. On the same day that he was sentenced, Baltimore County police obtained a search warrant and seized numerous firearms from Serio\u2019s home, alleging that he was a felon in possession. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 863 A.2d 952. Although Serio was not charged as a felon in possession, the County refused to return the firearms to Serio, or to sell them and give him the proceeds. Serio subsequently filed a five-count complaint against the County and one of the police officers who seized his firearms, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the return of his seized property. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 863 A.2d 952. Later, Stanski was added as a plaintiff, claiming he intended to purchase the seized firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 863 A.2d 952. After further amendment of the suit, related federal court proceedings, and other state court proceedings, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to the counts in which Serio requested\u2019 the return of his firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 863 A.2d 952. At a show cause hearing held two months later, to consider the return of the firearms, the court ruled that \u201cthe seized firearms and related items could not be returned to Serio or given to Stanski [his designee] for disposal because doing so would allow \u2018the defendant or claimant to profit by what he cannot possess legally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed. Although Serio, as a convicted felon, \u201cis not permitted to possess the firearms,\u201d the Court recognized that \u201che retains an ownership property interest in them____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 863 A.2d 952. The Court added that <em>Se\u00f1o </em>was entitled to due process protections under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which states that, \u201cno man ought to be ... deprived of his ... property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned, <em>id.: </em>\u201c[W]hether Serio\u2019s firearms are viewed as derivative contraband ... or as property that is incapable of possession because of Serio\u2019s status as a convicted felon, Serio is not divested of his ownership interest, and the County cannot just retain the firearms.\u201d Moreover, the Court noted that, \u201c[w]hen property has been physically appropriated by a governmental entity from a property owner, the government must \u2018justly\u2019 compensate the property owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 863 A.2d 952. In addition, the Court said: \u201cThe full monetary equivalent to compensate a person deprived of his property interests by the government is based upon the fair market value of his property ... which in the present case may be realized through a court ordered sale of the firearms ____\u201d <em>Id. See </em>Md. Rule 14-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Under <em>Se\u00f1o, </em>appellant\u2019s motion is not moot; regardless of the perjury conviction, he may have a right to a court-ordered sale of his weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Alternatively, even if the case is moot, it is worthy of our consideration because of the public importance of the issue of whether an emergency mental health evaluation constitutes a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cA case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties at the time it is before the court so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951 (1996); <em>see Hill v. Scartascini, </em>134 Md.App. 1, 4, 758 A.2d 1087 (2000).

Mr. Furda did have a hearing scheduled, but rather was released within an hour of that scheduled hearing. There was never an adjudication, never a decision made by a Judge, and no evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>heard. Furthermore, Mr. Furda was not represented by counsel, and he did not have the adversarial proceeding that is clearly contemplated by the Federal statute.... Thus, Mr. Furda was never \u201ccommitted\u201d and was never adjudicated a mental defective, and his brief evaluation period does not disqualify him from possessing firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The State counters that Furda was committed within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), which prohibits possession of a firearm by \u201ca person who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution.\u201d It rejects appellant\u2019s contention that the determination of a \u201ccommitment\u201d requires an evidentiary hearing at which the individual is represented by counsel. The State points to several federal cases indicating that, \u201cunder statutory schemes similar to Maryland\u2019s, an involuntary admission to a mental facility based on doctors\u2019 certifications is a \u2018commitment,\u2019 even in the absence of a formal judicial order of commitment following an adversary hearing.\u201d Thus, in the context of federal law, the State argues: \u201cFurda was \u2018committed\u2019 at the second stage of Maryland\u2019s involuntary admission process \u2014 that is, when he was certified for involuntary admission to Potomac Ridge by two doctors at Montgomery General Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Ordinarily, we review the denial of a motion for reconsideration based on an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>Wilson-X v.

We agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that the term \u201ccommitment\u201d is not limited solely to involuntary civil commitment proceedings. <em>See United States v.

In the absence of such minimal safeguards, the term does not extend to a brief hospitalization for purposes of an emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>mental health evaluation. Therefore, in this case, Furda\u2019s hospitalization was not a commitment under federal law.

Accordingly, we first review Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme for involuntary admission of persons, who, as a result of mental illness, may be a danger to themselves or others.

In particular, an application for involuntary admission of an individual to a facility must be accompanied by the certificates of one physician and one psychologist, or two physicians. H.G. \u00a7 10-615(6). Each must sign the certificate, based on an examination of the evaluee. H.G. \u00a7 10-616(a). Moreover, it must include a \u201cdiagnosis of the mental disorder of the individual\u201d; \u201can opinion that the individual needs inpatient care or treatment\u201d; \u201cand an opinion that admission to a facility is needed for the protection of the individual or another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Within twelve hours after \u201cinitial confinement of an individual to any facility,\u201d the individual must be given a form notifying him/her of the provisions under which the individual was admitted, and of the individual\u2019s various rights, including the right to an involuntary admission hearing.

COMAR distinguishes between \u201cobservation status\u201d and \u201cinvoluntary admission.\u201d Specifically, COMAR 10.21.01.02(18) defines \u201cobservation status\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">the status of an individual between the time the individual is initially confined in an inpatient facility on the basis of application and certificates for IVA [involuntary admission] and the time the individual is either admitted, voluntarily or involuntarily, to the inpatient facility or is released by a physician or by an ALJ [administrative law judge] from the inpatient facility without being admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">COMAR 10.21.01.02(12) defines \u201cinvoluntary admission\u201d as follows: \u201c[When] an individual has been admitted to an inpatient facility by an ALJ <em>following an IVA hearing pursuant to Healthr-General Article, \u00a7 10-632, Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Maryland statutory scheme seems consistent with 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11. It contemplates an involuntary commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of an individual only if, <em>inter alia, </em>there is an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>United States v. Midgett, supra, </em>198 F.3d 143, is instructive, because it stands in marked contrast to what transpired in this case. There, the defendant was charged in a Virginia state court with breaking and entering. <em>Id. </em>at 144. Because he \u201cappeared to be suffering from mental problems, the [Virginia state] court appointed a physician\u201d to evaluate him \u201cto determine his mental competence to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The physician concluded that Midgett was \u201csuffering from a Delusional Disorder or even a Paranoid Schizophrenic formulation____ Therefore, he is in definite need of treatment which would require his hospitalization in a Psychiatric facility....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court reviewed the physician\u2019s statement, heard evidence, and then made factual findings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBased upon these findings, and with the consent of both Midgett\u2019s attorney and the attorney for the Commonwealth,\u201d the court issued an order committing the defendant \u201cto the custody of the Central State Hospital for mental health treatment under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2-169.2 (Michie 1995).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-45. As a result, Midgett was hospitalized for two months. <em>Id. </em>at 145. The prosecutor nol prossed the state charges, and Midgett was released for outpatient care on January 22,1997. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">A few years later, numerous weapons were found in Midgett\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>He was indicted in federal court on four counts of possession of a firearm by a person who had been committed to a mental institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id. </em>Midgett moved unsuccessfully to dismiss the indictment, arguing that \u201chis admission ... pursuant to the [earlier] state court order was not a \u2018commitment\u2019 under section 922(g)(4)____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">On appeal, Midgett reiterated that his confinement did not constitute a commitment, asserting that the federal statute applies only to confinements \u201cresulting from the state\u2019s formal civil commitment process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit disagreed, concluding that \u201cthe statute has a broader application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>explained: \u201cIn interpreting section 922(g)(4) ... we are not bound by the terminology of Virginia statutory law; rather, we must look to the substance of the state procedure.... And when we do, we cannot help but conclude that Midgett\u2019s confinement was a commitment within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In the Fourth Circuit\u2019s view, Midgett\u2019s confinement \u201cfalls squarely within any reasonable definition of \u2018committed\u2019 as used in Section 922(g)(4).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court cited the following facts in support of its decision, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">(1) Midgett was examined by a competent mental health practitioner; (2) he was represented by counsel; (3) factual findings were made by a judge who heard evidence; (4) a conclusion was reached by the judge that Midgett suffered from a mental illness to such a degree that he was in need of inpatient hospital care; (5) a judicial order was issued committing Midgett to a mental institution; and (6) he was actually confined there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Fourth Circuit reasoned, <em>id.: </em>\u201cGiven Midgett\u2019s proven history of mental instability, he is undoubtedly in that class of persons \u2018who by reason of their status, Congress considered too dangerous to possess guns.\u2019 <em>United States v. Dunford, </em>148 F.3d 385, 388-89 (4th Cir.1998).\u201d It concluded, <em>id.: </em>\u201cUnder these particular circumstances, we have no hesitancy in finding that Midgett was committed to a mental institution and that application of section 922(g)(4) is proper.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Unlike in <em>Midgett, </em>appellant was not afforded an opportunity for an attorney during his brief confinement; no hearing was ever held, either by a court or a hearing officer; no factual findings were made by a judge or a hearing officer who heard evidence; and no judicial or administrative order was issued to detain appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\"><em>United States v. Hansel, </em>474 F.2d 1120 (8th Cir.1973), is also informative. There, a local board of mental health concluded that the defendant was mentally ill and ordered him to be hospitalized pursuant to a Nebraska statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1122. A doctor evaluated the defendant, found that he did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>serious mental disorder, and that he did not need hospitalization. <em>Id. </em>Hansel subsequently purchased a firearm and, in doing so, \u201cstated on the \u2018Firearms Transaction Record\u2019 that he had not been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1121. Thereafter, he was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), for falsely certifying that he had not been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>He was also charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(4) (now g(4)), for receipt of a firearm after having been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>After Hansel was convicted, he appealed. <em>Id. </em>The Eighth Circuit reversed both convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In finding that the defendant had not been \u201ccommitted\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h), the Eighth Circuit noted that nothing in the statute \u201cindicates an intent to prohibit the possession of firearms by persons who had been hospitalized for observation and examination, where they were found not to be mentally ill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1123. It added: \u201cThe statute makes it clear that a commitment is required.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"><em>United States v. Giardina, </em>861 F.2d 1334 (5th Cir.1988), is also noteworthy. There, the defendant was examined by a staff psychiatrist at a Louisiana health clinic. <em>Id. </em>at 1334. After the psychiatrist signed a Physician\u2019s Emergency Certificate, the police took Giardina to a local hospital, where a deputy coroner executed a Coroner\u2019s Emergency Certificate, by which the defendant was detained for treatment for two weeks. <em>Id. </em>He was then released without any additional hospitalization or legal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Giardina was later indicted for \u201creceiving and possessing a firearm after having been committed to a mental institution.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334-35. After the district court ruled that Giardina had been committed to a mental institution, Giardina appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The Fifth Circuit observed that \u201cwhether Giardina was committed to a mental institution is a question of federal law, but in making that determination we may seek guidance from state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335. It posited: \u201cWas Giardina committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>under Louisiana law? If he was not, is that answer consistent with federal policy?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that Giardina\u2019s brief, emergency evaluation did not \u201cconstitute a commitment under Louisiana law. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Therefore, unless this conclusion is inconsistent with federal policy, there has been no violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) by Giardina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336. The court agreed with the <em>Hansel </em>Court that there is no indication in the statute that Congress intended to prohibit persons who had been hospitalized for observation and examination from possessing firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 1337 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><em>United States v. Dorsch, </em>363 F.3d 784 (8th Cir.2004), also provides guidance. Dorsch was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) after more than thirty firearms were found in his residence and it was learned that he previously had been involuntarily \u201ccommitted\u201d to the South Dakota Human Services Center. <em>Id. </em>at 785. Dorsch argued that his admission did not constitute a commitment to a mental institution under \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id. </em>The trial court disagreed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On appeal, Dorsch renewed his contention. <em>Id. </em>Citing 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11, the appellate court noted that \u201cregulations promulgated under \u00a7 922 define \u2018committed to a mental institution\u2019 as \u2018[a] formal commitment of a person to a mental institution by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) under federal law, the court sought \u201cguidance from the law of the state where the prior commitment occurred [South Dakota] as to the meaning of commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed: \u201cThe regulations further specify that involuntary commitments are included within the definition, but persons in a mental institution for observation or on a voluntary basis are not within the purview of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The court rejected Dorsch\u2019s claim that he had not been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution as contemplated by Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) and 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786-87. In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that the County Board of Mental Illness found that Dorsch was mentally ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and that \u201cinvoluntary commitment to a mental facility was the least restrictive treatment available for him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. Moreover, it noted that these determinations \u201cfollowed a hearing, during which Dorsch was represented by counsel, was given the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and during which a physician testified that Dorsch was mentally ill and met the requirements of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Whiton, </em>48 F.3d 356, 358 (8th Cir.1995) (stating that defendant was \u201ccommitted\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(4) where, following a hearing, a state court judge found defendant to be mentally ill and orally ordered him \u201ccommitted\u201d to the hospital for temporary mental health services).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>Gallegos v. Dunning, </em>277 Neb. 611, 764 N.W.2d 105 (2009), Gallegos voluntarily sought treatment at a hospital in Nebraska. <em>Id. </em>at 107. After the doctor examined him, she filed a petition with a mental health board (\u201cMHB\u201d), averring that she believed Gallegos was mentally ill and asking for a \u201c \u2018hearing to determine whether [Gallegos] is a mentally ill dangerous person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original). That same day, the MHB appointed another physician, Dr. William March, as Gallegos\u2019s custodian, \u201c \u2018with the understanding that [Gallegos] is to be held in [March\u2019s] custody ... for care and treatment up to a period of 7 days from the date of this order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original). A hearing was to be held three days later. <em>Id. </em>On the day of the hearing, Gallegos filed a request with the MHB for a 90-day continuance so that he could complete inpatient treatment at a local hospital. <em>Id. </em>Gallegos agreed that if he failed to \u201c \u2018fully comply with [his] treatment plan, the County Attorney may pursue civil commitment against [him].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alternation in original). The MHB granted the request and the petition was \u201c \u2018continued for 90 days on recommendation of ... March ... for reason the subject agrees to treatment at the mental hygiene clinic and [posttraumatic stress disorder] Clinic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original). On January 16, 2002, the initial petition was dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In February 2007, Gallegos filed a federal firearms application with the sheriff, who \u201crefused to issue Gallegos a gun registration,\u201d because Gallegos\u2019s \u201c \u2018[MHB] Order with hospital stay\u2019 was a \u2018Federal Handgun Prohibitor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 (alteration in original). The county court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, the court acknowledged that whether Gallegos had been committed to a mental institution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) is determined under federal law, <em>id., </em>but recognized that it \u201cmay ... seek guidance from Nebraska law as to the meaning of \u2018commitment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108-09. The court said, <em>id. </em>at 109:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">Under the version of the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act (MHCA) in effect at the time of Gallegos\u2019 hospitalization, any person who believed another might be mentally ill and dangerous could communicate that belief to the county attorney[] If the county attorney agreed, he or she could file a petition with the local board of mental health stating such belief and indicating whether the subject of the petition should be immediately taken into custody.[]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Assuming it was necessary to take someone into immediate custody, a warrant would be issued for that purpose.[] Under this circumstance, Nebraska law required the subject to be examined by a mental health professional within 36 hours unless the subject had been examined within the previous 24 hours. A hearing was required</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">to determine whether there [was] clear and convincing proof that the subject of a petition [was] a mentally ill dangerous person and that neither voluntary hospitalization nor other alternatives less restrictive of his or her liberty than a mental-health-board-ordered treatment disposition [were] available or would suffice to prevent the harm described in Section 83-1009 [a substantial risk of harm to the subject or to others].[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8u\">Further, the court explained that, after the MHB conducted a hearing, it \u201ccould either conclude there was not clear and convincing evidence that a subject was a mentally ill dangerous person, and dismiss the petition,[] or could conclude there was clear and convincing evidence that the subject was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>mentally ill dangerous person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the MHB found that \u201c \u2018neither voluntary hospitalization nor other treatment alternatives less restrictive of the subject\u2019s liberty [were] available,\u2019 the board was required to enter an order providing for treatment of the subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The court determined that Gallegos was not committed within the definition set forth in 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11 or within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 110. It reasoned: \u201cWhile Gallegos was initially hospitalized under an MHB order, the MHB never made any finding that Gallegos was a mentally ill dangerous person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the MHB never found that \u201c \u2018voluntary hospitalization [or] other alternatives less restrictive of his ... liberty than a mental-health-board-ordered treatment disposition\u2019 were necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the board \u201cgranted Gallegos\u2019 request that he be allowed to undergo voluntary treatment and eventually dismissed the petition filed against him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Court was also of the view that its finding was consistent with the definition of \u201ccommitted to a mental institution\u201d in 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11, which requires a \u201cformal\u201d commitment and excludes admission to a mental institution \u201c \u2018for observation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said, <em>id.: </em>\u201cTo the extent that Gallegos\u2019 3-day hospitalization prior to his request to undergo voluntary hospitalization could be considered a \u2018commitment,\u2019 such was also unaccompanied by any hearing or finding that Gallegos was a mentally ill dangerous person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In <em>United States v. Waters, </em>23 F.3d 29 (2nd Cir.1994), the defendant was involuntarily hospitalized in 1979 \u201con a Two-Physicians Certif\u00edc\u00e1te, in accordance with New York Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 9.27(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. The court noted that, pursuant to New York law, \u201cThe director of a hospital may receive and retain therein as a patient any person alleged to be mentally ill and in need of involuntary care and treatment upon the certificates of two examining physicians, accompanied by an application for the admission of such person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that an individual involuntarily admitted under New York law \u201cmay request a hearing on the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the need for involuntary care and treatment \u2018at any time prior to the expiration of sixty days from the date of involuntary admission of [the] patient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Waters never requested or had a hearing. <em>Id. </em>In fact, sixty days following his involuntary admission, he \u201crequested that his status be converted to voluntary status ...,\u201d and he was released seven months later. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In November 1991, Waters was indicted for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), based on his psychiatric hospitalization in 1979. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. He moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that his earlier hospitalization \u201cdid not constitute a \u2018commitment\u2019 to a mental institution\u201d within the meaning of the federal statute, \u201cbecause there was no judicial order of commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. The district court denied the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">On appeal, the court noted that, \u201c[w]hile determination of the issue of whether the appellant \u2018was committed to a mental institution is a question of federal law,\u2019 a reviewing court may \u2018seek guidance from state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31 (citation omitted). It explained that \u201c[o]nce state law has addressed the general question, the federal court must then consider if the outcome is consistent with federal policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, under New York law, the right to a formal judicial proceeding was never triggered because the patient converted his hospitalization to a voluntary admission of prolonged duration. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Thus, the court was satisfied that the hospitalization amounted to a commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Here, Mr. Furda arrived at the Hospital at 2:28 a.m. on February 28, 2003, and he was evaluated in the emergency room. Appellant was transferred to Potomac Ridge within 24 hours. Although a hearing was set for March 4, 2003, at 9:30 a.m., to determine whether appellant would be released or detained involuntarily, the record does not reflect that a hearing ever took place. Notably, Furda was not afforded an attorney, and no court, agency, or hearing officer made findings of fact or conclusions of law to establish grounds to detain appellant involuntarily. Indeed, Furda was discharged from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Potomac Ridge within an hour of the hearing scheduled on March 4, 2003. Dr. Marnell made the following assessment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azo\">I have no grounds for detaining the patient at this time. There is no evidence of psychosis, confusion or withdrawal. He denies being suicidal or homicidal. He is behaviorally appropriate on the unit. His mood has stabilized. He is responsible for his actions.... Once again, I emphasize the patient is completely responsible for his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The State relies on <em>United States v. Chamberlain, </em>159 F.3d 656 (1st Cir.1998). There, a health clinician sought Chamberlain\u2019s involuntary admission to a mental institution on an emergency basis. <em>Id. </em>at 657. In the application, the clinician indicated that \u201c \u2018Chamberlain has a mental illness and, due to mental illness, poses a likelihood of serious harm, on the basis that he put a loaded gun to his head and threatened his wife.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>A judge in Maine certified that the application complied with the law, and ordered the subject\u2019s admission to a mental institution for no more than five days, the maximum length of an emergency detention under Maine statutory law. <em>Id. </em>After the initial five-day emergency detention, Chamberlain voluntarily admitted himself to the facility and remained there for a little over a week. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Chamberlain was later arrested for possessing firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id. </em>He moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that he had not been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Reasoning that \u201c \u2018commitment\u2019 occurs pursuant to procedures required by state law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 658, the court said: \u201c[W]e believe that the proper interpretation of the phrase, \u2018committed to a mental institution\u2019 should not turn primarily on the label attached by the state legislature to its procedures, but rather on the substance of those procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663. It continued: \u201cThus, rather than focus on the nuances of state statutory language in interpreting \u2018commitment,\u2019 we look at the realities of the state procedures and construe them in light of the purposes Congress sought to accomplish by prohibiting firearm possession by someone who has been \u2018committed to a mental institution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court focused on determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201cwhether identifying the state\u2019s procedures for involuntary hospitalization as a \u2018commitment\u2019 is reasonable and consistent with the federal policy underlying the firearms ban \u2014 namely, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who, if permitted to possess them, would pose a risk or potential for harm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In concluding that Chamberlain was \u201ccommitted\u201d to a mental institution for the purpose of the federal statute, the court stated, <em>id. </em>at 664:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">We reject Chamberlain\u2019s argument that a person is not \u201ccommitted\u201d for purposes of the federal firearms ban unless all of the requirements set forth in section 3864 [of the Maine statute] including provision of counsel, a full-blown adversary hearing, a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the person suffers from a mental illness, and a judicial order of commitment \u2014 are satisfied.... [T]o treat section 3864 detention as the only \u201creal\u201d commitment would come close to limiting \u201ccommitments\u201d to cases in which a person has actually been \u201cadjudicated a mental defective\u201d after an adversary hearing. [The statute] separately bans persons who have been \u201cadjudicated a mental defective\u201d from owning firearms, in addition to those who have been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution.\u201d ... <em>Requiring an adversary hearing and a judicial finding of mental illness would conflate two of the categories Congress singled out for the firearms prohibition. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The State also cites <em>United States v. Holt, </em>464 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.2006), which is consistent with <em>Chamberlain. </em>There, on February 16, 2004, a licensed clinical social worker applied for Holt\u2019s involuntary admission to a mental institution in Maine. <em>Id. </em>at 102. The application included a certification from a psychiatrist who examined Holt and concluded that he posed a \u201c \u2018likelihood of serious harm due to a mental illness....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The next day, a state judge authorized the county sheriffs to move Holt to a medical facility. <em>Id. </em>By May 10, 2004, Holt was no longer in a medical facility. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Holt was subsequently charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), by possessing a firearm after having been committed to a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>At trial, over objection, the court instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018[a]n involuntary commitment occurs when a State Judge, pursuant to an application for involuntary admission to a mental hospital, authorizes the sheriff to take the person into custody and transport him to a hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. Holt was convicted and appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On appeal, the court decided the \u201ccommitment\u201d issue by considering the Maine involuntary commitment statute, which is similar to Maryland\u2019s. In that statute, upon application, and with a proper medical certificate, a judicial officer reviews the material and, if the judicial officer is satisfied that the documents are in accordance with law, he or she shall \u201cendorse\u201d them. <em>Id. </em>at 104. At that point, the subject may be transported to a hospital. <em>Id. </em>The court relied on <em>Chamberlain </em>in concluding that \u201ca commitment under the Maine statute occurs when the court orders an involuntary hospitalization and not when the ... physician determines that the individual should remain in the institution after the 24-hour examination____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. In the court\u2019s view, the judicial order authorizing Holt\u2019s admission met \u201cthe ordinary definition of \u2018commitment\u2019 embraced in <em>Chamberlain: </em>\u2018to place in or send officially to confinement ... to consign legally to a mental institution....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105 (quoting <em>Chamberlain, </em>159 F.3d at 661) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The First Circuit reasoned that \u201cthe term \u2018committed\u2019 in the statute refers to a judicial (or possibly an administrative) order of commitment and does not depend on the ultimate outcome of the commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because a court had initially ordered Holt\u2019s involuntary hospitalization, the court rejected his argument that he was not \u201ccommitted\u201d under the federal statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In our view, Congress generally intended for the \u201ccommitment\u201d process to be marked by some type of adjudicatory process. The ATF regulations, set forth in 27 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00a7 478.11, are consistent with that interpretation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly, the substance of Maryland\u2019s statutory and regulatory scheme, discussed <em>supra, </em>clearly recognizes that an emergency evaluation is not the same as a \u201ccommitment.\u201d It affords individuals the procedural protections that are harmonious with what we believe Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We are not persuaded by the view that if an evidentiary hearing is required in order for an admission to constitute a commitment, then it would conflate and render meaningless the statutory alternative of \u201cadjudicated a mental defective.\u201d The breadth of the C.F.R.\u2019s definition of \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d convinces us that the two concepts are not the same, so as to render one superfluous, which would be at odds with principles of statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274-75, 987 A.2d 18 (2010). Moreover, as in <em>Waters, supra, </em>23 F.3d 29, we recognize that there may well be circumstances when the need for a hearing is not triggered, such as when a patient agrees to a voluntary admission. As the <em>Midgett </em>Court indicated, 198 F.3d at 146, a person can be found to have been committed outside the parameters of the civil commitment process, because it is the substance of what occurred that is dispositive. But, in this case, we see no substance that would lead us to conclude that appellant was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Finally, we disagree with the view expressed in <em>Chamberlain, </em>suggesting that the initial, <em>ex parte </em>judicial review of a petition is sufficient to constitute a commitment. That a judge approves an ex parte petition for an emergency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>involuntary mental health evaluation is hardly the equivalent of a commitment. In our view, that would be akin to suggesting that an arrest warrant approved by a judge is the equivalent of a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

When a revisory motion is filed beyond the ten-day period, but within thirty days, an appeal noted within thirty days after the court resolves the revisory motion addresses only the issues generated by the revisory motion.
