(\u201cMs. M.\u201d). The incident occurred more than eleven years earlier, on November 17, 1997, when Ms. M. was eighteen years old and appellant was fifteen. The jury also convicted appellant of related offenses, including one count of second degree sexual offense; two counts of fourth degree sexual offense, and three counts of second degree assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>sentenced appellant to a total of thirty years imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, appellant poses two questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">1. Did the trial court err by giving a missing witness instruction over the defense counsel\u2019s multiple objections and drawing the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that particular defense witnesses were not called to testify without inquiring whether such witnesses were peculiarly available to the Appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">2. Did the trial court err in permitting an inconsistent jury verdict of guilty on three charges of second degree assault and not guilty of one charge of second degree [assault] when the charging documents and the verdict sheet do not differentiate among different acts that could be the basis for separate assault charges?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer the first question in the affirmative and shall reverse and remand. Because the second question is not likely to recur on remand, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">At trial, Baltimore City Police Detective Chester Norton testified that he worked in the Sex Crimes Unit from 1998 to July 2007. He became involved in this case on April 9, 2007, when he received a DNA match linking appellant\u2019s DNA to vaginal swabs obtained from Ms. M. on November 18, 1997, shortly after she reported that she was raped. Detective Norton explained that he then contacted Ms. M. in California and interviewed her on the telephone. Ms. M. told him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>she had been raped in November 1997; she was also forced to perform fellatio; and the assailant had a gun. Detective Norton indicated, without objection, that what Ms. M. told him on the phone was consistent with what she had reported in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Ms. M. returned to Baltimore in August 2007 in connection with the investigation. According to Detective Norton, Baltimore City detectives Joseph Peters and Caprice Smith showed her a photo array on August 3, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The investigators also obtained a search warrant to \u201cget a confirmation swabbing of the defendant, to compare it against the case evidence to be sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Detective Smith, of the Sex Offense Unit, testified that she was a witness to a six-person photo array at which Ms. M. identified the person depicted in photograph five as the individual who attacked her. She also indicated that Ms. M. signed her name next to the photograph. However, Detective Smith did not know whether photograph five depicted appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Reginald Webb testified that he is the father of Ms. M.\u2019s children, has known her since 1996, and they are friends. According to Mr. Webb, in a telephone conversation with Ms. M. on the night of November 17, 1997, she told him she was going to take a cab from her aunt\u2019s house on Washington Street to his mother\u2019s house, which was nine or ten blocks away on Monument Street. Mr. Webb recalled that \u201c[t]ime just started going by and she wasn\u2019t there yet....\u201d Noting that Ms. M. is a \u201cprompt person\u201d, Mr. Webb thought that perhaps she had started walking while \u201ctrying to flag a cab down.\u201d Mr. Webb called Ms. M.\u2019s aunt, who indicated that Ms. M. had left about thirty minutes earlier. Mr. Webb then \u201cwaited some more,\u201d but Ms. M. \u201cnever came.\u201d He went outside to look for Ms. M. but did not see her, so he again called Ms. M.\u2019s aunt. She indicated that she had not seen Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>M. since she and Webb last spoke. Webb again walked outside, and this time he saw Ms. M. He recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">[She] was running into [his] mother\u2019s backyard, and she didn\u2019t have on any pants, no pants, no shoes, she was crying. She had dirt all over her face, and her shirt was like real wet. So I grabbed and pulled her in the house, and I was asking what happened. And when she got in the house, she just \u2014 she collapsed, she fell, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">She was trying to talk, but she couldn\u2019t talk. So I went and got a washcloth, and wiped her face off, and when I got close to her, I could smell her, she smelt [sic] like urine. So I had called the police, and the ambulance, and the police had came over. And she was telling me that \u2014 she was trying to say that she had got raped, but she couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if she was in shock or what was going on. But she was shaking like she was outside in the cold, so she couldn\u2019t get it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">According to Mr. Webb, on the night in question, Ms. M. recounted the details of what had occurred. He stated, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">She had told me that she called a cab, and she said that she left out, and the cab had came, but it kept going. And then she said she tried to flag a couple of cabs down, they wouldn\u2019t stop. So she said she started walking.... And she said when she got near Church Square Mall, she said this guy came up behind her and told her to come here. And she said no. And she said he put a gun to her back, and made her walk over ... [to] Water Towers. I think it\u2019s a retirement home or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">And there\u2019s a wall over there, she said he made her walk behind the wall, and she kept telling him she didn\u2019t want to go with him, and she said she started screaming out for help, there\u2019s nobody outside, and he told her if she kept screaming, he was going to hurt her. Took her behind the wall, and she said he pushed her on the ground, and made her give him oral sex, and took her pants off, and ... he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>urinated on her, he had \u2014 he tried to have sex with her anally, and he didn\u2019t, but he had sex with her vaginally, and he took \u2014 after\u2014she said he put dirt in her mouth and put a sock in her mouth while he was doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">And I remember her saying that he kept telling her over and over again, that she was his girlfriend or something like that. And she said she heard some police cars or squad cars, something, a siren, and he stopped, and she said she had a bag of clothes, because she had went shopping, and he took the clothes, and he walked off, and she said, once he left, she said she laid there for, I don\u2019t know how long, but she got up, and looked around the wall, to see if he was there, and he wasn\u2019t, and that\u2019s when she said she ran to my mother\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Jennifer Ingridson, a DNA analyst for the Baltimore City Police Department, testified as an expert in serology. In April 2003, Ms. Ingridson analyzed swabs that were taken from Ms. M.\u2019s vagina in the early morning hours of November 18, 1997. Her report of April 28, 2003, was admitted into evidence. According to Ms. Ingridson, the \u201ctesting of the vaginal swabs revealed that there was seminal fluid present, as well as sperm.\u201d The State also introduced Ms. Ingridson\u2019s report of November 2007, containing serological findings as to the underwear worn by Ms. M. on the night of the alleged attack. Ms. Ingridson noted that \u201c[t]wo of the stains were positive for the presence of creatine, which is just the possible presence of urine.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Jocelyn Carlson, of the Baltimore City Police Department, testified as an expert in DNA analysis. She analyzed the \u201csuspect standard,\u201d and then compared it to the vaginal swabs previously analyzed\u201d by BRT Laboratories (\u201cBRT\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ms. Carlson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The sperm fraction of the vaginal swab A from BRT, which is in my table, sample 2S, yielded a DNA profile consistent with the known standard from Tranell Dansbury. The chan[c]es of selecting an unrelated individual from a random population, possessing a stained profile as the evidence sample at the tested LOSI [sic] are approximately 1 in 74.6 quintillion individuals in the American Caucasian population, 1 in 6.99 quintillion individuals in the African American population, and 1 in 164 quintillion individuals in the southeast Hispanic American population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">Basically that means that [appellant\u2019s] profile, all the alleles he has matched all the alleles that were in the sperm fraction of the vaginal swabs, and the statistics are such that it\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else would\u2019ve developed\u2014 would\u2019ve contributed to that profile. A quintillion is a very large number, and the population of Earth right now is only 6.5 billion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">But, Ms. Carlson indicated that the sample also \u201ccontained a minor allele.\u201d The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4i\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So it\u2019s my understanding that [the minor allele] could indicate another person; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">[MS. CARLSON]: Minor alleles are just when the amount of DNA has not reached the same level as the amount from another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">In this case, the sperm fraction sample that [the prosecutor] was talking about, there was one minor allele.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abp8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So let me understand that, basically would it be fair to say that you cannot say that that minor allele of sperm belongs to Tranell Dansbury; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>[MS. CARLSON]: Well, that minor allele does not belong to Tranell, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Mary Davidson testified that she has worked as a \u201cSAFE\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nurse since 1994. She explained that \u201c[a] safe nurse is a nurse who has a special training in collecting evidence from persons who report sexual assault. [Safe nurses] also treat the persons ... for exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, and connect them with crisis centers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Davidson met with Ms. M. at around 5:15 a.m. on November 18, 1997, and examined her shortly afterwards. Davidson documented that Ms. M.\u2019s clothes were \u201cwet and stained and covered with debris,\u201d and she collected Ms. M.\u2019s bra and shirt. In addition, Ms. M. had \u201cforeign material collected, debris, which was inside the labia majora, the oral cavity and her hair.\u201d Ms. M. also \u201chad a crusty drainage around her anus that was collected.\u201d According to Davidson, Ms. M. suffered some genital injuries, including lacerations to her posterior forchette, which is a \u201clittle area below the vagina opening, but not at the anal opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">State\u2019s Exhibit 8 was a copy of Ms. M.\u2019s medical record, which included Davidson\u2019s notes from her interview of Ms. M. on November 18, 1997, and a summary of the specimens collected from her. Without objection, Davidson read from her notes of her interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">[Ms. M.] left her aunt\u2019s house, and she tried to flag down a cab. She said one cab did stop, but a stranger came up from behind, and grabbed her by her jacket, and said \u201ccome go down the street.\u201d The cab driver drove off. She questioned the stranger, \u201cdo I know you?\u201d Then she, \u201cfelt his gun in my back.\u201d He took her behind this wall, behind an old folk\u2019s home. He told her to give him her money. He pushed her to the ground, and pointed a gun at her head. He didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t give him the money, so he dug into her pockets and took it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>He told her to take her clothes off. She states, \u201cI was taking too long, so he pulled my pants down, and took them off.\u201d She was crying and yelling, \u201chelp.\u201d She states two people walked by and saw, but they ran off. He told her to get on her knees, and \u201csuck my dick.\u201d He shoved her head down, and made her do it. He ejaculated in her mouth. She spit it out. He told her to lay on the ground, the gun was pointed at her face. He then penetrated her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">He tried to get her to kiss him, but she turned her head, like she was coughing. He told her \u2014 he hit her in the face. He did ejaculate. He kept asking her if she liked it. She was crying and yelling, no one came.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">When he was finished, he made her kneel down and \u201cgive him head.\u201d He kept smacking the back of her head and telling her to go faster. He ejaculated again. He then made her lay on her back, and he penetrated her vagina again. He said, \u201cbitch, don\u2019t you want it.\u201d He again made her give him head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">He then got up and peed on [her] coat and face and shirt. He then pulled her up and pushed her against the tree. He asked her if she had anymore money or valuables he would want. She said no. He used the gun like he was going to hit her, and then clicked it back, and had his finger on the trigger and pointed it at her head. He then put it in her mouth, he took it out, and made her lay on the ground on her stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">He picked up her bag, pointed the gun at her head, told her to look down and stuffed dirt in her mouth. He kept saying some more, some more. He walked off saying, if he heard her moving while he was walking away, he would shoot her. She peeked once, and he was still there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">The second time, he was gone, and then she put her shoes on and ran. She saw him heading towards the projects. She ran to her boyfriend\u2019s house. The clothes he took from her, she was taking these clothes to her mother\u2019s house. It was a royal blue Mountain ... a white, some kind of jacket, a sky blue New York Yankees jersey, $35, black hooded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>sweatshirt and pants and some deodorant, bra and underwear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Davidson acknowledged that Ms. M. did not tell her about being hit with a handgun. She tested Ms. M.\u2019s alcohol level and \u201cit was less than 20,\u201d but agreed that that does not necessarily mean it was that low at 11:00 pm on November 17, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Ms. M. testified that she is a special education assistant. At the time of trial, she resided in California. At the time of the attack, however, she was a college student in Baltimore and worked as a waitress. In November 1997, she lived with her aunt at 911 North Washington Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">With respect to the events in issue, Ms. M. recalled that she had agreed to meet her boyfriend, Reginald Webb, at his house, located at 1306 Monument Street, less than a mile from her aunt\u2019s house. As to the night in question, she recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOK\">I stepped outside my aunt\u2019s house, and I flagged down a cab, but the cab didn\u2019t stop, it kept going. So I walked down a little further, down the street, I\u2019m not sure exactly what street it was on. But I saw another cab, and I tried to get it to stop, but it didn\u2019t. And I just decided to walk the rest of the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">And I walked all the way up to ... it was in between a church and a KFC, it was in a shopping center. And as I crossed the street, I saw cars going by, and one of the cars stopped and let a guy out, but it kept going. And he said, hey, stop, let me talk to you for a minute, and I said, no. And I kept walking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">And before I could cross the street, he caught up to me, and he had a gun in my back. And he asked me to go with him up the hill behind the wall,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and I said, no. And he said, you\u2019re going to go with me, because you\u2019re my girlfriend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>He then directed me to go behind the wall, that was at the old folks home, and he told me to take my clothes off. And I said, no. And that\u2019s when he took my clothes off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">According to Ms. M., \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much light ... \u201d, although a nearby light post emitted some light. The assailant removed her pants, sweat pants, and underwear. Ms. M. continued: \u201cThen he told me to lay down, and I wouldn\u2019t. And then he pulled me down, and that\u2019s when he began to\u2014 that\u2019s when he raped me.\u201d Ms. M. indicated that the rapist did not use a condom. Further, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">He put his penis in my vagina, and kept going, even though I told him no, and I told him to stop. He wouldn\u2019t stop. And I asked him to let me go, and he said no, that I was his girlfriend, and he just kept saying it over and over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">And then he told me to turn over, and I said no. And he turned me over, and he pushed my face down in the dirt. And he then put his penis into my vagina again. He ejaculated, and then he sat me up, and made me perform oral sex on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">He placed his penis in my mouth, and asked me \u2014 he asked me to keep sucking harder, and I was like, no, I didn\u2019t want to. So he grabbed the back of my head and forced me to do it. And he ejaculated in my mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">Then he urinated on my head and all over my face, and shoved dirt in my mouth, and turned me back over on my stomach, and put his penis in my vagina again. Then he stopped, and he hit me on my head with the gun, because I asked him, why don\u2019t you just kill me, if you want to kill me, just kill me. And he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">He had the gun pointed at my face, ... [i]t didn\u2019t go off for some reason.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>He then again repeatedly raped me, and I saw two strangers walk across the old folks home, and I asked them to help, because he was raping me. And they just looked at me, like I was crazy. And he told them to go away that he was my boyfriend and I liked it. And I said no, he\u2019s not, and he hit me with his hand, and they [sic] ran off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">I kept telling him to stop, and by that time, I heard a police car. I don\u2019t know if he heard it, too, but that\u2019s when he stopped and he ran off. And I got up, and I wiped my face with my hands, because I could barely see. There was urine in my face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Ms. M. recalled that she had been \u201ccarrying some presents and a bag and a backpack,\u201d and the assailant took her money. After the assault, Ms. M. ran to her boyfriend\u2019s house, wearing \u201cjust a shirt and a bra.\u201d Her pants were \u201cat the scene,\u201d along with her \u201cunderwear.\u201d She recalled: \u201c[B]efore I could knock on the door, he opened the door, and I fell to my knees. And I think that\u2019s when I told him what happened, and I told him to call the police.\u201d Ms. M. went to Mercy Hospital, where she was examined by a nurse who \u201ctook swabs.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Ms. M. identified appellant in court as the person who raped her. She maintained that she did not know her assailant. Ms. M. also identified the clothing she wore at the time of the attack, which was admitted in evidence, as well as a pair of gloves worn by her attacker.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">On cross-examination, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... And isn\u2019t it true that when you spoke to Detective Peters ... in August 2007, you noted that the person was 20, 22 years of age, five foot four, five foot eight, moustache, smelled of alcohol. Do you remember telling him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>[Ms. M.]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Ms. [M.], on November the 18th, 1997, did you tell a police officer that the person who raped you was a black male, approximately 19 years of age, five foot seven, 150 pounds, moustache, black hair, black blue jacket, bluejeans, white sneakers, light skin, had been drinking? Did you tell a police officer that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">[Ms. M.]: I do not giving [sic] the description, but I do remember saying that he had alcohol on his breath.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel referred Ms. M. to State\u2019s Exhibit 1, a photo array she was shown on August 3, 2007. Ms. M. agreed that she initially pointed to the individual in photo number five as the person who attacked her, and that person was not appellant. The detective instructed her to sign photograph number five to signify that the individual in that photograph raped her. When asked whether \u201cshe pick[ed] out any other photographs in the photo array,\u201d Ms. M. responded: \u2018Tes, but I was unable to sign it, because [the detective] said I had to sign the one that I chose first.\u201d Although Ms. M. claimed that she immediately \u201clet the detective[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] know that it was the wrong person,\u201d Ms. M. acknowledged that the \u201cRemarks\u201d section on the back of the photo array did not indicate that she told the detective she selected the wrong person. She also said that she was shown another photo array, but she did not make any identifications in that photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Defense counsel asked Ms. M.: \u201c[I]sn\u2019t it true, Ms. [M.] that you do know [appellant], and not as a rapist ... ?\u201d Ms. M. responded: \u201cNo, it is not.\u201d She also disputed that she was ever at the home of appellant\u2019s aunt or that she had been involved in a dispute with appellant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">On re-direct, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR:] When you looked at this photo array, when you turned it over and looked at it, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">[Ms. M.]: I looked over it a couple of minutes, and I wasn\u2019t certain, because it was 11 years ago. It was hard to identify the person at first. But once I signed, I realized I signed the wrong one, and I let the detective know as soon as possible, that\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay. So had you already signed your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">[MS.

The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">Appellant was the sole witness for the defense. As noted, he was fifteen years of age in November 1997. Dansbury testified that he knew Ms. M. as a \u201cgirl that I had known or I met previously, you know, in the area of Monument Street and that I had some type of relationship with her at one time.\u201d Moreover, he claimed that he had sex with Ms. M. only once, and that it was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Appellant recalled that in 1997, he and a friend were walking on Monument Street and he \u201cnotice[d] there\u2019s girls coming down the street.... [Ms. MJ said \u2018what\u2019s up\u2019 to me or hello or whatever and then it went from there.\u201d Because his mother, Cynthia Ray, did not have a phone at the time, he gave Ms. M. the phone number for his aunt, Tanya Ray, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>lived next door. According to appellant, Ms. M. called him at his aunt\u2019s house and they spoke to each other \u201c[o]n more than one occasion.\u201d Then, one day in November, not \u201ctoo far from Thanksgiving,\u201d appellant had a few people over at his aunt\u2019s house, and Ms. M. stopped by. They started talking about school, and she told him that she was in college. When appellant\u2019s aunt came home from work, a little after 11:00 p.m., she \u201cstarted fussing or whatever about people being in the house,\u201d so he and Ms. M. went to appellant\u2019s house. While he and Ms. M. were talking, \u201cthe issue of I guess, you know, sex or whatever came up or whatever, and we started kissing. And one thing led to another and we ended up in my bedroom.\u201d However, appellant\u2019s younger brother was in the bedroom, so appellant told him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">According to appellant, he and Ms. M. then engaged in sexual intercourse. However, appellant\u2019s mother walked in and found them. His mother \u201casked [Ms. M.] something about her being out in somebody\u2019s house at that time of night having sex____\u201d Appellant could not \u201cremember exactly what [Ms. M.\u2019s] response was to [his] mother,\u201d but he related that his \u201cmother took it as disrespect.\u201d According to appellant, his mother and Ms. M. got into \u201ca tussle.\u201d His aunt heard the commotion and intervened, grabbing appellant\u2019s mother and \u201cbreaking it up.\u201d According to appellant, Ms. M. was \u201chollering and screaming,\u201d and walked toward the street corner, about five or six houses from his mother\u2019s house. Appellant claimed that he never saw Ms. M. again until the trial. And, he denied that he \u201cever attacked [Ms. M.] at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">On cross-examination, appellant indicated that when he had sex with Ms. M., he did not wear a condom and he ejaculated. Appellant claimed that his friend, Gerrell Green, was with him when he met Ms. M. for the first time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant also identified the other people who were present at his mother\u2019s house when Ms. M. was there: his sister, Diera, who was nine years old at the time; his brother Kevin, who was around ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>years old at the time; and his sister Denae, who was a baby at the time. Appellant also claimed that his cousin, Phillip, who was about twelve years old at the time, was at his aunt\u2019s house, along with his cousin, Darnell, who was around eighteen or nineteen years old at the time; his cousin, Sedrick, who was a baby at the time; his cousin, Devonte, who was about four years old at the time; his friend, Deandre, who was about seventeen or eighteen years old at the time; his friend, Gerrell, and Gerrell\u2019s brother, Antwon, who was about seventeen or eighteen years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">At the close of appellant\u2019s case, defense counsel again moved for judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion. The jury returned its verdict on June 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In his instructions to the jury at the end of the case, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>gave the following \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">Now, you have heard testimony about the defendant\u2019s mother and a number of his relatives and friends ...

The first objection was lodged before the instruction was propounded, when the trial judge told the parties he intended to give the instruction to the jury.

The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-12\">THE COURT: Now, you have heard testimony about the defendant\u2019s mother and a number of his relatives and friends\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: May we approach the bench, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-15\">THE COURT: Yes, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-16\">(Bench conference as follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-17\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That is not the standard instruction. If you wish to talk about that, I would say, with all due respect, you would have to talk about the victim\u2019s aunt who was mentioned, Mr. Webb\u2019s mother who was mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-18\">THE COURT: No, I don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019ve already told you I\u2019m going to give this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-19\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But the missing instruction would apply to State\u2019s witnesses, too. How can it just apply to defense witnesses?

If the State wants to argue that, that\u2019s perfectly proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">THE COURT: Are you finished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But it\u2019s completely improper for you to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The court proceeded to give the missing witness jury instruction, as noted earlier. Appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his objection at the end of jury instructions. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would just like \u2014 I have two, but first, I would like to expand with regard to my missing \u2014 my exception to the missing witness instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t need to explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, I do need to put this on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-16\">THE COURT: All right. Go ahead and explain. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: This is a situation where the defendant was charged, accused, and notified of this charge in 2007, ten years after the event. So I do except to the missing witness instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-17\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-18\">During closing argument, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-19\">So he just tells us that, yeah, this girl randomly like 11 years ago is at my house and we were playing video games, and over 11 or 12 of my family members saw her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>But where was Mr. Green? Mr. Green saw this victim or the female at the house, but allegedly this victim, not one time, but two times. So where is Mr. Green? Where is his aunt? Where is his mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">They got in a fight with her. There was actually a fight with this female at the house. So where are they to tell us what happened? Where is Deandre, Antoine, Phillip, Darnel, Cedric, Delante, Diarra? [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">Where\u2019s Kevin? Kevin got kicked out of his own bedroom, because there was [a] female coming in. Where\u2019s Kevin? And I\u2019m not even counting the two obviously that were infants at the time, because it would be ridiculous for them to \u2014 to expect them to know. But where are these 11 other witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">And I\u2019ll draw to your attention that you did hear about Cynthia Ray and Tonya[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] Ray, because they were on the witness list. So where are they today?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">On appeal, appellant argues that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s missing witness instruction, made without a request from either the prosecution or the defense, did not meet the legal requirements for giving such an instruction, and unnecessarily and substantially prejudiced the Appellant.\u201d Noting the gap of more than a decade between the incident and the trial, he points out that the \u201cjudge conducted no inquiry\u201d as to whether any of the \u201cwitnesses who conceivably could have testified\u201d were, in fact, available or \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to him. Moreover, he contends that \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s decision to mention particular defense -witnesses while not referring to any missing State witnesses placed him in a position to unfairly and unjustifiably assist the prosecution at the expense of Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In appellant\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he circumstances in this case fall far short of meeting the elemental requirement that a witness be \u2018peculiarly available\u2019 to a party prior to a judge giving a missing witness instruction.\u201d In this regard, he observes that his aunt and mother \u201cwere right outside the courtroom during the trial,\u201d and were equally available to the State. Moreover, he argues that the fact that some of the missing witnesses were his \u201crelatives does not render their testimony pragmatically unavailable to the State since relatives are not per se considered to be peculiarly available to one side; what matters is the context of the situation in which they were not called to testify.\u201d Appellant also claims that \u201canother potential witness who was listed in the voir dire, Gerrell Green, was incarcerated at the time of trial and therefore unavailable\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Further, Dansbury posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">As a practical matter, there are myriad reasons why the defense counsel may have chosen not to put particular witnesses on the stand, none of which would justify an inference being drawn that a witness would have testified that the Appellant\u2019s version of the story was factually mistaken, or worse, fabricated. Since the incident in question occurred over ten years ago, witnesses\u2019 memories may have faded, and defense counsel understandably could have been reluctant to have someone testify whose memory may have been questioned by the State during cross-examination. Moreover, defense counsel might have made an assessment that even if someone recalled Appellant in the company of Ms. [M.], that witness\u2019s demeanor or prior history would not have made a favorable impression. The defense counsel must have discretion in determining trial strategy. Thus, for the trial judge to insert himself in this case by essentially making the missing witness argument for the prosecution is to shift effectively the burden of proof to the Appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In addition, in assessing the effect of the instruction, appellant points to the central importance of credibility to this case. Conceding that he engaged in sexual intercourse with Ms. M., Dansbury maintains that \u201c[t]he only issue at trial was whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>this was consensual,\u201d and claims that his \u201ccredibility was the dispositive issue in the case.\u201d Because \u201cthe critical determination for the jury was who to believe \u2014 Ms. [M.] or Mr. Dansbury,\u201d coupled with \u201cthe weight that the jury would have likely given to the judge\u2019s guidance in assessing whether to credit [his] testimony,\u201d appellant insists that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The State counters that \u201cthe trial court properly instructed the jury on missing witnesses____\u201d In its view, \u201c[t]he court properly noted that the defense missing witnesses appeared to be \u2018peculiarly available\u2019 to the defense based on the fact that these witnesses were either relatives or close family friends.\u201d Further, it notes that \u201cthe court rejected Dansbury\u2019s argument that the testimony would not be material. Indeed, these witnesses, according to Dansbury, could corroborate his account of a relationship and consensual sex.\u201d Alternatively, the State claims that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because \u201cthe evidence of Dansbury\u2019s guilt was overwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">A \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction informs the jury that the failure of a party to call a material witness permits the jury to infer that the testimony would have been unfavorable to the party who failed to call such a witness. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 314-15, 554 A.2d 395 (1989); <em>Christensen v. State, 274 </em>Md. 133, 134-35, 333 A.2d 45 (1975); <em>Smith v.

United States, </em>150 U.S. 118, 121, 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>S.Ct. 40,37 L.Ed. 1021 [ (1893) ][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">Thus, the missing witness rule applies where (1) there is a witness, (2) who is peculiarly available to one side and not the other, (3) whose testimony is important and non-cumulative and will elucidate the transaction, and (4) who is not called to testify. The inference to be drawn from the failure to call a witness will arise only if the relationship between the defendant and the witness is one of interest or affection.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Notably, an adverse inference cannot be drawn \u201c \u201cwhen the witness is not available, or where his testimony is unimportant or cumulative, or where he is equally available to both sides.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 321, 554 A.2d 395 (citation omitted). <em>See also </em>2 <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 264 at 220 (6th ed. 2006) (\u201cWhen it would be natural under the circumstances for a party to call a particular witness ... and the party fails to do so, tradition has allowed the adversary to use this failure as the basis for invoking an adverse inference.\u201d). This Court has said: \u2018Whether, in given circumstances, an unfavorable inference may be drawn from missing evidence or witnesses is a matter of fact, not law____\u201d <em>Keyes v. Lerman, </em>191 Md.App. 533, 546, 992 A.2d 519 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Before deciding whether to propound a missing witness instruction, there is a \u201cpreferred procedure\u201d that the trial court should follow. <em>Christensen, </em>274 Md. at 135, 333 A.2d 45. In <em>Christensen, </em>the Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 135-36 n. 1, 333 A.2d 45 (citation omitted; emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">\u201cThe better practice ... is for the party seeking to obtain a charge encompassing such an inference to advise the trial judge and counsel out of the presence of the jury, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>close of his opponent\u2019s case, of his intent to so request and demonstrating the names or classes of available persons not called and the reasons for the conclusion that they have superior knowledge of the facts. <em>This would accord the party accused of nonproduction the opportunity of either calling the designated witness or demonstrating to the court by argument or proof the reason for the failure to call. </em>Depending upon the particular circumstances thus disclosed, the trial court may determine that the failure to call the witness raises no inference, or an unfavorable one, and hence whether any reference in the summation or a charge is warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The trial judge has discretion to grant or deny the instruction \u201cwhen the facts would support the inference.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 319 n. 7, 554 A.2d 395. Conversely, there is \u201cno discretion to grant the instruction where the facts do not support the inference.\u201d <em>Id. See Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 688, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999) (\u201c[A] missing evidence instruction generally need not be given; the failure to give such an instruction is neither error nor an abuse of discretion.\u201d). As this Court recently said, \u201cthe court is under no obligation to give an instruction on the matter. It may do so, and in certain circumstances perhaps it should do so, but ... failure to do so is not error or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Keyes, </em>191 Md.App. at 546, 992 A.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. 309, 554 A.2d 395, the defendant was charged with automobile theft. He did not call as a witness a person whose identity was known only to him, and who allegedly would have exonerated the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 554 A.2d 395. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in propounding a missing witness instruction, because it was likely that the witness would have invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 554 A.2d 395. The Court recognized that a \u201cprivileged witness\u201d need not \u201calways be called in order to avoid the unfavorable inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 554 A.2d 395. But, the Court reasoned that because there was no evidence of the witness\u2019s existence or involvement in the crime, other than from the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>trial court did not err in regard to the instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 554 A.2d 395. Based on the circumstances, the jury could infer that the defendant did not call the witness because his testimony would have been unfavorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 318, 554 A.2d 395:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">Even had there been no instruction concerning the availability of this inference, we think it likely that among the first questions posed in the deliberation of this case would have been, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the defendant produce Alvin Johnson?\u201d Only if, as a matter of law, the unfavorable inference could not have been drawn by the jurors would the trial judge have been authorized to prohibit the prosecutor from posing that same question in argument. And, only if the circumstances were such that the trial judge should have prohibited the argument would we be likely to reverse because the instruction was given. If the argument fairly may be made, then it stands to reason that a sufficient foundation of facts exists upon which the inference[ ] may be drawn.[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Even if the court does not propound a missing witness instruction, a party may be permitted, in closing argument, to argue the adverse inference to the jury. <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 52, 633 A.2d 867 (1993). <em>See Garrison v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 475, 483, 594 A.2d 1264 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 249, 600 A.2d 418 (1992). Generally, in a close case, a judge may opt to deny the instruction, in favor of closing argument, because \u201ca statement or instruction by the trial judge carries with it the imprimatur of a judge learned in the law, and therefore usually has more force and effect than if merely presented by counsel.\u201d <em>Hardison v. State, </em>226 Md. 53, 62, 172 A.2d 407 (1961). The Court of Appeals stated in <em>Lowry v. State, </em>363 Md. 357, 375, 768 A.2d 688 (2001) (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 52, 633 A.2d 867):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u2018Where a party raises the missing witness rule during closing argument, its use is just that \u2014 an argument---Furthermore, the opposing side also has an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>refute the argument and counter with reasons why the inference is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">In contrast to the argument context is the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury. In the latter case, the inference is communicated to the jury as part of the judge\u2019s binding jury instructions, creating the danger that the jury may give the inference undue weight.... A trial judge has discretion to deny a missing witness instruction, leaving the matter to closing arguments, even when the facts would support the inference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In this case, we do not consider the failure to give a missing \u25a0witness instruction. Rather, we consider the court\u2019s decision to propound such an instruction. <em>Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 716, 944 A.2d 538 (2008), is instructive in assessing the propriety of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Bereano, an \u201cexperienced lobbyist,\u201d agreed to provide consulting and lobbying services to Mercer Venture, Inc. (\u201cMercer\u201d), based on a contingency fee. <em>Id. </em>at 723-24, 944 A.2d 538. The agreement\u2019s terms were included in \u201ca letter from Bereano to Mike Traina of Mercer,\u201d which Traina signed. <em>Id. </em>at 724, 944 A.2d 538. The State Ethics Commission subsequently \u201cinitiated a complaint\u201d against Bereano for violation of Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 15-713(1) of the State Government Article, which prohibits a \u201cregulated lobbyist\u201d from entering into contingency fee arrangements for lobbying agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 727, 730, 944 A.2d 538. At the merits hearing, Bereano did not call Traina as a witness. <em>Id. </em>at 738-39, 944 A.2d 538. In the Commission\u2019s Final Decision and Order, it stated, <em>id. </em>at 739, 944 A.2d 538:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201cAt the hearing Respondent testified that the language in the fee agreement related to T% of the first year receivables\u2019 was added to the agreement at Mr. Traina\u2019s request and that Mr. Traina had sent him the language.... Mr. Traina was on the Respondent\u2019s witness list submitted to the Commission as part of the pre-hearing requirement pursuant to our regulations----Because Mr. Traina did not appear and testify, we make the inference pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u2018missing witness rule\u2019 that his testimony would not have supported Respondent\u2019s testimony particularly in view of Respondent\u2019s incongruous testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">On appeal, Bereano argued that the Commission should not have \u201cinfer[red] that his failure to call Tra\u00edna as a witness indicated] that Traina\u2019s testimony would [have been] unfavorable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 944 A.2d 538. The Court agreed and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 756, 944 A.2d 538. It reiterated, <em>id. </em>at 742, 944 A.2d 538:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">Before a missing witness inference may be drawn, it must be demonstrated that \u201cthe missing witness was peculiarly within the adversary\u2019s power to produce by showing either that the witness is physically available only to the opponent or that the witness has the type of relationship with the opposing party that pragmatically renders his testimony unavailable to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Chi. Coll. of Osteopathic Med. v. George A. Fuller Co., </em>719 F.2d 1335, 1353 (7th Cir.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Court observed that there was \u201cno contention ... that Tra\u00edna was not physically available to both parties. Therefore, the issue turns on whether Tra\u00edna was demonstrated to have the type of relationship with Bereano that would render Tra\u00edna unavailable to the Commission\u2019s staff counsel as a practical matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that the Commission (in the role of fact-finder) made no finding that \u201cthe relationship between Bereano and Tra\u00edna created a bias on the part of Tra\u00edna in favor of Bereano.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 944 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Of import here, the <em>Bereano </em>Court said, <em>id. </em>at 744, 944 A.2d 538:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201cWhat is meant by \u2018equal availability\u2019 in this context is not merely that a witness is subject to compulsory process, and thus available in a descriptive sense, but that he is of equal avail to both parties in the sense that he is not presumptively interested in the outcome.\u201d <em>Tyler v. White, </em>811 F.2d 1204, 1207 (8th Cir.1987). This is a difficult showing to make. <em>See Hayes v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 489, 499, 470 A.2d 1301, 1306 (1984) (noting the \u201cstringent requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the witness be peculiarly within the control of the party\u201d). The mere possibility that a witness personally may favor one side over the other does not make that witness peculiarly unavailable to the other side. <em>See Woodland v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 503, 510, 490 A.2d 286, 290 (1985) (\u201cThe inference to be drawn from the failure to call a witness will arise only if the relationship between the defendant and the witness is one of interest or affection.\u201d); <em>United States v. Knox, </em>68 F.3d 990, 1001 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that the potential for bias is not enough to make a witness practically unavailable and noting that \u201c[e]ven government informants are not peculiarly within the government\u2019s control if the defendant can subpoena them as witnesses\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">There is no suggestion in this record, much less a finding by the Commission, that Tra\u00edna was \u201cpresumptively interested in the outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In reaching its conclusion to reverse, the <em>Bereano </em>Court distinguished <em>Robinson, supra, </em>315 Md. 309, 554 A.2d 395, in which the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in giving the instruction. The <em>Bereano </em>Court pointed to several distinctions between <em>Bereano </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>403 Md. at 749, 944 A.2d 538:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">First, unlike in the present case, the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>was given an opportunity to argue or explain the absence of the witness in an effort to forestall the announced intent to rely on the missing witness rule. <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that he lived in a neighborhood where one was subject to bodily harm for identifying a criminal perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, he claimed that Alvin had moved since the defendant had been in contact with him last. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 320, 554 A.2d at 400. In the present case, there was no meaningful discussion of Traina\u2019s absence until the missing witness inference was invoked in the Commission\u2019s written decision. Unlike in the present case, Alvin was not physically available to both parties in <em>Robinson. </em>Until he was on the witness stand and the trial judge signed an order charging him with contempt, the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>refused even to give Alvin\u2019s last name. <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>at 314, 554 A.2d at 397. The prosecution had no opportunity to confirm the existence of Alvin, much less the opportunity to interview him. In the present case, Tra\u00edna voluntarily submitted documents and met with staff counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Based on the record in the case <em>sub judice, </em>as well as the cases discussed above, we agree with appellant that the court abused its discretion when propounded a missing witness instruction. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">First, there was no finding by the trial court that the persons who allegedly witnessed appellant and Ms. M. together at the homes of appellant\u2019s aunt and mother were \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to appellant. As appellant points out, his aunt and his mother were both outside the courtroom during the trial, and therefore the State could have called them just as readily as appellant. And, of import here, despite the fact that the persons in issue are relatives or friends of a party, \u201c[t]he mere possibility that a witness personally may favor one side over the other does not make that witness peculiarly unavailable to the other side.\u201d <em>Bereano, </em>403 Md. at 744, 944 A.2d 538; <em>see Hayes v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 489, 501, 470 A.2d 1301 (1984) (concluding that the witness who was a brother-in-law of the defendant was not \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to the defendant because \u201c[a] witness will not necessarily testify favorably on behalf of his sister\u2019s husband\u201d); <em>Bing Fa Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 111-12, 403 A.2d 819 (1979) (finding witness equally available despite the fact that witness refused to speak with defense counsel and was, at the time of trial, in a federal witness protection program); <em>see also Harkins v. Perini, </em>419 F.2d 468, 471 (6th Cir.1969) (holding that no unfavorable inference should have been permitted against the government where the government offered to submit a police officer for cross-examination at a hearing and the opposing party\u2019s attorney declined); <em>Jenkins v. Bierschenk, </em>333 F.2d 421, 425 (8th Cir.1964) (holding that the defendant\u2019s son was equally available to both parties in the litigation) <em>Repecki v. Home Depot USA </em>942 F.Supp. 126, 129 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (finding that a companion of the plaintiff was equally available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>both parties); <em>D.S. Magazines, Inc. v. Warner Publisher Servs. Inc., </em>640 F.Supp. 1194, 1201 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (holding that the absence of a witness who could have been called by either party in a contract interpretation case did not justify the drawing of an adverse inference); see <em>also In re Williams, </em>190 B.R. 728, 734 (D.R.I.1996) (\u201cThe existence of an attorney-client relationship alone does not imply that the attorneys were clearly favorably disposed to the positions of their past or present clients.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Williams v. Morgan, </em>180 So.2d 11, 14-15 (La.Ct.App.1965) (holding that the plaintiffs broker was equally available to both parties); <em>State of Missouri v. Neil, </em>869 S.W.2d 734, 740 (1994) (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to argue an adverse inference in regard to the defendant\u2019s failure to call his mother with respect to his alibi defense; based on her relationship to the defendant, she was not equally available to the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Second, even if, <em>arguendo, </em>appellant\u2019s mother is regarded as \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to appellant, based solely on her status as appellant\u2019s mother, the sweep of the jury instruction was far broader than just appellant\u2019s mother. In addition to appellant\u2019s mother, the court included \u201ca number of [appellant\u2019s] relatives and friends____\u201d As to the relatives and friends, the status of their relationships, without more, did not reveal that they were peculiarly available to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Third, the court\u2019s missing witness instruction, which was not initially requested by the State, was not balanced or even handed. The court singled out that appellant did not call his mother and other relatives and friends. Yet, Mr. Webb, the victim\u2019s boyfriend and a key witness, had testified that, on the night in question, he called the victim\u2019s aunt in an effort to locate the victim. The court never pointed to the State\u2019s failure to call the victim\u2019s aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Fourth, it was not clear that any of the witnesses necessarily remembered any facts of relevance with respect to events that took place a decade before the trial. We also note that the encounter between the witnesses and Ms. M. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>brief, according to appellant, and some of the witnesses were children at the time. It is entirely plausible that memories had faded about an alleged visit in 1997 by Ms. M., yet the court made neither an inquiry nor a finding in this regard. As the Court said in <em>Christensen, </em>274 Md. at 135 n. 1, 333 A.2d 45, the \u201cbetter practice\u201d would have been for the court to afford appellant, \u201cthe party accused of nonproduetion,\u201d with the opportunity of \u201cdemonstrating to the court by argument or proof the reason for the failure to call.\u201d Appellant argued the point, but no further inquiry was made by the court. <em>See Thomas v. Owens, </em>28 Md.App. 442, 453, 346 A.2d 662 (1975) (\u201c[W]hen it is shown why the witness was not called upon to testify and the reasons for not calling him are reasonable and proper, no inference that his testimony would be unfavorable is permitted.\u201d) (Citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Having concluded that the court abused its discretion, we must consider whether the error is reversible or, instead, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 107-08, 994 A.2d 896 (2010); <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>410 Md. 352, 369, 978 A.2d 717 (2009); <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 698, 971 A.2d 296 (2009); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Disputing the State\u2019s contention that the instruction \u201chad no effect on the verdict under the circumstances of [this] case,\u201d because the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">[G]iven that Mr. Dansbury and Ms. [M.] were the only witnesses to testify about the interaction between them, the jury necessarily had to assess the credibility of the alleged defendant and the alleged victim in this case----The fact that the jury demonstrated its concerns about the credibility of Ms. [M.\u2019s] testimony by acquitting Mr. Dansbury on all theft, robbery, and handgun charges despite Ms. [M.] directly testifying that the Defendant stole it from her (6/10/08 T.181 (\u201cQ: What happened to your money? A: The guy took it. He took it.\u201d)) shows that the jury had doubts about the State\u2019s version of what occurred that night. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>light of the closeness of the case, the missing witness inference undoubtedly had the potential to shape the jury\u2019s evaluation of Defendant\u2019s testimony and sway the direction of the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Appellant also contends that \u201cthe physical evidence was not conclusive for the State.... \u201d He points to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIu\">1) DNA evidence taken from Ms. [M.] on the night in question suggested a possible match with a second unidentified person; 2) Ms. [M.] did not identify Mr. Dansbury as the person who raped her in the photo array shown to her; 3) Mr. Dansbury testified that he knew Ms. [M.], had talked to her on the phone on several occasions, and she came to his house in November 1997 and engaged in consensual sex with him in his bedroom; 4) Ms. [M.] had a boyfriend at the time, and thus would have been reluctant to disclose that she was carrying on a relationship with Mr. Dansbury, a fifteen-year-old boy in 1997; 5) the State provided no corroboration that Ms. [M.] left from her aunt\u2019s house instead of Mr. Dansbury\u2019s house the night she was allegedly raped; and 6) the proximity of Mr. Dansbury\u2019s house to Ms. [M.\u2019s] boyfriend\u2019s house enabled Ms. [M.] to walk the 1.5 miles between those locations on the night in question. Thus, the evidence supporting the Defendant was significant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332-33, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008), the Court reiterated the scope of harmless error review:</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638 [350 A.2d 665] (1976), [276 Md. 638] 350 A.2d 665 (1976), we adopted the test for harmless error announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Chapman v. State, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 [87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705] (1967). As adopted in <em>Dorsey, </em>the harmless error rule is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac4\">When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">In performing a harmless error analysis, we are not to find facts or weigh evidence. Instead, \u201cwhat evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u201d <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-61 (1990). \u201c \u2018Once it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 175, 872 A.2d 25, 43 (2005) (Bell, C.J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 716-17, 759 A.2d 764, 799 (2000)) (Bell, C.J., dissenting). \u201c \u2018To say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is, rather, to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed by the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 894 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Yates v. Evatt, </em>500 U.S. 391, 403, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 1893, 114 L.Ed.2d 432 (1991)). The \u201charmless error rule ... has been and should be carefully circumscribed.\u201d <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">To be sure, \u201c[h]armless error review is the standard of review most favorable to the defendant short of an automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Bellamy, </em>403 Md. at 333, 941 A.2d 1107. But, we are mindful that Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have upheld criminal convictions, notwithstanding error committed by the trial court, when the evidence of guilt was so \u201coverwhelming\u201d as to render the court\u2019s error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 578, 602 A.2d 677 (1992); <em>Burral v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 288, 298, 702 A.2d 781 (1997), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 707, 724 A.2d 65 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 832, 120 S.Ct. 89, 145 L.Ed.2d 75 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>Hayes, supra, </em>57 Md.App. 489, 470 A.2d 1301, provides guidance. In that case, Ted Hickman and Jay Connelly burglarized Lucia Midkiffs home. <em>Id. </em>at 491-92, 470 A.2d 1301. About a month later, Midkiff identified some of those items at an antique shop that the defendant owned. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 470 A.2d 1301. The defendant was then arrested. <em>Id. </em>At trial, Hickman testified that \u201cthe proceeds of the burglary were put in a trash can and moved to Paul Bentley\u2019s garage, from which location, Bentley was going to sell the merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Bentley, Hayes went to Bentley\u2019s garage and purchased the stolen items. <em>Id. </em>Bentley told the jury: \u201c \u2018In respect to Mrs. Midkiffs burglary, [Hayes] said ... as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s yours. I don\u2019t know where it comes from. I really don\u2019t care....\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Hayes testified in his own defense. He claimed that he was driven to Bentley\u2019s residence by Joseph Giordano, his brother-in-law, and \u201chad no reason to believe they were stolen property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, Hayes did not call Giordano to the witness stand. <em>Id. </em>Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court gave a missing witness instruction, although the State had not requested one. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 470 A.2d 1301. Thereafter, the jury convicted Hayes of theft. <em>Id. </em>at 491, 470 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">On appeal, this Court, through Judge Bell, found that the trial court erred in giving the missing witness instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 501, 470 A.2d 1301. The Court held, in part, that Giordano was not peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s control. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 470 A.2d 1301. And, of import here, the Court rejected any claim that the court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 470 A.2d 1301. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 501-02, 470 A.2d 1301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAd\">First, in this case, the main issue before the jury was who to believe \u2014 the State\u2019s witnesses, including Bentley, who claimed Hayes knew the property had been stolen, or Hayes, who testified that he had no reason to suspect that the property had been stolen, and that he believed he was engaging in a legitimate business transaction. As this Court noted in <em>Christensen [v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 428, 437, 320 A.2d 276 (1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>274 Md. 133, 333 A.2d 45 (1975) ]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>In a case determined by little more than which of two persons is to be believed possible inferences, whether naturally or legally raised, become crucial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">Since Giordano\u2019s testimony could well have reinforced the credibility of Hayes, the \u201chighlighting\u201d by the court of the inference that Giordano would testify unfavorably was crucial and prejudicial. Secondly, the giving of the instruction by the court in and of itself unfairly emphasizes the fact that Hayes did not call a particular witness. A reasonable person, upon hearing the instruction, would most likely give credence to it and infer that the missing witness\u2019 testimony would be unfavorable. Thirdly, since the instruction was couched in very general terms and no factual predicate was laid upon which the jury could intelligently decide whether to apply the rule, the instruction could have tended to mislead the jury. In light of the above, we cannot find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In this case, Dansbury put his credibility in issue when he testified in his own behalf and offered his version of what transpired. As indicated, he claimed that he and Ms. M. first went to his aunt\u2019s house, and then engaged in consensual sex at his mother\u2019s house. He also recounted that an argument unfolded when his mother found Ms. M. in bed with appellant. The court\u2019s missing witness instruction expressly highlighted that appellant did not call his mother and other relatives and friends. Although the State\u2019s evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was quite strong, it was not so overwhelming as to convince us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the missing witness instruction did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As in <em>Hayes, </em>a reasonable juror may have inferred that Dansbury decided not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>to call witnesses to the events because their testimony would be unfavorable. In turn, this might have led a reasonable juror to discredit appellant\u2019s entire account.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In sum, in the context of this case, in which Mr. Dansbury and Ms. M. were the only witnesses to the contact between them, and appellant\u2019s credibility was central to his defense, we cannot say that the missing witness instruction had no effect on the jury\u2019s evaluation of appellant\u2019s credibility, on which his defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL. COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-13\">. Appellant was acquitted of first degree rape; sexual offense in the first degree; two counts of sexual offense in the third degree; four counts of first degree assault; one count of second degree assault; use of a handgun in the commission of a felony; wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun; robbery with a dangerous weapon; robbery; theft under $300; and wearing and carrying openly a dangerous and deadly weapon. For sentencing, the court merged the convictions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>sexual offense in the fourth degree into the second degree rape conviction and combined all second degree assault convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">. At sentencing on July 30, 2008, the trial judge merged two of the three second degree assault convictions and the fourth degree sexual offense conviction with the second degree rape conviction. The trial judge sentenced appellant to twenty years imprisonment for second degree rape; a concurrent sentence of twenty years for the second degree sexual offense; and a consecutive term of ten years for second degree assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">.

Ms. M. was not able to recall the detective's name, but indicated that it was a male.

For example, in addition to appellant\u2019s testimony, DNA evidence taken from Ms. M. contained a minor allele, suggesting a possible match with a second unidentified person; the State did not clearly explain the significance or insignificance of a minor allele; and Ms. M. did not initially identify Mr. Dansbury as the person who raped her in the photo array shown to her in 2007. And, as appellant notes, the jury did not accept all of Ms. M.'s testimony, as it acquitted him of the handgun and theft related charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
