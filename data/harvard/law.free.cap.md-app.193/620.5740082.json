HACKNER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0y\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">On March 20, 2009, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied Appellant Robert B.\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petition for expungement of a criminal charge on the ground that he was not qualified for an expungement under Md.Code (2001, 2008 RepLVbl., 2009 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 10-105(e)(4) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d). Appellant challenges that order, and presents a single question for review. As we have restated it, the question before this Court is whether the circuit court committed error in denying Robert B.\u2019s expungement because he was a \u201cdefendant in a pending criminal proceeding,\u201d as contemplated by CP \u00a7 10-105(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the circuit court committed legal error and we will reverse and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Appellant was charged with possession with intent to distribute and simple possession of a controlled dangerous substance in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City on June 7, 2008. On August 7, 2008, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the possession with intent to distribute charge, leaving only the simple possession count for trial. On Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ber 9, 2008, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City after appellant requested a jury trial. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered on the remaining possession charge on October 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Appellant filed a petition for expungement of both charges in accordance with CP \u00a7 10-105(a) on February 6, 2009. The petition was accompanied by a general waiver of any liability claim against the Baltimore City Police Department. At the time he filed the petition, appellant was on probation for a prior armed robbery conviction that resulted from a guilty plea on July 25, 2007, in the Circuit Court for Howard County. Due to appellant\u2019s probationary status, the State objected to the petition for expungement, contending that appellant \u201chas been charged with a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The circuit court denied the petition for expungement, concluding that appellant was \u201ca defendant in a pending criminal proceeding\u201d because of his probationary status, and that he was therefore ineligible to obtain an expungement under CP \u00a7 10 \u2014 105(e) (4) (ii) (2). Appellant subsequently noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Subtitle 1 of Criminal Procedure Article Title 10 deals with expungements in Maryland. First enacted in 1975, this subtitle sets forth the petition process and eligibility requirements to obtain an expungement. A criminal charge concluded by the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is generally subject to expungement under the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u00a7 10-105. Expungement of record after charge is filed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">(a) A person who has been charged with the commission of a crime[] may file a petition listing relevant facts for expungement of a police record, court record, or other record maintained by the State or a political subdivision of the State if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(4) a nolle prosequi or nolle prosequi with the requirement of drug or alcohol treatment is entered[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">However, that section limits the right to expungement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(e)(4) The person is not entitled to expungement if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">(i) the petition is based on the entry of probation before judgment, a nolle prosequi, a stet, including a nolle prosequi with the requirement of drug or alcohol abuse treatment, a conviction for a crime specified in subsection (a)(9) of this section, or the grant of a pardon by the Governor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">(ii) the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">1. since the full and unconditional pardon, entry, or conviction has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\n<em>2. is a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANB\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Thus, the statute precludes expungement under two circumstances. First, a person is ineligible under subsection (e)(4)(ii)(l) if he \u201chas been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation\u201d since the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, a person is ineligible under subsection (e)(4)(ii)(2) if he is \u201ca defendant in a pending criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">The issue before this Court is whether the fact that appellant was on probation makes him \u201ca defendant in a pending criminal proceeding\u201d as contemplated by CP \u00a7 10-105(e) (4)(ii)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The issue presented is purely a question of law. Therefore, this Court must determine whether the result reached by the trial court was legally correct without giving deference to the legal conclusion of the trial court. <em>White, et al. v.

Principles of Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 661, 911 A.2d 1245 (2006) (quoting <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 571, 911 A.2d 427 (2006)). The Court of Appeals has stated that, \u201c[t]o determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Maryland-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690 (1997); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 636 A.2d 448 (1994). \u201c \u2018Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443, 903 A.2d 388 (2006) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 801 A.2d 160 (2002)). <em>See also Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886 (2004). \u201cWhen the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 697 A.2d 455 (1997). \u201cIf the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 661, 911 A.2d 1245. <em>See also Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 571, 911 A.2d 427 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994)). Additionally, \u201c[w]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engaged in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 776 A.2d 645 (2001). <em>See also Chow, </em>393 Md. at 443, 903 A.2d 388. \u201c \u2018If there is no ambiguity in th[e] language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends....\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 662, 911 A.2d 1245 (quoting <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 443-44, 903 A.2d 388).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\u201cIf the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then \u2018courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of [the] enactment [under consideration].\u2019\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 662, 911 A.2d 1245 (quoting <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 174, 680 A.2d 1052, (1996) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986))). The Court of Appeals has explained that there is ambiguity in a statute \u201cwhen there exist \u2018two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 662, 911 A.2d 1245 (quoting <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 444, 903 A.2d 388).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In construing a statute, \u201c[w]e avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 224, 909 A.2d 1020 (2006) (citing <em>Gwin v. MVA, </em>385 Md. 440, 462, 869 A.2d 822 (2005)); <em>see also Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994). Additionally, \u201cthe meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996). Because the language is a part of the context in which it is found, \u201crelated statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered.\u201d <em>Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar On Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 138, 702 A.2d 753 (1997) (citing <em>Popham v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, </em>333 Md. 136, 148, 634 A.2d 28 (1993)). \u201cThus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\n<em>B. Probation is not a \u201cpending \u201d criminal proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The expungement provisions of Subtitle 1 of Title 10 of the Criminal Procedure Article do not define the term \u201cpending\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 10-105(e)(4)(ii)(2). Nevertheless, there is no reason to think, nor do the parties suggest, that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cpending\u201d is ambiguous on its face. When interpreting an unambiguous statutory term, that term is defined by its common understanding. <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 443, 903 A.2d 388; <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 661, 911 A.2d 1245. The Court of Appeals has said that, \u201c[w]hen the term in a statute is a legal term, absent any legislative intent to the contrary, the term is presumed to be used in its legal sense.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Wildwood Medical Center, L.L.C., </em>176 Md.App. 731, 741, 934 A.2d 484 (2007) (citing <em>Dean v. Finder, </em>312 Md. 154, 161, 538 A.2d 1184 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We believe the term \u201cpending,\u201d as it is commonly understood and used in its basic legal sense, means the period of time beginning with the inception of an action and ending at the entry of a final judgment. For instance, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the term \u201cpending\u201d to mean \u201c[rjemaining undecided; awaiting decision &lt;a pending case&gt;.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1169 (8th ed. 2004). As will be explained below, this definition is supported by case law, which establishes that every criminal action begins when charges are initiated and ends when a judgment is entered. In the context of a criminal case, the judgment consists of the sentence imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">A criminal case begins upon a \u201cformal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u201d <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 474 A.2d 1305 (1984) (citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 167, 171-72, 300 A.2d 430 (1973); <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 749 (1973)). \u201cThe initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>17 Md. App. at 171, 300 A.2d 430 (1973) (quoting <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411, (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A criminal proceeding is completed when a \u201csentence is imposed on a verdict of guilty. That is when judgment is entered.\u201d <em>Chmurny v. State, </em>392 Md. 159, 896 A.2d 354 (2006). <em>See also Tweedy v. State, </em>380 Md. 475, 845 A.2d 1215 (2004); <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 433, 701 A.2d 419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>(1997); <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995); <em>Myers v. State, </em>303 Md. 639, 645, 496 A.2d 312 (1985). For purposes of appeal, judgment in a criminal case is final and appealable once a guilty verdict has been returned and a sentence imposed. A guilty verdict alone may not be appealed. <em>Jones v. State, </em>298 Md. 634, 637, 471 A.2d 1055 (1984). \u201cUntil sentence, and with it a judgment, is entered, the presumption of innocence continues to exist; it is the judgment that rebuts and erases that presumption.\u201d <em>Chmurny, </em>392 Md. at 168, 896 A.2d 354. <em>See also McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin Dist. 1, </em>486 U.S. 429, 436, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988) (\u201cAfter a judgment of conviction has been entered, however, the defendant is no longer protected by the presumption of innocence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Giving the expression its \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning,\u201d we conclude that a criminal proceeding is \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of CP \u00a7 10 \u2014 105(e)(4)(ii)(2) beginning with the formal charges, and ending upon entry of a judgment in the form of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">1. Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In <em>Blythe v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 492, 561, 870 A.2d 1246 (2005), this Court held that a defendant still serving a sentence was not a defendant in a \u201cpending criminal proceeding in the context of the Maryland Public Information Act (MPIA).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, Blythe made an MPIA request to obtain records from the State Attorney\u2019s Office relating to his murder convictions in 1997. Blythe was still serving his sentence when the request was made. The State\u2019s Attorney denied Blythe\u2019s MPIA request on the ground that because his sentence was not complete, he was a defendant in a \u201cpending criminal case\u201d and that \u201cdisclosure would interfere with a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and proper law enforcement proceeding.\u201d This Court rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">If the County were correct that the mere possibility that a post-conviction petition might be filed compelled the conclusion that the criminal case was still pending, no criminal case would ever be final and the reasoning of the <em>Faulk </em>opinions would have been pointless. As long as a convicted defendant is still serving a sentence or is on parole or probation, the possibility of filing a post-conviction petition or a writ of federal habeas corpus or a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is always present. <em>Faulk\u2019s </em>language about there being no harm in temporarily deferring the disclosure \u201cuntil the termination of a criminal proceeding\u201d would be meaningless. The deferral would be a permanent denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 561, 870 A.2d 1246.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995), the Court of Appeals considered whether the defendant had been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a predicate offense so as to subject him to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>enhanced sentence under former Article 27, Section 286(c)(1) which was part of the Controlled Substances Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time the subsequent offense was tried, a petition for writ of certiorari with respect to the prior conviction was still pending in the Court of Appeals. Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that Whack\u2019s conviction for the predicate offense qualified him for an enhanced sentence. The Court of Appeals agreed and defined the term \u201cconvicted\u201d in its \u201clegal and technical sense, to mean following judgment or sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whack had argued that he should not have been deemed \u201cconvicted\u201d until all avenues of appellate review were exhausted. The Court rejected that argument, holding that once a judgment has been entered, it remains conclusive and final until set aside on appeal. \u201cConvictions are a verity until set aside, and the use of prior convictions pending on appeal for punishment enhancement in another case is permissible.\u201d <em>Id., </em>338 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>675, 659 A.2d 1347 (citing <em>State v. Swartz, </em>140 Ariz. 516, 683 P.2d 315, 318 (1984)). The possibility that the judgment, or any portion of it, may be set aside in a pending appeal does not affect the finality of the judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Since a criminal judgment is conclusive despite the possibility of being set aside on appeal, it stands to reason that Appellant\u2019s conviction is conclusive even though his probation may later be revoked. An appeal from a criminal conviction addresses the merits of the underlying judgment and can result in the judgment being overturned. By contrast, a violation of probation arises independently from the underlying case. It does not alter the original judgment, even though the court can order execution of a previously suspended jail term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">One cannot reconcile a statutory interpretation that a criminal proceeding remains \u201cpending\u201d during probation, but that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>is not \u201cpending\u201d during appeal. We may not interpret a statute in a manner that would be \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with common sense,\u201d a construction of the statute we must avoid. <em>Blake, </em>395 Md. at 224, 909 A.2d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">2. Statutory Context and Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">A reading of the expungement statute as a whole supports the conclusion that a criminal proceeding is not \u201cpending\u201d under CP \u00a7 10-105(e)(4)(ii)(2) merely because a defendant is on probation in that proceeding when he applies for expungement of a record of another proceeding that was <em>nol prossed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">CP \u00a7 10-105(c) describes the time requirements for filing a petition for expungement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Certain provisions of this section specifically mention completion of probation as a condition precedent to obtaining an expungement. For instance, subsection (c)(6) reads: \u201c[A] petition for expungement based on the conviction of a crime under subsection (a)(9)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of this section may not be filed within 3 years after the conviction <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>satisfactory completion of the sentence, including probation, </em>that was imposed for the conviction, whichever is later (emphasis added).\u201d This language expresses the legislature\u2019s intention that for the enumerated offenses, the waiting period for expungement extends beyond conviction and the entry of a judgment. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d in (c)(6), indicates that a \u201cconviction\u201d means something different than the \u201ccompletion of the sentence, including probation.\u201d Otherwise, this language would be surplusage. \u201cA plain reading of the statute assumes none of its language is superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356 (2008) (citing <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 646, 943 A.2d 1260 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Subsection (c)(2)(i) states that a petition for expungement based on a probation before judgment may not be filed before \u201cthe date the petitioner was discharged from probation.\u201d If the legislature had intended for subsection (e)(4)(ii)(2) to preclude an expungement while a defendant was on probation, there would be no need for that language in (c)(2)(i). We must presume that the legislature did not intend for these two sections to be redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">By contrast, subsection (c)(1), which provides for expungement based on an acquittal, <em>nolle prosequi, </em>or dismissal, begins the time line from \u201cthe disposition.\u201d The only time constraints for expungements under these circumstances are the expiration of the tort limitations period or the filing of a written general release of tort claims by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>C. Probation is not a \u201ccriminal proceeding </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">It is well established in Maryland that a revocation of probation hearing is a civil proceeding. <em>Chase v. State, </em>309 Md. 224, 522 A.2d 1348 (1987). Both Maryland and Supreme Court cases have made it \u201cluminously clear [ ] that a revocation of probation proceeding is not a stage in a criminal prosecution. It is firmly established as a civil aetion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Howlett, v. State, </em>295 Md. 419, 456 A.2d 375 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Many of the constitutional rights inherent in criminal proceedings are not available in revocation of probation proceedings. For instance, a defendant is not entitled to a trial by jury at a probation hearing. <em>Chase, </em>309 Md. at 239, 522 A.2d 1348 (citing <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984)). Nor is a defendant protected against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The right to confront witnesses is not absolute <em>(Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972); <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <em>State v. Fuller, </em>308 Md. 547, 552, 520 A.2d 1315 (1987); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 238, 246, 846 A.2d 477 (2004)) and the rules of evidence do not strictly apply. <em>Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. 198, 202, 434 A.2d 552 (1981). The exclusionary rule for evidence illegally seized under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments does not ordinarily apply at a revocation of probation hearing. <em>Chase, </em>309 Md. at 252, 522 A.2d 1348 (1987). At the conclusion of the probation revocation hearing, the judge must be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that a violation occurred; proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not required. <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 272, 208 A.2d 575 (1965). The \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d standard is equivalent to the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Wink v. State, </em>317 Md. 330, 332, 563 A.2d 414 (1989); <em>see also McDonald v. State, </em>314 Md. 271, 280, 550 A.2d 696 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Since a violation of probation hearing is considered a civil matter, it would make little sense to view the probationary period that precedes it as a pending criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The State points out that the statute frequently uses the expression \u201ccriminal charge\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It argues that the legislature intended \u201ccriminal charge\u201d to have a different meaning than \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d and that the latter expression has a broader meaning than the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>If the language of a statute is unambiguous and expresses a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as written. <em>Stoddard, 395 </em>Md. at 661, 911 A.2d 1245. As it is well established that a violation of probation hearing is a civil proceeding, we cannot conclude that the legislature meant for a period of probation to be a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d absent clear statutory language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">\n<em>D. Purpose of the Expungement Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The general purpose of the Criminal Record Ex-pungement Statute, CP \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq., </em>is to \u201cprovid[e'j for the expungement of certain police and court records, providing procedures for such expungement, prohibiting certain practices concerning criminal charges not resulting in conviction, and relating generally to criminal records.\u201d 1975 Md. Laws, Chap. 260. The statute aims to prevent a person from unfairly suffering the social and professional stigma of a criminal charge that did not result in a conviction. \u201cOne of the General Assembly\u2019s purposes in providing for an expungement procedure was to help protect individuals seeking employment or admission to an educational institution, by entitling them to expungement of unproven charges, so that those individuals could avoid being unfairly judged during their application process.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Stoddard, </em>395 Md. at 664, 911 A.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>CP \u00a7 10-109 contains the enforcement provisions of the expungement statute and establishes criminal sanctions for its violation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These provisions reflect a value judgment that it is unjust to subject someone to the social consequences of a criminal charge without a finding of guilt. To read the statute in the manner urged by the State would frustrate the purpose of the expungement statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The State argues that the General Assembly did not intend a defendant to be eligible to obtain an expungement for a <em>nol prossed </em>charge \u201cif the person is engaged in criminal wrongdoing after the entry of the <em>nolle </em>prosequi\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>statute makes clear that a person is not eligible to obtain an expungement if he has been convicted of a crime in the interim between entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>and petition for expungement. CP \u00a7 10-105(e)(4)(ii)(l). The language of CP \u00a7 10-105(e)(4)(ii)(2) precluding an expungement if there is a pending criminal proceeding must be read in the context of the immediately preceding section, to prevent a defendant from obtaining an expungement order after being charged with a new offense, but before the new charge is concluded. We do not believe that being on probation qualifies as an inchoate state of wrongdoing that precludes the expungement of a subsequent charge that is <em>no'l prossed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We hold that appellant\u2019s prior criminal proceeding was concluded when he was sentenced on July 25, 2007, to a suspended prison term and probation. That event constituted the final judgment in the case, despite the possibility that appellant\u2019s probation might subsequently be revoked upon a violation. Therefore, there was no criminal proceeding pending as contemplated by CP \u00a7 10 \u2014 105(e) (4) (ii) (2) at the time the petition for expungement was filed. Appellant was otherwise eligible to obtain an expungement of the subsequent charges. Accordingly, the trial court committed error by denying the petition for expungement. We shall reverse the order of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\">.

Indeed, the purpose of [SG \u00a7 10-618(f)] was to permit nondisclosure of investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes only when there was a need for confidentiality because of a contemplated or pending law-enforcement proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 508, 474 A.2d 880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">.
