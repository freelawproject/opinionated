RODOWSKY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-117 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201c\u00a7 5-117. Actions arising from alleged sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">\u201c(a) <em>\u2018Sexual abuse\u2019 defined. </em>\u2014 In this section, \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 has the meaning stated in \u00a7 5-701 of the Family Law Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201c(b) <em>Limitations period. </em>\u2014 An action for damages arising out of an alleged incident or incidents of sexual abuse that occurred while the victim was a minor shall be filed within 7 years of the date that the victim attains the age of majority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">Section 5-117 (the Act) was enacted by Chapter 360 of the Acts of 2003, effective October 1, 2003. Uncodified SECTION 2 of Chapter 360 provides that \u201cthis Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">In the case before us, the appellant, Mary Roe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Plaintiff), contends that her action for damages for sexual abuse was timely filed under the Act. The appellee, James Doe (Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>dant), contends that the Act does not apply and that the claim is time barred under the three-year statute of limitations provided by CJ \u00a7 5-201.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Plaintiff was born on September 29, 1983, and reached her majority on September 29, 2001. See Article 1, \u00a7 24, Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.). She filed this suit on September 3, 2008, in the Circuit Court for Calvert County. She alleged facts sufficient to constitute sexual abuse, that that abuse had occurred while she was a minor, and that Defendant was the abuser. The complaint presented five counts, respectively labeled \u201cAssault,\u201d \u201cBattery,\u201d \u201cFalse Imprisonment,\u201d \u201cIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,\u201d and \u201cNegligence.\u201d We are concerned here with limitations only as to Counts II through V, because Plaintiff acknowledges that the one-year statute of limitations for \u201cassault\u201d under CJ \u00a7 5-105 had run before the Act became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Defendant moved to dismiss, contending that the three-year statute of limitations had run on September 30, 2004, and that \u00a7 5-117 could not apply because such an application would be retroactive, in violation of the legislative intent expressed in uncodified SECTION 2 of Chapter 360. Further, Defendant submitted, if the General Assembly intended a retroactive application, it would unconstitutionally deprive Defendant of the vested right that he had acquired when the three-year statute of limitations ran on September 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss. The judge reasoned that \u00a7 5-117 was purely prospective, so that it \u201cdoes not apply to <em>any </em>actions that accrued before October 1, 2003.\u201d Alternatively, the circuit court held that, were \u00a7 5-117 to be applied retrospectively, \u201cDefendant\u2019s due process rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>would be infringed, because he has a vested right to be free from a suit where the statute of limitations has run.\u201d The judge quoted <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 633, 805 A.2d 1061, 1078 (2002), where the Court said: \u201cThis Court has consistently held that the Maryland Constitution ordinarily precludes the Legislature ... (2) from retroactively creating a cause of action, or reviving a barred cause of action, thereby violating the vested right of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Plaintiff timely appealed. She presents two questions which we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall reframe Plaintiffs questions presented to conform to the issues discerned by the circuit court, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">1. Did the General Assembly intend \u00a7 5-117 to apply to the state of facts presented in the instant matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">2. If so, is that application constitutional?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">To assist the reader, we set forth the relevant dates in chronological order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">September 29, 2001 Plaintiff reaches majority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">October 1, 2003 Seven-year statute of limitations enacted, measured from majority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">September 30, 2004 Three-year statute of limitations, if applicable, runs on Counts II through V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>September 3, 2008 Suit filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">September 30, 2008 Limitations under \u00a7 5-117, if applicable, would run.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">If one were to consider only the codified portion of Chapter 360, and the effective date of October 1, 2003, there are, theoretically, at least three possible constructions as to the Act\u2019s application to causes of action that accrued prior to October 1, 2003. First, there is the null alternative, <em>ie., </em>that the Act has no application. This is the purely prospective construction for which Defendant contends. Second, there is the fully retroactive construction under which a cause of action that was barred as of October 1, 2003, by the three-year (or one-year) limitations period, is revived, if it is filed within seven years after the minor victim reaches majority. Plaintiff does not contend that the Act revives claims that were time barred as of October 1, 2003. Third, there is a partial retroactive construction under which the time for suit on a cause of action, that accrued prior to October 1, 2003, and that, as of that date, has not been barred by the three (or one) year period of limitations after reaching majority, is extended to seven years after the victim\u2019s reaching majority. This is the construction for which Plaintiff contends, but she bases it, not on the codified portion of Chapter 360, but on the uncodified statement of legislative intent in SECTION 2 of Chapter 360.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively and are to be constructed accordingly. The presumption against retrospectivity is rebutted only where there are clear expressions in the statute to the contrary. Moreover, even where permissible, retrospective application is not found except upon the plainest mandate in the legislation. The rationale underlying the general rule provides that retrospective application, which attempts to determine the legal significance of acts that occurred prior to the statute\u2019s effective date, increases the potential for interference with persons\u2019 substantive rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Riverdale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 560-61, 520 A.2d 1319, 1321-22 (1987) (citations omitted). That case dealt with Chapter 546 of the Acts of 1983 that created an immunity from tort. The effective date clause stated simply that it was effective July 1, 1983. The Court held that the defense did not apply to a tort committed prior to the statute\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In determining whether Chapter 360 was intended by the General Assembly to have any retroactive effect, we turn to the well established rules governing statutory interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cTo ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\"><em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274-75, 987 A.2d 18, 28-29 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Chapter 360, introduced as Senate Bill 68, contained three sections. SECTION 1 enacted CJ \u00a7 5-117. SECTION 2, an amendment added in the course of passage, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">\u201cAND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>SECTION 3 provides: \u201cAND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect October 1, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">SECTION 2 manifests the legislative intent that Chapter 360 have some retroactive application. If Chapter 360 were intended to apply purely prospectively, then it would have sufficed to enact only SECTION 3. In that way, the ordinary rule would apply under which legislation is presumed to operate only prospectively. But, here, it cannot be concluded that Chapter 360 operates only prospectively because, to do so, would render SECTION 2 surplusage, in its entirety. That reading violates a cardinal rule of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">SECTION 2, by its plain language, prohibits a construction of CJ \u00a7 5-117 that would effect a fully retroactive application that revived causes of action that were barred, prior to the enactment of Chapter 360, under the previously applicable law of limitations. Once again, if the Legislature intended, in addition, that CJ \u00a7 5-117 also bar causes of action on which limitations had not run, as of October 1, 2003, under the prior limitations law, then the Legislature did not say so. Further, if that were the legislative intent, it could have been accomplished simply by enacting SECTION 3 and omitting SECTION 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Defendant\u2019s position seems to be that the prior limitations law continues to govern claims that arose prior to October 1, 2003, and that CJ \u00a7 5-117 governs only claims that arose on or after October 1, 2003. But, that is not what SECTION 2 says. Defendant\u2019s reading would have SECTION 2 state, \u201cThat this Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred <em>or becomes barred </em>by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d Adding words to a statute to affect the meaning manifested by the statute\u2019s plain language is unsound statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Accordingly, it would seem that Plaintiff\u2019s construction is correct. SECTION 2 effects an extension of time, from three years to seven years after majority, for the filing of claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sexual abuse against a minor that were not barred prior to October 1, 2003, by the then applicable limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<em>Legislative History of Chapter S60</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Defendant, citing <em>Robey v. State, </em>397 Md. 449, 454, 918 A.2d 499, 502 (2007), points out that it is appropriate to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent as a check on one\u2019s reading of the plain language of the statute. The legislative history of Chapter 360 includes an opinion of an Assistant Attorney General in the office of Counsel to the General Assembly. In our view, Chapter 360\u2019s history, and the opinion of the Assistant Attorney General, support Plaintiffs position.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">When introduced as Senate Bill 68, Chapter 360 included two features that did not survive to final passage. The Bill would have made the statute of limitations twelve years following the later of the victim\u2019s twenty-first birthday or the victim\u2019s discovery that the alleged abuse was actionable. It also provided that what became CJ \u00a7 5-117 \u201cshall apply to any action commenced on or after October 1, 2003, including any action that would have been barred by the application of the period of limitation applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d In other words, Senate Bill 68, as introduced, was of the type of retroactivity we have above described as \u201cfully\u201d retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The Chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee requested an opinion on three questions. First, \u201cwhether the application of the bill to apply retroactively to cases that were barred prior to the effective date of the law would violate due process.\u201d Second, \u201cwhether the bill could constitutionally be amended to allow a one year window in which plaintiffs could bring suits that have already been barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d Third, \u201cwhat the effect would be if the bill is passed without any provision as to whether it is to be given retroactive or prospective effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">On the first question, the Assistant Attorney General concluded that \u201cit is clear that Senate Bill 68 could retroactively revive barred causes of action without violation of the United States Constitution.\u201d As to state law, counsel advised that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>there was no direct Maryland authority and that there was a difference of opinion in our sister states, with some states finding \u201ca vested right in a statute of limitations defense <em>once the limitations period has run.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The advice on the first and second questions concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cno reported case in Maryland ... would mandate the unconstitutionality of retroactive application of Senate Bill 68. However, it is possible, given the actions of other states, and its own statement in <em>Dua, </em>that the Court could conclude that retroactive application to revive barred causes of action violates Due Process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">(Footnote omitted). The opinion quoted that portion of <em>Dua </em>where the Court said that it had consistently held that the Maryland Constitution ordinarily precludes the Legislature \u201cfrom retroactively ... reviving a barred cause of action[.]\u201d 370 Md. at 633, 805 A.2d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Unremarkably, with respect to the third inquiry, counsel\u2019s advice was that, if the bill were silent on its application to existing causes of action, the bill\u2019s discovery provision would most likely apply only to causes of action arising after the effective date of the bill.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Defendant relies on the concluding sentence of the opinion: \u201cIt is also my view that in the absence of a specific provision, the statute could be interpreted to have prospective effect, and that most likely would mean that it would apply only to causes of action based on abuse occurring after the effective date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The key words in this sentence are \u201cin the absence of a specific provision,\u201d a hypothetical that the Assistant Attorney General was asked to assume in the third question presented. Here, of course, Senate Bill 68, as enacted, is not silent on its applicability to existing causes of action. It contains SECTION 2, expressly providing for partial retroactivity. Thus, the response of the Committee, and of the Legislature, in enacting Chapter 360 was to strike from the bill the fully retroactive provision and to make the bill apply to actions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>had not been barred, prior to its effective date, by the limitations provisions previously applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Failed Subsequent Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Defendant has collected the bills from legislative sessions after 2003 that were designed to amend CJ \u00a7 5-117, but failed of enactment. These bills, and the legislative session in which they were introduced, are H.B. 1376 (2005), H.B. 1147 (2006), H.B. 1148 (2006), S.B. 575 (2007), H.B. 858 (2008), S.B. 238 (2009), and H.B. 556 (2009). The relevant portions thereof are set forth in the Appendix to this opinion. Although these are not failed amendments that were offered to Senate Bill 68 in the 2003 session, we shall review them to see if they alter our construction of the plain language of Chapter 360, as enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Six of the bills, <em>i.e., </em>all except H.B. 1148 (2006), seem intended to achieve full retroactivity, that is, to revive claims barred by limitations prior to the proposed effective date of the legislation, and they couple that revival with a window of time within which the revived action must be brought. H.B. 1376 (2005) and H.B. 1147 (2006) expressly stated that they \u201cshall be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action\u201d barred before their effective dates. Further, H.B. 1376 (2005) would have enlarged limitations to twenty-eight years after majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">S.B. 575 (2007) and H.B. 858 (2008) would have permitted suit, filed within a window of time, by any plaintiff, regardless of age, whose attorney certified to the merits of the claim. H.B. 858, in addition, would have enlarged limitations to thirty-two years after majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">S.B. 238 (2009) and H.B. 556 (2009) were companion bills that would have revived causes of action that were barred prior to their effective dates under the seven years from majority statute of limitations. Both bills would have enlarged limitations to thirty-two years. These two bills seem to have been intended to protect claimants who missed the boat under the 2003 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>H.B. 1148 (2006) attracted the largest number of sponsors. It would have enlarged the period of limitations to twenty-four years from majority. SECTION 2 of the bill provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cThat this Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2006.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">If enacted, H.B. 1148 (2006) would have presented the same statutory interpretation question that we have answered above, except that, whether an action was barred would be measured by the seven-year statute and not the three-year statute that antedated the 2003 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">These failed amendments, by their attempts to revive actions barred before their effective dates and to enlarge the period of limitations, reflect that some legislators disagreed with the policy of the 2003 legislation that did not revive actions barred prior to its effective date but simply enlarged the period of limitations for claims that were viable on its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We conclude that, in enacting CJ \u00a7 5-117, the General Assembly intended that it be applied partially retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Defendant further argues that, even if the General Assembly intended that Chapter 360 apply to causes of action that had arisen prior to its effective date, but on which limitations had not yet run, Plaintiffs claim is nevertheless subject to dismissal because that partial retrospective application deprives Defendant of a substantial right. In support of this position, Defendant refers us to cases in which the Legislature extended a period of time that was a condition precedent to the cause of action. Defendant\u2019s argument fails to recognize the well established distinction between a time limit that is a condition precedent to the cause of action and an ordinary statute of limitations, such as CJ \u00a7 5-117. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Defendant emphasizes <em>Blocher v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571, 303 A.2d 395 (1973), <em>overruled on other grounds by Eastgate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Assocs. <em>v. Apper, </em>276 Md. 698, 350 A.2d 661 (1976). <em>Blocher </em>involved an amendment to the statute fixing the time within which a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate was to be filed. The amendment, effective June 1,1966, enlarged the deadline from six months after the personal representative qualified to three years from accrual of the cause of action, if it arose out of a motor tort and the decedent carried automobile insurance. In <em>Blocher, </em>the accident occurred April 15,1966, and the personal representative qualified September 9, 1966, but suit against the decedent\u2019s interest was not filed until February 14, 1969.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the claim would be timely if the new statute applied fully retroactively, but it would be barred if the new statute was partially retroactive or fully prospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The Court, dismissing the appeal in <em>Blocher </em>for want of a final judgment, expressed considered <em>dicta. </em>It said that the circuit court correctly dismissed the action on the authority of <em>Dixon v. Checchia, </em>249 Md. 20, 238 A.2d 247 (1968), a case involving the same statute as <em>Blocher </em>and presenting the same fact pattern. Both <em>Blocher </em>and <em>Dixon </em>rest on Chief Judge Hammond\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Chandlee v. Shockley, </em>219 Md. 493, 150 A.2d 438 (1959). There, the Court explained that, under the statute, \u201cthe representative does not merely take the place of one against whom a claim has been asserted, but is made amenable, in his representative capacity, to service of process as an original party. Such direct liability did not exist at common law but is conferred wholly by the Statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497,150 A.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>Dixon v. Checchia </em>put the same concept this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c[T]he period of limitations in Section 112 is set forth in the statute and is considered a part of the grant of the right itself. The limitation period in Article 93, Section 112 is a part of the substantive right that did not exist at common law but is wholly conferred by the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Dixon, </em>249 Md. at 24, 288 A.2d at 249. This passage is quoted in <em>Blocher, </em>268 Md. at 580, 303 A.2d at 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Indeed, the <em>Blocher </em>Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cThere is a substantial body of law to the effect that where a limitation period is stipulated in a statute creating a cause of action it is not to be considered as an ordinary statute of limitations, but is to be considered as a limitation upon the right as well as the remedy, with the result that as to causes of action already accrued at the time of the enactment of a subsequent statute enlarging the limitation period on such causes of action the subsequent statute will not be held applicable so as to extend or enlarge the original limitation period, particularly where no legislative intent to give the subsequent statute a retroactive application clearly appears from its language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">268 Md. at 581, 303 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The distinction between a condition precedent and an ordinary statute of limitations also applies to wrongful death actions. In <em>Trimper v. Porter-Hayden, </em>305 Md. 31, 501 A.2d 446 (1985), the appellant argued that the discovery rule, applicable to ordinary limitations issues, see <em>Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677 (1981), was applicable as well to actions for wrongful death. Rejecting that argument, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\u201cWe cannot, however, apply the foregoing rationale [the discovery rule] to the time bar applicable to -wrongful death actions. A long line of precedent in this Court and the unambiguous language of C J \u00a7 3-904(g) prevent adopting a discovery rule for such claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">\u201c \u2018The rule in Maryland is that, since the wrongful death statute created a new liability not existing at common law, compliance with the period of limitations for such actions is a condition precedent to the right to maintain the action.

Nor are we directly concerned with a shortening of a period of ordinary limitations which would have some impact on the holder of the cause of action. Our concern here is with an extension of an ordinary statute of limitations and whether the unquantifiable increase in the possibility that a suit may be brought during the period of the extension, based on a cause of action viable when the limitations are extended, infringes a substantial right of the persons who are sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In <em>Janda v. General Motors Corp., </em>237 Md. 161, 205 A.2d 228 (1964), the Court reviewed various rules formulated to aid in determining the prospective/retrospective issue. Quoting <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>217 Md. 316, 320,142 A.2d 550, 553 (1958), the first rule stated was: \u201cOrdinarily a change affecting procedure only, and not substantive rights, made by statute (and an amendment of the Maryland Rules has essentially the same effect) applies to all actions [and matters] whether <em>accrmd, </em>pending or future, unless a contrary intention is expressed.\u201d <em>Janda, </em>237 Md. at 168, 205 A.2d at 232 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">There are a number of Maryland cases which, in effect, treat ordinary statutes of limitations as dealing with procedure, but these cases involve a reduction of the time within which one asserting a claim must do so. For example, <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 501 A.2d 27 (1985), upheld a statute of repose in medical malpractice cases that was attacked on grounds that it deprived the plaintiff of a substantial right. The Court quoted from <em>Allen v. Dovell, </em>193 Md. 359, 363-64, 66 A.2d 795, 797 (1949):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201c Tt is true that the Legislature cannot cut off all remedy and deprive a party of his right of action by enacting a statute of limitations applicable to an existing cause of action in such a way as to preclude any opportunity to bring suit. However, the Legislature has the power to amend a statute of limitations either by <em>extending </em>or reducing the period of limitations, so as to regulate the time within which suits may be brought, provided that the new law allows a reasonable time after its enactment for the assertion of an existing right or the enforcement of an existing obligation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><em>Hill, </em>304 Md. at 702-03, 501 A.2d at 33-34 (emphasis added). <em>Allen v. Dovell </em>involved the reduction of the time within which a person whose property had been sold at tax sale could redeem the property from the tax sale purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A statute reducing plaintiffs\u2019 time for filing suit was approved in <em>Kelch v. Keehn, </em>183 Md. 140, 36 A.2d 544 (1944). The plaintiff was the receiver of an assessable mutual insurance company who sought to enforce assessments made in 1940 and 1941 on policies that had terminated in 1935 and 1936. Chapter 296 of the Acts of 1941, effective June 1, 1941, reduced limitations on such actions to one year after policy termination, unless the assessment was made within one year after policy termination. Under the prior law, the statute of limitations on the receiver\u2019s claim was three years, and the receiver\u2019s suit in 1943 was timely under the pre-June 1941 standard. The Court held that the receiver\u2019s claim was barred, saying, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cWhere the effect of the statute is not to obliterate existing substantial rights but affects only the procedure and remedies for the enforcement of those rights, it applies to all actions whether <em>accrued, </em>pending or future, unless a contrary intention is expressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 144, 36 A.2d at 545 (emphasis added). Although the statute did not contain any provisions similar to SECTION 2 in the matter before us, the <em>Kelch </em>Court concluded that it was \u201capparent that the Legislature intended that the rights existing ... on June 1, 1941, must be asserted within one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 36 A.2d at 547. As so construed, the Act afforded the Plaintiff a reasonable time within which to bring suit so that no substantial right was violated by the reduction in limitations. Judgment for the receiver was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><em>Ireland v. Shipley, </em>165 Md. 90, 166 A. 593 (1933), involved Chapter 342 of the Acts of 1931. Prior thereto, there was no time limit on a claimant\u2019s reopening a workers\u2019 compensation award. Chapter 342 set a time limit of one year from the award. Ireland, the claimant, formally petitioned in July 1932 to reopen his 1921 award. The Act was held to allow reopening, if sought within one year of the new statute\u2019s effective date. The case was remanded to have the administrative agency determine whether Ireland\u2019s letter to it in May 1932 procedurally effected a reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The reductions on plaintiffs\u2019 pre-existing time to sue, by the retroactive application of the statutes in the Maryland cases reviewed above, did not unconstitutionally impair substantial rights. Those reductions would seem to encroach on the preexisting rights of those plaintiffs to a similar, if not a greater, degree than the subject extension of limitations for child victims of sexual abuse encroaches on the pre-existing rights of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">From the standpoint of the due process rights of defendants, <em>Rice v. University of Maryland Md. Sys. Corp., </em>186 Md.App. 551, 975 A.2d 193, <em>cert. granted, </em>411 Md. 355, 983 A.2d 431 (2009), is closely related to the issue before us. That case involved the retroactive application of CJ \u00a7 5-119 (2009 Cum.Supp.). It is a saving statute for medical malpractice claims that had been dismissed for failure to present a certificate of merit that complied with the requirements elucidated in <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 911 A.2d 427 (2006). The <em>Rice </em>claims were filed on November 17, 2003. On January 18, 2007, a circuit court dismissed those claims without prejudice, based upon <em>Walzer, </em>and the plaintiffs appealed. While that appeal was pending, the General Assembly enacted \u00a7 5-119, effective June 1, 2007. It provided, <em>inter </em>alia, the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>dismissed without prejudice on or after November 17, 2006, and before June 1, 2007, could be commenced anew if filed on or before August 1, 2007. The <em>Rice </em>plaintiffs, on July 23, 2007, refiled, with a revised certificate, and permitted their pending appeal to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">This Court held that the statute did not violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights, even though the time within which the <em>Rice </em>plaintiffs initially could assert their claims had long expired. Distinguishing the cases in which the Legislature attempted full retroactivity of a Lord Campbell\u2019s action, we reasoned that \u201c[t]he appellants\u2019 claims were still in ongoing litigation at the time the 2007 statute took effect, and, as a consequence, their claims had not \u2018expired,\u2019 and no vested property interests of the [defendant] were infringed when the General Assembly enacted a provision that permitted the continued pursuit of such claims.\u201d 186 Md.App. at 566, 975 A.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The same point may be illustrated by <em>Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>362 Md. 535, 766 A.2d 98 (2001). Under <em>Lynch v. Lynch, </em>342 Md. 509, 677 A.2d 584 (1996), one charged with constructive civil contempt for failure to pay child support could defend on the ground that the obligee failed to prove that the alleged contemnor had the ability to pay at the time of the contempt hearing. Maryland Rule 15-207(e), effective January 1, 1997, changed the rule of <em>Lynch </em>and permitted a finding of contempt if it could be shown that the alleged contemnor had the ability to pay in the period when arrearages were accumulating, even if there were no ability to pay at the time of the hearing. Michael Rawlings, the contemnor in <em>Rawlings, </em>accumulated arrearages prior to January 1, 1997. The Court held that the new rule, being clearly remedial, had a retrospective sweep. 362 Md. at 554, 766 A.2d at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Further, the statements in <em>Hill </em>and <em>Allen, </em>that the Legislature may extend limitations, necessarily contemplate, based on the context, that the extension have some retroactive operation. There is nothing remarkable about the Legislature\u2019s enlarging limitations wholly prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\n<em>Out-of-State Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Defendant refers us to certain decisions of federal courts and courts of our sister states, but those cases do not address the type of partial retroactivity with which we are here concerned. The cited cases either apply, or at least recognize, the proposition that a change in a statute of limitations cannot be applied to revive a claim that was barred under a former limitations statute prior to the effective date of a new limitations statute. Applying that proposition are <em>Doe v. Diocese of Dallas, </em>234 Ill.2d 393, 334 Ill.Dec. 649, 917 N.E.2d 475 (2009); <em>Clay v. Kuhl, </em>189 Ill.2d 603, 244 Ill.Dec. 918, 727 N.E.2d 217 (2000); <em>Sepmeyer v. Holman, </em>162 Ill.2d 249, 205 Ill.Dec. 125, 642 N.E.2d 1242 (1994); and <em>Doe v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City, </em>862 S.W.2d 338 (Mo.1993). Recognizing, but not applying, that proposition are <em>Baughn v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>356 F.Supp.2d 1166, 1171 (D.Kan.2005); and <em>Long v. Hershey Chocolate, U.S.A., </em>1992 WL 191097, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6583 (M.D.Pa.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">More relevant to the issue before us are the partial retroactivity decisions. <em>See, e.g., Lamke v. Sunstate Equip. Co., </em>387 F.Supp.2d 1044, 1052 (N.D.Cal.2004) (adopting plaintiffs argument that \u201c \u2018the extension of the statutory period within which an action must be brought [here from one year to two] is generally held to be valid if made <em>before </em>the cause of action is barred.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Thistlethwaite v. Polymer, </em>6 F.Supp.2d 263, 265 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (\u201c[T]he law is now clear that a lengthened statute of limitations is \u2018procedural\u2019 \u2014 that is, it does not alter substantive rights \u2014 and can be applied to preexisting claims as long as the new statute does not revive claims already barred.\u201d); <em>Reeves v.
