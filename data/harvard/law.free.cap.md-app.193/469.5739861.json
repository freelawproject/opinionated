Following a trial in 2007, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted Omar Parker,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant, of second degree assault, in violation of Md.Code (2002, 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 3-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), and retaliation for testimony, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 9-303.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court initially sentenced appellant to five years\u2019 incarceration for second degree assault and, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 9-303(c)(2), to a concurrent term of twenty years for \u201cretaliation for testimony.\u201d The court dated both sentences from February 17, 2006, the date of appellant\u2019s arrest. This Court subsequently affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions but vacated his sentence for retaliation and remanded for a new sentencing for that offense. <em>See Parker v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 399, 404, 970 A.2d 968 (2009) <em>(\u201cParker I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">On October 20, 2009, the circuit court imposed a term of five years\u2019 incarceration for retaliation, commencing on July 2, 2009, the date when the Maryland Division of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) released appellant with respect to his assault conviction and transferred him to the Baltimore City Detention Center (\u201cBCDC\u201d). At the resentencing, the circuit court did not award appellant any credit for the time he had served from his arrest on February 17, 2006, until his transfer to BCDC on July 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Appellant\u2019s second appeal followed. He presents one question: \u201cDid the circuit court err in failing to give Mr. Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>credit against his five year sentence for witness retaliation for the time he served between February 17, 2006, and July 1, 2009?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">This matter is rooted in an incident that occurred on November 29, 2005, when appellant threatened Kya Hicks \u2022with a gun. <em>See Parker I, </em>185 Md.App. at 403-09, 970 A.2d 968. Appellant was convicted on June 4, 2007. At the initial sentencing proceeding on July 26, 2007, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Well Mr. Parker, also know [sic] as Mr. Anderson, there\u2019s no question that you\u2019re an intelligent man a well spoken man but you clearly have no insight into your behavior. You have no remorse. You\u2019ve no desire to change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">You have a serious drug history and the basis of this case [sic] strikes at the very heart of the criminal justice system. Intimidation of witnesses undermines everything that the criminal justice system stands for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">So as far as this court\u2019s concerned, its [sic] this kind of case which is the most serious case that we face in our society today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Accordingly, in <em>Parker I </em>the court imposed a sentence of five years\u2019 incarceration for second degree assault and a concurrent term of twenty years for retaliation. The court inquired as to \u201cthe start date,\u201d and defense counsel responded, \u201cFebruary 17, 2006.\u201d The court said: \u201cI will date that sentence from ... February 17, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Appellant lodged his first appeal on August 16, 2007. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court erred in sentencing him to an enhanced term of twenty years for witness retaliation, because the jury was never asked to determine whether the retaliation related to a drug crime or a crime of violence, as required for an enhanced twenty-year sentence under C.L. \u00a7 9 \u2014 303(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Parker I, </em>185 Md.App. at 409-13, 970 A.2d 968. In an Opinion filed on May 7, 2009, the <em>Parker I </em>Court agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 970 A.2d 968. Therefore, the Court vacated the sentence for retaliation and remanded for resentencing under C.L. \u00a7 9 \u2014 303(c)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 421, 970 A.2d 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As to the retaliation conviction, the trial court held a second sentencing hearing on October 20, 2009, at which the State asked the court \u201cto impose a five-year sentence,\u201d which was the maximum allowed under the circumstances. The State was silent as to whether the sentence should be consecutive or concurrent. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, given the opinion from the Court of Special Appeals and all the surrounding case law, given the fact that he\u2019s already given 20 years, I\u2019m going to submit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re not asking for less than five years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Defense counsel indicated to the court that appellant \u201cwas released from the Division of Correction and sent to the jail on July the 2nd.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">THE COURT: All right. Well, given the fact that the court viewed this case as such a serious violation, since it was one of the first matters in which there was testimony that there was retaliation for testifying, and since the Court of Special Appeals indicated that \u2014 that because the jury was not instructed to find that the retaliation had occurred in connection with a felony, that the court could not enhance the penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">And the court had given Mr. Parker the 20 years as the enhanced penalty. Therefore, the court, in this case, ... as per the instructions of the Court of Special Appeals with regard to the limits, this court feels that five years is the appropriate sentence. And I will give the defendant five years, and I\u2019ll date it from July 2nd, 2009 to give him credit for all time that he\u2019s served on this charge----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So, Your Honor, for clarification, so his sentence is going to be [sic] begin on the date that he was actually transferred from the Division of [Corrections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">THE COURT: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... My client is concerned that the credit would go back to, I believe, it\u2019s February of 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">THE COURT: I asked him when he was transferred to the Baltimore City Jail, and you just told me July 2nd. So that\u2019s the day it\u2019s [sic] going to get because he was serving a sentence on the assault in the second degree. Although if he was still at the Division of Correction, my sentence with regard to retaliation would be consecutive to that sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">Because he completed that sentence [for assault], then I\u2019m willing to give him credit for all the time he\u2019s been held at the City Jail pending sentencing in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADl\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object then. Because under the case law he can\u2019t be given a consecutive anyway [sic]. He\u2019s been in, he served pretrial from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not giving him a consecutive sentence. I\u2019m giving him five years and I\u2019m dating it from July 2nd 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred by failing to credit him for the time he served between his arrest on February 17, 2006, and his release to the BCDC on July 1, 2009, a total of 1,281 days.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to appellant, he served that time for the initial sentences of five years for assault and a concurrent term of twenty years for retaliation. Therefore, appellant maintains that, pursuant to Md.Code (2001, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 6-218 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>is entitled to credit on the new retaliation sentence for all the time he previously spent in custody on that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The State insists that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(d) applies here. In its view, the court was not required to grant appellant credit for the time he served in connection with his first sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We pause to review the relevant statutory provisions. C.P. \u00a7 6-218, titled \u201cCredit against sentence for time spent in custody,\u201d provides, in part:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in the custody of a correctional facility, ... or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">(i) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">(2) If a defendant is in custody because of a charge that results in a dismissal or acquittal, the time that would have been credited if a sentence had been imposed shall be credited against any sentence that is based on a charge for which a warrant or commitment was filed during that custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">(3) In a case other than a case described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the sentencing court may apply credit against a sentence for time spent in custody for another charge or crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">(c) <em>Credit when prior sentence set aside. </em>\u2014 A defendant whose sentence is set aside because of a direct or collateral attack and who is reprosecuted or resentenced for the same crime or for another crime based on the same transaction shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in custody under the prior sentence, including credit applied against the prior sentence in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">(d) <em>Credit when one of multiple sentences set aside. </em>\u2014 A defendant who is serving multiple sentences, one of which is set aside as the result of a direct or collateral attack, shall receive credit against and a reduction of the remaining term of a definite or life sentence, or the remaining minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in custody under the sentence set aside, including credit applied against the sentence set aside in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">(e) <em>Credit awarded at sentencing. </em>\u2014 (1) The court shall award the credit required by this section at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">(2) After having communicated with the parties, the court shall tell the defendant and shall state on the record the amount of the credit and the facts on which the credit is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In addition, Md.Code (2006 Repl. Vol., 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 12-702 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) is relevant. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Sentences following appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(a) <em>Remand for sentence; mandatory credit for time served. </em>\u2014 If an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower court may pronounce the proper judgment or sentence, the lower court shall deduct from the term of the new sentence the time served by the defendant under the previous sentence from the date of his conviction. If the previous sentence was a statutory maximum sentence, the lower court also shall give credit for any period of incarceration prior to the previous sentence, if the incarceration was related to the offense for which the sentence was imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(b) <em>Remand for sentence or new trial; limitations on increases in sentences. </em>\u2014 If an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower court may pronounce the proper judgment or sentence, or conduct a new trial, and if there is a conviction following this new trial, the lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense. However, it may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">(1) The reasons for the increased sentence affirmatively appear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">(2) The reasons are based upon additional objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">(3) The factual data upon which the increased sentence is based appears as part of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Appellant argues that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) \u201cclearly applies\u201d to this case, because his sentence was set aside as a result of a direct appeal, and he was then resentenced for the same offense, i.e., witness retaliation. Looking to the plain language of C.P. \u00a7 6-218, he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">[Sjubsection (c) applies to someone \u201cwhose sentence is set aside because of a direct or collateral attack <em>and who is reprosecuted or resentenced for the same crime or for another crime based on the same transaction,\u201d </em>while subsection (d) applies to a person \u201cwho is serving multiple sentences, one of which is set aside as the result of a direct or collateral attack.\u201d [C.P.] \u00a7 6-218(c) &amp; (d) (emphasis added). Both subsections refer to a sentence that is \u201cset aside.\u201d That the legislature used the italicized language in subsection (c) but not in subsection (d) strongly suggests that it did not intend (d) to apply to someone who was resentenced for the same crime or based on the same transaction. In other words, (c) applies when a conviction or sentence is vacated and the person is subsequently resentenced for the same crime or another based on the same transaction, whereas (d) applies when a sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>vacated but the defendant is not resentenced for that crime or another based on the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Noting that, since February 17, 2006, he was in custody on both the assault and retaliation convictions, appellant insists that he was entitled to \u201c \u2018receive credit against and a reduction of the term of \u201d the new five-year sentence \u201c \u2018for all time spent in custody under the prior sentence.\u2019 \u201d (Citing C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c)). He adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The judge\u2019s refusal to start the new five year sentence for retaliation on February 17, 2006, or to give Mr. Parker credit against this sentence for the 1,281 days he spent in custody between February 17, 2006, and July 1, 2009, deprived Mr. Parker of credit to which he was entitled under \u00a7 6-218(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Appellant underscores that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) refers \u201cto a resentencing for a particular crime,\u201d while \u00a7 6-218(d) begins with the phrase \u201c[a] defendant who is serving multiple sentences.\u201d He posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">There is nothing in subsection (c) that expressly limits its applicability to cases in which the defendant was sentenced on only one count. Its plain language makes clear that it applies here. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of any reason why the legislature would give a person resentenced for the same crime credit for time served only when there were no other sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Even if subsection (d) applies, Parker maintains that \u201cit would still require that Mr. Parker receive credit for the time he [initially] spent in custody on the witness retaliation charge.\u201d He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">[Subsection (d) ] commands, in pertinent part, that a defendant \u201cshall receive credit against and a reduction of the remaining term of a definite ... sentence ... for all time spent in custody under the sentence set aside.\u201d \u00a7 6-218(d). The \u201cremaining term\u201d in this case is the five year term the lower court imposed on resentencing. Under subsection (d), the court was required to give him credit against that five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>year term for the time spent in custody on the previous witness retaliation sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Noting that the \u201cjudge expressly denied that she was giving Mr. Parker a consecutive sentence,\u201d appellant complains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">If she had [imposed a consecutive sentence], this would have been an unlawful increase in his sentence. <em>Compare State v. Sayre, </em>314 Md. 559, 562 [552 A.2d 553] (1989) (holding that \u201c[w]hen a sentence is changed from concurrent to consecutive, it is increased in length\u201d) <em>with </em>[C.J.] \u00a7 12-702(b) (providing, with exceptions not implicated here, that when an appellate court remands a case to a lower court for resentencing, the lower court \u201cmay not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense\u201d); <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 725-26 [89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656] (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Even if the court was entitled to impose a consecutive sentence for retaliation, however, appellant maintains that he \u201calready served time in custody on the retaliation charge [from February 17, 2006 until July 1, 2009,] and therefore would be entitled to credit for it under [C.P.] \u00a7 6-218(c) and [C.J.] \u00a7 12-702(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Finally, appellant maintains that, \u201cto the extent that the statutory language is ambiguous on this issue, the rule of lenity requires that the ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant and against the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The State counters that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(d) \u201cspecifically applies to instances where \u2018one of multiple sentences\u2019 is set aside.\u201d It posits: \u201cSubsection (d) on its face applies to instances of multiple sentences.... \u201d Noting that \u201cSubsection (d) is silent as to credit for time served,\u201d and that it \u201cdoes not mention re-sentencing at all,\u201d the State maintains that the \u201cissue of credit for time served on other charges [is] discretionary under subsection (b)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">As to C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c), the State asserts: \u201cSubsection (c) mandates giving credit for time served on that single sentence if and when a sentence is reimposed <em>for that charge, </em>which is entirely consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 6-218.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>in original.) In its view, if appellant were allowed to receive credit for the time he served on the original sentence, he would receive \u201cdouble\u201d credit, in contravention of the intention of the Legislature and the Court of Appeals. It posits: \u201cThe law is not meant to allow inmates to \u2018bank\u2019 time ... or receive double credit for time served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">According to the State, \u201c[b]y applying subsection (c) to cases where there were multiple sentences, judges would be forced to impose de facto concurrent sentences at resentencing. Parker\u2019s interpretation essentially mandates \u2018double time.\u2019 \u201d The State adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Parker\u2019s attempt at forcing a subsection (d) case into subsection (c) ... would contribute nothing toward [the legislative goal of] avoiding \u201cdead time\u201d; as the time he spent in jail on his assault conviction was not \u201cdead.\u201d It would, however, essentially tie the hands of the judge at resentencing, which was never the purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Further, the State maintains that there \u201cis no Constitutional or statutory bar to imposing a new sentence [on appellant] which runs consecutive to his prior sentence.\u201d In its view, C.J. \u00a7 12-702(b) \u201cexpressly allows a court to impose any legal sentence after remand, while requiring \u2018objective information\u2019 and \u2018aff\u00edrmative[ ] reasons\u2019 before allowing an increase in the sentence on remand.\u201d Therefore, it claims that the sentencing court was entitled to begin Parker\u2019s sentence for witness retaliation on July 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The State also argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">[T]here is an overarching element of common sense involved in allowing the sentencing court to shape the sentence it feels is appropriate. Parker seeks, essentially, a windfall from an inadvertent error of the sentencing court in what was a case of first impression. <em>[Parker </em>I,] 185 Md.App. at 414 [970 A.2d 968]. This is precisely the sort of gamesmanship the Supreme Court [has] rejected____ It is painfully evident that had the sentencing court been aware, at the time Parker\u2019s initial sentence was passed, that it was limited to a five-year maximum on the charge of witness intimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>dation, Parker\u2019s sentences would not have been made concurrent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">Section 6-218(d) of the Criminal Procedure Article leaves it to the trial court\u2019s discretion as to whether a defendant should be given credit for time served on a different charge. Section 12-702 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article does not affect the imposition of a new sentence on a different charge, which is the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In response, appellant posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">If the lower court had originally sentenced Mr. Parker to five years for assault and a consecutive fifteen years for witness retaliation (instead of five years for assault and a concurrent twenty years for witness retaliation), he would not have been serving his sentence for witness retaliation while he was serving his sentence for assault, and therefore would not be entitled to credit for that time against his new sentence for witness retaliation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">But, appellant insists that when the court initially sentenced him to concurrent terms, the court \u201cgave him double credit for the time he was serving.\u201d He argues: \u201cApplying subsection (c) to cases with multiple sentences would not require judges to impose de facto concurrent sentences at resentencing; it would merely require that judges give defendants credit against the new sentence for the time they served on the prior sentence.\u201d Parker argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the judge lawfully could and actually did make the witness retaliation sentence consecutive at the resentencing, \u00a7 6-218 would still require that the court give him credit against the consecutive sentence for the time he had already served on the previous sentence. Even if a court could change a sentence from concurrent to consecutive on remand, the State can point to no statute that would permit a court to deprive Mr. Parker of the credit to which he was entitled under \u00a7 6-218.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Appellant makes a somewhat veiled challenge to the imposition of a consecutive sentence on remand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State argues in its brief that the court lawfully imposed a consecutive sentence on remand. Therefore, we turn first to the question of whether, on remand, the court imposed a consecutive sentence and, if so, whether it was permitted to do so if the original sentence for retaliation was concurrent to the assault sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018sentence\u2019 is defined as \u2018[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter v.

We disagreed, <em>id. </em>at 60-61, 779 A.2d 1031:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">The record itself is clear: the trial judge erred in sentencing appellant for crimes he did not commit (or at least was acquitted <em>of) </em>while, at the same time, failing to sentence him for crimes he did commit. Moreover, his intention to impose a sentence in connection with each of the three children who had been endangered by the shotgun blasts is unambiguously set forth in the sentencing transcript. After separately naming each child and identifying the assault count associated with that child, the court imposed a separate sentence. In imposing sentence, the trial judge made it plain that appellant\u2019s conduct amounted to a criminal act against each of the three children, and he intended to impose a separate and consecutive sentence with respect to each child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In rejecting Ridgeway\u2019s double jeopardy claim, we reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 64, 779 A.2d 1031:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">[T]he Supreme Court has cautioned against permitting those convicted of a crime from using the Double Jeopardy Clause to avoid sentencing or, in other words, turning sentencing into \u201ca game in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner.\u201d <em>Bozza v.

Moreno-Hernandez was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to transport aliens (count 1), two counts of transporting aliens (counts 2 and 3), and being an alien found in the United States after a felony conviction and subsequent deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) (count 4). <em>Id. </em>at 1113. Each term of imprisonment was to be served concurrently, and to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release on each count, also concurrent. <em>Id. </em>at 1114. With regard to count 4, Moreno-Hernandez was initially sentenced to 125 months under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>The statute carried a maximum penalty of fifteen years if the predicate felony is an \u201caggravated\u201d felony. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the government did not prove that the prior felony was an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1114 n. 1. Therefore, it remanded for resentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carried a maximum penalty of five years. <em>Id. </em>at 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">On remand, the court resentenced Moreno-Hernandez under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>But, based on the sentencing guidelines, the court \u201cordered his sentence on that count to be served consecutively to, rather than concurrently with, the 60-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>month concurrent sentences imposed on counts 1-3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Moreno-Hernandez\u2019s overall sentence for all four counts was decreased from 125 months to 120 months. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Again, Moreno-Hernandez appealed. He contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court improperly changed the concurrent sentence to a consecutive sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1113. Rejecting that claim, the Ninth Circuit stated, 48 F.3d at 1116:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">A resentencing mandate from an appellate court ... does away with the entire initial sentence, and authorizes the district court to impose \u201cany sentence which could lawfully have been imposed originally.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. United States, </em>330 F.2d [26, 29 (9th Cir.1964) ] (quoting <em>United States v. Chiarella, </em>214 F.2d 838, 842 [ (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 902, 75 S.Ct. 226, 99 L.Ed. 708 (1954) ]). In the latter case, double jeopardy is not implicated. A defendant has no legitimate expectation of finality in a sentence which he places in issue by direct appeal, so long as he has not completed serving the valid portion of the sentence. <em>United States v. Andersson, </em>813 F.2d 1450, 1461 (9th Cir.1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Because, in this case, the district court resentenced Moreno-Hernandez in accordance with our mandate, and not pursuant to [Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (\u201cCorrecting or Reducing a Sentence\u201d)], the court was free to reconsider the entire \u201csentencing package\u201d and to restructure the sentences to run consecutively. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>884 F.2d 433, 441 (9th Cir.1989) (noting that on remand after vacation of sentence, the district court should have an opportunity to reconsider the entire \u201csentencing package\u201d, not only the unlawful portion)[, <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 568, 107 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Further, the court said, <em>id. </em>at 1117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">The district court\u2019s resentencing order that the sentence on count 4 run consecutively to the concurrent sentences on counts 1-3 does not violate our remand. In that remand we did not limit the overall sentence the district court could impose, nor did we circumscribe the manner in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>court could apply the Sentencing Guidelines. We simply directed the district court to limit its sentence on count 4 to the five-year maximum prescribed by section 1326(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">Moreno-Hernandez\u2019s argument that our previous remand precluded the district court from imposing a consecutive sentence completely ignores [United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cUSSG\u201d), 18 U.S.C. Appx. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (\u201cSentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction\u201d) ]. That section is specifically designed to provide for consecutive sentences whenever, as was the case here, the sentencing range determined from the defendant\u2019s combined offense level exceeds the maximum sentence permitted on the count of conviction that carries the highest statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Joetzki, </em>952 F.2d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir.1991). Because Moreno-Hernandez had previously been deported after conviction for an aggravated felony, he was subject, under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2), to an enhanced sentencing range of 100-125 months on count 4. The maximum possible sentence for that count, however, and for each of the other counts on which Moreno-Hernandez was convicted, is only five years. The district court therefore acted within its authority in requiring Moreno-Hernandez to serve his sentence on count 4 consecutively to his sentences on counts 1-3. This resulted in an overall sentence of 120 months, which is within the 125-month upper limit of the guidelines range for count 4 when enhanced under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The cases discussed above lead us to agree with the State that, on remand, the court was entitled to impose any sentence it could have lawfully imposed under C.L. \u00a7 9-303(c)(l), including a consecutive sentence. As in <em>Moreno-Hernandez, </em>48 F.3d at 1116, the trial \u201ccourt was free to reconsider the entire \u2018sentencing package\u2019 and to restructure the sentences to run consecutively.\u201d A consecutive five-year sentence, in lieu of a twenty-year concurrent sentence, was not an illegal increase in sentence under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Our resolution of this issue, however, leaves open the question of whether appellant was entitled to any credit against that consecutive five-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We turn to the issue of whether the sentencing court erred by failing to credit appellant for the time he spent in custody before the resentencing. We consider two discrete periods: 1) the period from appellant\u2019s arrest to the initial sentencing, i.e., his pretrial detention; and 2) the period from the imposition of the original sentence to the time of resentencing. Stated otherwise, the question is whether a judge who initially imposed a concurrent sentence for an offense, with credit from the date of arrest, and changes it, on remand, to a consecutive sentence, must nonetheless award credit for the period of pretrial detention, awarded at the first sentencing, as well as the time served while the sentence was concurrent (i.e., before the remand). As we have seen, each side presented cogent arguments in support of its respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In considering the subject of awarding credits after remand, R.D. Hursh, <em>\u201cRight to Credit for Time Served under Erroneous or Void Sentence or Invalid Judgment of Conviction Necessitating New Trial,\u201d </em>85 A.L.R.2d 1283 (1954), is informative. Hursh explained, 35 A.L.R.2d 1283, \u00a7 2 (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">In cases dealing with resentencing necessitated by the invalidity of the original sentence, but not involving a new trial between the first and second sentence, the courts are not in agreement on the question whether time served under the first sentence is to be credited against time served under the second. In some jurisdictions, allowance of such credit is provided for by statute. In jurisdictions lacking such a statute, what appears to be the modern (and, it is submitted, the better) view is that such an allowance is proper. But in a substantial number of cases the contrary view has been approved; in some of these decisions the courts have limited their rulings to cases in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>invalid judgment is void (reasoning that in such a situation there is, in law, no imprisonment), while in others it has been commented that such an allowance is a matter for the legislature and beyond the power of the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Hursh also addressed \u201cthe question whether one who has served in prison under a sentence is entitled to have time so served credited where, because the original sentence was invalid, it is necessary that he be resentenced\u201d without a new trial. 35 A.L.R.2d 1283, \u00a7 5. He argues that the \u201cmodern (and the better) view ... is that such an allowance is proper.\u201d 35 A.L.R.2d 1283, \u00a7 5. However, Hursh does not address the more confounding situation where a defendant is serving multiple concurrent sentences, only one of which is vacated, and whether credit must be granted for time served if, on remand, the vacated sentence is made consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">To resolve this thorny question, which involves construing C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a), as well as C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) and (d), the well settled principles of statutory interpretation guide our analysis. The interpretation of a statute is a judicial function. <em>Zimmer-Rubert v.

That rule is reflected in subsection (a), and is required by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. <em>Pearce </em>also held that if there was a reversal, a new trial, and a re-conviction, the second sentence could not be more severe than the first, except under certain limited circumstances. That rule is reflected in subsection (b), and the circumstances permitting an increased sentence are taken almost verbatim from <em>Pearce. </em>This rule is required by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>...

According to the Revisor\u2019s Note, the second sentence of C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a) was new, and \u201cstate[d] the rule of <em>Wright v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 673 [276 A.2d 411] (1971),\u201d in which the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 675, 276 A.2d 411, that \u201cthe Maryland Legislature, in providing a statutory maximum sentence, intended such maximum sentence to be calculated by including time spent in jail prior to trial and sentencing.\u201d The Revisor\u2019s Note continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">A related question is whether or not credit for pre-original sentence confinement must be given if the original sentence was less than the statutory maximum. In <em>State v. Ewell, </em>234 Md. 56 [198 A.2d 275] (1964) the Court of Appeals answered that question in the negative. Thereafter, <em>North Carolina v.

But the question now under consideration was not expressly decided, whatever inferences may be gathered from <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Benton. </em>It was expressly left open in <em>Wright. </em>Therefore, no statutory provision on this point is proposed----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Laws of Maryland 1973, ch. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We are unaware of any cases that have construed C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a). When the Legislature enacted C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a) in 1973, however, it \u201cintended to correct situations in which the first sentence was given while the judge was unaware of information that would have resulted in a greater sentence----\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report, H.B. 1139 (Md.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In 1988, the Legislature amended C.J. \u00a7 12-702(b) when it passed H.B. 1139.

State, </em>364 Md. 209, 228, 772 A.2d 283 (2001); <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989); <em>Davis v. State, </em>312 Md. 172, 539 A.2d 218 (1988). Maryland\u2019s appellate courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>have recognized that C.J. \u00a7 12-702(b) was the Legislature\u2019s \u201cresponse to the due process holding of <em>North Carolina v.

State, </em>307 Md. 449, 454-55, 514 A.2d 1219 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Similarly, in <em>Davis, </em>312 Md. at 179, 539 A.2d 218, the Court said as to C.J. \u00a7 12-702(b): \u201cIt is a policy determination that, after a defendant successfully challenges a criminal conviction, he may not at a resentencing for the same offense receive a greater sentence than the sentence previously imposed, unless specified statutory conditions are met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The legislative intent behind C.J. \u00a7 12-702, although mostly discussed in the context of subsection (b), suggests \u201cthat upon re-sentencing credit must be given for any portion of a sentence previously served.\u201d Laws of Maryland 1973, ch. 2. We are satisfied that C.J. \u00a7 12-702(b) does not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>case <em>sub judice, </em>because there was no \u201cconviction following [a] new trial\u201d and appellant\u2019s sentence was reduced, not increased. However, Subsection (a) does appear to apply. It mandates that the \u201ccourt shall deduct from the term of the new sentence the time served by the defendant under the previous sentence <em>from the date of his conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Because the court originally imposed a concurrent sentence for retaliation, this means that appellant was serving that sentence while his first appeal was pending. Thus, pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a), it would appear that, at the very least, appellant is entitled to credit for the time he served from his conviction on June 4, 2007, to July 1, 2009.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We turn to the second statute, C.P. \u00a7 6-218. Both C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) and (d) are interrelated. Each addresses the situation in which a defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cset aside\u201d because of \u201ca direct or collateral attack,\u201d and each provides that the defendant \u201cshall receive credit against and a reduction ... for all time spent in custody.\u201d There are key distinctions between the two subsections, however. Subsection (c) refers to a single sentence that is set aside, and expressly addresses reprosecution or resentencing. Here, there was more than one sentence, of which only one was vacated. But, there was a resentencing. Subsection (d) refers to \u201cmultiple sentences,\u201d of which only one is set aside.

The preamble to H.B. 650 (Md.1974), which enacted Article 27, \u00a7 638C, established that its \u201cpurpose [was] of providing that under certain circumstances persons shall receive credit against their sentences for any time spent in custody.\u201d Laws of Maryland 1974, ch. 735; <em>see Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 665, 887 A.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 158, 482 A.2d 490, the defendant was in jail awaiting trial on a charge of theft when he escaped from jail and took an automobile that was left unattended with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>motor running. He was apprehended the next day. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State nol prossed the original charge of theft and Fleeger pled guilty to escape and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Fleeger received concurrent sentences of six years\u2019 imprisonment for escape and three years\u2019 imprisonment for unauthorized use. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 482 A.2d 490. The sentencing court gave Fleeger credit against the sentence for the time he spent in custody after his escape, but not for the period of pre-escape custody. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the Court of Appeals, Fleeger argued that he was entitled to have his pre-escape incarceration credited against his sentence for escape. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 482 A.2d 490. The Court determined that the nolle prosequi of the original charge was \u201ceffectively tantamount to a dismissal\u201d under Article 27, \u00a7 638C(a). <em>Id. </em>at 161, 162, 482 A.2d 490. Moreover, the Court stated: \u201cThat Fleeger received credit for his pre-escape custody against an offense committed after his original custody is not determinative of whether Fleeger is banking time. Instead, the determinative factor is whether Fleeger satisfies the precise conditions of the mandatory credit provision [in \u00a7 638C(a) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 482 A.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Concluding \u201cthat Fleeger [was] entitled to have his preescape custody credited against his sentence for the crime of escape,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 168, 482 A.2d 490, the Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 163-64, 482 A.2d 490:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Credit statutes are designed to avoid the obviously undesirable effect of permitting a defendant to \u201cbank\u201d time before he commits a new offense. <em>See Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures </em>196 (American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice 1968) ...; <em>see also Bauers v. Yeager, </em>261 F.Supp. 420, 424 (D.N.J.1966) (discussing \u201cbanked\u201d time). Indeed, the possibility that an accumulated reserve of time could be used to offset a sentence for a future, yet uncompleted crime would destroy the deterrent value against the commission of such a crime. Maryland\u2019s credit statute, however, minimizes the banked time problem by restricting credit to those cases where a warrant or commitment is lodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>against a defendant while in custody on another charge, and the original charge culminates in a dismissal or acquittal....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 659, 887 A.2d 549, is also informative. Gilmer was in pretrial detention on a charge of attempted murder. On the defendant\u2019s 426th day in detention, he stabbed an inmate. <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 887 A.2d 549. The stabbing led to charges of attempted first degree murder, first degree assault, openly wearing and carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon, reckless endangerment, second degree assault, and attempted second degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 660-61, 887 A.2d 549. A jury convicted Gilmer of first and second degree assault and, prior to sentencing, the State nolle prossed the original charge of attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 887 A.2d 549. At sentencing, the judge merged second degree assault with first degree assault and sentenced Gilmer to fifteen years\u2019 incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 887 A.2d 549. But, the court did not credit him with the 426 days he had already served on the initial attempted murder charge that was later nolle prossed. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 887 A.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed with Gilmer that the use of the term \u201cdismissal\u201d in C.P. \u00a7 6 \u2014 218(b)(2) was ambiguous, because it \u201creasonably can be interpreted in either of two ways: one in which the unrelated offense may not be re-prosecuted, or the other in which the unrelated offense subsequently may be prosecuted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668-69, 887 A.2d 549.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After reviewing the history of nolle prosequi, it determined that \u201cdismissal,\u201d as used in that provision, included disposition by nolle prosequi. <em>Id. </em>at 675, 887 A.2d 549. Therefore, the Court held that the circuit court erred in denying Gilmer credit for the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>served for the nolle prossed charge. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 887 A.2d 549. It explained, <em>id. </em>at 676-77, 887 A.2d 549:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">The State ... asserts that if a nolle prosequi is included in the purview of dismissal for purposes of Section 6-218(b)(2), Gilmer could be awarded a potential windfall of double credit for time served on the nolle prossed charges were he prosecuted and convicted on them and again credited for the time served. Double credit, however, is not in issue because receiving credit for time served for the attempted murder can only occur once under the statute. More importantly, denying a defendant credit for time served on nolle prossed charges is not consistent with the legislative purpose for enacting Section 6-218, to ensure that \u201ca defendant receive as much credit as possible for time spent in custody.\u201d <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 165 [482 A.2d 490].... The risk of double credit can be easily avoided administratively, whereas the elimination of \u201cdead time\u201d is an essential attribute of Section 6-218(b)(2). The State\u2019s argument about double credit is not persuasive.[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Wilson, </em>157 Md.App. 82, 849 A.2d 88, a habeas corpus case, also provides guidance. There, the Circuit Court for Carroll County sentenced Wilson, consecutive to sentences imposed by the Circuit Court for Talbot County.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 85, 93, 849 A.2d 88. The sentences from Talbot County were subsequently reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Wilson subsequently sought a 526 day credit, pursuant to Article 27 \u00a7 638C, for the time he served under the Talbot County sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 85 n. 1, 89-90, 849 A.2d 88. He claimed that his Carroll County sentences began to run immediately, i.e., before his actual sentencing. In support of his position, Wilson pointed to the statutory language, now set forth in C.P. \u00a7 6-218(d), \u201crequiring credit for all time spent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>custody under the sentence set aside, \u2018including credit applied against the sentence set aside.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 849 A.2d 88. On appeal, Wilson argued that the circuit court erred in its application of C.P. \u00a7 6 \u2014 218(d) when read in connection with C.P. \u00a7 6-218(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 849 A.2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Court found that C.P. \u00a7 6-218 was ambiguous \u201cand should thus be construed in appellant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 849 A.2d 88. It said, <em>id. </em>at 96, 849 A.2d 88: \u201cThe Court of Appeals has noted that one purpose of the statute is to minimize the possibility that \u2018an accumulated reserve of time could be used to offset a sentence for a future, yet uncompleted crime.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 163, 482 A.2d 490). But, the Court also said: \u201cAnother purpose is to eliminate time spent in custody that will not be credited to any valid sentence.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>157 Md.App. at 96, 849 A.2d 88 (citing <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 163, 482 A.2d 490).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In construing C.P. \u00a7 6-218 against the State, the Court determined that Wilson should be credited for the 526 days that he had served on the Talbot County sentences. <em>Wilson, </em>157 Md.App. at 99-100, 849 A.2d 88. Thus, while the Court affirmed the denial of Wilson\u2019s petition for habeas corpus, it also computed a term of confinement that credited Wilson with an additional 526 days. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 849 A.2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The <em>Wilson </em>Court noted that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) and (d) \u201coperate like (b)(2), although (c) and (d) apply to sentences set aside, and (b)(2) applies to dismissals and acquittals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 849 A.2d 88 (citation omitted). Further, the Court explained, <em>id.: </em>\u201cSubsection (c) addresses the situation where a defendant\u2019s sentence is set aside on direct or collateral attack, and the defendant is reprosecuted and resentenced for the same crime or another crime based on the same transaction.\u201d In contrast, C.P. \u00a7 6-218(d) \u201caddresses the situation where a defendant is serving multiple sentences and one of them is set aside as a result of a direct or collateral attack.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In <em>Lawson v. State, </em>187 Md.App. 101, 975 A.2d 357 (2009), we construed C.P. \u00a7 6-218(b). As part of a plea agreement, Lawson pled guilty to possessing a cell phone in his prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>cell. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 975 A.2d 357. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the defendant received a one-year sentence \u201cto run consecutive to the completion of any outstanding Maryland sentence not yet fully served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After sentencing, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to correct the commitment record, because it included credit for time the defendant served awaiting trial on the cell phone charge, even though defendant was in prison during that time as the result of prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>The defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that the removal of the credited time rendered the sentence illegal. <em>Id. </em>The court denied that motion. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant asserted that the court erred \u201cin changing his commitment record after sentencing to eliminate the credit for time served.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The <em>Lawson </em>Court determined that C.P. \u00a7 6 \u2014 218(b)(1) \u201cis not ambiguous, and so the rule of lenity does not apply.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>187 Md.App. at 107, 975 A.2d 357 (citing <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 646, 943 A.2d 1260 (2008) and <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994)). We stated that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(b)(l)\u2019s \u201cplain meaning is that, upon conviction, a defendant must be credited for time he has served in custody \u2018because of that crime (or the conduct underlying that crime).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 975 A.2d 357. The Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ade\">Here, prior to his cell phone charge conviction, the appellant was serving time in custody for his 2002 convictions, not for the cell phone charge (or for possessing a cell phone in prison). If the appellant never had been charged with illegal possession of the cell phone, he nevertheless would have spent that entire seven months and 12 days in prison because of his 2002 convictions. (In fact, if he never had possessed the cell phone, he still would have spent that time in prison.) <em>Cf. Blankenship v. State, [supra, </em>135 Md.App. at 620, 763 A.2d 741] (holding that, when a defendant is held to answer for numerous charges, he is not entitled to have his jail time credit multiplied by being given credit on each sentence for the full time he spends in jail awaiting disposition on multiple charges of cases). Under the plain meaning of CP section 6-218(b)(l), the appellant was not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>to be credited for time served, because there was no time served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">The Court also rejected Lawson\u2019s alternative argument that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">even if he was not entitled to credit for time served under CP section 6-218(b)(l), the inclusion of the credit on his original commitment record shows that the sentencing judge exercised his discretion to grant him credit for time served, under CP section 6-218(b)(3); and, having exercised his discretion to grant the credit, or even if the commitment record was in error, the sentencing judge could not correct the sentence, after the appellant left the sentencing hearing, so as to increase the time the appellant would serve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 975 A.2d 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We concluded that the record was clear that credit for time served was not part of the plea agreement, nor part of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 975 A.2d 357. Citing C.P. \u00a7 6-218(e)(2), the Court explained: \u201cThere was no mention at the hearing of any credit for time served; and, if the court were granting such a credit, it would have been required to tell the appellant and state on the record \u2018the amount of the credit and the facts on which the credit is based.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court affirmed, noting that \u201ccorrecting the commitment record to remove the credit was not a modification of the sentence, and Rule 4-345 did not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 975 A.2d 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We must also consider <em>Blankenship, </em>135 Md.App. 615, 763 A.2d 741. Blankenship was charged with seven robberies and two attempted robberies. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 763 A.2d 741. For each of the nine offenses, he was sentenced to consecutive five year sentences, with all but two years of each sentence suspended. <em>Id. </em>Blankenship had spent 238 days in custody before the imposition of his sentences, and he received 238 days of credit towards one of his three sentences. <em>Id. </em>Blankenship filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, alleging that, \u201cpursuant to Md. Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a) (1999), the 238 days credit should have been subtracted from <em>each </em>offense for which he was convicted and sentenced and not just from one of them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original). After Blankenship\u2019s motion was denied, he appealed, arguing that the court \u201cerred in failing to give him credit for time spent in custody before the imposition of sentence for <em>each </em>of the offenses ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">After examining the legislative intent underlying Article 27, \u00a7 6380(a), the Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 618-19, 763 A.2d 741 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">If two defendants receive identical sentences for similar crimes, it is the self-evident purpose of Sect. 638C(a) that the indigent prisoner who could not make bail not serve more time (pre-sentence incarceration plus post-sentence incarceration) than the more affluent prisoner who did make bail (post-sentence incarceration only). It is, moreover, clear that the Legislature contemplated a practical one-day-for-one-day method of reckoning. If a defendant has suffered 85 days of pre-sentence incarceration, for instance, he will serve 85 fewer days of actual incarceration pursuant to his sentence or aggregate sentences of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\"><em>The State mil not be permitted to deny a defendant his credit for time served by applying it to one concurrent sentence but not to another. </em>It is more than a \u201cpaper\u201d credit. If the prisoner had been in jail for 85 days prior to being sentenced, he would be entitled to walk out of jail 85 days sooner, even on multiple concurrent sentences. <em>Nash v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 681, 691-93 [519 A.2d 769, <em>cert. denied, </em>309 Md. 326, 523 A.2d 1013] (1987). By the same token, the defendant is not entitled to double or triple or quadruple credit for time served in the case of consecutive sentences. The defendant is entitled to a single credit against the aggregate sentence, not to multiple credits against each and every constituent segment of that aggregate. The elemental equation is one actual day for one actual day, and the paper shuffling of multiple sentences will neither decrease it nor increase it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In the Court\u2019s view, Blankenship usurped the phrase \u201cas much credit as possible\u201d from <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 165, 482 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>A.2d 490, and used it out of context. <em>Blankenship, </em>135 Md.App. at 619, 763 A.2d 741. The Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzP\">On the facts of <em>Fleeger, </em>the problem was that of giving Fleeger \u201cas much credit as possible\u201d up to and hopefully including 100% credit for his pre-sentence incarceration actually served. What was before the Court in <em>Fleeger </em>did not in any way involve a claim of entitlement to 200% credit or 900% credit for the pre-sentence incarceration and the Court of Appeals was not even giving thought to such a nonexistent issue. The use of the phrase \u201cas much credit as possible\u201d by the Court of Appeals simply will not, therefore, carry the semantic weight urged by the appellant. The appellant here, of course, received 100% credit for the 238 days he served of pre-sentence incarceration. That is as much credit as the \u201cas much credit as possible\u201d language of <em>Fleeger </em>ever contemplated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Although the issue is one of first impression in Maryland, our resolution of it is in line with the undeviating resolution of the same issue by our sister states under virtually identical \u201ccredit for time served\u201d statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Court affirmed, holding that the trial court \u201cwas correct in awarding the appellant 238 days credit for pre-sentence incarceration on one of the nine consecutive sentences and in not awarding what would have been excessive duplicate credit on the other eight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 763 A.2d 741. Nevertheless, based on the language quoted above, <em>id. </em>at 618-19, 763 A.2d 741, the Court indicated that the outcome would have differed if Blankenship\u2019s sentences had been imposed concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\"><em>Nash, </em>69 Md.App. 681, 519 A.2d 769, is the only Maryland case that we have found that has directly addressed the issue of awarding credit for presentence confinement on multiple concurrent sentences arising from the same incident. Nash was convicted of two counts of child abuse and two counts of third degree sexual offense. <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 519 A.2d 769. One count of each offense involved a youngster named Paula, and one count of each offense involved her older sister, Michelle. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 519 A.2d 769. The charges were severed for trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 684 n. 1, 519 A.2d 769. In regard to the charges involving Paula, Nash received a nine year sentence. <em>Id. </em>The convictions involving Paula were subsequently affirmed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>In regard to the charges involving Michelle, Nash was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment for child abuse and a consecutive sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment for third degree sexual offense. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 519 A.2d 769. At sentencing, the court stated: \u201c T\u2019m going to sentence you to the Division of Corrections for two years consecutive to the first count so making a total of nine years beginning today. There will be jail credit applied to the previous case, but not to this one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 519 A.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On appeal, Nash claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court \u201cerred at sentencing in allowing the appellant credit only for time served while awaiting trial on the severed charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 519 A.2d 769. He argued that his second sentence of nine years should \u201cbe treated as concurrent with his first sentence of nine years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 519 A.2d 769. The Court determined: \u201cThe failure to specify whether a sentence imposed is to be served concurrently or consecutively requires that the sentences be treated as concurrent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 519 A.2d 769. Then, looking to Article 27, \u00a7 638C(a) and <em>Fleeger, </em>301 Md. at 160, 482 A.2d 490, the Court concluded that Nash\u2019s situation fell \u201cwithin the scope of the first sentence of subsection (a).\u201d <em>Nash, </em>69 Md.App. at 693, 519 A.2d 769.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that \u201cappellant was in custody before trial and was then convicted on the charge for which he was being held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, it held \u201cthat when imposing sentence, the court must give credit for all time spent in custody as a result of the charge for which the sentence is imposed rather than allow such credit to apply only to the sentence of a severed count in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it vacated the sentences and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Other jurisdictions support the view that credit for presentence confinement should be granted for all concurrent sentences arising from the same matter. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. State, </em>120 Nev. 296, 89 P.3d 669, 671 (2004) (stating that the \u201coverwhelming majority of states,\u201d when apportioning credit for time served in presentence confinement arising from one matter, adhere to the principle that credit is given once, but when concurrent sentences are imposed, credit is effectively applied against each concurrent sentence, because the longest term of a concurrent sentence determines the time in jail); <em>Schubert v. People, </em>698 P.2d 788, 795 (Colo.1985) (\u201cIn the case of concurrent sentences, the period of presentence confinement should be credited against each sentence.

The credit applied once, in effect, is applied against each concurrent sentence. This is done because the longest term of the concurrent sentences determines the total length of the imprisonment.

Regan, </em>[176 Colo. 59, 489 P.2d 194 (1971) ], does not require that credit be afforded for the time spent by the defendant in jail before sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">As we have said, in this case, at the initial sentencing on July 26, 2007, the court imposed concurrent terms of confinement. Therefore, until the retaliation sentence was vacated, appellant was serving time on that sentence. Moreover, the court initially dated both sentences from appellant\u2019s arrest on February 17, 2006. Because the court imposed concurrent sentences, and dated both from appellant\u2019s arrest, the pretrial credit necessarily applied to <em>both </em>the assault and retaliation sentences. To be sure, one of appellant\u2019s concurrent sentences was subsequently vacated and, on remand, it was changed, in effect, to a consecutive sentence. But, as we construe the statutes, the court could not retroactively take away the time that appellant had already served before the retaliation sentence was vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>With respect to the retaliation sentence, appellant served 1,230 days prior to July 2, 2009, and is entitled to a credit for that time against the five-year consecutive sentence imposed on remand. Those days are not \u201cdead time,\u201d because the time was credited towards appellant\u2019s assault charge, separate and apart from whether it should also be allocated to the retaliation sentence. Neither is it \u201cbanked\u201d time, because it is not a \u201creserve of time.\u201d In imposing the sentence for retaliation, the court originally sentenced appellant to a concurrent term and expressly credited his pretrial detention to both the assault and retaliation sentences. And, on resentencing, appellant was not sentenced for a new offense. Rather, it was the same offense. Section 6-218(c) emphasizes crediting a defendant for \u201call time spent in custody under the prior sentence.\u201d In the instant case, because the retaliation sentence was \u201cset aside,\u201d the second sentence is not governed solely by C.P. \u00a7 6-218(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Alternatively, C.P. \u00a7 6-218 is ambiguous in the context of this case, because there is more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>Stoddard, supra, </em>395 Md. at 662, 911 A.2d 1245. Parts of both C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) and (d) seem to apply here, while other portions of each seem inapplicable. For example, it would seem that (c) applies because we have a resentencing. <em>Wilson v. Simms, </em>157 Md.App. at 95, 849 A.2d 88, suggests that C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) applies when the same transaction is involved. Here, appellant was \u201cresentenced for the same crime ... based on the same transaction.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c). However, the subsection also seems to envision a scenario where there is only one \u201cprior sentence.\u201d Conversely, C.P. \u00a7 6-218(d) applies when a defendant is serving multiple sentences for multiple offenses, whether imposed by one court or several courts, and only one is set aside. Arguably, (d) applies because only one of multiple sentences was set aside here. Interpreting C.P. \u00a7 6-218(e) to apply in this circumstance, where the Court remanded for resentencing, avoids violation of a basic principle of statutory construction: we endeavor to avoid a construction that renders a clause meaningless or surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We recognize that C.P. \u00a7 6-218 is more specific in detail than C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a). The provisions of C.J. \u00a7 12-702 generally address credit for time served on remand, while C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) and (d) refer, respectively, to the more specific situations of when credit should be awarded -with regard to a \u201creprosecut[ion] or resentenc[ing] ... based on the same transaction\u201d or when a defendant is \u201cserving multiple sentences, one of which is set aside.\u201d Under principles of statutory construction, a more specific statute controls if there is a conflict. <em>See Dixon, supra, </em>175 Md.App. at 421, 927 A.2d 445. But, we first attempt to harmonize the statutes, when possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">When we reconcile C.P. \u00a7 6-218 with C.J. \u00a7 12-702(a), it suggests to us that the General Assembly intended for a defendant to receive credit for the time served on a previous sentence that is later vacated. Here, the defendant was initially awarded credit from the date of his arrest, and his sentence for retaliation was initially concurrent. It follows that appellant was entitled to credit from February 17, 2006, through July 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Our analysis is also consistent with the rule of lenity, which applies in the event of ambiguity. <em>Nelson, supra, </em>187 Md. App. at 13, 975 A.2d 298. Under this principle, any ambiguity in the statutes is construed against the State. <em>Haskins, supra, </em>171 Md.App. at 193-94, 908 A.2d 750. In that event, C.P. \u00a7 6-218(c) would govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">As we have indicated, the judge initially imposed an enhanced sentence \u2014 the maximum sentence for witness retaliation that she believed was permitted by law (i.e., twenty years). On remand, that sentence was reduced to the applicable maximum of five years, with a start date of July 2, 2009. Although we discern no error in the court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence of five years for retaliation, under C.L. \u00a7 9-303(c)(l), we shall vacate the sentence and remand to the circuit court to award credit for the period that appellant served between February 17, 2006, and July 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">SENTENCE FOR RETALIATION VACATED.
