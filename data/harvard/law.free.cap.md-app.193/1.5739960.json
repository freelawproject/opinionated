Accordingly, we reverse, in part, and affirm, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">Strub filed a Complaint on behalf of her minor son, Sebashton Charles Nocar, in the circuit court alleging that C &amp; M\u2019s negligence caused the death of his father, Wayne Barry Nocar, II (Nocar) who suffered fatal injuries after he fell from the third floor of a row home while working as an HVAC subcontractor in a renovation of a Baltimore City row home.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Prior to trial, C&amp;M moved <em>in limine </em>to prevent Strub\u2019s expert witnesses from testifying that, in failing to cover the stairwell openings on the construction site, C&amp;M violated MOSHA and OSHA standards; thus, it breached a statutory duty owed to Nocar. Specifically, the parties disagreed as to whether C&amp;M owed a duty to Nocar when Nocar was an employee of Comfort Masters Cooling and Heating, Inc. (Comfort Masters). Appellant contended that C&amp;M was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>obligated to protect not only its own employees from the fall hazard created by the open stair ways, but also the employees of other subcontractors because it created the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Strub proffered that Brent Leisenring, an engineer and former MOSHA inspector, would testify that C&amp;M violated the statutes in failing to secure the openings on the construction site. Strub further explained, during the hearing on C &amp; M\u2019s motion, that following his testimony, Strub intended to request that the trial court instruct the jury \u201cthat the violation of MOSH standards is evidence of negligence.\u201d C&amp;M argued that this Court held, in <em>Murphy v. Stuart M. Smith, Inc., </em>53 Md.App. 640, 455 A.2d 69 (1983), that the statutes did not apply to this case, imposing a duty on C &amp; M to a person who was not one of its employees. The trial court permitted Leisenring to testify, but restricted his testimony, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">All Right. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to deal with this. I don\u2019t think you can properly use the MOSH [sic] expert to testify that \u2014 if he wants to testify on industry standards regarding the preparation of the job site as was done by the defendant, that\u2019s f\u00edne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">But if he\u2019s simply saying it violates MOSH [sic] standards, therefore there\u2019s a duty owed and there\u2019s negligence, I don\u2019t think he can do that based on what you gentlemen have told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The trial court then clarified its ruling, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">... if he\u2019s going to discuss industry standards, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to discuss, we\u2019ll allow him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">But I don\u2019t want him saying there\u2019s a legal duty owed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">He can say there was negligence based on industry standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">Counsel for Strub sought clarification of the court\u2019s ruling and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Counsel for Strub: So as I understand your ruling Ken Johnson is excluded but Brent Leisenring is allowed to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">The Court: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">Counsel for Strub: You\u2019re probably not going to want to hear this. And I think this will be legal argument actually now that I think about it. Because I do have an argument \u2014 well, Mr. Leisenring, the other expert, is only going to be permitted to testify to industry standards. He\u2019s not going to be allowed to talk about MOSH [sic] or OSHA, am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">The Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The case proceeded to trial during which the following evidence was presented. C&amp;M entered into an oral contract with Bayside Properties, Inc. (Bayside), the general contractor, to finish framing a row home on Fleet Street. Bayside began the renovation project, \u201cgutting\u201d the building and framing the first floor, leaving nothing but a \u201cshell.\u201d All that was in place at the time that C&amp;M began its work was the exterior walls and a roof. The first floor had a rectangular opening prior to C &amp; M\u2019s work, that was not guarded, for the steel staircase that was to be installed in the basement at a later date. C&amp;M agreed to frame the second and third floors of the building and to leave openings in the floors for staircases to be installed directly above the existing opening in the first floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Prior to Leisenring\u2019s testimony, C&amp;M moved to exclude him as a witness because, in light of the court\u2019s earlier ruling on its motion <em>in limine, </em>he was barred from testifying to OSHA and MOSHA standards and was limited to testifying to customary practices of the construction industry. C&amp;M argued that Leisenring never testified to the practices of the industry generally during discovery and, thus, his testimony should be excluded. The court explained that the basis of its earlier ruling limiting Leisenring\u2019s testimony was that it agreed with C&amp;M that the expert should not be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>testify that MOSHA or OSHA imposed a statutory duty on C &amp; M to cover the openings in the floors because duty is a legal question and not something to which an expert can testify. The parties again disputed the applicability of MOSHA and OSHA and the trial court denied C &amp; M\u2019s motion. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">The Court: But how can you \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know that OSHA and MOSH [sic] don\u2019t suggest grounds for arguing that there\u2019s a breech [sic]. They just don\u2019t establish to whom the duty is owed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">Counsel for Strub: That\u2019s why [Leisenring] should testify about OSHA and MOSH [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">The Court: He can\u2019t testify as to \u2014 see, you shouldn\u2019t be asking me these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">All right. Leave OSHA and MOSH [sic] out of this. If ... but I\u2019m going to let him testify to what he has to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgD\">And if you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">Counsel for C&amp;M: And it will be standard usual and customary practices?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">The Court: And if you \u2014 yeah, it will be practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">Leisenring testified that in the process of framing the house, C&amp;M created openings in the floors for staircases to be constructed at a later date. C &amp; M did not cover the openings, exposing workers to \u201cfall hazards greater than six feet, which violated the industry standards and was a cause of Wayne Nocar\u2019s death.\u201d Leisenring further testified that it was \u201cpredictable\u201d that other workers would be entering the premises after C&amp;M completed its assigned job of framing and that it is the general practice of the industry to cover and guard such holes to protect others from falling through the openings in the floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">Christopher Chavez, part owner of C &amp; M, testified that, at the end of their framing job on May 5, 2006, C&amp;M removed the ladders that they had constructed to access the floors of the building and left the openings exposed, expecting that Bayside\u2019s next sub-contractor would be the company installing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the stairs. He further testified that Bayside never asked C &amp; M to guard the openings to the stairwell for this job or any other jobs that C&amp;M had done for Bayside in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Three weeks later, on May 26, 2006, Comfort Masters sent three of its employees, Nocar, Joshua Tudor and Andrew Pfarr, to the building to install a heating and cooling system, despite the fact that the stairs had not yet been installed. The three worked for approximately three hours that morning before Nocar\u2019s fall. Throughout the morning, the three worked with only two step ladders, as they had left one behind at the shop. They planned to retrieve a third ladder from the shop on their lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Tudor testified that, in addition to forgetting a ladder, they had neglected to bring other materials necessary for the installation of a return on the third floor. He testified: \u201cWe had no collars to hook to it. So I told him, I say, Wayne, there\u2019s no sense of putting this return box up just so that we have to take it down in an hour____\u2019\u201d Nocar agreed and Tudor went down to the second floor to begin another project. Tudor testified that soon thereafter Nocar had yelled down to him while he was working on the second floor to bring his ladder up to the third floor. Tudor testified that he told Nocar that he would give him his ladder in a minute after he finished the task he was working on when Nocar \u201cleaned down in the hole ... and said \u2018Oh. You using it. Never mind.\u2019 \u201d Then, according to Tudor, Nocar said \u201cFuck it. I\u2019ll just climb the bitch.\u201d Three or four minutes later, Tudor heard a loud noise and heard Pfarr scream. He walked to the opening of the second floor stairwell and saw the step ladder \u201cdangling over the third floor\u201d and realized that Nocar had fallen from the third floor into the basement. Tudor testified that, based upon the conversation minutes before the fall, he believed that Nocar had pulled the ladder that had been nailed into the stairwell up to the third floor to use it to install the return box on the third floor. He surmised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">The ladder was leaning right where the return box was supposed to go. The ladder was too tall to stand up in the hallway like straight. And the hallway was too narrow for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>him to fit up there. So what he did is he leaned it across the hole up against the metal stud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">And the metal studs are not made for structural [sic]. So when he leaned on it, it bent and tipped the ladder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">During cross-examination, Tudor explained that he did not know for certain if Nocar fell as a result of positioning the ladder as he had described, but that he thought that he fell in that manner based on the circumstances and his knowledge of the task that Nocar was attempting to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Timothy Galarnyk, a forensic investigator, testified for the defense that industry practice and industry customs would not have required C &amp; M to cover or otherwise guard the stairwell openings. Rather, \u201c... when a contractor is finished with their portion of the work; in other words, framing contractor is finished with their portion of the work; they leave the job site and prepare it only for the next contractor, which in this case would have been the stairway contractor.\u201d He further testified that it was typical for framing contractors to leave stairwells open in order to move large pieces of plywood between floors. Galarnyk also testified that, based upon Tudor\u2019s testimony and his examination of the vertical sheet metal stud on the third floor that the ladder was hanging from after Nocar\u2019s fall, in order for a ladder to cause such damage to a stud \u201cit had to be loaded and twisted,\u201d <em>ie., </em>someone had to be standing on the ladder when it twisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, C&amp;M moved for judgment and argued that Nocar assumed the risk of injury and was contributorily negligent in utilizing the ladder improperly in close proximity to the stairwell opening to install the return box. The motion was denied and the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of C&amp;M, finding no primary negligence on its part. Thus, the jury did not reach the questions of assumption of the risk and contributory negligence. Strub filed a timely appeal and C &amp; M filed a timely cross-appeal. Additional facts shall be supplied <em>infra </em>as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Strub contends that the trial court erred in restricting Leisenring\u2019s testimony and prohibiting him from testifying regarding OSHA and MOSHA standards because, in doing so, the court implicitly made the legal determination that C&amp;M did not owe a duty of care to Nocar under either statute because Nocar was not a C &amp; M employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hall v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., </em>398 Md. 67, 82, 919 A.2d 1177 (2007); <em>Saxon Mortgage Servs. v. Harrison, </em>186 Md.App. 228, 252, 973 A.2d 841 (2009); <em>Brown v. Contemporary OB/GYN Assocs., </em>143 Md.App. 199, 252, 794 A.2d 669 (2002). The threshold issue for the court\u2019s ruling in this case was its legal determination that the statutes did not apply because there was no employer-employee relationship between Nocar and C&amp;M. The Court of Appeals has said that, \u201c[i]f \u2018the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a pure legal question, we generally review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.'\u201d Hall, </em>398 Md. at 82, 919 A.2d 1177 (quoting <em>Bern-Shaw Ltd. Partnership v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>377 Md. 277, 291, 833 A.2d 502 (2003)). Thus, we shall conduct a <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Act (MO-SHA), Md.Code (1991 Rep. Vol., 2006 Supp.), Labor &amp; Employment, L.E. \u00a7 5-101 <em>et seq., </em>is the State counterpart to the federal legislation embodied in the Occupation Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651, <em>et seq. </em>MOSHA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">\u00a7 5-104. General duties of employers and employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">(a) <em>Safe employment and places of employment. </em>\u2014 Each employer shall provide each employee of the employer with employment and a place of employment that are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">(1) safe and healthful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(2) free from each recognized hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Strub contends that, despite the plain language of the statute, C&amp;M, although not Nocar\u2019s employer, owed Nocar a duty of care pursuant to MOSHA. Thus, Strub further posits that the trial court erred in prohibiting Leisenring from testifying that the open holes in the floor violated MOSHA, under which it owed a duty of care to Nocar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The basis for this duty, according to Strub, is the \u201cmulti-employer\u201d doctrine. Strub cites <em>Universal Construction Company, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>182 F.3d 726, 730 (10th Cir.1999), in support of her contention. <em>Universal Construction </em>propounds the doctrine as follows, <em>id. </em>at 728:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">The multi-employer doctrine provides that an employer who controls or creates a worksite safety hazard may be liable under the Occupational Safety and Health Act even if the employees threatened by the hazard are solely employees of another employer. The doctrine has its genesis in the construction industry where numerous employers, often subcontractors, work in the same general area, and where hazards created by one employer often pose dangers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>employees of other employers. The Secretary has imposed liability under the doctrine since the 1970\u2019s and has steadfastly maintained the doctrine is supported by the language and spirit of the Act. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation has been accepted in one form or another in at least five circuits, and rejected outright in only one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Strub also cites a number of cases where federal courts have applied the doctrine to hold an employer liable for an OSHA violation, <em>ie., </em>the employer\u2019s citation has been upheld under the doctrine, although the violation was committed by another contractor or endangered the employees of another contractor. In <em>Universal Construction Company, </em>the Tenth Circuit affirmed a final order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission imposing a penalty against Universal, a general contractor, based upon the \u201cmulti-employer worksite doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. That court adopted the doctrine because Universal, as the general contractor, observed the OSHA violation and \u201chad plenary control and authority over the worksite and could itself correct a hazard created by any subcontractor....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Strub also cites <em>Beatty Equipment Leasing, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>577 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1978), where the Ninth Circuit upheld a citation issued to a \u201cmaterialman\u201d for a general contractor for failure to comply with scaffolding standards under OSHA. The court observed that, \u201cfor all relevant purposes, petitioner functioned as a subcontractor in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. It adopted the multiemployer worksite doctrine and upheld the citation issued to the subcontractor, even though the violation for which it was responsible only exposed employees of other subcontractors to the hazard because \u201c[i]t facilitates the broad remedial purpose of [OSHA] which Congress declared is \u2018to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions\u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 ... \u2018Congress clearly intended to require employers to eliminate all foreseeable and preventable hazards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>California Stevedore and Ballast Co. v. OSHRC, </em>517 F.2d 986, 988 (9th Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Finally, Strub cites <em>Solis v. Summit Contractors, Inc, </em>558 F.3d 815 (8th Cir.2009), and asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneously based upon the earlier decision by the Occupational Health and Safety Review Commission (OSHRC) in that case wherein the OSHRC vacated an OSHA citation against a general contractor for a hazard created by one of its subcontractors. Strub argues that the case was not yet decided when the trial in the instant case took place, but that, in light of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s recent holding, we should reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling. Initially, we observe that, although C&amp;M cited the case in its motion <em>in limine, </em>there is absolutely no indication in the record that the trial court relied upon <em>Solis </em>in making its determination. Notwithstanding that fact, we find <em>Solis </em>instructive as it chronicles the history and evolution of the multi-employer worksite doctrine and its adoption in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The Eighth Circuit explained that the multi-employer doctrine has its basis in the specific duty provided in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 subsection (a)(2) \u201cto comply with standards for the good of all employees on a multi-employer worksite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818. The court further delineated the evolution of the doctrine and the practice of citing employers for violations committed by other contractors or non-employees, noting that, \u201c[a]s part of OSHA\u2019s inception, Congress authorized the Secretary to adopt numerous preexisting federal standards, including those of the Construction Safety Act, as OSHA standards.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818. Thus, the Secretary of Labor promulgated a series of regulations pursuant to that authority and also enacted a Field Operations Manual, wherein it first established \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s multi-employer worksite policy, a policy that indicates which employers at a multi-employer construction site OSHA could cite for violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. The original multiemployer worksite exceptions were \u201cthe creating employer and the exposing employer citation polices, but not the controlling employer citation policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the OSHRC originally construed these policies very narrowly by citing employers for violations of others only when their own employees were exposed to the hazard, the court observed that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>by 1975, the Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit rejected the narrow interpretations, questioning whether an employer of a general contractor needed to be exposed to the violation in order to make a general contractor liable under OSHA. <em>Id. </em>at 820 (citing <em>Brennan v. OSHRC, </em>513 F.2d 1032, 1308 (2d Cir.1975); <em>Anning-Johnson Co. v. OSHRC, </em>516 F.2d 1081, 1091 n. 21 (7th Cir.1975)). Thus, \u201cOSHRC announced its revised position that a contractor who has either created a hazard or controls a hazardous condition has a duty under \u00a7 654(a)(2) to comply with OSHA standards even if the contractor\u2019s own employees are not exposed to the hazard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820-21 (citing <em>Grossman Steel &amp; Aluminum Corp., </em>4 BNA OSHC 1185, 1975-1976 CCH OSHD 20, 691 (O.S.H.R.C. May 12, 1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Ultimately, the <em>Solis </em>Court observed that in 1981 \u201cthe correcting employer citation policy was added\u201d and then, in 1994, \u201cthe multi-employer worksite was amended to add the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies.\u201d The current version of the OSHA citation manual contains \u201cthe same four citation policies \u2014 exposing employer, correcting employer, creating employer and controlling employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821. The <em>Solis </em>Court held that the controlling employer citation policy was not barred by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.12(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the court rejected Solis\u2019 argument that, as a general contractor, it could not be held liable for a subcontractor\u2019s OSHA violation simply because it controlled the work environment. <em>Id. </em>at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In light of the foregoing authorities, Strub posits that, because C&amp;M could have been cited as a creating employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>under the multi-employer worksite doctrine, Maryland should adopt the doctrine and hold that C&amp;M owed Nocar a duty of care under the statute. C&amp;M contends that, notwithstanding the authorities cited by Strub, the language in L.E. \u00a7 5-104 limits the duty to comply with MOSHA to the employer-employee relationship. L.E. \u00a7 5-104 provides in pertinent part, \u201c[e]ach employer shall provide each employee of the employer with employment and a place of employment ...\u201d that complies with MOSHA. Further, C&amp;M posits that \u201cthis precise issue\u201d was addressed in <em>Murphy v. Stuart M. Smith, Inc., </em>53 Md.App. 640, 455 A.2d 69 (1983). C&amp;M believes our decision in <em>Murphy </em>to be determinative of the issue before us. We agree, but not for the same reasons advanced by C &amp; M. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In <em>Murphy, </em>a route salesman for Tastykake, Inc. suffered injuries while loading his work van, in the dark, at a warehouse owned by the defendant and leased to Murphy\u2019s employer. Murphy claimed that he lost his footing and fell due to inadequate lighting at the facility. <em>Id. </em>Murphy sued the property owner based upon two alternate theories: (1) that the property owner retained control of the area in which he fell and owed him a duty as a business invitee and (2) that the property owner owed him a duty of care under MOSHA. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Murphy argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that, \u201cas a matter of law, any duties owed to [him] pursuant to [MOSHA], were not applicable in this case because [the property owner] was not Mr. Murphy\u2019s employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 455 A.2d 69. We acknowledged that Murphy cited \u201ca series of federal cases which have applied a duty under certain circumstances upon someone other than an employer to maintain safe premises for another\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those exceptions included (1) where the jurisdiction\u2019s OSHA statute specifically limited the duty to keeping the place of employment safe \u201cfor employees,\u201d (2) \u201cwhere the employer was, or could have been, found to have voluntarily assumed a duty to comply with OSHA regulations for the benefit of persons other than his own employees ...\u201d and (3) when \u201cowners or employers who have either actually created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>hazardous condition which violated specific OSHA regulations and to which its own and another\u2019s employees were exposed <em>... or </em>had actual and substantial physical control over the work area, and actual responsibility for the hazardous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643, 455 A.2d 69 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We also acknowledged that the Fifth Circuit \u201cflatly held that OSHA does <em>not </em>create a duty on behalf of an employer to any persons other than its own employees, regardless of any other factual circumstance presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644, 455 A.2d 69 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We declined to \u201cgo to the extreme of the fifth circuit\u201d because \u201cwe are a Court purposed to decide cases on the facts presented rather than proclaim in black letter the applicability of law for all purposes.\u201d We instead held, <em>id. </em>at 644, 455 A.2d 69:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">It will suffice that under the facts of this case the Maryland Act is clearly limited, placing the duty on the \u201cemployer\u201d for the benefit of \u201chis employees.\u201d Rules of construction are to be resorted to only when there is a doubt, ambiguity, or uncertainty, and they are never to be used to create doubt, only to remove it. <em>John McShain, Inc. v. State, </em>287 Md. 297, 301 [411 A.2d 1048] (1980). This is another case for applying the canon of construction of the wag whom Justice Frankfurter quoted as saying when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute. <em>Greenwood v. United States, 350 </em>U.S. 366, 374 [76 S.Ct. 410, 100 L.Ed. 412] (1956). In doing so we find that neither its statutory language nor legislative intent can be stretched beyond the fair implication of the statute\u2019s words or its purpose. <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335 [449 A.2d 1158] (1982). Because the issue had been injected into the case by [Murphy], the trial judge quite properly dispelled the jury\u2019s doubts by instructing that the statutory duty had no applicability in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">C&amp;M asserts that, \u201csince <em>Murphy, </em>two exceptions to this principle have been recognized in Maryland. But, neither exception is apposite here.\u201d C&amp;M points out that, in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Thompson, </em>57 Md.App. 642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>471 A.2d 768 (1984), we recognized the \u201cactual control exception\u201d and, in <em>Brady v. Ralph M. Parsons Co., </em>82 Md.App. 519, 572 A.2d 1115 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>327 Md. 275, 609 A.2d 297 (1992), we recognized the \u201cassumed duty\u201d exception to the general rule that employers are only liable to their own employees to provide a safe workplace under MOSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In <em>Thompson, </em>we affirmed a trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that \u201cB.G. &amp; E. was responsible for providing [Thompson] with a safe place of employment ...\u201d when Thompson was not an employee of B.G. <em>&amp; </em>E. 57 Md.App. at 645, 471 A.2d 768. Thompson, an employee hired by Insul-Temp/Airco, Inc., was performing a job for B.G. &amp; E. and, while climbing scaffolding erected by B.G. &amp; E., fell to the floor and suffered permanent injuries. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Thompson. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, B.G. &amp; E. argued that it did not owe a duty to provide a safe workplace under MOSHA or OSHA, relying on <em>Murphy, supra. </em>Thus, it maintained that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that, \u201cif they found that [B.G. &amp; E.] and its employees failed to provide safe access to the scaffolding, they could consider such failure evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 471 A.2d 768. We rejected B. G. &amp; E\u2019s contention and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">In <em>Murphy, </em>however, we pointed out circumstances wherein the duty of the employer may be owed to someone other than its own employee. One of those circumstances was where employers have \u201cactually created a hazardous condition which violated specific OSHA regulations and to which its own and another\u2019s employees were exposed, ... or had actual and substantial physical control over the work area, and actual responsibility for the hazardous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643, 455 A.2d 69.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Implicitly, we acknowledged that exception in <em>Murphy </em>although it was not factually relevant there. It is, of course, quite relevant here because B.G. <em>&amp; </em>E. admits that it erected and constructed the hazardous condition and retained actual control over the work area to which it had assigned Thompson. If there were any question in <em>Murphy </em>whether that circumstance applied to an employer\u2019s duty in Maryland, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>here lay to rest such doubt, at least as it applies to subcontractors assigned to such employers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 651-52, 471 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Six years later, in <em>Brady, </em>we recognized another circumstance where an employer may owe a duty to a non-employee to comply with MOSHA. 82 Md.App. at 527, 572 A.2d 1115. Brady, a sheet metal worker, died after falling from scaffolding erected during the construction of the Cold Spring Lane Station of the Baltimore Region Rapid Transit System. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 572 A.2d 1115. The Mass Transit Administration (MTA) entered into three contracts as part of the construction project, one with a construction company to serve as the general contractor, one with another company to administer a safety program for the site and a third with Parsons to provide \u201cinspection and safety services for MTA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The general contractor, in turn, subcontracted a portion of the construction work to Brady\u2019s employer. <em>Id. </em>Brady\u2019s survivors sued Parsons for \u201cnegligent performance of its contractual safety responsibilities at the construction site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 572 A.2d 1115. Initially, summary judgment was granted in favor of Parsons. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case and, on remand, the jury found Parsons negligent and also found that Brady was contributorily negligent and had assumed the risk. <em>Id. </em>at 523-24, 572 A.2d 1115. Brady\u2019s survivors appealed again, asserting that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk and argued that Parsons owed a nondelegable duty to comply with safety regulations and that the duty was absolute. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 572 A.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We agreed with Brady\u2019s contention, in part, because we determined that Parsons\u2019 duty to Brady arose as a result of his contract with MTA, but we declined to hold that the duty was absolute and that the defenses did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 572 A.2d 1115. Again citing <em>Murphy, </em>we explained that, \u201cgenerally, the duty created by MOSHA runs from the employer to its own employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 572 A.2d 1115 (citing <em>Murphy, </em>53 Md.App. at 643, 455 A.2d 69). But, we pointed out that, in <em>Murphy, </em>we had previously acknowledged that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>employer may in some circumstances owe a duty to someone other than its own employees. \u201cOne of these circumstances is where the employer \u2018voluntarily assumed a duty to comply with OSHA regulations for the benefit of persons other than his own employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Murphy, </em>53 Md.App. at 643, 455 A.2d 69).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We held that the \u201cassumed duty\u201d exception was relevant in <em>Brady </em>\u201csince Parsons assumed the responsibility for safety on the construction site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Moreover, although we have not expressly adopted the \u201cassumed duty exception,\u201d Maryland appellate courts have utilized the policy behind it as a basis for imposing liability: that is, where a duty of due care has been assumed by contract or conduct, a worker not in privity is protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE\"><em>Id. </em>at 528, 572 A.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In holding that Parsons owed a duty to Brady, we did not establish a statutory duty under MOSHA, but instead applied existing case law to reinforce \u201cthe policy of holding those liable who have assumed a duty of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 572 A.2d 1115. Noting that \u201c[t]his is particularly true where, as here, there is a multi-employer worksite where employees of a number of contractors are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, we adopted the assumed duty exception. We explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">In light of the policy set forth in <em>Krieger [v. J.E. Greiner Co., </em>282 Md. 50, 382 A.2d 1069 (1978) ] and <em>Cutlip [v. Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>22 Md.App. 673, 325 A.2d 432 (1974)], we conclude that one who assumes the contractual obligation to supervise and enforce safety on a multi-employer worksite owes a duty of reasonable care to a worker even though he or she has no contractual privity. Since the \u201cassumed duty exception\u201d encompasses this conclusion, we hereby adopt that exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">In adopting the assumed duty exception, we rejected Brady\u2019s argument that, \u201csince OSHA and MOSHA were designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>to protect workers from injury and to ensure a workplace free from recognized hazards, it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the statutes to allow the interposition of [contributory negligence and assumption of the risk].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 572 A.2d 1115. <em>See Brady v. Ralph M. Parsons Co., </em>327 Md. at 294-95, 609 A.2d 297 (affirming our holding). We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">MOSHA was not enacted to create an action for damages in favor of an employee. This is manifest from the preventive and noncompensatory nature of MOSHA. The Act is designed not to punish but, rather, to achieve compliance with safety standards and the abatement of hazards. Under the Act, no remedy is provided to the employee. Instead, a penalty is imposed on the employer who has been cited for an unsafe condition. In fact, the statute may be violated even though no accident or injury occurs. To this end, we have held that the assumption of risk and contributory negligence defenses will not exculpate an employer who is charged with a violation under MOSHA. <em>Mardo Homes, Inc. v. Commissioner of Labor and Industry, </em>35 Md.App. 260, 267, 370 A.2d 144 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\"><em>Mardo Homes, </em>however, does not apply in tort actions since it is only controlling to the extent that an employer, who has been cited with a violation under MOSHA, may not assert these defenses. A citation for a safety violation is entirely distinct from the type of claim at issue here, namely, a civil cause of action for damages in a personal injury action against a third party who is not the decedent\u2019s employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 533-34, 572 A.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Both parties agree that the assumed duty exception does not apply in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Strub, however, argues that the \u201ccreating employer\u201d exception was recognized in <em>Murphy </em>and that it applies in this case while C &amp; M\u2019s rejoinder is that the exception first recognized in <em>Murphy </em>and later adopted in <em>Thompson </em>is limited to circumstances where the employer not only creates the hazardous condition that violates OSHA or MOSHA, but also exercises actual control over the work area and the job being performed. We agree with Strub.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In <em>Murphy, </em>we acknowledged that an employer may owe a duty to a non-employee to maintain a safe workplace under OSHA. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">The third and final circumstance relates to owners or employers who have either actually created a hazardous condition which violated specific OSHA regulations and to which its own and another\u2019s employees were exposed, <em>Wendland v. Ridgefield Const. Services, Inc., </em>[184 Conn. 173] 439 A.2d 954 (Conn.1981), <em>or </em>had actual and substantial physical control over the work area, and actual responsibility for the hazardous condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Murphy, </em>53 Md.App. at 643, 455 A.2d 69 (emphasis added). Although not factually relevant to our holding in <em>Murphy, </em>when faced with the relevant factual scenario in <em>Thompson, </em>we did not hesitate to adopt the exception where the \u201c \u2018employer had actual and substantial physical control over the work area, and actual responsibility for the hazardous condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson, </em>57 Md.App. at 651, 471 A.2d 768 (quoting <em>Murphy, </em>53 Md.App. at 643, 455 A.2d 69). C&amp;M urges that the exception originally recognized in <em>Murphy </em>and adopted in <em>Thompson </em>does not apply to these facts because C &amp; M did not retain control over the work area, nor did it control Nocar\u2019s work assignments. While we agree that C &amp; M did not exercise control in this instance, it was undisputed that C &amp; M did <em>create </em>the hazard when it framed the second and third floors of the row home and left the stairwell openings uncovered and exposed its own employees to the hazard. Liability under these circumstances was recognized in both <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>but in <em>Thompson, </em>it was the control aspect of the exception that applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In both <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>we previously acknowledged that there are two alternative ways that an employer can be liable to someone other than its own employees under MOSHA, <em>i.e. </em>(1) by creating a hazardous condition in violation of OSHA regulations \u201cto which its own and another\u2019s employees were exposed\u201d <em>or </em>(2) by exercising \u201csubstantial physical control over the work area, and actual responsibility for the hazardous condition.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>57 Md.App. at 651, 471 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>A.2d 768. Having previously recognized this \u201ccreating employer\u201d exception, we hereby adopt it as it is clearly applicable to the case at hand. Accordingly, we need not decide whether all four of the categories of the multi-employer worksite doctrine cited by Strub apply in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The circuit court erred in precluding all testimony regarding OSHA or MOSHA because C &amp; M, as an employer that created the openings in the stairwells, exposed its own employees to the hazard and left them unguarded, in violation of MOSHA, could be liable under MOSHA for its violation and, thus, owed Strub a duty to maintain a safe workplace, as explained <em>supra. </em>We pause, however, to point out that the trial court did not err in ruling that Strub\u2019s expert witness could not testify to the existence of a legal duty. As C &amp; M aptly points out, \u201cthe existence of a legal duty is a question of law, to be decided by the court.\u201d <em>Doe v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Inc., </em>388 Md. 407, 414, 879 A.2d 1088 (2005) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, Leisenring should not have been totally barred from testifying about MOSHA requirements and whether the conditions of the construction site would have constituted a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Finally, we must reiterate that, in holding that C&amp;M, as the creating employer, who also exposed its own employees to the hazard, owed a duty to Nocar to comply with MOSHA, we do not hold that a violation of MOSHA automatically gives rise to a tort duty. \u201cMOSHA was not enacted to create an action for damages ... the Act is designed not to punish ... no remedy is provided to the employee.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>82 Md.App. at 533, 572 A.2d 1115.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Because the trial court erred in precluding all testimony regarding MOSHA and OSHA, we are constrained to turn to C &amp; M\u2019s alternative argument in its cross-appeal for the purposes of remand. C&amp;M contends that the circuit court erred in denying its motion for judgment at the conclusion of the case because Nocar assumed the risk and/or was contributorily negligent. Under either theory, C&amp;M asserts that Strub should have been barred from recovery as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment at the conclusion of the evidence <em>de novo.\u201d Wilkens Square, LLLP v.

CSX Transp., Inc., </em>126 Md.App. 25, 37, 727 A.2d 396 (1999). Thus, we must determine whether the evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to Strub, compels a finding that Nocar assumed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>risk and/or was contributorily negligent. If reasonable minds could differ, we must affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to submit the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">At the conclusion of Strub\u2019s case, C&amp;M moved for judgment and argued that Strub failed to put on any evidence that Nocar fell through the holes created by C &amp; M. At that juncture, the court expressed concern that Strub had failed to present any direct evidence regarding how Nocar fell. Specifically, the court observed that Strub did not present any fact witnesses and only presented expert testimony based on their observations of pictures and other evidence. The court pointed out that Strub offered no evidence or theory as to what Nocar was doing when he fell or how he may have fallen, only that he died as a result of falling approximately twenty-six feet from the third floor of the building. At the conclusion of all of the evidence, C&amp;M again moved for judgment arguing that Nocar assumed the risk of falling into the opening by \u201cvoluntarily working in close proximity to it.\u201d In addition, C &amp; M argued that Nocar was contributorily negligent in pulling the ladder through the opening in the floor, which Leisenring testified was a violation of safety standards, and in placing the rung of the ladder against the stud, as Tudor and Galarnyk testified, which also violated safety standards. Further, C &amp; M argued that Nocar was obligated to utilize a safety belt in using the ladder as a work station and failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Opposing C &amp; M\u2019s motion, Strub argued that assumption of the risk is a jury question in nearly every case, that there was not sufficient evidence that Nocar was trained in the applicable safety standards and that C &amp; M\u2019s theory, based upon Tudor\u2019s testimony, that Nocar had pulled the ladder up to the third floor to install a return box was simply speculation. Strub based this conclusion on the fact that Nocar did not take the return box with him on the ladder and that he was not holding a screw driver when he fell and he had specifically been instructed to wait until after lunch to install the return box. Thus, counsel for Strub argued, \u201c... for all we know, he pulled the ladder up, saw that the ladder wouldn\u2019t fit within the eight-foot ceilings and left it there and started working on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>something else and for a different reason that\u2019s not negligent fell through the hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The court denied the motion, referring to its earlier pronouncement that it preferred not to take a case from a jury, even when it is weak, noting that \u201cthis is very problematic in my humble opinion____\u201d C&amp;M seizes upon the trial court\u2019s obvious reservations and now argues that there was insufficient evidence to generate a jury question as to either defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Assumption of the Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">We have iterated that, \u201c[although the question of whether the plaintiff assumed the risk is normally for the jury, if it is clear that an individual of normal intelligence, in the plaintiffs position, must have understood the danger, then the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Saponari, </em>126 Md.App. at 32, 727 A.2d 396 (citing <em>Baltimore Gas and Elec.

Assumption of the risk is a defense that completely bars any recovery by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals has penned, <em>id.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">[i]n Maryland, there are three requirements that the defendant must prove to establish the defense of assumption of the risk: (1) the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk of danger; (2) the plaintiff appreciated that risk; and (3) the plaintiff voluntarily confronted the risk of danger. <em>ADM Partnership, </em>348 Md. at 90-91, 702 A.2d at 734.

Thus, C&amp;M urges us to hold that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Nocar voluntarily assumed the risk of falling through the opening simply by working \u201cin and around these openings for approximately 3 to 3 &amp; hours, using 10 [foot] long wooden ladders to climb through them, carrying tools and ductwork back and forth between the first, second and third floors without protest.\u201d C&amp;M cites <em>ADM P\u2019ship v. Martin, </em>348 Md. 84, 702 A.2d 730 (1997), for the proposition that the fact that Nocar was performing the work on the third floor as part of his job duties does not negate the voluntariness of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">While we agree that there was no evidence presented that Nocar protested to working in and around the openings, we decline to hold that the court erred in submitting the issue to the jury because there was no direct evidence offered by either party of what Nocar was doing when he fell. C&amp;M offered a theory that he positioned the ten-foot ladder at an angle in order to accommodate the eight-foot ceiling on the third floor to install a return box that he had previously stated that he intended to do. While plausible, as Strub pointed out before the trial court, Tudor could only testify to what he <em>thought </em>Strub may have done based upon their earlier conversation. However, an inference can also be drawn from the facts, as Strub argued, that Nocar obeyed Tudor\u2019s instructions and did not attempt to install the return box, based upon the fact that the return box was found on the floor in the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">C&amp;M urges us to follow <em>Casper v. Smith &amp; Son Inc., </em>71 Md.App. 445, 526 A.2d 87 (1987), where we held that two young children assumed the risk of the serious brain injuries sustained by walking over a frozen body of water and falling through. <em>Id. </em>449-50, 526 A.2d 87. C&amp;M analogizes this case to <em>Casper </em>because, in this case, as in <em>Casper, </em>there is no evidence of exactly how the accident happened. We opined in <em>Casper, id. </em>at 475, 526 A.2d 87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">While no one will ever know how the accident happened, there is no evidence or even suggestion that they arrived in the water in any other way except by their own actions ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>If they jumped, ran, walked, or crawled onto the ice or even if they leaned over too far into the water from the bank, through their own volition they positioned themselves hazardously close to the open and obvious danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We discern important factual distinctions between this case and <em>Casper. </em>In traversing a frozen body of water, the children took some action and in doing so, voluntarily assumed a risk of injury. While we did not know precisely what that action was, we knew that the children somehow positioned themselves on the ice in order for the ice to break and for them to fall through. C&amp;M presents this court with no authority for the proposition that, by virtue of working in a building with a twenty-six foot deep opening, Nocar assumed the risk of falling through. C&amp;M theorizes that the evidence makes clear that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">[wjithin minutes of when the accident occurred, Nocar had \u2018stuck his head\u2019 far enough down the same third-floor stairwell opening into which he would soon fall, that he made eye contact with Tudor ... He asked Tudor to hand him up a step ladder. When he realized that Tudor was still using it, he said \u2018F* * *it, I\u2019ll climb the B* * *.\u2019 He removed the nail that had been holding the 10' ladder in place in the stairwell opening, and pulled the ladder up to the third floor, placing it at an angle with its feet on an outside wall ledge and its top rung against an interior metal stud, so that it spanned over the center of the stairwell opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Nocar\u2019s purpose in positioning the ladder there was to install a return box in the third floor hallway ceiling\u2019s ductwork, immediately adjacent to the stairwell opening. The evidence before the jury was that Nocar was on the ladder when it bent the metal stud, causing the ladder to twist. Whether that happened when he was just stepping onto it or from it or as he was climbing up or down, it is, unknown, but irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Whether Nocar actually climbed the ladder across to the opening, or whether he obeyed the instruction of his superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>to wait until after lunch to install the return and fell for some other reason was for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\n<em>Contributory Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Alternatively, C&amp;M asserts that it was entitled to judgment in its favor because Nocar was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Like assumption of the risk, \u201c[generally, the issue of contributory negligence is for the jury as long as \u2018there is a conflict of evidence as to material facts relied on to establish contributory negligence, or more than one inference may be reasonably drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saponari, </em>126 Md.App. at 87, 727 A.2d 396 (quoting <em>Flippo, </em>348 Md. at 703, 705 A.2d 1144). C&amp;M cites the same conduct that it alleges constitutes assumption of the risk to support his claim of contributory negligence. We have explicated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">... \u201cin order to establish contributory negligence as a matter of law, \u2018the evidence must show some prominent and decisive act which directly contributed to the accident and which was of such a character as to leave no room for difference of opinion thereon by reasonable minds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reiser [v. Abramson </em>], 264 Md. [372] at 378 [286 A.2d 91 (1972) ]). We also must \u201cgive due consideration not only to all inferences of fact tending to support the opposite view, but also to the important presumption that [the decedent] exercised ordinary care for [her] own safety.\u201d <em>Pachmayr v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., </em>157 Md. 256, 262, 145 A. 611 (1929) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">C&amp;M argues that the presumption that Nocar exercised due care has been rebutted by \u201cproof to the contrary,\u201d citing <em>Bratton v. Smith, </em>256 Md. 695, 703-04, 261 A.2d 777 (1970). We decline to hold that the presumption has been rebutted for the same reason that we find that the issue of assumption of the risk was properly submitted to the jury. It was for the jury to decide whether Nocar in fact brought the ladder up to the third floor and climbed it, as argued by C &amp; M. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of appellees\u2019 motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED, IN PART, AND REVERSED, IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID FIFTY PERCENT (50%) BY APPELLANT/CROSS-APPELLEE AND FIFTY PERCENT (50%) BY APPELLEE/CROSS-APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-16\">.
