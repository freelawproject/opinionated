The court sentenced him to a term of sixty days incarceration for failure to obey a lawful order, and to a consecutive one year term of incarceration for resisting arrest. Appellant presents two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">I. Did the court err in failing to instruct the jury, upon request, that a person is privileged to resist an unlawful arrest and that if they found that Mr. Arthur was unlawfully arrested they should acquit him of the crime of resisting arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">II. Is the evidence sufficient to sustain Mr. Arthur\u2019s convictions for failure to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">Frederick Police Corporal Eric Stanley testified that on the night of July 4, 2007, he was working as a Patrol Officer in Frederick when he came upon Andre Arthur, whom he identified at trial as appellant. He recounted that 10 or 15 minutes before midnight, he was driving his patrol vehicle very slowly northbound on Market Street approaching Third Street. He observed a group of three people in the 300 block of Market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Street, very close to the intersection, walking northbound. There was no one else in the vicinity. He noticed that appellant reached down and picked up a newspaper left on the sidewalk next to a small tree. Corporal Stanley continued driving northbound and as he passed the threesome, he noticed that appellant had the paper in his hand. As soon as he drove past appellant, he heard \u201cthe thump of an item hitting my patrol vehicle.\u201d When Corporal Stanley heard the thump he looked in his side view mirror and noticed that appellant was no longer holding the newspaper. Believing that appellant had thrown the newspaper at his vehicle, he exited his police vehicle and said, \u201cHey, let me talk to you.\u201d Appellant responded by yelling obscenities at the officer and \u201cspecifically said [\u2018]you get the fuck away from me, leave me the fuck alone,[\u2019] ah, these types of things.\u201d Corporal Stanley told appellant to settle down and that he needed to talk to him, and asked appellant what was going on. Appellant continued his \u201cverbal onslaught.\u201d At that point, they had neared the Old Town Tavern entrance. There were several people standing outside the tavern, \u201cjust patrons in and out,\u201d looking toward them. Corporal Stanley explained that while it was \u201cnot uncommon for people to look at the police,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s also not uncommon for them to go about their, their own business as soon as they, you know, they\u2019re not the subject of what it is that we\u2019re, we\u2019re trying to do \u2014 \u201d The patrons of Old Town Tavern, however, kept watching him and appellant. As appellant continued his obscenities, \u201cpeople began to look my way and it was at that time I told him to lower his voice, to settle down, and he continued to refuse. He was trying to leave from me and I told him that he was under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As he told appellant that he was under arrest, Corporal Stanley placed his hands on appellant\u2019s shirt. Appellant \u201ccontinued to try to pull from me in, in a yanking, jerking motion. Standing there and trying to, to hold onto him and I called for another police officer to back me up to affect [sic] the arrest. He continued to try to pull away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Officer Wharton arrived in response to Corporal Stanley\u2019s call, and the two officers tried to handcuff appellant. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tried to take him \u201cto the ground.\u201d On the ground, appellant continued to kick and pull. Officer Cirko arrived and assisted with the arrest. Corporal Stanley suffered a sprained ankle during the struggle with appellant. Corporal Stanley allowed the other officers to handcuff appellant, and they took appellant into custody. Corporal Stanley went to the hospital because of his ankle injury, so Officer Cirko completed the paperwork on the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Corporal Stanley testified that he was not angry that someone threw a newspaper at his cruiser, but that he found it dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On redirect, the officer reiterated what happened when he approached appellant: \u201cHe became disorderly, yelling, you know, drawing the attention of the people in front of the bar, screaming obscenities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">As noted, Frederick Police Officers Cirko and Wharton responded to Corporal Stanley\u2019s call for assistance. Officer Wharton testified that when he arrived, he saw Corporal Stanley struggling with appellant. It looked to him as though Corporal Stanley was trying to get appellant\u2019s arm behind his back, and Corporal Stanley was being pushed up against the wall. There was \u201ca crowd that was getting closer and closer.\u201d Officer Wharton related that \u201c[o]ne of the guys from the crowd was, ah, was yelling at both, both of \u2018em. I, I think he was trying to break it up, but I wasn\u2019t sure, but the first thing I did was try to get him to step back so I, so he didn\u2019t jump in or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Officer Cirko testified that when he arrived, Corporal Stanley and Officer Wharton \u201cwere actively on the ground with Mr. Arthur in a scuffle.\u201d Officer Cirko noticed that Officer Wharton had one of appellant\u2019s hands handcuffed and that Corporal Stanley was holding appellant down. Officer Cirko grabbed appellant\u2019s other hand and he and Officer Wharton were able to get appellant handcuffed. Officer Cirko said that appellant was taken to the hospital complaining of injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Danielle Nicole Brigham, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, testified for the defense. She reported that she was with appellant at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>approximately midnight on July 4, 2007. She testified to a different version of what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">We were walking coming from Baker Park and I had stopped to talk to my friend, who I\u2019d seen on the street, on Market because there was a bunch of people on Market street. I had stopped to say hi. As I was going forward, um, I turned around and there was a cop that was approaching Andre and he had asked him to put his hands behind his back and I, Andre had asked, you know, why, why am I getting arrested? Why am I getting arrested? And I had also asked too and he just told him to put his hands behind his back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">And then he had asked him to put his hands behind his back. He did so. He, I don\u2019t want to say forcefully, but had put him on the ground and had put him eventually in the back of the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On cross-examination, Brigham reported that she had \u201cjust seen a cop car stop and I had seen that, you know, the cop was approaching him.\u201d She affirmed that appellant was taken to the hospital that night. She assumed that it was for injuries he sustained during the arrest because he did not have any injuries before that.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel also called Dasean Arthur, appellant\u2019s brother, to the stand. He testified that they were coming from the fireworks display at Baker\u2019s Park and were walking to a convenience store. He reported that he was about \u201ctwo car lengths\u201d from appellant and Brigham. As he was going into the store, he turned around to see if appellant wanted anything from the store and saw the police officer approach. The officer was putting the handcuffs on appellant, and appellant was asking why he was getting arrested. At that point, Corporal Stanley \u201cgrabbed him and just threw him to the ground for no reason like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Appellant also testified as to his version of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">Well, around, I would say around 10:00 in the evening, fireworks just displayed, me and my girlfriend and my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>brother, we were walking from the, from Baker Park. We were actually walking up to Market Street. While we\u2019re walking up Market Street I\u2019m being approached by a police officer and while I\u2019m approached by him he\u2019s telling me, you know, place your hands behind your back. I automatically asked him, this is before, you know, he tried to arrest me, I automatically asked him was I, am I under arrest. He said no. So I continued to walk. I walked ahead. I was yelling to my brother telling him, you know, the officer, he\u2019s you know, he\u2019s harassing me right now. That\u2019s how I took it. Like he was actually trying to get, not harassing me, I not gonna say harassing me, but you know, he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u2014was asking me questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Appellant further testified that he picked up the newspaper and threw it across the street, but not at or on the officer\u2019s car, and he did not hit any vehicle with it. When the officer saw appellant throw the paper across the street, he \u201cjumped out his car,\u201d and appellant got defensive. Appellant averred that the officer never said he wanted to detain him and just told him to place his hands behind his back, and the officer tried to arrest him but did not tell him why. Appellant asked whether he was under arrest, and the officer said, \u201cno,\u201d so appellant continued to walk. Then, the officer grabbed him by the shirt and \u201cslammed\u201d him up against the wall. Appellant testified that he told the officer that he did not need to be so aggressive and put one of his hands behind his back, at which point the officer brought him to the ground by \u201csweeping\u201d one of his legs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">I fell down onto my shoulder. After I fall down onto my shoulder another officer comes and he\u2019s trying to handcuff my other hand. He takes my other hand, places it behind my back and he, he smashes my finger. I got, I got a cut. Actually I got on my hand also from the handcuff because he jerked the handcuff and smashed it onto my finger instead of on my wrist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Appellant denied using profanity or cursing, but said he did curse when he was on the ground. Appellant further testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>that he had an injury underneath his arm, a knee injury from one of the officers, a pinched nerve in his neck from one of the officers placing his knee into appellant\u2019s neck, shoulder injuries and four or five cuts. He claimed that one of the officers hit him with a baton four or five times. He denied resisting arrest and denied that the officer ever told him why he was under arrest, or why he was being detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On cross-examination, appellant repeated that he threw the newspaper across the street right in front of the police car. He maintained that he was \u201cactually throwing it to one of my buddies \u2018cause it was thrown over to me and we was just like playing catch.\u201d He continued, saying that he was throwing it to a friend who lived \u201cdirectly across the street\u201d and was \u201cstanding right in front of his building\u201d and that the newspaper belonged to his friend. Appellant explained that he had been drinking \u201ca little bit.\u201d Appellant also said that Corporal Stanley\u2019s vehicle was stopped at the light and he did not know it was a police car. He said that as soon as the light turned green, Corporal Stanley pulled up and approached him. He conceded that he had an idea why the officer might want to talk to him, but he thought that because the officer said he was not under arrest, he did not have to talk to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the State failed to show that appellant failed to obey a lawful order, and since he was not disregarding a lawful order there was no right to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Additional facts will be set forth, as needed, in our resolution of the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">I. \u2014 Instruction On Right To Resist Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">When the trial court discussed the proposed jury instructions, appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the use of the pattern instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Inaudible \u2014 one word) Your Honor that I, (inaudible \u2014 one word) I had a (inaudible \u2014 one word). If you determine the Defendant was not lawfully arrested and no arrest warrant was used then the Defendant had the right to resist arrest and that\u2019s pursuant to case law. Resisting unlawful arrest is not a crime in Maryland. If an arrest is illegal the arrestee may use any reasonable means to, even for to affect [sic] his escape. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s Maryland case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">THE COURT: The problem that you get into in this case is there\u2019s, I don\u2019t really want to have a sub-litigation issue about whether his arrest, because there, there could be four or five different things that he could have been arrested for according to the police officers. According to him, nothing. I\u2019m gonna give the Pattern and no embellishment to\u2014 \u2014it in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not asking for embellishment. I would object to just a Pattern. I\u2019m just stating that under Maryland law it is illegal [sic] to resist an illegal arrest. If the jury concludes that any of the four theories that he was legally arrested then he has no defense. But if the jury concludes that there wasn\u2019t no \u2014 a, a legal arrest, under Maryland law he has the right to resist and we have generated that instruction. I would just simply ask that that instruction be added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">THE COURT: How do you believe that you, you have generated that instruction? From the Defendant\u2019s initial, own testimony, best case he was littering. Second, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>acting, I, I mean, looking at it objectively the Defendant\u2019s own conduct constituted a particular offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The trial court refused to give appellant\u2019s requested instruction, stating two grounds: first, the court was not sure the defense was generated; second, the requested instruction was not in the pattern instructions. The trial court said it would instruct the jury that \u201cthey do have to find that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Defendant had committed a crime for him to be guilty of that offense.\u201d The court noted counsel\u2019s objection for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in \u201cfailing to instruct the jury as to the longstanding legal principle that, in Maryland, a person is privileged to offer reasonable resistance to an unlawful warrantless arrest.\u201d <em>See In re Albert S., </em>106 Md.App. 376, 396-97, 664 A.2d 476 (1995). He asserts that \u201cthe jury was permitted to convict only so long as it found that Corporal Stanley had \u2014 in the layperson\u2019s view \u2014 \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 to arrest, and was left with the mistaken impression that if Mr. Arthur did not passively acquiesce in that arrest he was guilty of resisting arrest.\u201d (Internal footnote omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The State counters that the pattern jury instruction sufficiently covered the area. In addition, the State asserts that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language \u201cproperly conveys the concept of probable cause, which must be present to effect a lawful arrest.\u201d The State further contends that Corporal Stanley had probable cause to arrest appellant for \u201cnewspaper theft ... as well as other crimes, such as obstruction, second degree assault, and reckless endangerment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Need For An Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law.\u201d When requested to do so by a party, the trial court is required to give an instruction that correctly states the applicable law if it has not been fairly covered in the instructions actually given. <em>State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 356, 619 A.2d 992, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 855, 114 S.Ct. 161, 126 L.Ed.2d 122 (1993). The instruction need not be given, however, unless the requesting party has generated the issue, <em>i.e., </em>produced \u201csome evidence\u201d sufficient to give rise to a jury issue on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990), a case involving a self-defense claim, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANK\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says \u2014 \u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the [] claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not kill in self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201cIn evaluating whether competent evidence exists to generate the requested instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the accused.\u201d <em>Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 433, 818 A.2d 1117 (2003). As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 721 A.2d 699 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">The task of this Court on review is to determine whether the criminal defendant produced that minimum threshold of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that would allow a jury to rationally conclude that the evidence supports the application of the legal theory desired.... [A] defendant charged with murder who seeks instructions on the issue of mitigation or self-defense bears the \u201cburden of initially producing \u2018some evidence\u2019 ... sufficient to give rise to a jury issue with respect to these defenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 721 A.2d 699 (citing <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 208, 362 A.2d 629 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We disagree with the State\u2019s assertion that there was no evidence of an unlawful arrest and therefore no reason to give the disputed instruction. If the jury believed appellant and his witnesses, they might conclude that Corporal Stanley had no reason to arrest appellant. Nonetheless, we see no error. The instruction the trial court gave followed almost exactly, with insignificant changes, Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions 4:27.1, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">The second charge the Defendant is charged with is resisting a warrantless arrest. The Defendant is charged with the crime of resisting arrest. In order to convict the Defendant of [ ] resisting arrest, the State must prove each of the following elements: That a law enforcement officer attempted to arrest the Defendant; that the Defendant knew that a law enforcement officer was attempting to arrest him; <em>that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the Defendant had committed a crime </em>and that the Defendant refused to submit to the arrest and resisted the arrest by force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">MPJI-CR 4:27.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">It is clear from that instruction that the State was required to prove that Corporal Stanley had reasonable grounds to believe appellant had committed a crime. If the jury believed that the officer did not have reasonable grounds to arrest appellant, then it was required to find him not guilty of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">We agree with the State that \u201cthe \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 language contained in the pattern instruction properly conveys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the concept of probable cause.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe \u2018substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 371, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (quoting <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949)). The Maryland Court of Appeals has described probable cause as \u201ca non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 132-33, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007); <em>State v. Wallace, </em>372 Md. 137, 148, 812 A.2d 291 (2002); <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 584, 774 A.2d 420 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This Court and the Court of Appeals have noted the credentials and the expertise of the pattern instructions committee and recognized the value of following the pattern instructions. In <em>Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 383, 620 A.2d 295 (1993), referring to the Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction on reasonable doubt, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">The fourteen members of the Committee which fashioned the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal 1991 (MPJI \u2014 CR) consisted of judges at the trial and appellate level, prosecutors and former prosecutors, defense attorneys, law professors and other distinguished members of the Maryland bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In <em>Green v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 758, 771, 736 A.2d 450 (1999), this Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">[W]e say for the benefit of trial judges generally that the wise course of action is to give instructions in the form, where applicable, of our Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions. Those instructions have been put together by a group of distinguished judges and lawyers who almost amount to a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of the Maryland Bench and Bar. Many of these instructions have been passed upon by our appellate courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Indeed, appellant recognizes that \u201cthe Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions are presumed to be valid and in accordance with Maryland law.\u201d Although we have recognized that there are situations in which the pattern instruction is inadequate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>such deviations are generally owing to unusual fact patterns rather than error in the instruction. In <em>Rajnic v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 286, 664 A.2d 432 (1995), this Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s use of the Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction on self-defense was not sufficient. We noted, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Our decision here today should not be construed as a departure from the appellate policy of general adherence to the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions. <em>See generally Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370 [620 A.2d 295] (1993). Rather, our holding, that more was required than that set forth in the pattern instruction on self-defense, is limited to the particular and somewhat unique facts of the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 291 n. 1, 664 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In the present case, appellant has not stated how this case is distinguishable from other cases in which the State must prove that a defendant resisted arrest. The pattern instruction adequately covered the concept that the arrest must be lawful. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury using the pattern instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">II. \u2014 Sufficiency Of The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"ADd\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that appellant failed to obey a lawful order, and, therefore, Corporal Stanley had no right to arrest him. Appellant claims that \u201c[t]he First Amendment of the United States Constitution granted Mr. Arthur the ability to continue his expression, and forbid [sic] [Corporal] Stanley from ordering Mr. Arthur to stop speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The State asserts that appellant failed to preserve the issue because appellant did not contend in the trial court that the officer could not arrest him for using objectionable language. The State further asserts that, even if preserved, appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Maryland Rule 4-324(a), which governs motions for judgments of acquittal, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">(a) Generally. A defendant may move for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts, or on one or more degrees of an offense which by law is divided into degrees, at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence. The defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The language of the rule is mandatory. <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. 129, 134-36, 517 A.2d 761 (1986); <em>Whiting v.

Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original); <em>see also State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 429, 842 A.2d 716 (2004). In performing its fact-finding role, the trier of fact\u2014 here, the jury \u2014 decides which evidence to accept and which to reject. <em>See Jones v.

Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 707, 790 A.2d 660 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Validity Of The Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">To convict appellant of resisting arrest, the State was required to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the arrest was lawful. <em>See Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 689, 827 A.2d 68 (2003); <em>Barnhard v. State, </em>325 Md. 602, 609-10, 602 A.2d 701 (1992). Here, Corporal Stanley arrested appellant for failure to obey a lawful order to lower the volume of his voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 10-201 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCR\u201d), prohibits \u201c[disturbing the public peace and disorderly conduct,\u201d and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">(c) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">(2) A person may not willfully act in a disorderly manner that disturbs the public peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">(3) A person may not willfully fail to obey a reasonable and lawful order that a law enforcement officer makes to prevent a disturbance to the public peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">(5) A person from any location may not, by making an unreasonably loud noise, willfully disturb the peace of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">(i) on the other\u2019s land or premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">(ii) in a public place; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">(iii) on a public conveyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Appellant relies on <em>Downs v. State, </em>278 Md. 610, 366 A.2d 41 (1976), to establish that his arrest was unlawful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals stated the facts of <em>Downs, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Appellant Downs was conversing with three friends while eating an early morning breakfast in a Lexington Park restaurant. In the course of the conversation Downs said in a loud voice, \u201cAll the goddamn policemen in this County are no fucking good, they\u2019re just after me.\u201d A few minutes later he loudly said, \u201c[T]he fucking niggers in this County are no better than goddamn policemen.\u201d A uniformed State Trooper (Trooper Taylor) sitting at a table about eight feet away from the booth in which Downs and his friends were seated overheard these remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">The trooper went over to Downs\u2019 booth and told him that his talk was disruptive and that he would be placed under arrest if he did not refrain from using such profane language. Downs replied, \u201cYou ain\u2019t bad enough to place me under arrest,\u201d whereupon the trooper grabbed him and informed him that he was under arrest for disorderly conduct. A scuffle ensued, but Taylor finally managed to handcuff Downs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">278 Md. at 611-12, 366 A.2d 41 (internal footnote omitted). Trooper Taylor stated that he was not personally incited by the comments about police officers, but he was concerned about the effects of the racist comments in the racially mixed crowd. Downs claimed that his remarks were not directed to anyone in particular. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 366 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that Downs\u2019 speech was protected by the First Amendment because there was no direct evidence that he made his comments to anyone other than the persons sitting in the booth with him. The Court also pointed out that no evidence was adduced that anyone else, beside Trooper Taylor, heard this statement, or, if they did, that they were so offended by it that they were \u201cso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>aroused as to respond in a violent manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 366 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Although we agree with appellant that his language was protected speech, we disagree that Corporal Stanley arrested him based on his language. In our view, Corporal Stanley\u2019s testimony was clear that he arrested appellant because of the volume of appellant\u2019s verbalizations and not their content, and the jury accepted that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">This distinction was made in <em>Polk v. State, </em>378 Md. 1, 835 A.2d 575 (2003). There, Polk went to pick up her final paycheck at the hospital where she had worked. When she went to her employer\u2019s Human Resources Department (\u201cHuman Resources\u201d), she was told that her paycheck was in the \u201cHeart Center,\u201d her work site. When she went to the Heart Center, her former supervisor told her that her check was not there and to return to Human Resources. Soon after that, the supervisor found the pay check and called Hospital security to have the check delivered to Polk at Human Resources. Raymond Sperl, the security officer who responded to the supervisor\u2019s request, encountered Polk at Human Resources, and when Polk asked him about the check, he told her he had to take it to personnel. Polk responded, \u201cFuck you, asshole.\u201d A Human Resources employee indicated to Sperl that he could give Polk the check. Polk \u201csnatched\u201d it from him, repeating the expletive. As Sperl escorted Polk toward an exit, he told her to \u201ckeep your mouth quiet and leave.\u201d She again repeated the expletive. Sperl told her to \u201ckeep your mouth quiet and leave or I\u2019m going to lock you up for disorderly conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 835 A.2d 575. He told her to \u201ckeep [her] mouth shut, stop [her] cursing, [and] just leave the property.\u201d He warned her several times that \u201cshe\u2019d be locked up [for disorderly conduct] if she didn\u2019t stop her profanity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two women \u201cheard the commotion\u201d and walked away. <em>Id. </em>As Polk left the hospital, she turned toward Sperl and shouted, \u201cFuck you, asshole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">As Sperl escorted Polk toward the Hospital parking garage Polk was \u201cyelling at him and cursing at him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>A.2d 575. \u201cWhen the \u2018vulgarity ... intensified,\u2019 \u201d Sperl told Polk she was under arrest. <em>Id. </em>When he grabbed her shoulder, she pulled away and bit his arm. Other officers arrived and eventually subdued her. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Polk was charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with engaging in disorderly conduct, in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 2001 Supp.), \u00a7 121(b)(3) of Article 27. <em>Polk, </em>378 Md. at 5, 835 A.2d 575. After the State presented its case, she moved for a judgment of acquittal on all the charges, arguing that Sperl\u2019s orders to \u201cstop cursing\u201d \u201cwere unlawfully directed at the content of her speech and that a \u2018domino effect\u2019 made her subsequent arrest illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She asserted that her use of profanity against the officer was protected speech and that because she had not disobeyed a lawful order, the officer had no reason to arrest her. <em>Id. </em>She claimed, therefore, that she \u201crightfully resisted the attempts to arrest her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied her motion, concluding that Sperl\u2019s orders to \u201cquiet down\u201d were \u201clawful orders to prevent a disturbance to the public peace,\u201d \u201cdirected at the volume of Polk\u2019s speech rather than its content,\u201d and that \u201ca reasonable fact-finder could find that Polk failed to comply with the officer\u2019s order to reduce the volume of her voice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 835 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">This Court agreed and affirmed Polk\u2019s convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 835 A.2d 575. The Court of Appeals agreed that Sperl\u2019s orders were directed to the volume of Polk\u2019s voice and were reasonable and lawful orders. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 835 A.2d 575. The <em>Polk </em>Court distinguished its case from <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Significantly, and unlike the present case, the arresting officer in <em>Diehl </em>testified that he arrested Diehl because of the <em>content </em>of his language. <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 478 [451 A.2d 115]. Corporal Sperl, on the other hand, did not testify that he arrested Polk based on the content of her language. Instead, he stated that he told Polk \u201cjust shut your mouth and leave or you\u2019re going to be locked up for disorderly conduct.\u201d This testimony supports the rational inference drawn by the trial court that the order was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>lawful attempt to prevent Polk\u2019s violation of \u00a7 121 due to her loud and disruptive behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 13, 835 A.2d 575. The Court noted that there \u201cwas ample testimony before the trial court supporting its finding that Corporal Sperl issued orders aimed, in the main, at the volume of Ms. Polk\u2019s speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 835 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Eanes v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Appellant contends that the present case is more like <em>Diehl </em>and <em>Downs </em>than <em>Polk. </em>He asserts that the \u201cthe most critical point of difference between <em>Polk </em>and <em>Downs, Diehl, </em>and the present case seems to be within the context of the second <em>Eanes [v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 569 A.2d 604 (1990) ] factor, the circumstances surrounding the time and place where the speech occurred, as well as the overhearing parties\u2019 location.\u201d <em>See Polk, </em>378 Md. at 12, 835 A.2d 575; <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447, 569 A.2d 604. He recites that \u201c[t]he record discloses that Corporal Stanley encountered Mr. Arthur in the milieu of a city sidewalk on the evening of the Fourth of July, a public concourse with a restaurant up the street.\u201d He likens the situs \u201cto the public parking lot in <em>Diehl, </em>or the restaurant in <em>Downs, </em>and clearly distinguishable from the hospital in <em>Polk </em>where the majority recognized \u2018a compelling interest in maintaining peace and quiet in the environs of the Hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Polk </em>at 19-20, 835 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\"><em>Eanes, </em>however, demonstrates that speech may be sufficiently loud to amount to disorderly conduct even on a public sidewalk. In that case, Eanes had gathered with others in front of a medical clinic on a public street in Hagerstown to \u201cassemble^] to speak out against abortion, to pass out gospel tracts [and] to try to talk to girls that are walking by [in order to explain the evils of abortion.]\u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 441, 569 A.2d 604 (alterations in original). A police officer spoke with Eanes and told him that the police had received a number of noise complaints and requested that the group lower its volume. <em>Id. </em>at 441-42, 569 A.2d 604. The officer left, but he returned forty minutes later in response to further complaints and arrested Eanes for disturbing the peace. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>A.2d 604. The District Court found Eanes guilty of disturbing the peace, and, at a trial <em>de novo, </em>the circuit court found Eanes \u201cguilty of willfully disturbing the peace and tranquility of that particular neighborhood ... by making loud and otherwise unacceptable^] improper under the circumstances noises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 569 A.2d 604 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The Court of Appeals discussed several United States Supreme Court decisions regarding statutory restrictions on speech and noted that the level of scrutiny depends on \u201cwhether the statute distinguished between prohibited and permitted speech on the basis of content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 569 A.2d 604 (quoting <em>Frisby v. Schultz, </em>487 U.S. 474, 481, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988)). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">A content-based restriction is constitutionally hale only if it can be shown that the challenged \u201c \u2018regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end....\u2019\u201d <em>[Frisby </em>] (quoting <em>Perry [Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 44, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) ]....) On the other hand, a state \u201c \u2018may ... enforce regulations of the time, place and manner of expression which are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frisby, </em>487 U.S. at 482 [108 S.Ct. 2495] (quoting <em>Perry, </em>460 U.S. at 45 [103 S.Ct. 948]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 447-48, 569 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The Court of Appeals held that the State did not violate Eanes\u2019 First Amendment rights. The court recognized that \u201c \u2018[I]f one of the proposed interpretations would render an enactment valid, while another would render it invalid or ineffective, the court will construe the enactment to be valid whenever feasible,\u2019 \u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 448, 569 A.2d 604 (quoting <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 589, 525 A.2d 1059 (1987)), and therefore construed the phrase \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d \u201cin a content-neutral fashion in order to remain in conformity with first amendment jurisprudence.\u201d The court construed the statute to mean that \u00a7 121 could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>enforced \u201conly if the speech is unreasonably loud under the circumstances,\u201d and, thus, content-neutral. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 569 A.2d 604. Quoting from <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), the Court noted that \u201c \u2018it can no longer be doubted that government has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 450, 569 A.2d 604 (quoting <em>Ward, </em>491 U.S. at 796, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). The Court further noted that numerous Supreme Court cases \u201creflect judicial concern with balancing the right of free speech with the individual\u2019s right to be free from unwanted communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 569 A.2d 604. The Court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">We read the statute as going no further than to afford content-neutral protection to the captive auditor (on the facts before us, auditors in homes or in private offices) who cannot avoid continuing, unreasonably loud and disruptive communications emanating from the street. So read, the statute serves a substantial interest and is narrowly tailored to serve those ends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 569 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Although CR \u00a7 10-201 is worded differently from Art. 27, \u00a7 121, it is clear that it also affords content neutral protection to the captive auditor. In the present case, Corporal Stanley testified that when he approached appellant, appellant began yelling obscenities at him, and he told appellant to settle down.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further testified that when he and appellant neared the Old Town Tavern, people outside the doors of the tavern stood and watched them. Corporal Stanley said that he told appellant to \u201clower his voice, to settle down, and [appellant] continued to refuse.\u201d He later testified that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>lant \u201cbecame disorderly, yelling ... drawing the attention of the people in front of the bar, screaming obscenities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Further, the record reveals that the incident occurred late at night, and, from appellant\u2019s testimony that his \u201cbuddy\u2019 lived directly across the street, the area was at least partly residential. The individuals in their homes were entitled to be free from unreasonably loud noise. A rational jury could find that Corporal Stanleys order that appellant lower his voice was content-neutral and was based on the volume of appellant\u2019s voice. The jury could also find that the order was reasonable, that it was intended to prevent a disturbance to the public peace, and that appellant disobeyed it. Because the officer had a right to arrest appellant for committing the offense in his presence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the jury could find that appellant resisted a lawful arrest and, therefore, was guilty of the offense of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
