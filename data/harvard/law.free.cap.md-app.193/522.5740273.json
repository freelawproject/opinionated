In 2008, appellant moved to recalculate his sentences, and the Circuit Court for Howard County called for a status conference on July 24, 2008. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion and subsequently issued an amended order of commitment. Appellant moved to correct the amended order as an illegal sentence, which motion was heard and denied on August 13, 2008. Appellant appealed that ruling on August 13, 2008, as Number 1408 of September Term, 2008. Appellant filed a second motion to correct the amended order as an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sentence on December 14, 2009. This motion was denied without a hearing on December 28, 2009, and appellant appealed that ruling on December 30, 2009, as Number 2427 of September Term, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Appellant presents one question for our review, which we have edited, for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">I. Did the trial court err when it denied appellant\u2019s motions to correct an illegal sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer no and affirm the ruling of the Circuit Court for Howard County.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">On April 8, 1980, appellant was riding in a stolen vehicle when it attempted to pass an unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle illegally. The trooper gave chase and appellant fired at him with a shotgun stolen from the \u201cGun Smith on Wheels\u201d of Laurel, Maryland. At the time of his arrest, appellant had charges pending against him in several jurisdictions for various crimes, including armed robbery and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Appellant was charged with ten criminal counts, all listed in the \u201cCHARGES\u201d section of the trial court\u2019s docket sheet, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">(1) Assault W/i Murder (2) Attempt Murder (3) Assault by Shooting (4) Assault (5) Battery (6) Mai. Destr. (7) Assault W/i Murd. (8) Assault by Shooting (9) Assault (10) Mai. Destr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">The \u201cTRIAL\u201d section of the docket sheet indicates that a jury found appellant guilty of all counts on September 11, 1980. In that same section, a paragraph entitled \u201cJUDGMENT AND SENTENCE\u201d summarizes appellant\u2019s sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-17\">(C) Cts. 1 30 yrs. 2 Merge 3 10 yrs. 4 Merge 5 Merge 6 3 yrs. 7 30 yrs. 8 10 yrs. 9 Merge 10 3 yrs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The sentences were imposed with the following \u201cSpecial Conditions:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">Count 3 is consecutive to count 1, Count 6 is concurrent to count 3, Count 7 is concurrent to count 6, Count 8 is consecutive to count 7, count 10 is concurrent to count 8. Credit from time served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Appellant\u2019s commitment record, dated December 19th, 1980, reflects the same sentences and conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">Commencing on December 19, 1980 for a period of 30 years as to count 1; count 2 merges; 10 years to count 3, consecutive [sic] to count 1; counts 4 &amp; 5 merge; 3 years to count 6, concurrent to count 3; count 7-30 years, concurrent to count 6,10 years to count 8, consecutive to count 7; count 9 merges; 3 years to count 10 concurrent to count 8; with credit for time served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Taking these terms at face value and assuming that all the sentences would be carried out, appellant faced as many as seventy years in confinement for the crimes in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">As a routine part of the incarceration process, the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Division of Parole and Probation (\u201cDPP\u201d), prepared a \u201cPreSentence Investigation\u201d report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The report, dated November 12, 1980, recited appellant\u2019s convicted counts and sentences almost exactly as they appear on the docket sheet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Nevertheless, the PSI sewed the seeds of this case when its author concluded that appellant \u201creceived a total of 40 years with credit for 225 days served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Employees and agents of DPP, the Division of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d), and the Maryland Parole Commission (\u201cMPC\u201d) repeated the PSI\u2019s error, describing appellant\u2019s maximum incarceration as forty years rather than seventy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s \u201cInmate Institutional Progress Sheet\u201d from the DOC contains an entry, dated \u201c12/24/1980,\u201d the context of which is not altogether clear but indicates that appellant was sentenced to \u201c40 years from 4/8/80.\u201d There are also at least six \u201cParole Recommendation/Decison\u201d reports from the MPC, dating from 1991 to 2008, as well as an \u201cOrder for Release on Parole\u201d from 1998, all of which indicate that appellant was sentenced to forty years, beginning in 1980 and ending in 2020.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In the meantime, appellant pursued the usual array of post-conviction judiciary processes. The circuit court heard appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>lant\u2019s application for review of sentence on January 16, 1981, and denied it on March 16, 1981. The court heard and denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration on April 21, 1981. The court twice denied post-conviction relief, first on March 9, 1981, and again in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In 1995, most of the judicial record from this case was destroyed pursuant to the Fifth Judicial Circuit\u2019s records retention and disposal schedule in effect at that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No transcript or notes from the sentencing hearing remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On August 27, 2004, the court heard and denied appellant\u2019s second motion for reconsideration. At that proceeding, appellant stated that his original sentence had been \u201c40 years back in April of 1980.\u201d The court noted that although most of the record had been destroyed, what was left of it revealed that the court had previously denied a motion for reconsideration, depriving the court of jurisdiction over the motion before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">During a routine audit in 2008, the DOC discovered the aforementioned discrepancy and wrote to the circuit court, asking it to clarify the matter and issue an amended order of commitment. On July 24, 2008, appellant appeared before the court for a \u201cstatus conference,\u201d where he moved to recalculate his sentences. The court determined that appellant\u2019s total confinement stood at seventy years, denied appellant\u2019s motion, and issued an amended order of commitment to clarify the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Appellant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that the court\u2019s amended order of commitment from July 24, 2008, constituted an illegal increase in one or more of his sentences.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court heard and denied this motion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>August 13, 2008. Appellant filed a second, similar motion on December 14, 2009, which the court denied without a hearing on December 28, 2009. Appellant now seeks our review of these rulings in this consolidated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant argues that the sentences handed down on December 19, 1980 imposed a maximum incarceration of forty years and that the amended order of commitment that issued after the July 24, 2008 status conference illegally increased his sentences to seventy years, violating Maryland Rule 4-345(e)(1). <em>See State v. Sayre, </em>314 Md. 559, 562, 552 A.2d 553 (1989). First, appellant contends that the sentences are inherently ambiguous as pronounced by the trial court. Second, appellant contends that the various records from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services make his sentence ambiguous. In either case, appellant argues the rule of lenity requires that we resolve the ambiguity in his favor, so that his sentences imposed at most forty years of incarceration. <em>See Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170,187, 840 A.2d 715 (2004) (holding that the rule of lenity applies to ambiguous pronouncements). We review the trial court\u2019s ruling and amended order of commitment <em>de novo. See Cox v. State, </em>397 Md. 200, 211, 916 A.2d 311 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Appellant first argues that the pronounced sentences are ambiguous because of the way they are worded. The trial court found that, according to the plain language of the sentencing as evidenced by the docket sheet, count seven was concurrent with count six, which was concurrent with count three, which was consecutive to count one. Therefore, the court reasoned that count seven was \u201cconsecutive\u201d to count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Citing our decisions in <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 458, 857 A.2d 590 (2004) and <em>Nelson v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 304, 503 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>A.2d 1357 (1986), appellant argues that \u201cbecause Count 7 was not explicitly made consecutive to Count 1 it ran concurrently with that count.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues: \u201cThe word \u2018consecutive\u2019 is not used with regard to Count 7. Thus under <em>Gatewood </em>and <em>Nelson </em>Count 7 cannot [sic] deemed to be consecutive to Count 1.\u201d Essentially, appellant argues that there is no \u201ctransitive property\u201d of consecutive sentences,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> so that although count seven appears to be consecutive to count one by way of its relations to \u201cintermediate\u201d sentences, those relations are ambiguous. Therefore, appellant concludes that the rule of lenity demands that we ignore the intermediate sentences and consider count seven as concurrent with count one. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Appellant misconstrues the holdings in two of our decisions when he argues that, as a general matter: \u201cIf during a criminal sentencing, a judge does not explicitly make one sentence consecutive to another, the sentences are deemed to be running concurrently.\u201d There are several cases in which the court pronounced a sentence without explicitly making it consecutive to another one of the sentences and the sentences were deemed concurrent with one another. <em>See Gatewood, </em>158 Md.App. at 480, 482, 857 A.2d 590; <em>Nash v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 681, 519 A.2d 769 (1987); <em>Nelson v. State, </em>66 Md. App. 304, 310, 503 A.2d 1357 (1986). That, however, does not form the rule, because those cases turned on the fact that their pronouncements failed to specify how the sentence in question related to <em>any other sentence, at all.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In <em>Gatewood, </em>the sentencing court stated only: \u201cAs to the conviction for distribution of cocaine on May 14, 2002, the sentence is twenty years, but that sentence is suspended.\u201d 158 Md.App. at 480, 857 A.2d 590. In <em>Nash, </em>the trial court was also silent on the issue and merely pronounced that the defendant would serve \u201cSeven years for the second count.\u201d 69 MdApp. at 681, 691, 519 A.2d 769. In <em>Nelson, </em>we held that the sentencing court\u2019s \u201cfailure to designate whether [the sentences] were to be served concurrently or consecutively, rendered them concurrent.\u201d 66 Md.App. at 312-13, 503 A.2d 1357. With no chronological guidance whatsoever, the rule of lenity required that we construe those sentences in-a manner most favorable to the defendant, which meant that they were deemed concurrent with the other sentences pronounced contemporaneously. <em>See Gatewood, </em>158 Md.App. at 482, 857 A.2d 590; <em>Nash, </em>69 Md.App. at 692, 519 A.2d 769; <em>Nelson, </em>66 Md.App. at 314-15, 503 A.2d 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">This case stands closer to <em>Collins v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 173, 196-99, 516 A.2d 1015 (1986), in which we removed ambiguity from a sentence by examining its context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">When it imposed terms of imprisonment under counts two, three, and five in the Lisa K. case, however, the court did not indicate that the terms were to run concurrently. The maximum penalties available under counts two, three, and five were thirty years, life, and twenty years respectively. If made concurrent with each other, a term of fife imprisonment would result. If made consecutive to each other, a total of life increased by fifty years would result. Counts two and five were clearly stacked when described as \u201cfifty years.\u201d The court\u2019s intention that this term should follow the life term is apparent by its use of the word \u201cplus.\u201d Courts are encouraged to phrase their sentences with the word \u201cconsecutive\u201d when successive terms are intended so that the accused and those charged with the execution of the sentence are advised of its duration. We do not, however, regard the term \u201cconsecutive\u201d a talisman and where the duration of a sentence is otherwise discernable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>from the record, it will be upheld without resort to the presumption of leniency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In this case, we need not go to the lengths we did in <em>Collins </em>because the trial court explicitly pronounced the way in which each count related to at least one other count. As such, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 379-80, 564 A.2d 395 (1989), though correct, is self-defeating. In that case, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the rule of lenity precisely because the sentencing court was not silent on the issue, and the Court had only to interpret the meaning of the phrase \u201cconsecutive with sentence now serving\u201d and similar pronouncements, there being several possible sentences fitting that description. Each of appellant\u2019s sentences, by contrast, unambiguously refers to another sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">If we hold each count to be concurrent to those not specified, that would directly contradict and undo the relationships that the court did specify for no reason. Case law does not demand that we interpret the time imposed for one count as concurrent with every count not explicitly related. To do so would not only cause us to enforce contradictions but would unduly burden a trial court that wishes to simplify its pronouncement by relying on logical combinations. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s interpretation of the rule of lenity could cause more confusion than it allegedly resolves. Appellant does not state precisely how, under his theory, the court should have pronounced his sentence. It appears, however, that he would have had the court state that count seven was <em>both </em>consecutive to count one <em>and </em>concurrent with count six, which could actually create additional confusion by leaving open the question of which count would take priority if the terms change.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>If not that pronouncement, then appellant\u2019s theory would have the court state that count seven is \u201cconcurrent with count six and <em>not consecutive </em>to count one.\u201d The difference between stating \u201cconcurrent with count six and <em>not consecutive </em>to count one\u201d and simply stating \u201cconcurrent with count six\u201d is hypothetical at best and in any event is immaterial to the case at hand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Having established that there is no ambiguity in the court\u2019s original pronouncement, what remains of the judicial record gives no reason to apply the rule of lenity to appellant\u2019s sentences. Appellant\u2019s first argument therefore fails to establish any error in the court\u2019s amended order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Appellant next argues that his sentences are ambiguous because the docket sheet conflicts with various records in the DPP, DOC, and MPC. Appellant cites several cases holding that a conflict between a trial transcript and docket entries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>must be resolved in favor of the transcript. <em>See Gatewood v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 458, 482, 857 A.2d 590 (2004) (\u201cThe transcript of the trial, unless shown to be in error, takes precedence over the docket entries.\u201d (quoting <em>Jackson v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 679, 687-88, 515 A.2d 768 (1986) (quoting <em>Shade v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 407, 411, 306 A.2d 560 (1973))) (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, as there is no transcript of appellant\u2019s sentencing, there can be no such conflict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The remains of the record from this case clarify the issues presented here and support the State\u2019s argument that appellant faced a maximum incarceration of seventy years. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Scott v. State </em>that the rule of lenity applies when a sentencing court does not \u201carticulate the period of confinement with clarity so as to facilitate the prison authority\u2019s task.\u201d 379 Md. 170, 187, 840 A.2d 715 (2004) (quoting <em>Robinson, </em>317 Md. 371, 564 A.2d 395) (internal quotation marks omitted). We are aware that in this case the DPP, DOC, and MPC misinterpreted the court\u2019s sentence, but this does not necessarily mean that the court failed in its duty by pronouncing a sentence that was unintelligible, <em>per se. </em>The mistakes in this case were caused by an extrajudicial error and were not due to objectively faulty logical or grammatical construction by a court. In other words, one person\u2019s misinterpretation \u2014 though perpetuated \u2014 does not render the underlying text ambiguous or contradictory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Furthermore, as appellee points out, the DPP, DOC, and MPC are executive agencies, and it would be unprecedented to extend the rule of lenity to their actions. Not surprisingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>appellant cites no case that applies the rule of lenity in that manner, and our research has discovered none. The sentencing \u201carticulated the period of confinement with clarity so as to facilitate the prison authority\u2019s task.\u201d It was only an unchecked error by that prison authority which introduced any ambiguity. Appellant has given us no reason that the rule of lenity should be extended in an attempt to reform the actions of executive agents and agencies. Moreover, appellant has cited no authority by which we may do so. We therefore reject appellant\u2019s argument that executive records that plainly contradict an unambiguous sentence can invoke the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">It is regrettable that the DPP introduced and perpetuated, along with the DOC and MPC, such a significant error of interpretation, but it does not undo the fact that appellant\u2019s sentences, as pronounced and reflected in court documents, were unambiguous and therefore legally binding. For the forgoing reasons, the rule of lenity has no bearing on this case. Appellant\u2019s sentences stand as stated by the original sentencing court and as reiterated by the more recent amended order of commitment. The trial court, therefore, did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motions to correct an illegal sentence, and we affirm those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. The chronology is more easily understood when presented graphically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Count 1 (30 years)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Count 3(10 years, consecutive to 1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">Count 6 (3 years, concurrent with 3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">Count 7 (30 years, concurrent with 6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">Count 8(10 years, consecutive to 7)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">Count 10 (3 years, concurrent with 8)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-15\">. The report incorrectly lists count six as consecutive, rather than concurrent, to count three, which would have extended appellant\u2019s total imprisonment by a matter of ten years. This mistake, however, was overshadowed by the report\u2019s incorrect summary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-16\">. This is not surprising, as we might expect a reader simply to refer to the summary rather than recalculate the total time from the list of individual counts above it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-17\">. Appellant also produced a commitment record from a separate conviction on March 31, 1981, reflecting that appellant was sentenced to \"15 years to run concurrent with sentence of 53 <em>years </em>imposed by Howard County Court\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">. Some documents from this case were marked with the label \u201cDo Not Destroy.\u201d According to a letter from the court to appellant, the court no longer disposes of files involving murder and first-degree rape, and appellant's file was marked as such by mistake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">. Although the bulk of appellant\u2019s arguments address only count seven, it is not clear whether his motions and this appeal refer only to that sentence or to multiple sentences. Our reasoning applies to all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>appellant\u2019s sentences, however, and so we do not need to distinguish them for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. \"Transitivity\u201d is a logical concept, learned by most students in elementary mathematics \u2014 and often quickly forgotten \u2014 that allows us to \"string\u201d certain relationships together. If a relation between things (be they numbers, sentences, or what have you) is transitive, then if one thing is related to a second thing, and that second thing is similarly related to a third thing, then the first and the third things are related in the same way. The relationship \"is greater than\u201d is perhaps the simplest example. It is transitive because if <em>x </em>is greater than <em>y </em>and <em>y </em>is greater than <em>z, </em>then <em>x </em>is greater than <em>z. </em>Here, the question is whether sentence <em>x </em>being consecutive to <em>y, </em>and <em>y </em>consecutive to <em>z, </em>implies that <em>x </em>is consecutive to <em>z, </em>as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">. This problem would arise if count three were eliminated, in which case count six would become concurrent with count one, which would conflict with the pronouncement that count seven should be consecutive to count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The priority problem would be resolved by pronouncing, for example, that count seven is consecutive to the longest-running of counts one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>through six. Appellant did not address this scenario, but the general implication of his argument is that this would not suffice because it does not state exactly whether count seven is consecutive or concurrent with each of counts one through six. The only way to do so would be to consider every possible combination of counts one through six and then, for each combination, state how count seven relates to each one of those six sentences. We would obviously not burden the court with such a task \u2014 which would escalate by orders of magnitude with the number of sentences imposed \u2014 when the same meaning can be imparted with less effort by using logical constructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">. This distinction highlights the present confusion as to whether count seven is \"consecutive to count one.\u201d In a technical and, hence, legal sense, count seven is not \"consecutive to count one;\u201d it is only \"concurrent with count six.\u201d This is to say that count seven depends only on count six and operates independently of count one. In other words, count seven cannot begin to run <em>until count six begins to run, </em>as opposed to <em>after count one has expired. </em>The distinction is academic in the case at hand because the beginning of count six coincides with the end of count one. If count six were nullified, however, count seven would be left with nothing to which it could be \"consecutive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">These facts are not before us, however, and so we need not decide what would occur if one or more \u201cintermediate\u201d sentences were nullified. The point of this discussion is to demonstrate that there is no ambiguity because count seven is not technically \"consecutive\u201d to count one and thus there is no contradiction when the court creates a chain of relations among sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. Admittedly, it would be better practice to pronounce a total sentence of time to be served after imposing multiple individual sentences. Absent a transcript, we do not know if that was done here when the original sentences were imposed. Moreover, we note that even doing so could not prevent all the pitfalls of which appellant complains, because no single statement could account for every potentiality, should some sentences be reduced, vacated, suspended, or otherwise changed. Although a summation is a helpful guide and often employed, we see no reason to enforce a rule that would make one absolutely necessary in every pronouncement of multiple sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
