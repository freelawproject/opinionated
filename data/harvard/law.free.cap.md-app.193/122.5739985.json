MOYLAN, Jr., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Across the scorched earth of Maryland Rule of Procedure 4-215, the appellant, Joe Henry Randolph, and no less than three judges of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County waged a four-month war of attrition between November 10, 2008 and February 18, 2009. On February 19, 2009, a jury, presided over by Judge Ronald B. Rubin, found the appellant guilty of first-degree escape. He was sentenced to a term of eight years imprisonment. The appellant would now like to refight the war of 4-215. On this appeal, he contends</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">1. that the trial court erroneously permitted him to discharge counsel without punctilious compliance with Rule 4-215;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">2. that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process when the court erroneously failed to insure that two of his subpoenas for documents were honored;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">3. that the court erroneously instructed the jury on the law of escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">4. that the court erroneously denied his request for a jury instruction on the defense of necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">An Amalgam of Subsections 4-215(e) and 4-215(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">The appellant\u2019s flagship contention is that because of a breach in the Maginot Line of Rule 4-215 he was forced to go to trial on February 18, 2009, without the benefit of counsel. As is common with long-range struggles, the nature of the conflict seemed to evolve, over time, from one initially concerning the discharge of counsel pursuant to subsection 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>215(e) into one involving waiver by inaction pursuant to subsection 4-215(d). We will try to deal with the totality of the metamorphosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Judge Weinstein on November 10, 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It was on October 3, 2008, that Administrative Judge Ann S. Harrington set the appellant\u2019s first scheduled trial date for November 10, 2008, before Judge Paul Weinstein. Until that point, the appellant had been represented by the Montgomery County Public Defender\u2019s Office. At the very outset of the proceedings on November 10, however, the appellant stated that he had fired his assistant public defender, Adam Harris. Judge Weinstein immediately pointed out that the unilateral decision of the appellant in that regard was not the official decision of the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to let him, you can take it up with the trial judge, but I\u2019m not going to let him go, <em>I\u2019m not going to let you fire him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>I already fired him, </em>I mean, a while ago in my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">THE COURT: <em>You may have fired him, but the Court didn\u2019t fire him. </em>December 3rd for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">At the suggestion of the prosecutor, Judge Weinstein then conducted what the parties referred to as a waiver hearing. The subject of a waiver of the right to counsel by the act of discharging counsel is covered by Rule 4-215(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">(e) <em>Discharge of counsel </em>\u2014 Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. <em>If the court finds that there is a merito\u00f1ous reason for the defendant\u2019s request, </em>the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u25a0with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. <em>If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, </em>the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">It is a curiously drawn subsection that uses a lot of words to make what purports to be an important distinction without any truly significant difference. The common denominator threshold is that if the defendant requests the judge\u2019s permission to discharge counsel, he must \u201cexplain the reasons for the request.\u201d The heart of the subsection then contrasts 1) the finding of \u201ca meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request\u201d with 2) the finding of \u201cno meritorious reason.\u201d With one minor difference, the judge, in either event, has to do almost precisely the same thing. The meritorious reason and the non-meritorious reason produce essentially the same result:</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">MERITORIOUS REASON NO MERITORIOUS REASON</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">1. Advise defendant of risk of 1. Advise defendant of risk of going to trial unrepresented going to trial unrepresented</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">2. Grant a continuance, if necessary</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Presumably in the non-meritorious scenario, the defendant could theoretically be forced to go to trial immediately. In either situation, however, there must be compliance with subsection (a)(l)-(4) of the Rule. In this case, it seems clear that Judge Weinstein did not find any meritorious reason for the appellant\u2019s request. Because the trial was not going forward on that day in any event, that finding made absolutely no difference. The warning about the possibility of having to go to trial without a lawyer had to be given in either event. Compliance with subsection (a)(l)-(4) had to be effected in either event. Subsection (e) does seem to be unnecessarily bloated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Although the meritorious versus non-meritorious character of the appellant\u2019s request appears to be inconsequential, it was apparent that there was bad blood between the appellant and the assigned assistant public defender dating back to an earlier case where the appellant had fired him as his lawyer. There were also claims that the lawyer had not done all of the things the appellant asked him to do in the present case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to let your fire your lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">MR. RANDOLPH: Excuse me. The reason I said that, <em>I had him for other cases where I had fired him and, we had never got along on terms on other cases, </em>and in this case, too, I told him I didn\u2019t have (unintelligible) for my case. He came to me and we talked and I said, listen, you not, <em>all this stuff I asked him to do </em>for me, <em>he never done it. </em>And <em>the stuff I asked him to do this time, he still hasn\u2019t done it for me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">THE COURT: Who is going to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>He\u2019s not going to represent me because he\u2019s not in my best interest. </em>I mean, he\u2019s a good and competent lawyer, but <em>he hasn\u2019t done the things that I asked him, and the things that I asked him to get for this Court </em>so I could present mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">THE COURT: What did you ask him to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>I asked him to get some stuff from PRC. I asked him subpoena my records from PRC, </em>actually my medical records so I said if I\u2019m going with disposition, I need to present my evidence to the judge also and my facts. <em>He hasn\u2019t done none of that. He says that he did it but nobody got back to him but Pm pretty sure, these people told, me that they haven\u2019t even talked to him.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The assistant public defender, interjecting, insisted that he had complied with the appellant\u2019s requests and had communicated with the appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">[THE COURT]: But I\u2019m telling you, you have a trial date and you\u2019re not getting a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A I mean, I don\u2019t even know, why can\u2019t I get a continuance, I mean, I don\u2019t even have no paperwork, no nothing. How can I even go, <em>this is my first time I\u2019ve ever seen an indictment </em>and I can\u2019t even get a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">Q Well, <em>you knew what you were charged with, you just told me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\"><em>A I knew what I was charged with, </em>but I kept asking for my discovery, my paperwork and trying to get subpoenas and he hasn\u2019t done any of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">Q Well, <em>he just told me he gave it to you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>A He didn\u2019t.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">THE WITNESS: <em>When did you give me discovery, what date?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">MR. HARRIS: <em>I mailed the discovery and I subpoenaed the people that you wanted to.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">THE WITNESS: You mailed it, now he mailed it to me, <em>first he handed it to me, now he mailed it. He doesn\u2019t even know what he did. </em>I mean, this, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to have to do this time. This is my, you know what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Compliance With Subsection (e) Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Before we get to compliance with subsection (a)(l)-(4), subsection (e) generally expressly required the following in the appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">Judge Weinstein fully satisfied that requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">Q All right. <em>I\u2019m telling you now that if you fire him, you\u2019re going to represent yourself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>A Okay. So I can represent myself at the disposition hearing also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">Q Disposition hearing, that\u2019s right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">A Can I, I can represent myself, at this hearing too, also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Q Well, you can tell me anything you want to. I\u2019m not going to make a decision to let you fire him yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">A Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">Q <em>I want you to listen to what I\u2019m telling you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">Q <em>Do you understand that you have a right to a lawyer?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">A <em>Yes, I do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">Q <em>You have a lawyer that was appointed by the Public Defender. If you fire him, they\u2019re not going to give you another lawyer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">A <em>I know that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">Q You do have a right, if you have money, to hire a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-15\">A I have money, but they won\u2019t release my money from the police station. I have money, I have money, but I\u2019ve been trying to get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-16\">Q I don\u2019t have any, <em>I\u2019m just telling you what your rights are.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">A Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">Q And <em>I want to point out that it\u2019s dangerous for you to represent yourself because as a lawyer, he knows a lot more how to protect your interest and how to defend you than you do. Okay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-19\">A He may know that, but he\u2019s not in my best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-20\">Q All right. I\u2019m just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-21\">A Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-22\">Q <em>Listen to me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-23\">A All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Q <em>You\u2019re ultimately going to make the decision as to what you want to do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">A Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">Q But I\u2019m tell[ing] you, <em>you have a trial date and you\u2019re not getting a continuance.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">As of that hearing of November 10, if not before, the appellant was apprised of the fact that he had a scheduled trial date of December 3, 2008.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">BY THE COURT: All right. You have indicated that you want to fire Mr. Harris, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">Q <em>Do you understand you have a trial date on December 3rd?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">A No, I did not, I never had, I never had no paperwork. <em>I don\u2019t know nothing, </em>I\u2019ve never seen an indictment, I don\u2019t know if I can, <em>you waived my indictment, right, waived my preliminary hearing?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">MR. HARRIS: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">THE WITNESS: I mean, I didn\u2019t see no paperwork or nothing, <em>I don\u2019t know nothing. </em>I don\u2019t know nothing about my trial date, anything. <em>It\u2019s the first I\u2019m hearing about the trial date on December 3rd.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-15\">MR. HARRIS: <em>I sent Mr. Randolph a letter on October 6th.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-16\">THE WITNESS: <em>Never got it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-17\">MR. HARRIS: <em>To the detention center indicating that his trial date was December 3rd.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-18\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">At the end of the hearing on November 10, Judge Weinstein did not find that there was \u201ca meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request\u201d to fire his attorney. Indeed, Judge Weinstein had throughout the hearing consistently manifested his displeasure with the appellant\u2019s request and his extreme reluctance to grant it. In the face of the appellant\u2019s adamant insistence that he would not be represented by Mr. Harris but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>would represent himself, however, Judge Weinstein had no realistic choice but to acquiesce in the inevitable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Harris\u2019 appearance is stricken at the request of the defendant. Trial date December 3rd. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Harris is ordered by the Court to give a copy of his file to Mr. Randolph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">MR. HARRIS: I\u2019ll provide it today, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Compliance With Subsection (a)(l)-(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Subsection (e), dealing with the discharge of counsel, concludes with the direction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Turning to subsection (a), requirement (a)(4) is not pertinent to the situation before us and requires no discussion. The other three requirements are applicable. Subsection (a)(l)-(3) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">[T]he court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">(1) Make certain that the defendant has received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">(2) Inform the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">(3) Advise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">A. Subsection (a)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">The satisfaction of subsection (a)(1) is very different from the satisfaction of (a)(2) or (a)(3). This Court discussed the difference in <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 297, 304, 909 A.2d 1112 (2006), <em>ajfd, </em>401 Md. 175, 931 A.2d 1098 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">With respect to the three absolute requirements, <em>the first is, essentially, the court\u2019s confirmation that someone delivered to the defendant \u201ca copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.\u201d </em>The second and third requirements, concerning, respectively, 1) \u201cthe right to counsel\u201d and \u201cthe importance of assistance of counsel\u201d and 2) \u201cthe nature of the charges\u201d and the \u201callow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>able penalties,\u201d are actual advisements that must be made by the judge personally to the defendant on the face of the record. <em>Some appreciation of the different natures of these three </em>(or four or five) <em>requirements will make an application of a sometimes overly generalized caselaw more sensitively possible.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">What is required to satisfy (a)(2) or (a)(3) is not required for the satisfaction of (a)(1). Our <em>Broadwater </em>opinion went on, 171 Md.App. at 325, 909 A.2d 1112:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">It would not, however, apply to requirement # 1, by which the court only seeks information about an event (the delivery of a copy of the charging document). <em>The recipient of information pursuant to requirement </em># <em>1 is the judge, not the defendant. </em>The requirement is that <em>\u201cthe court shall make certain\u201d that the event </em>(the delivery of the charging document) <em>had </em>at some earlier time <em>actually taken place. This is not part of a message being aimed at the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7f\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">We also noted the distinction between (a)(1), on the one hand, and (a)(2) and (a)(3), on the other hand, in <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 248, 934 A.2d 1059 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 Md. 614, 943 A.2d 1245 (2008).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">As we focus in on subsection (a)(1), <em>it is important not to treat all of the provisions of Rule 4-215 the same but to recognize the fundamental difference, </em>in terms of essential character, <em>between subsection (a)(1), which concerns the happening of an event, and most of the other provisions </em>of Rule 4-215, <em>which involve the actual and direct imparting of specific information by the judge to the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">At the hearing on November 10, the discussion among Judge Weinstein, the appellant, and Assistant Public Defender Harris covered a wide range of papers, documents, subpoenas, and discovery. In the course of the discussion, the appellant denied everything that Mr. Harris informed the court that he had done.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>THE COURT: Have you obtained, has he received a copy of his indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">MR. HARRIS: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have to go through the file. I met with Mr. Randolph before this, <em>I\u2019ve provided him with discovery and I\u2019ve issued subpoenas to the parties that he\u2019s asked me to issue subpoenas to.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">THE WITNESS: I never received any, <em>he never gave me no discovery. I haven\u2019t had any of the indictment papers, and he hasn\u2019t issue any subpoenas at all, he hasn\u2019t done anything on my case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">At the end of the discussion, the appellant was assured that he would receive copies of everything Mr. Harris claimed he had earlier provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">Q You have about a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">A So I got about a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">MR. HARRIS: That\u2019s what he\u2019s saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">Q And <em>I\u2019m going to order Mr. Harris to give you another set of the discover[y].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">A <em>He never gave me the first set.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">MR. HARRIS: <em>I\u2019ll be happy to send a copy.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-17\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">Q <em>You just told me you didn\u2019t get it, but you\u2019re going to get it this time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">A <em>Okay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-20\">Q <em>Because it\u2019s going to be hand carried to you. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-21\">As the hearing of November 10 came to an end, Judge Weinstein\u2019s final directive was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-22\">THE COURT: Trial date December 3rd. <em>Mr. Harris is ordered by the Court to give a copy of his file to [the appellant].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>MR. HARRIS: <em>I\u2019ll provide it today, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"As3\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although this colloquy, to be sure, did not use the magic word \u201cindictment\u201d or \u201ccharging document,\u201d the record itself establishes that the appellant was actually given a copy of his indictment. On the scheduled trial date of December 3, 2008, he appeared before Judge Harrington and made the following acknowledgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">THE COURT: Are you Mr. Joe Henry Randolph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">MR. RANDOLPH: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Randolph, today is the trial date in your case and <em>you are charged by ... indictment in one count with escape in the first degree </em>on or about June 11, 2008. <em>Have you received a copy of the indictment?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>Yes, I did. [</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeL\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">That acknowledgment of December 3 established that subsection (a)(1) had been satisfied. With respect to the nature of the proof required to show compliance with (a)(1), we observed in <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. at 249-50, 934 A.2d 1059:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\"><em>Subsection (a)(1), </em>unlike the other provisions, <em>involves only the objectively measured question of whether \u201cthe defendant received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">As <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 609, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988), makes clear, <em>the satisfaction of subsection (a)(1) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>does not require a judge to make inquiry of, or say anything to, a defendant in a courtroom. If evidence objectively establishes that the defendant actually received a copy of the charging document, </em>moreover, <em>the fact that the judge failed to \u201cmake certain\u201d of that fact is immaterial. The very occurrence of receiving the document speaks for itself and ipso facto satisfies the subsection. </em>The holding in this regard of <em>Fowlkes v. State </em>was unequivocal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">As to subsections (l)(l)-(3), the record contains a copy of the charging document in the defendant\u2019s case. <em>This document* </em>which bears the defendant\u2019s signature, <em>contains a notice of the right to counsel; </em>therefore, <em>this document demonstrates compliance with subsection (a)(1).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">311 Md. at 609 [536 A.2d 1149] (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">... We cite <em>Fowlkes </em>for the threshold proposition that <em>if extrinsic evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding that the defendant indeed received a copy of the charging document, adequate compliance with subsection (a)(1) has been shown. </em>Whether the judge himself did or did not do something or other in the courtroom is a redundant technicality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">B. Subsection (a)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Subsection (a)(2) requires that the judge personally advise the defendant of 1) the right to counsel and 2) the importance of the assistance of counsel. Judge Weinstein personally advised the appellant in both regards. At one point early in the hearing, the exchange was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">THE COURT: I want you to listen to what I\u2019m telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">Q <em>Do you understand that you have a right to a lawyer?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>A <em>Yes, I do.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">A few questions and answers later in that same exchange, Judge Weinstein further advised the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">I want to point out that <em>it\u2019s dangerous for you to represent yourself because </em>as <em>a lawyer, </em>he <em>knows a lot more [about] how to protect your interest and how to defend you than you do. </em>Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Subsection (a)(2) was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">C. Subsection (a)(3):</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Subsection (a)(3) required Judge Weinstein to advise the appellant with respect to 1) the nature of the charge and 2) the allowable penalties. As to the nature of the charge, the following exchange took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">THE COURT: <em>Do you know what you\u2019re charged with?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anh\">\n<em>A. I\u2019m charged with first-degree felony escape.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">Q. Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">A short time later when the appellant complained that that day, November 10, was \u201cmy first time I\u2019ve ever seen an indictment,\u201d the appellant acknowledged knowing what he had been charged with.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">Q Well, <em>you knew what you were charged with, you just told me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\"><em>A I knew what I was charged with, </em>but I kept asking for my discovery, my paperwork and trying to get subpoenas and he hasn\u2019t done any of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-17\">Q Well, he just told me he gave it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-18\">A He didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">A little further along in the hearing, Mr. Harris briefly summarized the nature of the case and the nature of the defense for the appellant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>THE COURT: Tell him what you told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">MR. HARRIS: What I represented to the Court was that <em>the escape came in the course of a moment of panic, </em>that it was, that <em>there were mental health issues that fed into that briefly considered decision </em>and that <em>no one was hurt </em>in this case and that <em>the conduct that\u2019s alleged doesn\u2019t justify a sentence of seven years. </em>That was my argument to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In explaining to Judge Weinstein at one point why he would not agree to a plea bargain resulting in a sentence of seven years, the appellant demonstrated a clear understanding of what was being charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Q Tell me what you want to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">A <em>I wanted to tell you about the facts of the case and why I don\u2019t think I should get seven years.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">Q I understand what the facts were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">A You understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">Q <em>The allegation </em>is that you walked off from the PreRelease Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">A <em>Allegation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">Q <em>Okay. They have to prove it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">A <em>Right.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">(Emphasis supplied). The appellant was advised of and fully understood the nature of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">The maximum penalty for the felony of first-degree escape is ten years imprisonment. There are no mandatory provisions. In the course of a longer discussion as to why the appellant would not accept a plea bargain resulting in a seven-year sentence, Judge Weinstein informed the appellant that upon a verdict of guilty without a plea bargain, he would be inclined to impose a sentence of nine years. In the course of the discussion, moreover, Judge Weinstein expressly informed the appellant that the maximum penalty for first-degree escape was ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Q Ms. Armstrong, who is the prosecutor, has made you an offer. Mr. Harris has told me he conveyed that offer to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">A He told me they offered me seven years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">Q Seven years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">A They said you was going to give me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">Q You don\u2019t have to accept it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">A I didn\u2019t want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">Q And I\u2019m not suggesting you accept it, because if you do accept it, you have to tell me it\u2019s voluntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">A I\u2019m not going to accept seven years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">Q All right. Then you have a right to go to trial. <em>The maximum penalty that you can receive is 10 years. You understand that?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">The appellant was thus fully informed as to the maximum penalty he was facing. In all respects, subsections (a)(l)-(3) were fully complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Judge Harrington on December 3, 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">The appellant has chosen to argue this contention exclusively in terms of Rule 4-215(e), dealing with the discharge of counsel. His narrow analysis of events ends with the hearing of November 10, 2008. The saga of the appellant and Rule 4-215, however, did not end on November 10. Because of a heroic effort by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to insure that the appellant enjoyed every constitutional protection to which he was entitled, the story did not end with a scheduled trial of the appellant on December 3, 2008. There was instead an extended pretrial hearing on that day in front of Judge Harrington, in which the entire panoply of warnings and advisements were bestowed on the appellant all over again.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">In contrast to the appellant, who chooses to remain doggedly entrenched in 4-215(e), the State argues that the supervening post-December 3 reality is that the appellant\u2019s ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>trial without counsel on February 18-19, 2009, was a product of a 4-215(d) waiver by inaction in the circuit court. The position of the State is that what began as a subsection (e) discharge of counsel segued or metamorphosed, post-December 3, into what then became a subsection (d) waiver by inaction. In pertinent part, subsection (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">If a defendant appears in circuit court without counsel on the date set for ... trial, indicates a desire to have counsel, and the record shows compliance with section (a) of this Rule ... in a previous appearance in the circuit court ... the court shall permit the defendant to explain the appearance without counsel. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s appearance without counsel, the court shall continue the action to a later time and advise the defendant that if counsel does not enter an appearance by that time, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds that there is no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s appearance without counsel, the court may determine that the defendant has waived counsel by failing ... to obtain counsel and may proceed with the ... trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The ultimate issue, of course, is whether the appellant, when he ultimately went to trial without a lawyer on February 18, 2009, was unconstitutionally denied his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. Looking back from February 18, 2009, we resist the notion that our analysis must be confined either to a hermetically sealed subsection 4-215(e) or to a hermetically sealed subsection 4-215(d), with no leakage between the two. As we assess the collective effort of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to follow the law, the totality of circumstances necessarily includes both the hearing before Judge Weinstein on November 10 and the hearing before Judge Harrington on December 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">If we were looking only at subsection 4-215(e), the appellant would have been tried, without a lawyer, on December 3, 2008. As of the hearing of November 10, he was, indeed, scheduled for trial on December 3. On December 3, however, no such trial took place. As Judge Harrington introduced the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ceedings, she noted that what was on her docket was a trial with a \u201cself-represented litigant.\u201d The assistant state\u2019s attorney indicated that the appellant had fired the public defender who had originally represented him and that he was \u201cgoing to ask for a continuance today to retain Spencer Hecht.\u201d With the acquiescence of the prosecutor, Judge Harrington agreed to a continuance and ultimately settled on a more remote scheduled trial date of February 18, 2009. There followed a discussion about whether Rule 4-215(a) had earlier been satisfied and then a decision to do it again simply as a precaution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">THE COURT: [T]he file doesn\u2019t reflect that there\u2019s ever been a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">MS. ARMSTRONG: <em>Judge Weinstein actually did, but I don\u2019t think it would hurt to do it again.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">THE COURT: Judge Weinstein did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">MS. ARMSTRONG: He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">THE COURT: <em>It just doesn\u2019t show it on the docket entries. Oh, yes, it does, Tab No. SO.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">MS. ARMSTRONG: <em>But I don\u2019t think it would hurt to do a complete one.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">THE COURT: <em>Oh, okay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">In terms of 4-215(d), Judge Harrington explored with the appellant the subject of his representation and heard from him that he hoped to get a privately retained lawyer and, indeed, had the funds to do so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">THE COURT: Now I see that you had Mr. Harris representing you, but right now you don\u2019t have an attorney. <em>Were you going to represent yourself?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">THE COURT: <em>What were your plans?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-16\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>My plan was to have a lawyer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-17\">THE COURT: Who are you going to have represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-18\">MR. RANDOLPH: Over at the (unintelligible), since it\u2019s hard for me,, you know, to get in contact with a lawyer, so right now I\u2019ve just been sending out letters trying to get in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>touch with a lawyer. I have no other way to get in contact with a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">THE COURT: Well, <em>do you have any family members who can contact attorneys for you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>Uhn-huh.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">THE COURT: <em>Do you have funds to hire a lawyer ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>Yes, I do have funds. </em>I have funds, all my funds when I got locked up\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">MR. RANDOLPH: \u2014 they\u2019re at the police station. I need somebody to go pick them up. <em>So I\u2019ve been trying to get a lawyer </em>to see if he can go, I can file a power of attorney so <em>he can pick my money up and represent me.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Judge Harrington then heard from the appellant as to why he had fired the assistant public defender.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">THE COURT: Did you fire Mr. Harris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">MR. RANDOLPH: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-14\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t want the assistance of a public defender in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-15\">MR. RANDOLPH: The only thing about it, with me and Mr. Harris, I had Mr. Harris on some other cases and we weren\u2019t seeing eye-to-eye and I fired him in those other cases. So I figured there was some kind of, some animosity going on. We wasn\u2019t seeing eye-to-eye\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-16\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-17\">MR. RANDOLPH: \u2014 because I had to fire him in my other case last year and I thought that maybe he had something against me. He wasn\u2019t representing me right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">Judge Harrington ascertained that the appellant actually wanted a continuance in order to retain an attorney. She granted him a two-and-one-half month continuance to do just that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, <em>I did have a conversation with Spencer Hecht yesterday. </em>He indicated that I don\u2019t know who <em>he had been contacted </em>with, <em>but that he was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>trying to see if Rule No. 1 could be taken care of and that he was hoping to get in. </em>But I don\u2019t know what conversations Mr. Randolph has had with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>I had some, I had some conversations with him. I filed, I signed over a power of attorney with him so he can see if he\u2019s going to get my money.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>So I am in the process of trying to hire a lawyer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">THE COURT: Well, what I\u2019m trying to ascertain is, <em>are you ready for trial right now or are you </em>asking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>No, I\u2019m not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">THE <em>COURT: </em>\u2014 to <em>postpone this case?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>I\u2019m asking for a postponement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">THE COURT: Okay. <em>And the State does not object to that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">MS. ARMSTRONG: <em>No, Your Honor, </em>but I would put on the record that we are prepared today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">MS. ARMSTRONG: We do have all of our witnesses. Most of them are on call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-16\">MS. ARMSTRONG: But I understand the difficulty of him going forward without an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-17\">THE COURT: Okay. <em>Then I will grant Mr. Randolph\u2019s postponement. The file is going to reflect that he has been fully advised of his rights to have counsel. I see that Judge Weinstein already did that and Judge Weinstein determined that Mr. Randolph had waived his right to be represented by counsel for today\u2019s purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-18\"><em>But since he is making attempts to have an attorney represent him, I\u2019ll grant a postponement [at] his request </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>and set this in for trial on February 18, </em>2009, at 9:30 in the morning for two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In subsection 4-215(d) terms, Judge Harrington had \u201cpermitted] the defendant to explain the appearance without counsel\u201d and presumably found that there was \u201ca meritorious reason\u201d for it, in that she granted the appellant a continuance. It was then explained to the appellant \u201cthat if counsel does not enter an appearance by that time, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">MS. ARMSTRONG: And I think it\u2019s clear to us, but <em>just so Mr. Randolph understands, if he comes to Court on February 18th without an attorney, he will go forward without an attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">THE COURT: Fes. <em>We had marked the file no further postponements.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">MS. ARMSTRONG: <em>No further Defense postponements?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">THE COURT: <em>No further postponements. </em>Everybody stay healthy and...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">MS.

Subsection (a)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">As we have already mentioned, Judge Harrington double-checked on the appellant\u2019s receipt of the indictment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">THE COURT: [Y]our are charged by indictment in one count with escape in the first degree on or about June 11, 2008. <em>Have you received a copy of the indictment?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>MR. RANDOLPH: <em>Yes, I did.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">B. Subsection (a)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">With respect to the right to counsel and the importance of counsel, Judge Harrington\u2019s advice was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Now, you are entitled to be represented by an attorney and I need to advise you pursuant to rule that an attorney could be very helpful to you in the presentation of any defenses that you might have in the preparation of your trial and actually getting witnesses if you have them to appear in Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Even if you were ultimately to be convicted of this offense, an attorney could present information which might mitigate a sentence to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">C. Subsection (a)(3):</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">With respect to the nature of the offense, Judge Harrington added to what Judge Weinstein had earlier done.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">THE COURT: Okay. And do you understand the charge, the elements of the charge and what it means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">MR. RANDOLPH: Not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t understand what it means to escape? <em>It says that you escaped from the Montgomery County Pre-Release Center which was a place of confinement, meaning that you left when you were not authorized to do so. That\u2019s what that offense means. Do you understand that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">MR. RANDOLPH: <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">On the subject of penalties, Judge Harrington actually supplemented what Judge Weinstein had earlier done. She added a mention of the possible monetary fine, whereas he had limited himself to the possible incarceration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. This is a felony offense. The maximum statutory penalty is 10 years in jail and/or a $20,000 fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">D. Subsection (a)(5):</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Whereas the reference of subsection 4-215(e) to subsection (a) is limited to (a)(l)-(4), subsection 4-215(d)\u2019s reference is to all of subsection (a), which includes (5). That\u2019s the provision that with the granting of the continuance must come the warning that \u201cif the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.\u201d This subprovision of 4-215(a) is redundant with what the general body of 4-215(d) already requires and we have discussed <em>supra </em>how it was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Judge Harrington on February 18, 2009</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">From the appellant\u2019s point of view, the axe finally fell on February 18, 2009. The case was initially brought before Judge Harrington on that day in her capacity as administrative judge. She learned that the appellant was present without a lawyer, notwithstanding that he had earlier been warned about the consequences. There was no necessity to plow that ground again. Judge Harrington assigned the case to Judge Rubin for trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">THE COURT: Good morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">MS.

ARMSTRONG: Your Honor, I guess I don\u2019t know whether anyone has ever asked the defendant whether he wishes to proceed by way of a jury or by way of a bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">MS. ARMSTRONG: He has been advised numerous times of his right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">THE COURT: Well, it doesn\u2019t hurt to go over things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">MS.

May I just give you some ground rules please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">MR. RANDOLPH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Rule 4-215 Concluded</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">It really does not matter whether we are analyzing subsection 4-215(e), as the appellant would prefer, or subsection 4-215(d), as the State would prefer, for each was independently satisfied. <em>A fortiori, </em>the amalgam of the two was doubly satisfied. Anguishing over which particular box gets to be checked is silly. When the appellant went to trial on February 18, 2009, the judges of Montgomery County had fully complied with every requirement of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel, even as implemented and amplified by Maryland Rule of Criminal Procedure 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">The Escape in a Nutshell</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">On July 11, 2008, the day of the appellant\u2019s escape, he was serving an 18-month sentence in Montgomery County that had begun on December 10, 2007, for an unrelated crime. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>had initially been at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility, a medium security facility where the inmates are literally locked up. Once a prisoner has less than 18 months to serve, however, he becomes eligible for transfer to the PreRelease Center, an extremely minimal security facility where the inmates enjoy extensive privileges. On April 20, 2008, the appellant was transferred to the Pre-Release Center. On June 11, the supervisory personnel decided that it was necessary to transfer the appellant back to the detention center, at least temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The appellant, however, did not want to go back to the detention center. When he saw one of the guards approach him with handcuffs for the transport, he suddenly ran out the door, ran down the hall, and fled the building. He claimed that he panicked and never intended to escape. He never turned himself in, however, when the panic attack was over. About five days after his initial flight, the appellant telephoned his case manager at the Pre-Release Center. Although she urged him to turn himself in and informed him that there was a warrant out for his arrest, he deliberately declined to do so. He was ultimately picked up by the police on July 8, 2008, approximately one month after his initial flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">At trial, the appellant did not contest the State\u2019s proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>His exclusive defense was the he did not have the requisite <em>mens rea </em>to escape \u201cknowingly\u201d because he was tired, under stress, and experienced a moment of panic. His direct testimony sums up the entire defense case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">I got up the next morning. I went to work, 4:00 a.m. <em>I was still tired. </em>I was still in pain. My chest was swollen. <em>I was under stress. </em>I was stressed out, been stressed out for weeks. <em>I\u2019ve been stressed out ever since I was over at the Clarksburg facility.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">The next morning, you know, well, after I came back from work, I came back from work around like 11:30. I got back. I went in the room. I laid down, little bit tired. I get up early in the morning. I laid down. I don\u2019t be out too much any way. I got a knock at my door, well, not a knock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>somebody, <em>somebody came to my door. It was Mr. O\u2019Malley. Came in and said, \u201cI need yon do'wnstairs.\u201d </em>And I asked him, I said, what is it about? He said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just come on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">Well, you know, I still had my kitchen uniform on. I just, you know, I followed him. I didn\u2019t think nothing was going on. He said come on down the room. <em>When I came down to the room, I seen two other individuals in the room. And he said, turn around, put your hands up on the wall. I said, put my hands up on this wall? I didn\u2019t know what he was doing. </em>I thought he might wanted to pat me down or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Then I, you know, <em>I looked back and I seen another individual pulling out handcuffs. </em>When I seen him pull out the handcuffs, you know, I don\u2019t know, <em>I don\u2019t kno'w what came over </em>me, you know. <em>I just kind of lost all rational ability. I wasn\u2019t thinking. And I just bolted. I just ran. </em>I wasn\u2019t thinking, I was, <em>I think my mind was somewhere else. </em>All I saw were the handcuffs and, you know, I just lost it, you know. I just wasn\u2019t thinking. <em>My whole rationality </em>of, you know, discerning what was going on <em>was out the door.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\"><em>I was already under a lot of stress and I was under duress, </em>you know. I wish I could have acted or <em>I wish I could have did something else. But, </em>like I said, <em>I was under stress. </em>And, you know, <em>sometime when you\u2019re under stress you </em>do things that you don\u2019t really, <em>wouldn\u2019t normally do if you wasn\u2019t stressed out or under duress.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Subpoenas and Compulsory Process</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The appellant contends that his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was violated when the trial court failed to ensure that his subpoenas for medical records were honored. With respect to the appellant\u2019s medical and emotional condition, the appellant successfully subpoenaed and introduced into evidence his medical records from the Suburban Hospital. He also called as defense witnesses 1) a nurse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>practitioner from the Pre-Release Center; 2) a nurse from the Correctional Facility; and 3) his unit manager from the Pre-Release Center. His complaint concerns two subpoenas, one for records from the Pre-Release Center and the other for records from the Correctional Facility. No where in the trial record do we find any express request for Judge Rubin to do anything with reference to these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">One subpoena was for Patricia Sollock as well as for what the appellant described as \u201cComplete psych report for Joe Randolph and from any other outside agencies.\u201d The Sheriffs Office records show that that subpoena was returned \u201cnon est\u201d after four attempts at service. The second subpoena about which the appellant complains was for Sylvia Hernandez, as well as certain documents from the Pre-Release Center described in the subpoena as \u201cComplete Prc File including any letters or memo written to staff or team from Joe Randolph.\u201d That subpoena was returned \u201cnon est\u201d after nine attempts at service. Notwithstanding that, Sylvia Hernandez testified as a witness for the State. She was the case manager at the Pre-Release Center. During the appellant\u2019s extensive cross-examination of Ms. Hernandez, he never once inquired about any missing records that she had failed to bring with her. When questioning Evelyn Chun, the community health nurse from the Correctional Facility, moreover, the appellant never inquired about any subpoenaed records from that institution. The present contention is clearly an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">There was no remote violation of the compulsory process clause in this case. As Judge Wilner stated for the Court of Appeals in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>345 Md. 437, 449, 693 A.2d 344 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">Nor does the right [to compulsory process] require a court to engage in a manhunt for the missing witness. It is up to the defendant to locate his or her witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In referring to the Maryland law under the <em>in pari materia </em>Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>incorporation of the compulsory process clause), <em>Wilson </em>went on to point out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">In <em>[Edmondson v. Brady, </em>188 Md. 96, 52 A.2d 96 (1947) ], the appellant, appealing from the denial of his petition for habeas corpus, complained that a witness he had subpoenaed at his trial failed to appear. He gave no reason for the nonappearance and apparently did not ask the court to take any action. <em>He simply complained about her non-appearance. </em>We rejected the complaint, holding that <em>Article 21 \u201cassures him process for witnesses but does not guarantee attendance of the witnesses.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">345 Md. at 445-46, 693 A.2d 344 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also State ex rel. Battee v. Warden, </em>191 Md. 751, 752, 60 A.2d 187 (1948); <em>Copeland v. Wright, </em>188 Md. 666, 668, 53 A.2d 553 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The <em>Wilson </em>opinion also stated emphatically that \u201cto establish a violation of the compulsory process clause, the defendant \u2018must at least make some plausible showing of how [the] testimony would have been both material and favorable to his defense.\u2019 \u201d 345 Md. at 448, 693 A.2d 344. Cf. <em>Whack v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 107, 118, 615 A.2d 1226 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In groping to show materiality, the appellant argues, \u201cIf the subpoenas had been properly complied with, and the relevant records obtained, then Appellant may have had a factual basis for entering a plea of not criminally responsible.\u201d Aside from the purely speculative nature of the suggestion, there was no plea of not criminally responsible in this case. The appellant goes on, \u201cThe pertinent records may also have triggered an inquiry by the trial court to determine Appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial under the Criminal Procedure Article, Section 3-104.\u201d Competency was not at issue in this case. The appellant concludes, \u201cFinally, the contents of the medical records may have been helpful to establish a defense to the crime of escape.\u201d The contention is based on sheer speculation. The appellant was not denied compulsory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Jury Instruction on Escape</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The appellant contends that Judge Rubin erroneously instructed the jury on the law of escape by adding to the <em>Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions </em>\u2014 Criminal, 4:11.1 the following additional language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\"><em>Knowingly means that the defendant knew his actions would result in his leaving the facility without permission. </em>Even if you find that the defendant was having problems within the facility or institution, <em>he is not entitled to resort to self help, </em>but must apply for release or other remedies through proper and regular channels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Although, incidentally, we see nothing wrong with the instruction, the short answer to the contention is that it has not been preserved for appellate review. After initially objecting to the supplemental instruction, the appellant changed tactics, \u201cI don\u2019t mind this coming in as long as I can get another instruction saying that stress and duress can be derived from it.\u201d Quite independently, Maryland Rule 4-325 provides that unless a party objects after the court has completed its instructions, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. No such objection was forthcoming here. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 97, 116, 792 A.2d 368, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 573, 801 A.2d 1033 (2002); <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 173, 180-81, 624 A.2d 1257, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The Defense of Necessity</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The appellant finally contends that he was erroneously denied a jury instruction on the defense of necessity. At trial he kept talking about duress or necessity, but he has abandoned any argument with respect to duress. As Judge Kenney pointed out for this Court in <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 131, 882 A.2d 900 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">The circuit court need not give the instruction, however, unless the defendant has produced \u201csome evidence\u201d sufficient to give rise to a jury issue on the defense. <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cWhether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge.\u201d <em>Roach v. State, </em>358 Md. 418, 428, 749 A.2d 787 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 617, 402 A.2d 115 (1979), this Court dealt with the defense of necessity in the context of the crime of escape. We quoted with approval from <em>People v. Lovercamp, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 823, 118 Cal.Rptr. 110 (1975), which explained the type of extreme situations which might sometimes excuse an escape on the basis of a truly dire necessity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u201c[RJather early in the legal history of the offense of escape, it became clear that all departures from lawful custody were not necessarily escapes or, to put it more accurately, there was a possible defense to an escape charge, to wit, necessity. In 1 Hale P.C. 611 (1736), it was written that <em>if a prison caught fire and a prisoner departed to save his life, the necessity to save his life \u2018excuseth the felony. \u2019 </em>So, too, we may assume that <em>a prisoner with his back to the wall, facing a gang of fellow inmates approaching him with drawn knives, who are making it very clear that they intend to kill him, might be expected to go over the wall rather than remain and be a martyr to the principle of prison discipline.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The <em>Robinson, </em>opinion went on, 42 Md.App. at 621-22, 402 A.2d 115, to set out the necessary elements for the availability of the necessity defense in an escape case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\"><em>[A] limited defense of necessity </em>is available to an individual charged with the crime of escape <em>if the following conditions exist:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201c(1) <em>The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints which makes any result from such complaints illusory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(3) There is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other \u2018innocent\u2019 persons in the escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">(5) <em>The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.'\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">We think these guidelines represent a sound and reasonable approach to the problems arising in our prison institutions which may occasionally force upon a member of the prison population <em>a choice between escaping or subjecting himself to death or serious bodily harm. </em>A person charged with the crime of escape should have available to him the defense of necessity or compulsion if he can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the judge or jury that <em>the facts surrounding his escape fall strictly unthin the guidelines </em>set out above in <em>Lovercamp.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 413, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980), the case on which the appellant relies heavily, the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201ca defendant accused of escape is not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of necessity unless he proffered testimony of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed duress or necessity had lost its coercive force.\u201d In <em>Craddock v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 513, 516, 424 A.2d 168 (1981), this Court upheld a trial court\u2019s refusal to provide a necessity instruction where the appellant had testified that he feared being shot by authorities if he had surrendered but where he was only actually returned to custody after his capture in Georgia approximately one month subsequent to his escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">If nothing else, the appellant clearly failed the fifth <em>Robinson </em>test. As Judge Rubin explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\"><em>[Ajmong other items that need to be shown, </em>before the Court must instruct the jury on that matter, <em>is that the person made a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed </em>duress or <em>necessity had lost its coercive force. </em>That was decided by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>in <em>Bailey. </em>It\u2019s adopted in <em>Craddock </em>by the Court of Special Appeals. And was adopted by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Samo.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">Here the evidence is such that <em>even if one assumes without deciding there was the stress of the moment </em>if you will when Mr. Randolph saw the handcuffs and decided or reacted in his view to the notion that, well, he wasn\u2019t going back to Clarksburg, didn\u2019t want to go back to Clarksburg, <em>there is no question here that after the event, that is to say the leaving of the facility, </em>we don\u2019t have to call it an escape, but the <em>leaving of the facility for a substantial period of time during which there was a cooling off, </em>the defendant had conversations with his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\"><em>The defendant called his counselor at the facility </em>to, my words not his, \u201csort of feel out\u201d the situation. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll happen if I come back?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll happen if I stay out?\u201d <em>There is clearly, there was deliberation and thoughtfulness and coolness on his part.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">So <em>at the very least that element is not made out by the evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The appellant also, of course, failed the first <em>Robinson </em>test. Again, Judge Rubin explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">So what I\u2019m going to say is even if you find that the defendant was having problems with the institution, <em>he is not entitled to resort to self help </em>but must apply for his release or, I\u2019m going to add, or other remedies through regular channels, because I think that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\"><em>If somebody is at an institution and they\u2019re having problems, it happens. They have rights of redress. </em>You can file, I told you this in the beginning, you can proceed administratively. You can sue everybody. You can bring a class action. You can follow suit under section \u2014 The point is you have rights. <em>But one of the rights is not just to leave. You have rights, but it doesn\u2019t include, \u201cI\u2019m checking out of the hotel. \u201d That it doesn\u2019t include.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">There was no factual basis to support a necessity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\">. In the circumstances of this case, it is hard to imagine how Judge Weinstein could have forced counsel upon the appellant without doing violence to the appellant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to self-representation. In <em>Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. 623, 634, 980 A.2d 435 (2009), Judge Harrell referred to the at-times uneasy coexistence within the Sixth Amendment of two sometimes conflicting rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">The right of a defendant in a criminal case to counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.... The right to counsel seeks to protect a defendant from the complexities of the legal system and his or her lack of understanding of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\"><em>Defendants, </em>however, <em>have the corresponding right to proceed without the assistance of counsel.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Gregg v. State, </em>377 Md. 515, 548, 833 A.2d 1040 (2003) (\"[T]he Sixth Amendment ... grants the accused not only the right to be represented by counsel, but also the right to make his own defense <em>without </em>the assistance of counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">What Judge Harrell called a \"corresponding right,\u201d the Supreme Court has referred to as a \"correlative right.\u201d In <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835-36, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the Supreme Court made it clear that an overly zealous protection of the right to counsel should not manifest itself in diminished protection for the corresponding or correlative right to self-representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">Here, weeks before trial, <em>Faretta clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself and did not want counsel. </em>The record affirmatively shows that <em>Faretta was literate, competent, understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will. </em>The trial judge had warned Faretta that he thought it was a mistake not to accept the assistance of counsel, and that Faretta would be required to follow all the \"ground rules\u201d of trial procedure.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\"><em>In forcing Faretta, </em>under these circumstances, <em>to accept against his will a state-appointed public defender, the California courts deprived him of his constitutional right to conduct his own defense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The caselaw, to be sure, favors the right to counsel and, therefore, insists upon an intelligent and voluntary waiver of it before the corresponding right to self-representation will be recognized. In implementing this favor, however, a sensitive balancing is called for. To go overboard in one direction inevitably sends a chilling message in the other direction. The bonds circumscribing the waiver of the right to counsel should not be drawn so tight that they choke the life out of the right to self-representation. The overly excessive, if not indeed obsessive, protection of one right can end up doing violence to a corresponding right. An insightful sensitivity to this need for balance was shown by the dissenting opinion of Judge Murphy in <em>Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. at 644-45, 980 A.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, established the sensitive border line between the competing constitutional rights at the classic waiver standard of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 \u2014 65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). That is the line beyond which the court may not stray in either direction without violating one or the other of the correlative rights. The Court of Appeals recognized the critical importance of this dividing line in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 414, 676 A.2d 513 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">If the defendant requests dismissal of counsel in order to proceed <em>pro se, </em>and if the proposal to discharge counsel is timely and unequivocal, the court must ordinarily grant the request. <em>Faretta. ... </em>Although courts have recognized several exceptions to the <em>Faretta </em>rule, these <em>exceptions have been narrowly construed to effectuate the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation. </em>Absent a recognized exception, <em>refusal to grant a timely unequivocal request for self-representation is reversible error.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">At least twice, however, the Court of Appeals has acknowledged that its interpretation of Rule 4-215 is deliberately tilted in favor of the right to counsel. <em>State v. Wischhusen, </em>342 Md. 530, 543 n. 10, 677 A.2d 595 (1996) (\"Rule 4-215 imposes requirements that exceed constitutional standards.\u201d); <em>Richardson v. State, </em>381 Md. 348, 367 n. 11, 849 A.2d 487 (2004) (\"It is important to note that Rule 4-215 imposes requirements that exceed constitutional standards.\u201d). To provide extra protection for the right to counsel is, <em>ipso facto, </em>to reduce protection for the correlative right to self-representation. In <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 244, 934 A.2d 1059 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 Md. 614, 943 A.2d 1245 (2008), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">With respect to such excess coverage, it is clear that a defendant who wishes to represent himself and who has satisfied <em>Faretta, Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>and <em>Adams </em>[v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942)] but who has failed to satisfy one of the non-constitutional provisions of Rule 4-215 could be denied his constitutional right to <em>pro se </em>representation if the rule of court were permitted to \"trump\u201d the constitutional principle. <em>It is inconceivable that the Supreme Court would countenance such a thumb on the scales of its finely calibrated balancing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Indeed, an alternative holding in <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. at 246, 934 A.2d 1059, was that such a tilting of the scales would be unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">Our alternative holding with respect to this contention would be that <em>if a provision of Rule 4-215 were violated and that provision were in excess of the constitutional requirements for an effective waiver, that provision </em>of the rule <em>would not be permitted to stand </em>against what would otherwise be an entitlement to the Sixth Amendment right to self-representation <em>according to established constitutional criteria.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVu\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\"><em>. </em>By way, perhaps, of carrying coals to Newcastle, we also note that the indictment was filed September 11, 2008. The case file also contains a Record of Service from the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office, attesting that the charging documents were served on the appellant at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility on October 16, 2008, at 11:05 A.M. There is also in the file an Initial Appearance Report in the District Court informing the appellant of the charge against him and expressly advising him, on two separate pages, of his entitlement to an attorney, including explicit instructions for contacting the Office of the Public Defender. Both pages are signed by the appellant and dated August 15, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
