BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">This appeal is brought by H. B. Zachry Company pursuant to a petition for review of a decision of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) in favor of the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The Occupational Safety and Health citation alleged that Zachry had committed a serious violation of the Act by allowing its mobil crane to come within 10 feet of energized electrical transmission lines thus creating a hazard of electrical shock. An order of abatement and a $700 penalty was assessed against Zachry. Finding substantial evidence in the record to support the decision and order of the Administrative Law Judge and Commission, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-17\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b877-18\">The facts which gave rise to the penalty imposed by the Secretary and affirmed by the Commission are uncontroverted. Zachry is a general contractor engaged in world-wide construction with its principal place of business at San Antonio, Texas. Early in 1976, Zachry was engaged in construction at the Sooner Dam and Power Plant project near Pawnee, Oklahoma.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At approximately eight o\u2019clock on the morning of February 11, 1976, one of Zachry\u2019s crane operators, Raymond Kitchens, was ordered by his immediate supervisors to transport a load of pipe from a storage area to an excavation site \u2014 -a distance of several hundred feet. Located approximately 28 feet above this pathway were uninsulated energized electrical transmission lines carrying 7,000 to 7,200 watts of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">The load was secured by steel cables attached to the end of the pipe, wrapped around, and then fastened to a hook on the boom of the crane. With this load attached, the boom rested at an angle of about 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 with a length including the jib of approximately 48 to 50 feet. Two employees, Tobias and Fragu were assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>to assist Kitchens in this moving operation by holding the ends of the pipe to stabilize it. As the load was being transported across the work site, the jib of the mobil crane<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> came into contact with one of the transmission lines fatally electrocuting To-bias and seriously injuring Fragu.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The following morning, Roger Jackson, an OSHA compliance officer commenced an on-site investigation pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 657(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on this investigation, the Secretary of Labor issued a citation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on February 27, 1976, which alleged that Zachry had committed a serious violation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of 29 C.F.R. 1926.550(a)(15)(i)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by failing to maintain a minimum clearance of ten feet between energized electrical transmission lines and the crane or its load, thus creating the hazard of electrical shock. The citation was accompanied by the Secretary\u2019s recommendation of a $700 penalty and an order of immediate abatement of the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Zachry timely contested the citation and proposed penalty pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both at the administrative hearing on July 20, 1976, and now before this Court, Zachry challenges the citation and penalty on three grounds. First, since the citation and complaint<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allege an \u201cinspection\u201d rather than \u201cinvestigation\u201d of the work site, the Secretary should not have been allowed to amend the complaint and present evidence relating to the crane accident. Second, the cited standard (see note 6. <em>supra) </em>is not applicable to the operation which was being performed at the time of the accident. And, more importantly, the company should not be held liable for an employee\u2019s unforeseeable negligence when it has adequately trained and supervised its employees in this particular area of safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) by decision and order of October 26, 1976, affirmed the Secretary\u2019s citation and $700 penalty. The same results were reached by the Review Commission on January 31, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">\n<em>Our Review Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">In considering Zachry\u2019s request to set aside the Commission\u2019s decision, we are mindful of the broad scope and remedial purpose of OSH A. <em>Atlas Roofing Co. v. OSHA, </em>430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977), <em>aff\u2019g </em>518 F.2d 990 (5th Cir. 1975). We are also bound by that body\u2019s findings on questions of fact and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole even if this Court could justifiably reach a different result de novo. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> e. <em>g., American Petroleum Insti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>tute v.

We now proceed with a careful analysis of the record in order to evaluate Zachry\u2019s three challenges in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Was <em>Amendment To Complaint Proper?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1J\">The ALJ and Commission rejected Zachry\u2019s claim of prejudice due to the allowance of an amendment to OSHA\u2019s complaint at the time of the hearing. With this amendment which added the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d to \u201cinspection\u201d <em>(see </em>notes 4 and 8, <em>supra) </em>the ALJ admitted evidence at the hearing concerning the fatal accident. Zachry urges a violation of constitutional due process by allowing the Secretary to proceed under a citation which originally alleged an \u201cinspection\u201d and then introduce evidence obtained on an \u201cinvestigation\u201d\u2014 Kitchens\u2019 testimony. Zachry\u2019s position is that the Secretary should have been limited to producing evidence concerning only the actual observations of the compliance officer and, furthermore, that OSHA investigative procedures do not provide for the issuance of civil citations as a result of an \u201cinspection\u201d. Consequently, Zachry should not have received the citation issued and the one which it did receive did not permit it to adequately prepare its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">We adopt the observations made by the ALJ and Commission that Zachry was not unduly prejudiced. It is obvious from the OSHA investigative report that Zachry was fully aware that the purpose of the complaint officer\u2019s visit was to investigate the accident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, this Court has previously held that after-the-fact observations and investigations made by OSHA officials have evidentiary weight. <em>Texports Stevedore Co. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>484 F.2d 465 (5th Cir. 1973). Obviously, since this subsequent amendment would neither have surprised nor hindered Zachry in the preparation of its defense, we think that it was within the discretion of the ALJ to allow the amendment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">We dispose of Zachry\u2019s second point quickly by referring to \u00a7 9(a) of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 658(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides that \u201cupon <em>io</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>spection or investigation </em>the Secretary shall issue a citation to the employer when the Secretary believes the Act has been violated.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The express language of the Act unquestionably controls over other sections of the Secretary\u2019s Field Operations Manual which Zachry cites as support for its proposition that OSHA investigation procedures do not provide for issuance of citations as a result of an investigation. In addition, the ALJ and Commission concluded that the adoption of Zachry\u2019s reasoning that an \u201cinvestigation\u201d could not lead to the issuance of citations would \u201cseriously undercut\u201d the enforcement scheme of \u00a7 9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\n<em>Did Cited Regulation Apply?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Zachry next challenges the cited regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.550(a)(15)(i) (see Appendix I) as inapplicable to \u201cmobil cranes\u201d. Zachry attacks the provision on three grounds. First, subsection (a) (entitled General Requirement), of \u00a7 550 (entitled Crane and Derrick) applies to all cranes, but requires only that they be operated in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. A careful look at the statute reveals that subsection (a) heads the list of 18 general crane safety provisions which include paragraphs (1) through (15), under which Zachry was cited. It makes no sense to conclude that only general requirements of .550(a) applicable to all cranes, applies only to paragraph (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Secondly, according to Zachry, mobil cranes are specifically mentioned in another regulatory section \u2014 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-550(b)(2) which was not cited by the Secretary. Based upon <em>Diamond Roofing v. OSHA, </em>528 F.2d 645 (5th Cir. 1976), Zachry adopts the reasoning that where a term is carefully employed in one section and excluded in another it should not be implied where excluded. <em>Diamond, </em>528 F.2d at 648. Therefore, the Secretary failed to allege or prove any violation of the specific standard applicable to mobil cranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">We reject Zachry\u2019s reasoning and misplaced reliance on Diamond\u2019s rationale which is not controlling in the instant case. The ALJ and the Commission, as we do, read <em>Diamond </em>to stand for the proposition that when terms with \u201cdistinct meanings\u201d are employed together in one place and not together in another, that the latter instance should be construed as an intent to exclude the omitted term. In the present case, the ALJ and the Commission reasoned that the terms \u201cequipment and machines\u201d found in the cited standard are general or inclusive terms encompassing the more specific term \u201cmobil cranes\u201d. Therefore, the use of these terms, \u201cequipment and machines,\u201d did not meet the <em>Diamond </em>situation of \u201cdistinct meanings\u201d apart from mobil cranes. Clearly, the cited standard applies to all cranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Additionally, there is nothing in .550(d) which would lead us to reach the conclusion that the general requirements of .550(a) have no application to the types of cranes enumerated in .550(b). Absent such language, .550(a) must be held to apply to mobil cranes because they are cranes. Besides, .550(b) does not pertain to the safe operation of mobil cranes and electrical transmission lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Finally, Zachry complains that the cited standard does not apply to mobil cranes where they are actually moving and carrying a load. Zachry attempts to imply that since paragraph (15)(iii) provides specific minimum clearance for cranes in transit without a load and boom lowered, (15)(i) &amp; (ii) cannot apply to cranes in transit <em>with </em>a load.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Where the Commission has given the regulation an interpretation well within the plain meaning of its terms, our standard of review is whether the Commission\u2019s reading is unreasonable or inconsistent with the regulation\u2019s purpose. <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Fiegen, </em>513 F.2d 713, 716 (8th Cir. 1975). <em>E. g. Udall v. Talman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616, 625 (1965). T. <em>Roy Bryant Cattle Co. v. United States, </em>463 F.2d 418, 420 (5th Cir. 1972). This Court has held that the \u201cpromulgator\u2019s interpretation is controlling as long as it is one of several reasonable interpretations, although it may not appear as reasonable as some other.\u201d <em>Brennan v. Southern Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number><em>tractors Service, </em>492 F.2d 498, 501 (5th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">It is more logical and in keeping with the standard\u2019s terms and its purpose<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to find (15)(iii) as an <em>exception </em>\u2014 only when a crane is in transit without a load \u2014 to the general rules of (15)(i) &amp; (ii) concerning minimum clearance between cranes and electrical transmission lines whether or not the crane is loaded or in transit. It is doubtful that (15)(iii) would have been needed if (i) &amp; (ii) were intended only to regulate cranes operating in a stationary position. For these reasons, we follow the ALJ and Commission in concluding that the cited standard does apply to the operation being performed by Zachry\u2019s mobil crane at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Was <em>The Affirmative Defense Made Out?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Zachry\u2019s final challenge and principal defense against the Secretary\u2019s citation is that it could not reasonably have prevented the isolated, negligent misconduct of crane operator Kitchens because the company had adequately trained and supervised its employees in this area of safety. In order to prevail in this defense, an employer must demonstrate that (i) all feasible steps were taken to avoid the occurrence of the hazard, <em>General Dynamic v. OSHRC, </em>599 F.2d 453, 451 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Horne Plumbing and Heating Co. v. OSHRC, </em>528 F.2d at 571. This includes the training of employees as to the dangers and the supervision of the work site, <em>Horne, </em>528 F.2d 56 at 569. And (ii) the actions of the employee were a departure from a uniformly and effectively communicated and enforced work rule of which departure the employer had neither actual nor constructive knowledge. <em>See, e. g., General Dynamics, </em>559 F.2d at 465; <em>Ames Crane and Rental Service, Inc. v. Dunlock, </em>536 F.2d 123 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">When faced with this defense, reviewing-courts have consistently looked at the record evidence of the employer\u2019s safety program. In the present case, testimony at the hearings by Zachry\u2019s safety director described the company\u2019s safety program as including (i) the showing of safety films, (ii) regular scheduled safety meetings, and (iii) the distribution of safety bulletins and materials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The manual and materials included work rules, one of which required crane operators to maintain a minimum distance of ten feet from energized overhead wires as well as a rule requiring the assignment of a flag person to assist cranes moving over the job site.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Zachry submitted evidence that Kitchens had signed and received these various company publications and that he had been exposed to numerous safety bulletins and films. On cross-examination, Kitchens testified that he had previously been warned about that particular power line and was familiar with the company\u2019s ten foot clearance instructions. Photographs introduced into evidence depict the ten foot clearance warning signs which were painted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>inside and outside of the operator\u2019s crane cab and posted around the work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Although there is substantial evidence that Zachry had a safety program and work rules requiring cranes to maintain a minimum of ten feet clearance from energized power lines, the ALJ and Commission found deficiencies in the communication and enforcement of the rule. Kitchens testified that he skipped about one-half of the regularly scheduled safety meetings yet would sign an attendance roster for fear that he would lose his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">An even more glaring deficiency was the inadequacy of supervision given Kitchens and his two helpers the day of the accident. Zachry\u2019s \u201cSupervisor\u2019s Rules for Safe Operation of Cranes\u201d stated the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">1. Power cranes and excavators are powerful and complex machines. Your complete attention to control is required every minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">2. You \u2014 as the man responsible for all operations under your control \u2014 are the crucial key to safe machine performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">3. Do not operate or allow to be operated any machine under your control until you fully understand the operator\u2019s manual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Zachry Exhibit-B at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">According to the uncontradicted testimony of Kitchens, his supervisor was actually present when he began loading the pipes on the crane. Practically speaking, it is undisputed that the only way the ten foot minimum clearance standard could have been met was by shortening the cables which were wrapped around the pipes. The fact that the supervisor apparently failed to instruct Kitchens to make that adjustment or to specifically designate one of the two helpers to give hand signals to Kitchens, (see, note 15, <em>supra) </em>permits the inference that the supervisor lacked familiarity with the manual's rules.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This fact becomes particularly significant since this was Kitchens\u2019 first attempt to carry a load with this particular crane under these power lines. Apparently, the ALJ and Commission found Kitchens was given little guidance and instruction \u2014 evidence which independently demonstrates the ineffective communication and enforcement of the company work rules. Further, this Court has previously stated the \u201cbehavior of supervisory personnel sets an example at the work place, an employer has \u2014 if anything a <em>heightened </em>duty to ensure the proper conduct of such personnel,\u201d <em>Floyd S. Pike Electrical Contractors Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>576 F.2d 72, 77 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>citing National Realty and Construction Company, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>489 F.2d 1257, 1267 n. 38 (5th Cir. 1973). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the supervisor was familiar with this particular company rule, his noncompliance with it is additional evidence that the implementation of the rule was lax. <em>Id. </em>Thus the company\u2019s attempted defense of employee negligent misconduct fails because of the employer\u2019s inability to establish to the satisfaction of the factfinder that it effectively communicated and enforced work rules which were necessary to ensure compliance with OSHA standards.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Because we find substantial evidence in the record as a whole that (i) the amended complaint did not prejudice Zachry\u2019s defense against the Secretary\u2019s citation, (ii) the Secretary reasonably interpreted the cited standard to apply to mobil cranes in transit with a load, and (iii) Zachry failed in establishing the defense of negligent employee misconduct because of its ineffectual communication and enforcement of company work rules which were needed to comply with OSHA standards, we sustain the findings of the ALJ and the final order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Subpart N \u2014 Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators, and Conveyors</p>\n<p id=\"AM4\">\u00a7 1926.550 Cranes and derricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">(a) <em>General requirements. </em>(1) The employer shall comply with the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and limitations applicable to the operation of any and all cranes and derricks.

Since Zachry did not qualify for the employee misconduct affirmative defense, its contention that the citation should be vacated because the record does not demonstrate that the company with the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known of the presence of the violation is meritless. An examination of the elements of the employee misconduct affirmative defense reveals that it is designed to demonstrate that an employer exercised reasonable diligence by providing adequate safety training and supervision to its employees. Thus, an employer\u2019s inability to establish the adequacy of the safety instructions to his employee shows a failure to exercise reasonable diligence. In a case involving the same standard as the case at bar, the Court rejected the employer\u2019s defense of employee misconduct, finding that the company had failed to \u201ctake adequate precautionary steps to instruct and train employees to protect against reasonable foreseeable dangers,\u201d <em>Ames Crane and Rental Service, </em>532 F.2d at 125.
