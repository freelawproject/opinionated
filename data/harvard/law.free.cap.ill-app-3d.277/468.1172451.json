On appeal, defendant claims the trial court erred in these decisions: (1) denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress identification testimony; (2) refusing to sever his trial from a codefendant\u2019s trial; (3) denying his challenge against a venireperson for cause; (4) permitting the State to offer witnesses for modus operandi testimony; (5) overruling defendant\u2019s objection to testimony that violated a motion in limine; (6) allowing the State to introduce testimony on the recovery of weapons and valuables; (7) preventing defendant from presenting testimony that he had worked as an undercover agent in the past; (8) denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of the speedy trial statute; and (9) sentencing defendant to 15 years of incarceration.</p> <p id=\"b489-11\" pgmap=\"489\">We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b489-12\" pgmap=\"489\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b489-13\" pgmap=\"489\">On September 8, 1991, at 2:20 p.m., three men committed an armed robbery at the Order of Sarafina Church, a predominantly Nigerian congregation located at 5129 North Broadway, Chicago. A few minutes after the robbery, defendant was arrested after being cornered by church members near where the incident occurred. Defendant had suffered a head wound and was bandaged at a hospital before arriving at the police station.</p> <p id=\"b490-3\" pgmap=\"490\">At the station, defendant gave information to Officer Michael Cronin that formed the basis of a search warrant for codefendant Robert Brandon. Police searched Mr. Brandon\u2019s apartment and discovered proceeds from the robbery and several weapons. A lineup with defendant was held at 8 p.m. on September 8, 1991, about five hours after the robbery. Defendant wore the same clothing he had when arrested, and he also had the hospital bandage around his head. Three witnesses identified the defendant from the lineup as one of the perpetrators. Defendant was held in custody and indicted for the robbery, as were codefendants Mr. Brandon and Anterio Charles.</p> <p id=\"b490-4\" pgmap=\"490\">The previous week, on September 1, 1991, at 3 p.m., a robbery had occurred at the Celestial Church of Christ, a predominantly Nigerian congregation located at 7117 North Ravenswood in Chicago. On September 9, 1991, two witnesses from that robbery identified the defendant in a lineup. Proceeds from this robbery were also recovered from Mr. Brandon\u2019s apartment.</p> <p id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">On April 15, 1992, defendant filed motions to suppress his statement to Officer Cronin and to suppress the identifications. The motions were continued by agreement until July 14, 1992, when the defendant was ready to proceed, but the State requested another continuance, which was opposed by the defendant. The court granted the continuance until September 16, 1992, at which time the State stated it needed another continuance because a witness to defendant\u2019s statements was on military furlough until October. That continuance, opposed by the defendant, was granted until October 5, 1992. On October 6, 1992, the State\u2019s missing witness testified that police questioning of defendant had continued after defendant had invoked his right to remain silent. The court continued the motion to suppress the statements but denied the motion to suppress the identifications.</p> <p id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">On October 6, 1992, the defendant also presented a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 103 \u2014 5(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/103 \u2014 5(a) (West 1992)), arguing that the State had not brought him to trial within 120 days from the date he was taken into custody. Defendant included 44 days before his pretrial motions and the 79 days after July 14, 1992, when he opposed further continuances by the State. Although the trial court believed the State responsible for the delay after July 14, 1992, the court held that the defendant wanted the State to respond to his motions before proceeding to trial, and thus the statute was tolled the entire time the State was responding to the defendant\u2019s motions.</p> <p id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490(12) 491(71)\">On May 18, 1993, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to use other crimes evidence. On June 1, 1993, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion in limine suppressing the defendant\u2019s statements until such time as he testified, after which they could be used to impeach him. The same day, defendant requested that his trial be severed from that of codefendant Brandon, but his request was denied. On June 2, 1993, the State agreed to sever Mr. Charles\u2019 case from that of defendant.</p> <p id=\"b491-4\" pgmap=\"491\">On June 3, 1993, Mr. Brandon requested new counsel, and when that request was denied, he requested to proceed pro se. Mr. Brandon did not participate in jury selection, and the trial court allowed defendant to use two of Mr. Brandon\u2019s unused peremptory challenges. Mr. Brandon also ignored several orders of the court, culminating in a citation for contempt and a six-month prison sentence. Defendant renewed his request for severance, which was again denied. Opening statements were given on June 4, 1993. On June 7, 1993, before the State began presenting evidence, the trial court declared a mistrial as to Mr. Brandon due to continued difficulties of his pro se representation. Defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied.</p> <p id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">At trial, five witnesses described the robbery at issue and five other witnesses testified as to the circumstances of the robbery at the Celestial Church of Christ the previous week. For the robbery of the Sarafina Church, witnesses claimed that while Brandon and Charles went around the church collecting valuables, defendant stood as a lookout brandishing a gun at the church entrance and shielding himself with a baby. Witnesses of the previous church robbery described defendant, Brandon, and Charles proceeding in a manner very similar to that of the Sarafina Church robbery. Defendant testified that he had been on his way to the Sarafina Church when congregation members ran out and screamed that defendant\u2019s friend had taken their money, after which defendant ran but was caught and beaten. The jury convicted the defendant of armed robbery, and he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment.</p> <p id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491\">OPINION</p> <p id=\"b491-7\" pgmap=\"491\">I</p> <p id=\"b491-8\" pgmap=\"491(73) 492(77)\">Defendant first argues that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress identifications from lineups which he alleges were unduly suggestive. The determination as to whether a pretrial confrontation in a specific instance is so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification as to deny due process depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it. (People v. Richardson (1988), 123 Ill. 2d 322, 348, 528 N.E.2d 612.) Defendant bears the burden of proving that a lineup procedure was impermissibly suggestive and resulted in the denial of due process. (Richardson, 123 Ill. 2d at 348.) The admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its ruling should be upheld absent a clear abuse of discretion. People v. Medrano (1995), 271 Ill. App. 3d 97, 103, 648 N.E.2d 218; People v. Stone (1993), 244 Ill. App. 3d 881, 893, 614 N.E.2d 293.</p> <p id=\"b492-4\" pgmap=\"492\"> Defendant first contends that his bandage and his clothes rendered the lineup impermissibly suggestive. As to the bandage, participants in a lineup need not be physically identical. (Richardson, 123 Ill. 2d at 350 (defendant had the only \" 'Afro\u2019 hairstyle\u201d).) This court has specifically held that bandages are not impermissibly suggestive so long as the bandages were not present when the witness first viewed the defendant, which was the situation in this matter. (People v. Morissette (1986), 150 Ill. App. 3d 431, 437, 501 N.E.2d 781.) As to the clothes, defendant believes he was prejudiced because his clothes matched those of descriptions given by the witnesses. However, there is no requirement that police find matching clothes for everyone in the lineup. (People v. Johnson (1991), 222 Ill. App. 3d 1, 8, 582 N.E.2d 1331 (no error when defendant was only person in lineup with red pants matching witness\u2019 description).) Defendant relies on People v. Franklin (1974), 22 Ill. App. 3d 775, 317 N.E.2d 611, but in that case the police made the defendant change into clothes that matched the witness\u2019 description, and thus Franklin is inapposite to the circumstances in this matter. Therefore, we find that the lineups were not impermissibly suggestive.</p> <p id=\"b492-5\" pgmap=\"492\">Even assuming arguendo that any of the pretrial identification procedures were impermissibly suggestive, the identifications were still admissible because the totality of circumstances clearly and convincingly established that those identifications had an independent origin in the witnesses\u2019 memories of events at the time of the crime. {Richardson, 123 111. 2d at 350.) Factors relevant to this determination include: the witness\u2019 opportunity to view the suspect at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the suspect, the witness\u2019 level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. (Richardson, 123 Ill. 2d at 350.) Examining these factors, we conclude that the lineup witnesses who identified defendant had ample opportunity to view the defendant and were paying very close attention, the length of time between the crime and confrontation was short, and none of the witnesses who identified defendant expressed doubt about their identifications. Thus, we find that any possible error was cured under the totality of the circumstances.</p> <p id=\"AlD\" pgmap=\"493\">II</p> <p id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\"> Defendant argues that he was denied a fair trial by the court\u2019s decisions to deny a severance or mistrial after Brandon\u2019s behavior. Generally, defendants who are jointly indicted are to be jointly tried unless a separate trial is necessary to avoid prejudice to one of the defendants. (People v. Mahaffey (1995), 165 Ill. 2d 445, 469, 651 N.E.2d 174.) Because of Brandon\u2019s mistrial before the presentation of any evidence, defendant suffered no prejudice before his separate trial became a fact.</p> <p id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">As to defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, the decision to declare a mistrial rests within the discretion of the trial court, and it is a power that should be exercised with great caution. (Illinois v. Sommerville (1973), 410 U.S. 458, 461, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425, 429, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 1069.) Although defendant suffered no direct prejudice from Brandon\u2019s actions, defendant relies on People v. Grignon (1976), 37 Ill. App. 3d 418, 346 N.E.2d 82. In Grignon, the court held it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to declare a joint mistrial where members of the jury may have believed a prejudicial statement about a codefendant actually referred to the defendant. (Grignon, 37 Ill. App. 3d at 426.) However, in this matter, there was no such confusion, and thus Grignon is inapposite and the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p> <p id=\"b493-6\" pgmap=\"493\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b493-7\" pgmap=\"493\">Defendant next claims that the trial court should have excluded venireperson John Taylor for cause. The following colloquy took place at jury selection:</p> <blockquote id=\"b493-8\" pgmap=\"493\">\"THE COURT: Is there anything about the fact that the location of the alleged robbery is a church that would affect any of your abilities to be fair and impartial jurors?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-9\" pgmap=\"493\">MR. TAYLOR: I have a problem with that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-10\" pgmap=\"493\">THE COURT: Everyone else except Mr. Taylor indicated no.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-11\" pgmap=\"493\">MR. TAYLOR: The reason being I hold a position of deacon in my church. I handle money and I pay tithes. It\u2019s important to me. Because of where the \u2014 location of where the alleged offense, whatever you call it, I have a problem with that from a spiritual viewpoint.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-12\" pgmap=\"493\">THE COURT: All right. Well, from a spiritual point of view, Mr. Taylor, certainly from a spiritual point of view people are presumed innocent. Would you agree?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-13\" pgmap=\"493\">MR. TAYLOR: I agree with you. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b493-14\" pgmap=\"493\">THE COURT: All right. If someone committed an armed robbery on the street or in the church it would be against the law.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-4\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: No matter where the robbery occurred; is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-6\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: That\u2019s true.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: If the robbery allegedly occurred on the street do you believe that you can give both sides a fair trial?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: All right. Now, you are saying because of the fact that it is alleged to have occurred in a church that you don\u2019t think you can fairly listen to the evidence, the arguments, and my instructions on the law and decide the case based upon those things putting aside the location where the offense occurred?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-10\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: Well, what I am saying is yes, I can listen to it; but knowing that in the church, knowing my commitment to tithing and, you know, something like that to happen in the church, which is in my opinion the [L]ord\u2019s money, I have a problem with that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-11\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Taylor. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re disagreeing, Mr. Taylor, the point is not where the offense occurred, but the point is did the offense occur no matter where it occurred.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-12\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-13\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: That\u2019s the issue for you to consider, did the offense occur. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-14\" pgmap=\"494\">MR TAYLOR: I understand.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-15\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: For yourself putting aside the fact that it appeared or occurred in a church, I don\u2019t think you are in disagreement with me. You are saying you think it\u2019s terrible to take money in church or anyone [sic], but because you have a commitment to a church you think it\u2019s maybe more egregious that it happened in a church?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-16\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: I don\u2019t disagree with you.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-17\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-18\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: Just a very most unfortunate incident under those circumstances.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-19\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: All right. Are you saying you can\u2019t be fair? Are you saying you can\u2019t follow the law because of the location where it occurred?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-20\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: I will do my best.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-21\" pgmap=\"494\">THE COURT: Well, all right. I\u2019m asking, Mr. Taylor \u2014 I think you know exactly what I am asking.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-22\" pgmap=\"494\">MR. TAYLOR: I will follow the law. You know, I will follow the law. I\u2019m giving you my opinion, that\u2019s all.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b494-23\" pgmap=\"494(45) 495(16)\">THE COURT: All right. If you will follow the law that is all I can ask of you, to follow the law. *** If you can do that then that is all I\u2019m asking you to do, sir, not asking you to put aside any religious belief or conviction, anything like that. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. Do you understand me?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-3\" pgmap=\"495\">MR. TAYLOR: I understand.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-4\" pgmap=\"495\">THE COURT: Do you believe you can do that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495\">MR. TAYLOR: I can do it.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b495-6\" pgmap=\"495\">The party challenging the venire member must show the actual existence of a disqualifying state of mind as will raise the presumption of partiality. (People v. Reid (1995), 272 Ill. App. 3d 301, 307, 649 N.E.2d 593; People v. Johnson (1992), 149 Ill. 2d 118, 138, 594 N.E.2d 253.) In reviewing a decision whether to excuse a venireperson for cause, it is necessary to consider the venireperson\u2019s statements as a whole and not in isolation. (People v. Taylor (1995), 166 Ill. 2d 414, 421, 655 N.E.2d 901.) The circuit court is in a superior position to ascertain the meaning that a venireperson intends to convey where there are inconsistencies in the answers he or she has given. (Taylor, 166 Ill. 2d at 421.) The determination of whether to allow a challenge for cause is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. Taylor, 166 Ill. 2d at 421-22.</p> <p id=\"b495-7\" pgmap=\"495\">Applying these principles, we find the trial court was within its discretion in concluding that Taylor\u2019s statements as a whole did not show a disqualifying state of mind. Although Taylor gave one equivocal answer \u2014 \"I will do my best\u201d to follow the law \u2014 after that Taylor stated three times that he could successfully follow the law as presented to him. An equivocal response by a prospective juror does not necessitate striking the prospective juror for cause where the prospective juror later states that he will try to disregard his bias. (People v. Hobley (1994), 159 Ill. 2d 272, 297, 637 N.E.2d 992 (not error to refuse dismissal for cause where one juror first stated she would \"try to\u201d follow applicable law and another juror first \"guessed\u201d she could follow applicable law).) The trial judge went into substantial detail with Mr. Taylor and had the best opportunity to observe his demeanor, and thus we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion.</p> <p id=\"b495-8\" pgmap=\"495(123) 496(59)\">The defendant relies on People v. Johnson (1991), 215 Ill. App. 3d 713, 575 N.E.2d 1247. However, in Johnson, that venireman repeatedly gave equivocal responses when asked if he could be impartial. On several occasions we have held that a single equivocal answer, as in Hobley, does not require acceptance of a challenge for cause. In Reid, we found no abuse of discretion where the venireman stated he would \"try\u201d not to let his experiences affect his judgment. (Reid, 272 Ill. App. 3d at 307-08.) In People v. Barragan (1993), 266 Ill. App. 3d 961, 641 N.E.2d 535, there was no abuse of discretion when a venireman first stated that \" '[i]t would be hard\u2019 \u201d to be fair. (Barragan, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 975.) The jurors in both Reid and Barragan, as in the instant matter, expressed a willingness to follow the law in their other answers. Therefore, we find Reid, Hobley, and Barragan applicable to this matter, and not Johnson, and hold that the trial court acted within its discretion in refusing the challenge against Taylor.</p> <p id=\"b496-4\" pgmap=\"496\">IV</p> <p id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">Defendant next claims that he was denied a fair trial through testimony that only showed his propensity to commit crime. Evidence of other crimes is not admissible to establish the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit crime; however, evidence of other crimes committed by defendant may be admitted if relevant to establish any material question other than the propensity to commit crime. (People v. Hill (1995), 272 Ill. App. 3d 597, 604, 650 N.E.2d 558; People v. Miller (1993), 254 Ill. App. 3d 997, 1010, 626 N.E.2d 1350.) As with other evidence, in determining admissibility, the trial judge must balance the relevancy of the evidence against the possible prejudicial effect. (Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1010-11.) The trial judge\u2019s ruling that the evidence is admissible will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1011.</p> <p id=\"b496-6\" pgmap=\"496\"> The modus operandi exception has been recognized as circumstantial evidence of identity on the basis that crimes committed in a similar manner suggest a common author and strengthen the identification of a defendant. (Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1012.) The offenses must be so similar that evidence of one crime tends to prove the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. (Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1012.) However, the crimes need not be identical or so distinctive as to amount to a \"signature,\u201d as some dissimilarities will always exist between crimes. (Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1012.) The trend in Illinois is that the similarities must outnumber the differences, not that the crimes must be similar in every respect. Miller, 254 Ill. App. 3d at 1012.</p> <p id=\"b496-7\" pgmap=\"496(125) 497(31)\"> In the instant matter, we find that the trial court properly admitted testimony of the September 1, 1991, robbery to show modus operandi. The robberies both took place at Nigerian churches a few miles apart, at about the same time in the afternoon, one week apart. In both robberies, three men with guns entered the churches and ordered the congregations to lie down on the floor and put their money, purses, and other valuables on the floor. In both incidents two of the three men went around and collected the proceeds, and in both incidents the church offices were robbed as well. Lastly, Mr. Brandon, Mr. Charles and the defendant were identified as participating in both robberies, and proceeds from both robberies were found in Mr. Brandon\u2019s apartment. We find the similarities between the crimes to be overwhelming. Thus, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the modus operandi evidence.</p> <p id=\"b497-4\" pgmap=\"497\">Defendant cites People v. Triplett (1981), 99 Ill. App. 3d 1077, 425 N.E.2d 1236, in support of his contention that the crimes in this case were not similar enough to allow modus operandi evidence. Although the crimes in Triplett did have several similarities, there were also substantial differences in the methods used:</p> <blockquote id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">\"[T]he defendant first approached the manager of the first station on a pretext whereas during the second robbery the offender simply confronted the manager with a gun; the first offense involved two offenders whereas there was only one offender in the second offense; a black gun was used during the first robbery, a 'shiny\u2019 gun in the second; a green two-door sedan was used during the first crime and a green station wagon in the second; and the two crimes were committed three months and several miles apart.\u201d (Triplett, 99 Ill. App. 3d at 1083.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497\">Unlike Triplett and its substantial dissimilarities between crimes, the instant case does not present differences of the magnitude of the five listed in Triplett, and thus Triplett cannot sustain defendant\u2019s claim.</p> <p id=\"b497-7\" pgmap=\"497\">Defendant also contends that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its relevance. However, the evidence was strongly probative that defendant was not a mere bystander in the charged offense, but rather was an active participant with Mr. Brandon and Mr. Charles as he had been in the previous crime. Therefore, we cannot say it was an abuse of discretion for the court to find that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p> <p id=\"b497-8\" pgmap=\"497\">Lastly, defendant contends that the prosecution went into unnecessary and prejudicial detail as to the previous crime. However, defendant relies on a case where only a witness\u2019 previous opportunity to identify the defendant was involved \u2014 People v. Butler (1975), 31 Ill. App. 3d 78, 334 N.E.2d 448. Because modus operandi was at issue in this matter, the State necessarily had to delve into greater detail of the previous crime to establish its similarities to the charged offense, and thus Butler is inapposite.</p> <p id=\"b497-9\" pgmap=\"497\">V</p> <p id=\"b497-10\" pgmap=\"497(59) 498(67)\"> Defendant contends that the State violated s, motion in limine by introducing testimony that Officer Cronin had a conversation with defendant prior to obtaining a search warrant. However, defendant\u2019s motion in limine precluded the State from introducing evidence that defendant was the confidential informant whose statements formed the basis of the search warrant. The motion was not violated by testimony that Officer Cronin talked with defendant, as the State had not even broached the subject of the search warrant when defendant first objected. Defendant also contends that the State planted an \"inference\u201d from Officer Cronin\u2019s testimony that he later obtained a search warrant. However, we agree with the trial court that the State elicited no testimony that defendant\u2019s statements formed the basis of the warrant.</p> <p id=\"b498-4\" pgmap=\"498\">Defendant also makes issue of the State\u2019s references in closing argument to defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Cronin. However, in granting the motion in limine, the trial court specifically stated that defendant\u2019s statements could be used to impeach him if he decided to testify. Because defendant did testify, the State\u2019s remarks in closing argument were not improper.</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">VI</p> <p id=\"b498-6\" pgmap=\"498\"> Defendant next claims the court erred in allowing the State to introduce weapons and proceeds from Brandon\u2019s apartment that were not specifically identified by victims of the crime. As to the proceeds \u2014 jewelry and other valuables \u2014 the defendant has not explained in his brief how he was prejudiced by this evidence, nor included any citations indicating that such evidence was error, and thus he has waived this issue. 134 Ill. 2d R. 612(i); People v. Ortiz (1980), 91 Ill. App. 3d 466, 414 N.E.2d 1072.</p> <p id=\"b498-7\" pgmap=\"498\">As to the introduction of the handguns, defendant argues that this evidence was irrelevant because it had no connection to defendant personally or to his guilt of the crime. However, witnesses stated that defendant committed the crime with \u00e1 handgun. A sufficient nexus exists where the weapon is suitable for the crime charged although it need not have been actually used in committing the crime. (People v. Maldonado (1992), 240 Ill. App. 3d 470, 479, 608 N.E.2d 499; People v. Free (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 378, 415-16, 447 N.E.2d 218.) In addition, the introduction of all four guns tended to implicate the defendant by refuting a defense theory \u2014 that Mr. Brandon and Mr. Charles were the only men involved in committing the crime. Therefore, the trial court properly admitted this relevant evidence.</p> <p id=\"b498-8\" pgmap=\"498(92) 499(35)\">The defendant relies on Maldonado, in which we found error in the introduction of an extra weapon. However, in Maldonado the State admitted that the extra weapon was not associated with the crime, while in this matter the trial court specifically held that testimony had revealed that the handguns at issue were suitable for the commission of the offense. Even when the connection of a weapon to the defendant is tentative, a defendant \" 'may point out the weakness of its probative value, but he cannot bar its admission.\u2019 \u201d Free, 94 Ill. 2d at 417 (gun accessories admissible where connected to crime), quoting People v. Scott (1963), 29 Ill. 2d 97, 114, 193 N.E.2d 814 (wrench near decedent\u2019s body admissible although not connected to defendant).</p> <p id=\"b499-4\" pgmap=\"499\">VII</p> <p id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499\"> Defendant claims the court erred in barring the testimony of Agent Victor Robinson, who would have testified that the defendant had worked for the government in the past. However, defendant\u2019s own testimony stated that on the day of the crime, he went to the church without any connection to his previous government involvement. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Agent Robinson\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because defendant\u2019s previous government involvement did not form a defense to the crime for which he was accused.</p> <p id=\"b499-6\" pgmap=\"499\">In his reply brief, defendant argues for the first time that this testimony could have shown that he assisted in the investigation of church members and, thus, could have demonstrated bias by the State\u2019s witnesses against the defendant. However, defendant never made this contention in the trial court. Because this specific basis for admissibility of the proffered evidence was not raised below, the defendant has waived this issue on appeal. People v. Todd (1993), 241 Ill. App. 3d 542, 549, 608 N.E.2d 933; People v. Grant (1992), 232 Ill. App. 3d 93, 105, 596 N.E.2d 813.</p> <p id=\"b499-7\" pgmap=\"499\">VIII</p> <p id=\"b499-8\" pgmap=\"499\"> Defendant next contends that the State violated section 103\u2014 5(a) by not bringing him to trial within 120 days from the date he was taken into custody. Defendant bears the burden of proving that the State has violated this statute. (People v. Smith (1993), 251 Ill. App. 3d 839, 842, 623 N.E.2d 857; People v. Jones (1984), 104 Ill. 2d 268, 280, 472 N.E.2d 455.) We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s attribution of delay to a given party absent a clear abuse of discretion. People v. Williams (1995), 272 Ill. App. 3d 868, 877, 651 N.E.2d 532; People v. Turner (1989), 128 Ill. 2d-540, 551, 539 N.E.2d 1196.</p> <p id=\"b499-9\" pgmap=\"499(103) 500(50)\">Defendant argues that the State was responsible for 123 days of delay before his trial \u2014 the 44 days before his pretrial motions and the 79 days after he opposed further continuances by the State to address his pretrial motions. However, we conclude the trial court properly charged the defendant with the entire time period the State used to address defendant\u2019s motions. The applicable speedy-trial period is tolled by those delays in trial to which the defendant contributes or causes. (People v. Staten (1994), 159 Ill. 2d 419, 433, 639 N.E.2d 550.) A delay occasioned by motions by a defendant is ordinarily chargeable to the defendant. (People v. Erickson (1994), 266 Ill. App. 3d 273, 276, 639 N.E.2d 979; Jones, 104 Ill. 2d at 278.) Only in exceptional circumstances will the delay in ruling on a defense motion not be attributed to the defendant. Erickson, 266 Ill. App. 3d at 276.</p> <p id=\"b500-4\" pgmap=\"500\">In the instant case, we do not find the State\u2019s conduct so exceptional as to charge it with the time spent responding to the defendant\u2019s motions. For the motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statements to the police, the State at that time was required to produce Detective Wojtowicz under the material witness rule. (People v. R.D. (1993), 155 Ill. 2d 122, 134, 613 N.E.2d 706.) On July 14 and September 16, 1992, when Detective Wojtowicz was on military furlough, the trial court saw fit to grant continuances for the State until the detective returned in October. We do not believe that granting the continuances was an abuse of discretion, and thus the State\u2019s behavior was not so exceptional as to warrant charging it with this time. If the State had engaged in dilatory behavior in responding to the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court had many options at its disposal, including the denial of the request for a continuance. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that section 103 \u2014 5(a) was not the appropriate or necessary instrument to remedy its situation.</p> <p id=\"b500-5\" pgmap=\"500\">The defendant cites People v. Terry (1975), 61 Ill. 2d 593, 388 N.E.2d 162, but that case does not support his claim. In Terry, the State had ignored orders of the trial court to respond to the defendant\u2019s motions, as opposed to the State\u2019s proper motions for continuances which were granted in this case. Moreover, Terry stated that its defendant \"took action that was inconsistent with an intention to have his pending motions answered. The prosecution *** should have judged the demand for trial as indicating that the defendant no longer wished to pursue his earlier motions but instead wished to go on trial.\u201d (Terry, 61 Ill. 2d at 596.) The trial court in this case expressly held that the defendant had at all times indicated his wish to pursue his motions, and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the defendant\u2019s motions continued to toll the speedy-trial period.</p> <p id=\"b500-6\" pgmap=\"500\">IX</p> <p id=\"b500-7\" pgmap=\"500(57) 501(68)\"> Lastly, defendant argues that the court abused its discretion by sentencing him to 15 years of incarceration. Absent an abuse of discretion, the sentence imposed by the trial court will not be altered upon review. (People v. Gonzalez (1992), 151 Ill. 2d 79, 89, 600 N.E.2d 1189.) When a reviewing court examines the propriety of a sentence, it should proceed with great caution and care and must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court merely because it would have weighed the sentencing factors differently. (People v. Streit (1991), 142 Ill. 2d 13, 19, 566 N.E.2d 1351.) It is the province of the trial court to balance these factors and make a reasoned decision in each case. Streit, 142 Ill. 2d at 21.</p> <p id=\"b501-4\" pgmap=\"501\">The defendant argues that the trial court placed improper emphasis on the fact that defendant robbed a church while ignoring his minimal criminal history and potential for rehabilitation. However, a crime in a place of worship is an aggravating factor by statute. (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 5\u20143.2(a)(ll) (West 1992).) The defendant also had a prior felony conviction and was on probation at the time of the commission of this offense. The defendant received a sentence of 15 years when he was eligible for a sentence within a range of 6 to 30 years. (730 ILCS 5/5 \u2014 8\u20141(a)(3) (West 1992).) When the sentence is within the applicable statutory provisions, the trial court is presumed to have properly imposed it People v. Krueger (1994), 260 Ill. App. 3d 841, 849, 632 N.E.2d 177), particularly where the sentence in question is well within the statutory limits. People v. Abston (1994), 263 Ill. App. 3d 665, 678.) We find that defendant\u2019s sentence was not an abuse of discretion.</p> <p id=\"b501-5\" pgmap=\"501\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b501-6\" pgmap=\"501\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b501-7\" pgmap=\"501\">McNULTY and T. O\u2019BRIEN, JJ., concur in part and specially concur in part.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b501-8\" pgmap=\"501\">JUSTICE McNULTY,</author> <p id=\"AhD\" pgmap=\"501\">specially concurring in section III:</p> <p id=\"b501-9\" pgmap=\"501\">The defense contends that the trial court committed reversible error by not excluding venireperson John Taylor for cause. It argues that the error is reversible because the defense was forced to use its last peremptory challenge to keep this potential juror from sitting on the jury. As the supreme court said, however, in 1887, \"[w]e can not reverse [a] judgment for error committed in the lower court in overruling challenges for cause to jurors, even though [the] defendants exhausted their peremptory challenge unless it is further shown that an objectionable juror was forced upon them and sat upon the case after they had exhausted their peremptory challenges.\u201d Spies v. People (1887), 122 Ill. 1, 258, 12 N.E. 865, 989, accord United States v. Tweed (7th Cir. 1974), 503 F.2d 1127, 1129.</p> <p id=\"b501-10\" pgmap=\"501(9) 502(17)\">After the defense had exhausted its peremptories, eight additional venirepersons were examined by the court. The following colloquy took place regarding venireperson John L. Theisinger:</p> <blockquote id=\"b502-4\" pgmap=\"502\">\"THE COURT: Do you want the card?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">MR. HOWARD [assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502\">THE COURT: Here\u2019s all of the cards.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-7\" pgmap=\"502\">MR. HOWARD: We would accept them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-8\" pgmap=\"502\">THE COURT: Mr. Laurent [defense counsel],</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-9\" pgmap=\"502\">MR. LAURENT: Judge, I\u2019m out of peremptories. I have no choice. I formally requested more. You have already denied my motion.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-10\" pgmap=\"502\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m asking if you have any challenges for cause.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-11\" pgmap=\"502\">MR. LAURENT: Let me take a good look. Unless he lives next door to the guy that sings in the church choir I will formally make a motion for cause, although he did answer the question correctly. Okay.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b502-12\" pgmap=\"502\">THE COURT: That motion for cause will be denied.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"AGA\" pgmap=\"502\">Whereupon Mr. Theisinger was sworn as the twelfth juror and two alternates were selected.</p> <p id=\"b502-13\" pgmap=\"502\">I do not reach the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing excused venireperson John Taylor for cause on the record before us. The defendant has made no showing that an \"objectionable juror\u201d was forced upon him after he exhausted his peremptory challenges to exclude venireperson Taylor. See People v. Marts (1994), 266 Ill. App. 3d 531, 540, 639 N.E.2d 1360, 1367; People v. Washington (1982), 104 Ill. App. 3d 386, 392, 432 N.E.2d 1020, 1024-25.</p> <p id=\"b502-14\" pgmap=\"502\">An \"objectionable juror\u201d has been defined as \"a juror who should have been dismissed for cause \u2014 one who would prejudice the case.\u201d (Flynn v. Edmonds (1992), 236 Ill. App. 3d 770, 781-82, 602 N.E.2d 880, 887.) As the foregoing excerpt indicates, defense counsel made no showing whatever that juror Theisinger demonstrated any prejudice toward his client. Instead, he clearly indicated that his objection was pro forma to preserve the error for review and that the juror had answered the inquiries on the information card in a manner defense counsel found satisfactory.</p> <p id=\"b502-15\" pgmap=\"502(63) 503(19)\">As Justice Wolfson aptly said in People v. Reid (1995), 272 Ill. App. 3d 301, 309, 649 N.E.2d 593, 599, \"[t]he defendant takes the position that an 'objectionable juror\u2019 is anyone she did not want on her jury. We do not agree. There must be some attempt to persuade the trial judge that a juror the defendant was required to accept could not be fair and impartial. The failure to make such a showing forecloses further consideration of the issue.
