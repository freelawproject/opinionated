R. R. Co., a corporation of Indiana, authorized to build a railroad in that state, and the A. R. R. Co., an Illinois corporation, authorized to build a railroad in that state, entered into a contract by which the I). Co. made over to the A. Co. certain donations made to it for the purpose of building its road, and agreed that the road and all property of the D. Co. should belong to the A. Co. for the purpose of building such road upon condition that the A. Co. should begin construction before a certain date, and thereafter prosecute the same in good faith with such diligence as lay in its power, providing also that the principal condition of the ownership of the A. Co. was the commencement and prosecution of the work of building the road. The A. Co. began the work of construction, and carried it on for a time, expending a considerable sum of money, though this was not shown to be more than the donations to the D. Co., and then discontinued work for want of means to .carry it on. In September, 1877, the D. Co., assuming that the A. Co. had failed to prosecute the work, let the contract for completing the road to independent contractors, by whom it was completed, and put in operation. <em>Meld, </em>that the A. Co., by its agreement with the D. Co., was bound to prosecute the work, not only diligently, according to its ability, but at all events; and, it having ceased work, though from lack of ability to prosecute it, the D. Co. was justified in assuming possession of the road, and contracting with others for its completion, and the A. Co. had no lien on the completed road, or on the part where its work was done, for the amount of its expenditure upon it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b779-8\">Appeal from tlie Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Indiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b779-9\">The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company was organized September 1, 1873, under the general railroad .incorporation law of Illinois, approved March 1, 1872. Its proposed capital stock was $3,500,000, divided into Shares of $100 each. To this capital stock only a nominal subscription was ever made. It is stated in the argument for appellant, and apparently not disputed in that for appellee, that the total amount of stock subscribed was eight shares. In September, 1872, the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company was formed under the act of March 11, 1867, of the legislature of Indiana, to declare abandoned certain unfinished railroads, and to provide for their completion, etc. This company succeeded to the rights of a prior and abandoned corporation of the same name. Its capital stock was $2,500,000, divided into shares of $50 each. Its corporate purpose was to build and operate a railroad from Indianapolis, by way of Delphi, a distance of some 140 miles, to a point on the boundary line between Illinois and Indiana in the county of Lake in the latter state, and in the direction of Chicago. The number of shares originally subscribed to the capital stock of this company was 1,068. Just how many were afterwards subscribed, and what was paid for the same, or agreed to be paid, does not clearly appear in the record. On September 5, 1873, these two corporations made a treaty in words following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b779-10\">\u201cWhereas, the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company is a corporation duly organized-and existing under the laws of the state of Indiana, and thereby duly authorized to construct and operate a railroad extending from a point on the dividing line between the states of Indiana and Illinois at or near Lake county, Indiana, to Indianapolis, Indiana, commencing at Indianapolis, and extending through or within eighty rods of the following points, to wit, Big Springs Meeting House, Boone county; Kirkland, Frankfort, and Rossville, Clinton county; Delphi, Carroll county; Monticello, White county; and Renssalaer, in Jasper county. Said railroad is intended to pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>into or through the counties of Marion, Hamilton, Boone, Clinton, Carrolll White, Jasper (probably Newton), and Lake (counties); and thence on a routJ to be chosen by the said corporation to such a point on said county line bel tween said states as may be most practicable; and is also empowered byl the laws of the state of Indiana to construct, operate, and maintain an ex-1 tension of its railroad from any point on the line thereof to any point on the! line of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad in the state of Illinois. And! whereas, the said Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad is a corporation dulyl chartered, organized, and existing under and by virtue of the state of Illinois,I and for the purpose of building and operating a railroad from the city of Chicago, in the state of Illinois, to a point on the boundary line between the states of Illinois and Indiana', and to be hereafter located so as to connect with the terminus of the road of the said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago-Railroad Company. And whereas,. said roads are to be built in the line of I and as parts of a railway to be known as the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad, which said railroad is to be built on a uniform gauge of four feet and eight and one-half inches (4 feet 8% inches) in a line as near as may be as-follows, to wit: Commencing at Chicago, Illinois, in the most direct route-practicable over and upon the road of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Company to connect with the road of the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company on the line dividing the states of Illinois and Indiana, between the counties of* Cook, Illinois, and Lake, Indiana; thence to Montieello; thence to Delphi; thence to Frankfort; thence to Indianapolis, over the routes of said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company; thence toShelbyville; thence to Greensburg; thence to the Ohio river, at Vevay, or Rising Sun; thence crossing the Ohio river to Ker.hcky; thence to Frankfort or Lexington; thence to Loudon or some point near; thence by either or by both by direct route to Knoxville, Tennessee; thence to the Blue Ridge road to headwaters of the Savannah river to Anderson, in the state of South Carolina, or by the route from Loudon, or some point near it, to some-point near the Cumberland Gap; and thence to Asheville, in the state of North Carolina, the objective points being Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston and Port Royal, or Foote\u2019s Point, South Carolina, and Augusta and Savannah in Georgia. And whereas, the said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp;. Chicago Railroad Company is incorporated as a' railroad company, and has been, and now is, obtaining, and is hereafter to obtain, subscriptions and donations for the purpose of building, maintaining, and operating said company: Now, therefore, the said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company and the said Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, for the purpose of making the said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company a&gt;. portion of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, and for the purpose of securing -an early commencement and completion of the work of building and operating said railroad company, do hereby make and enter into-the following arrangements and agreements, to wit: (1) The Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company, with all its property, franchises, and' privileges, shall from this day be operated, controlled, and absolutely owned in fee simple by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company aforesaid as a portion of the grand route from the city of Chicago to the South Atlantic Ocean, upon condition, nevertheless, that the said Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, or their agents or assignee, shall on or before the first day of July, 1874, commence the construction of said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad within the state of Indiana, and shall thereafter prosecute the building of the same in good faith with such diligence as lies in their power until said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad shall be completed.

That the said corporations above named, by force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>and virtue of said original article of writing, and by force of these presents, are hereby associated, but not consolidated, for the purpose of jointly promoting the building and running of their respective roads, shall assume a common name, and after the first day of July next shall be known under the name and style of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, but nevertheless all the estate, real, personal, mixed, and the rights, privileges, and immunities, together with the stocks belonging to each of the said corporations, shall become vested in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company of the state of Illinois from September 5, 1873, and the debts and liabilities of each of said corporations shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be the debts and liabilities of the last-named body corporate. Second. All the capital stock of the said Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company shall be held by the board of directors of said company for the use of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company of Illinois, and for such purpose shall be held in trust for the board of directors of the said last-mentioned company, to be held by them and their successors in office, or by such other persons as the board of. directors of said company may from time to time direct, for the use of said company, and subject to the said control and management, direction, disposition, sale, and disposal of the said board of directors of said last-mentioned company: provided, nevertheless, the stock of the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company now out in the hands of subscribers and bona fide holders, or which shall thereafter be issued to counties, townships, municipal corporations, or individuals, shall be entitled to share pro rata in all dividends hereafter made and declared by the Chicago <em>&amp; </em>South Atlantic Railroad Company of Illinois.

The original articles in \u2022writing are to be in no way canceled or annulled by these supplementary artiIcles, but the same are hereby ratified and confirmed in every respect. Eighth. INothing contained in the articles above written shall be so construed as to Ibe a consolidation or surrender of the franchises of said roads, or either of them, but the said roads are each to preserve their integrity, independence, and identity the same as if no such contract had been made; the true meaning and intent of these presents being that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic' Railroad Company of Illinois are to be the owners of such stock of the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad as had not been sold or subscribed for up to the 5th of September, 1873, together with all its property, real, personal, and mixed, for the purposes hereinbefore expressed, and the Chicago &amp; South lAtlantie Railroad Company is to carry on all the business of building, equipping, and operating said road, and at such time, and not until then, as said road is built, and cars running over the same from Chicago to Indianapolis, and then and thereafter the said roads shall be consolidated and united as one corporation, and the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad shall be incorporated with and become merged in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company of Illinois, and the board of directors and officers of the last-named company shall constitute the directors and officers of said consolidated company. Ninth. And the said parties hereto, for the consideration aforesaid, do mutually agree and declare that the stipulations herein shall take effect immediately upon the due execution of the present articles.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-4\">Shortly after September 5, 1873, the work of constructing the road was commenced, and for a time carried on under the administration of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company pursuant to the contract. On September <em>29, 1877, the </em>directors of the Delphi Company, assuming as a fact that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Company had failed to prosecute the work of building the road in Indiana, in effect declared that the last-named corporation had no further interest or right in the unfinished road, and shortly after let a contract to complete the construction. The contractors, Yeoman, Hegler &amp; Co., at once proceeded with this work. Hater their contract was assigned to Yeoman, and afterwards by the latter to a corporation called the Chicago &amp; Indianapolis Air-Line Railway Company. The work of construction was at length finished, the contractors and their assignees treating the unfinished road, upon which construction was resumed as here stated, <em>as </em>the property of the Delphi Company, and disregarding or ignoring any claim or right therein on the part of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. About the time of making the contract with Yeoman, Hegler &amp; Co., the Delphi Company mortgaged the entire property to secure bonds. These bonds were subsequently purchased for value by the Chicago &amp; Indianapolis Air-Line Company, and afterwards this mortgage was foreclosed, and the road sold. Later appellant became the owner, and the road is now in use by appellant as part of its line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-5\">On May 14, 1880, one John B. Pettit filed a creditors\u2019 bill against the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company in the circuit court of the United States for the Northern district of Illinois. On December 31, 1880, appellee, Pope, was made receiver of, and to him later was assigned, all the property of the defendant in the last-named suit. On July 12, 1881, the bill in the case at bar wherein appellant and a number of other corporations and individuals were made parties defendant was filed. After divers amendments, answers, replications, etc., the cause was referred to a special master. On his report, and in accordance with his recommendation, a decree was entered, wherein it is adjudged that appellee receiver, in right of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, has a lien on the road from Dyer, in Lake county, Ind., to Delphi, in Carroll county, to secure the sum of $168,922.88 as justly due the company last named, with interest thereon at 6 per cent, per annum from the 4th day of March, 1881; and that, unless that sum be paid by a day fixed, the portion of the road referred to be sold. Prom this decree, appellant, the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, alone prosecutes this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-6\">On September 5, 1873, the date of the first of the two writings set forth in this statement, the Delphi Company had not commenced the work of constructing its road, but it had acquired certain rights of way; and certain subscriptions, for payment of which it held notes, had been made. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>initial agreement with the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, these notes and subl scriptions were, according to the seventh finding of the master, canceled, ami other or new notes and subscriptions substituted in their place. Shortly after September 5, 1873, the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic surveyed or resurl veyed the proposed road from Indianapolis to Dyer; and in June, 1874, gradl ing was commenced in Lake county. Under the direction and control of tha Chicago &amp; South Atlantic and its contractors, the construction went on quita continuously in the counties of Lake, Jasper, White, and Carroll' until tha work, including \u201crights of way paid for and covered by said work,\u201d and ini eluding surveying and engineering, amounted in value, as estimated by tha master in his nineteenth finding, to $168,922.88. The thirty-second findind shows that this work\u2014identified in the nineteenth finding as having beenl \u201ctwenty-three miles of grading, grubbing, and bridging of said railroad ini Lake county, about six miles in Jasper county, one mile in White county, and] nine miles in Carroll county\u201d\u2014was all done some time prior to September 1,1 1875. The master states that other work was done by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, but he apparently failed to identify the same, and the total value of the work or unfinished road for which he found the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was entitled to recover, as fixed by him, was the $168,922.88, with interest, as above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b784-4\">The theory of the special master\u2014and his view was adopted by the circuit court\u2014was that any cessation in the prosecution of the work of building the road in Indiana prior to September 29, 1877, was due, not to any want of diligence on the part of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, but to inability, caused in a measure by the stringency of the times; that there never was any intent by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic to abandon the work of building the road; that the action of the Delphi Company in resuming active control and letting the work to its own contractors was wrongful as against the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic; that the unfinished road, as seized by the Delphi Company and its contractors, was still the property of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic by force of the contract; that appellant and all persons and corporations dealing with the property after September 29, 1877, had or were charged with notice of the rights of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company; and that appellee, as receiver in right of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, was entitled to the recovery and lien already mentioned. Further reference to the report and evidence will be found in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b784-5\">E. C. Field, Henry W. Blodgett, Addison 0.

The sum recovered, $168,922.88, with interest, as allowed, now amounts to more than $312,000. This money, or a large part thereof, would doubtless be used by the receiver in discharge of the debts of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company. But it is the right of the company which is in question. No creditor is here asserting any lien in his own right; nor is it anywhere intimated as a theory of the case that certain creditors had liens in their own right, and that by a species of subrogation the debtor company may, in this proceeding, assert such liens. As the record comes before this court, the creditors have no right which transcends that of the company. If there were no creditors, and the purpose were to divide the large sum mentioned above among the few persons who made the trifling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>subscription to the stock of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, the question of recovery here would be precisely the same as it is. The people of Indiana along the proposed route were much interested in the enterprise which formed the subject-matter of the contracts of 1873 and 1875. By the laws of that state they, in the form of municipal corporations, were empowered to make donations, subsidies, and subscriptions in aid of the franchise granted to the Delphi Company to build the road. Individual property owners could, of course, make such donations as they saw fit. It was hardly expected that any municipal or other subscription to the stock of the Delphi Company would yield direct profit. The scheme evidently was to solicit and obtain donations, subsidies, and subscriptions, and use the same, or the proceeds thereof, in the work of initial construction, and then use the unfinished road as the basis of credit to secure means for \u25a0completion. The appeal for municipal aid, it was evidently thought, would meet with a more liberal response if the road to be built in Indiana could be represented as part of a continuous line from Chicago to the South Atlantic seaboard; hence the organization of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Bailroad Company, and the compact between the two corporations shown by the writings of 1873 and 1875. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was at liberty, of course, to provide .means out of its own proper resources to be used in the construction -of the road from the Indiana state line to Indianapolis, but no engagement to do so distinctly appears in either writing. Whether it was possible for the Delphi Company to alienate the franchise to \u25a0build the road, that company did not do so. Section 8 of the writing of 1875 is explicit upon the point. The liberty and authority of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic to build the road in Indiana, and \u00a1solicit, accept, and use in construction work in Indiana donations, \u25a0subsidies, and subscriptions from property owners and municipal \u25a0corporations along the route in that state, must be referred to the .contract with the Delphi Company. All such donations, subsidies, .and subscriptions, together with the stock of the Delphi Company undisposed of at the time of the execution of the writing of 1873, and all other property of the Delphi Company then on hand, was by the contract made subject to a special or limited ownership in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. Since all construction work in In-diana was under the Delphi Company\u2019s franchise, and would otherwise have been without legal sanction, all donations, subsidies, and aids volunteered towards the work in Indiana, whether before or pending the contract, must have been initially the property of the Delphi Company. It was by force of the contract that these \u201cthings \u25a0of value\u201d were subject to the dominion of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Bailroad Company. That this was the understanding is apparent more particularly from the last sentence of the first paragraph of the preamble to the treaty of 1873, from the sections marked 1 and 2 of that same writing and from sections 5 and 8 of the writing of 1875. The section, for instance, marked 2 of the paper of 1873 in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">\u201cAll moneys, lands, stocks, bonds, and other things of value that have been and shall hereafter be contributed, donated, or subscribed by any state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>county, city, community, corporation, or individual for the purpose of conj structing or maintaining the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad shalll from henceforth belong to, and he absolutely owned by, the Chicago &amp;' SoutM Atlantic Railroad Company, subject, however,\u201d etc. I</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad is the road from! Indianapolis to the state line, which the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chi-I cago Railroad Company was authorized to build. ' That company,! retaining its franchise to so build, and being deemed, held, and byl necessary implication declared, the owner initially of everything! given in aid of said franchise, transfers a limited and special do-l minion over all the \u201cthings of value\u201d referred to in the contract asl then extant or in expectancy to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. It I may be here added that profit as to a contractor or in any other! way to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was not stipulated for or pro-1 posed. When, under the administration of that company, the road should be completed, and cars running from Indianapolis to Chicago, the two corporations were to merge into a third, and the entire property was to vest in the consolidated concern. By the third section of the writing of 1875 the directors and officers of the Delphi Company and their successors \u201cshall continue in office for the purpose of preserving and guarding the trusts created in the articles of agreement.\u201d By the eighth section of the same writing, after the idea of a surrender or alienation of its franchise by the Delphi Company is excluded, \u201cthe true meaning and intent of\u201d the contract is declared to be that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic shall be owner of the property of the Delphi Company \u201cfor the purposes hereinbefore expressed\u201d; that is, to carry on the work of building the Indiana portion of the road in question. In the preamble to the writing of 1873 it is recited that the Delphi Company \u201chas been and now is obtaining, and is hereafter to obtain, subscriptions and donations for the purpose of building\u201d the road in Indiana; and the immediate purpose of the contract is expressed to be \u201can early commencement and completion of the work of building\u201d the road. The property alienated or put in the dominion of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic by the contract was, as before noted, all the property which the Delphi Company then had, or which might, pending the contract, be given or subscribed by any person or corporation in aid of its franchise to build the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The limitations fixed in the contract on the ownership thus vested in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic appear to be three in number, and to be limitations in time. Such ownership commenced when the writing of 1873 was executed. It would cease, apparently, first, if the work of construction were not commenced on or before the 1st day of July, 1874; again, if the work were not thereafter prosecuted,\u2014 that is, followed up or carried on with substantial continuity; and again, if diligence by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic in such prosecution should not be commensurate with the means for the time being available. These limitations seem to be set down, the first and third in the section marked 1; the other, in the section marked 2 of the writing of 1873. The learned counsel for appellee does not identify the second of these limitations. He reads in the contract only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>first and third, and he insists that the cessation in the work of conftruction prior to September 29, 1877, if there were any substantial cessation, was due, not to any want of diligence on the part of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Company, but to inability for want of Ineans. It would, of course, follow on this view that a cessation, liowever indefinite in time, if due to inability, would leave the own|;rship of the unfinished road in the 'Chicago &amp; South Atlantic; that the Delphi Company, while liable to lose its charter if it did not build the road, and morally bound that construction work done with [means given by Indiana people should, in case of need to forward [the work, be a basis of credit, has yet made a contract which, in a [contingency not unlikely to happen, would leave the unfinished road in [possession of a foreign corporation unable to proceed with the work, [and yet in a position, by reason of such inability, to demand in cash the value of what had been done, before the Delphi or any person or corporation succeeding to the rights of the Delphi could go on with the work to completion. The adjudication in the circuit court was,.and the contention here, in effect, is, that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic had to be paid the full value of the unfinished road, even though every dollar used in construction had been given by Indiana [people, and even though the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic had neither furnished out of its own resources, nor become liable out of its own resources for, any labor or material which had entered into the construction. This holding and contention would be sound if we take the contract to mean that the limitation on the ownership vested in the Chicago &amp; South. Atlantic was only a want of diligence, and not a failure to prosecute the work, due to inability rather than to want of diligence. By the section marked 1 of the writing of 1873 the ownership transferred to the Chicago <em>&amp; </em>South Atlantic is \u201cupon condition that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad .Company ';f * shall on or before the 1st day of July, 1874, commence the construction of the\u201d road in Indiana, \u201cand shall thereafter prosecute the building of the same in good faith with such diligence as lies in their power until said\u201d road \u201cshall be completed.\u201d By the section marked 2 all property or \u201cthings of value that have been and shall hereafter be contributed, donated, or subscribed for the purpose of constructing\u201d the road in Indiana \u201cshall * * * be absolutely owned by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, subject, however, to the laws of the state of Indiana and the Indianapolis, Delphi &amp; Chicago Railroad Company,\u201d \u2014meaning, apparently, subject to any obligation or condition imposed by law on the last-named company,\u2014and also subject \u201cto such provisions and conditions as shall be hereafter set forth.\u201d Then follow the words: \u201cThe principal condition of ownership of said things of value by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company is fully understood and agreed to be the commencement and prosecution of the work of building\u201d the road in Indiana. The Delphi Company, as already suggested, was subject to loss of its charter and franchise to build the road if the work of construction were not commenced and prosecuted. The primary and immediate purpose of the contract was the \u201cearly commencement and completion cf the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>work of building.\u201d Dominion over all property at the date of the first writing owned by the Delphi Company, or afterwards con tributed in aid of its franchise, was turned over to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, not as beneficial owner, but for the purpose mentioned. If the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic .did not commence the work of construction before the 1st of July, 1874, or if it did not thereafter use in carrying on the work the degree of diligence specified, or if for want of ability or means it ceased to carry on the work,\u2014in any one of these contingencies its dominion or ownership over the things of value comprehended in the contract was to lapse or expire. The prosecution of the work of building the road in Indiana is one thing; diligence in such prosecution commensurate with the means at hand for the time being is another. Prosecution of the work might go on without cessation, but the degree of diligence in such prosecution might be inadequate and out of proportion to the means and instrumentalities available. The purpose here was an early commencement and completion of the work. The language of the contract expresses both conditions. They are not inconsistent. The 'Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was expected out of its own proper resources to build the road from the Indiana state line to Chicago. It might also quite possibly build and complete the road in Indiana without other means than what was transferred to it by the contract with the Delphi Company. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was privileged to pledge the unfinished road in Indiana, but such pledge would, of course, be subject to the conditions under which that company held that property. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was also privileged to provide means out of its own resources to complete the work. When completed, the compensation would come in the shape of a beneficial ownership vested in the consolidated corporation. But the failure of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic to prosecute the work, and its loss on that account of the special dominion given by the contract over the \u201cthings of value\u201d therein mentioned and the construction work done with said \u201cthings of value,\u201d did not necessarily entail pecuniary loss on the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Company. There was no engagement by the Delphi Company that the \u201cthings of value\u201d turned over to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic would be sufficient to build the road. The risk of failure to prosecute the work, and of the loss on that account of that ownership which was transferred to it by the contract, was left with the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The master states in his report that the seizure or resumption of active control by the Delphi Company in the fall of 1877 \u201crendered the completion of the road by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic impossible if it were otherwise able to have completed its construction.\u201d He says also that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company was in 1880, \u201cand had been for some years, without means to complete said road, yet the purpose to build said road had not been abandoned, and efforts were made by said road from time to time to raise means with which to prosecute the enterprise.\u201d The total value, so far as the master saw fit or was able to compute, of the construction work done under the administration of the Chi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>cago &amp; South Atlantic, and for which that company was, according to the master, entitled to recover, was $168,922.88. This construction work, as stated in the nineteenth finding, \u201cconsisted of about 23 miles of grading, grubbing, and bridging of said railroad in Lake county, about 6 miles in Jasper county, 1 mile in White county, and 9 miles in Carroll county.\u201d This estimate included also engineering and surveying and \u201crights of way paid for and covered by said work.\u201d From what the master says in the two paragraphs of the thirty-second finding, this work must have been all done prior to the 1st day of September, 1875. On September 29, 1877, the directors of the Delphi Company declared that contract relations with the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic were at an end, and on October 2, 1877, three days later, the Delphi Company let a contract for completion of the road to Yeoman, Hegler &amp; Co.; and these contractors thereupon commenced work on the unfinished road. This action of the Delphi Company at once became known to the officers of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. The statement by the master that \u201cthe purpose\u201d on the part of the latter company \u201cto build the road had not been abandoned\u201d is immaterial. Intent, one way or another, on the matter of abandonment, was not fixed in the contract as a limitation on the ownership thereby vested in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. But this finding by the master is hardly warranted. From the correspondence between the officers of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, and from statements made by officers of the latter company to a committee of inquiry sent by the Delphi Company prior to September 29, 1877, and from other matters shown in evidence, the better conclusion would have been that the purpose or expectation of building the road under the contract was, in fact, given up, or at least had become secondary to another policy, namely, to claim ownership over the unfinished road for whatever advantage might result to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, its stockholders and creditors. But it is not here meant that this claim was not in good faith. It was made on a construction of the contract evidently deemed sound and defensible. The contractors, Yeoman, Hegler &amp; Co., commenced, and for a year or more carried on, their construction work on that part of the road which lay in White and Carroll counties. Active work under their contract was not resumed in Lake county until later. The conclusion of the master is that the part of the road in Lake county was not \u201cseized\u201d until work was so resumed thereon. He states, in general terms, that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic did some work on this part of the road after October 4,1S77. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\">\u201cIn November, 1878, lumber was provided by said road to construct a bridge over the Kankakee river to the state of Indiana, and some work was done in the fall of 1878 in Lake county, and some ties were delivered at that time in said county to be used in said road, and ordered by said company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">This is apparently a prefatory statement to what follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">\u201cAnd until the appropriation of said part of said line of road as herein set forth in Lake counts\u2019, the same was in the possession of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, though such road was at that time, and had been for some years, without means to complete said road, yet the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to build said road ha'd not been abandoned, and efforts were made by sai&lt; road from time to time to raise means with which to prosecute the enterprise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The master does not indicate what the work last referred to was, nor does he give any value to the same, or to the ties or lumber, if any were in fact used. The purpose of the statement is apparently to signify an assertion of right persisted in up to that time by the managing agents of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. On March 12, 1876, the president of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic wrote to the vice president:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">\u2018\u2018The work must be put under headway this spring, .otherwise we will lose our subsidies and the moral effect. * * * Now you should by all means get the road under headway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Other letters interchanged between the date last mentioned and October 4, 1877, indicate, as the status at the time, substantially a complete cessation of the work of construction, in response to a letter written October 3, 1877, by the president of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic detailing the action of the Delphi Company on September 29, 1877, and the letting of the contract by that company as before noted, the vice president wrote on October 4, 1877, \u201cMy advice is, simply protest and keep quiet.\u201d The contention by appellant that for more than two years prior to September 29, 1877, the work of building the road in Indiana had ceased, seems well made. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was advised at once of the action taken by the Delphi Company based on the failure to prosecute the work. Whatever the former company afterwards did, if-anything, in Lake county, was done with notice that the latter denied any ownership on the part of the former over any part of the road in Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">It is said that the action of the Delphi Company on September 29, 1877, was a forfeiture; that the law abhors forfeitures; that time was not of the essence of the contract; and that there could be no forfeiture or rightful resumption of control by the Delphi without a formal request to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic to proceed, and a refusal after such request. But the contract declared that the prosecution of the work of building was a principal condition of \u201cthe ownership of* said things of value by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Bailroad Company.\u201d The contract fixed a limitation upon whatever ownership or dominion vested by that instrument in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic over said \u201cthings of value,\u201d or the unfinished road so far as constructed with said \u201cthings of value.\u201d This ownership ceased by its own limitation. The case is not one of the forfei\u00fcire of an estate upon condition. It is an instance, rather, of a conditional limitation. The Delphi Company had to make sure as a fact of that cessation or failure to prosecute the work which by the contract limited the dominion of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. In such event, there was no longer any ownership in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic to be displaced by re-entry. The contract made no provision for any demand or notice. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic was not prejudiced in any way by want of prior formal demand and notice. On the showing of the record, the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>finished work had been neglected, and was falling into decay. There had long been nothing more, if anything, than a mere constructive possession in the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. Such a possession is fictitious. It ceases with the legal ownership. In 1876 a committee was sent by the Delphi Company to inquire of the officers of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic whether or not, and when, if at all, the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic proposed to go on with the work. One Gould, a member of the committee, testified that at the interview between the representatives of the two companies the statement was distinctly made on behalf of the Delphi Company, in effect, that if the work were not speedily resumed, the latter company would displace the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic, and itself resume exclusive and active control. The vice president of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic testified that he did not remember any declaration so strongly put on the occasion in question. The testimony of Gould was not otherwise disputed. It makes nothing upon the rights of these corporations, as defined in the contract, that after ownership thereunder by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic had ceased by limitation, the Delphi Company for a time might have been still willing that the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic should take up the work again. The original bill and the amended bill each contains the following statement: \u201cYour orator further shows that all subscriptions, bonds, subsidies, and assets of every kind and description obtained by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company, as stated in this bill, were obtained under and in pursuance of either the original agreement or supplemental agreement * * * or both of them,\u201d\u2014 meaning the writings of 1873 and 1875. In other words, within the scope of the bill, the subject-matter contended about in this litigation is the property of the Delphi Company on hand when the writing of 1873 was executed, everything which was subsequently given, contributed, or subscribed in aid of the franchise to build the road in Indiana, which franchise always remained, as originally vested, in the Delphi Company, and all construction work done with the means aforesaid. The master found that some portion of the construction work included by him, as already stated in the valuation of $168,922.88, had not been paid for by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. How much he does not state. He does not find any lien on this work in favor of any laborer or contractor or specify any sum as due to any one. He does not show any sum raised by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic for, or expended on, the work in Indiana, which did not come to that company by virtue of its contract with the Delphi. He shows that donations and subscriptions aggregating some $300,000 were made in Indiana pending the contract. He does not show that the $168,922.88 was in excess of the amount actually received by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic from such donations and subscriptions in Indiana. Moreover, the distinct and specific purpose of the bill, as already said, was to recover the \u201cassets * * obtained by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic Railroad Company under and in pursuance of either the original agreement or the supplemental agreement, * * * or both of them\u201d (meaning the writings of 1873 and 1875); and the distinct ground of such re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>covery is stated in the bill to be that the displacement of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic on September 29, 1877, was on the false and fraudulent pretense that the latter company had failed to prosecute the work of building the road in Indiana. The argument on behalf of appellee proceeds at times on the unconscious assumption that the donations, subsidies, and subscriptions by Indiana municipal corporations and people were never the property of the Delphi Company, but were initially and at all times the property of the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. These donations, subsidies, etc., in Indiana were, as repeatedly stated herein, in aid of the franchise to build the road. This franchise was vested in the Delphi Company. Building operations were carried on by the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic pursuant to the Delphi franchise, and solely by force of the contract with the latter company. The initial ownership over every aid to the road is, in effect, declared as a term in the contract. Every donation or subsidy, whether pending or in futuro, is by the contract transferred from the Delphi to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. The latter company got nothing of the kind except as coming from the former. It had no right, as between itself and the Delphi, to tre\u00e1t anything in aid of the construction work in Indiana otherwise than as initially given to the Delphi Company, and thence transferred to itself by force of the contract. One may not assert a contract and at the same time evade any term in it. A devisee who elects to take under a will must not claim adversely to the testator anything disposed of by such will. The contract between these two corporations is avowedly the foundation of the claim here sued on. The receiver cannot assert, contrary to the section marked 2 of the writing of 1873, that any \u201cthing of value\u201d thereafter \u201cdonated * * * for the purpose of constructing * * \u201c said road\u201d in Indiana was not, by force of said section, given to the Delphi Company, and by force of said section transferred from the Delphi Company to the Chicago &amp; South Atlantic. The property here in controversy belonged in the first instance to the Delphi Company. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic derived its ownership from the contract, and such ownership was subject to the limitations expressed in the contract. One of the conditions of such ownership was \u201cthe prosecution of the work of building\u201d said road. The Chicago &amp; South Atlantic failed to prosecute the work. Its ownership, therefore, ceased and determined. The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded, with the direction that as to this appellant the bill be dismissed for want of equity.</p>\n<author id=\"b792-4\">Mr. Justice BROWN, dubitante.</author>\n<p id=\"AcQ\">Upon the argument of this case, I was strongly inclined to the opinion that the cancellation of its contract by the Delphi Company was not made in good faith, particularly in view of the fact that there was a personal consideration passing to Mr. Haymond, and that he appeared to have acted in excess of his authority. While the cessation of the work might have authorized the Delphi Company to put an end to the contract by legal proceedings in the nature of a foreclosure, or perhaps even by notice, it did not seem to me that it could be legally done by a summary seizure and appropriation of the unfinished road, by which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>acquired property of the value of $1G8,000, without having paid anything for it, unless the subscriptions made by the Indiana people could be construed as having been made for its benefit. There was no provision in the contract for a forfeiture of the property acquired or the work done by the South Atlantic Company in case the contract were rescinded; and I had assumed the law to be that where a party to a cqntract for the construction of a building, railway, or other similar work elected to rescind such contract for failure to perform within the stipulated time, he could not take to himself the fruits of a part performance without making compensation in the nature of a quantum' meruit. While the application of this rule may be subject to modification to the extent to which the Delphi Company had contributed of its own means to the construction of the work, it seemed to me that, if the receiver was not entitled to recover the whole value of the property appropriated, he was equitably entitled to recover at least to the extent of the claims of the creditors of the South Atlantic Company for the work done or the materials furnished in the construction of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">But as my brethren have placed a different construction upon the contract and the acts of the parties, and as the case depends largely upon the view taken of the testimony, which is very voluminous, and no question of law is involved which is likely to become important as a precedent, I am disposed to acquiesce in the opinion of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
