Benner against Eugenio K. Hayes for alleged infringement of letters patent Ho. 232,137, granted September 14, 1880, to Tyler C. Lord, for improvements in check-rowing attachment for corn planters. The circuit court dismissed the bill, holding that, if complainant\u2019s device was patentable at all, the patent must be limited to the mechanical arrangement by which the rope or cable is permitted, on the removal of obstacles, to straighten itself, and that, so construed, it was not infringed by defendant. From this decree the complainant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b987-10\">Taylor E.
