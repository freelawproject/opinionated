Said bonds bore interest at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, payable annually on the 1st day of April of each year at the office of the county treasurer of said county, upon delivery of the attached interest coupons. The bonds were redeemable at the pleasure of the county after 10 years, and were due and payable at the office of the county treasurer 20 years from the date thereof. The coupons maturing upon these bonds before April 1, 1884, were all paid, as they matured, at the office of said county treasurer; but no coupons maturing at or after that date have been paid, the coupons sued on being among those unpaid. The answer of the defendant denied knowledge, or information sufficient to form a belief, as to whether plaintiff was the owner and holder of any of the coupons, or had become the purchaser of them for a valuable consideration, without notice of any claim affecting their validity. But the principal defense, variously stated in the answer, was, in substance, that under the constitution and laws of the state of Colorado the board of county commissioners of said county of Lake had not, when they issued said bonds, any power or lawful authority to issue the same, for the alleged reason that by the issue of such bonds a debt of said county was contracted, or the prior debt of said county increased, to an amount prohibited by the constitution of said state, and that, from the existing facts and circumstances shown by the'records of said county, all purchasers of said bonds were bound to take notice of their invalidity. Section 6 of article 11 of the constitution of Colorado, as it stood prior to the year 1888, was as follows: \u201cNo county shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>contract <em>any debt by loan in any </em>form, except for the purpose of erecting necessary public buildings, making or repairing public roads and bridges, and such indebtedness contracted in any one year shall not exceed the rates upon the taxable property in such county following, to wit: Counties in which the assessed valuation of taxable property shall exceed five millions of dollars, $1.50' on each thousand thereof; counties in which such valuation shall be less than five millions of dollars, $3.00 on each thousand dollars thereof. And the aggregate amount of indebtedness of any county for all purposes, exclusive of debts contracted before the adoption of this constitution, shall not at any time exceed twice the amount above herein limited, unless when, in manner provided by law, the question of incurring such debt shall, at a general election, be submitted to such of the qualified electors of such county as in the year last preceding such election shall have paid a tax upon property assessed to them in such county, and a majority of those voting thereon shall vote in favor of incurring the debt; but the bonds if any be issued therefor, shall not run less than ten years, and the aggregate amount of debt so contracted shall not exceed twice-the rate upon the valuation last herein mentioned: provided, that this section shall not apply to counties having a valuation of less than one million of dollars.\u201d The said bonds contained a recital upon the face of each bond, as follows: \u201cThis bond is one of a series of fifty thousand dollars, which the board of county commissioners of said county have issued for the purpose of erecting necessary public buildings, by virtue of and in compliance with a vote of a majority of the qualified voters of said county at an election duly held on the 7th day of October, A. D. 1879, and under and by virtue of and in compliance with an act of the general assembly of the state of Colorado entitled \u2018An act concerning counties, county officers and county governments, and repealing laws on those subjects,\u2019 approved March 24th, A. D. 1877; and it is hereby certified that all the provisions of said act have been fully complied with by the proper officers in the issuing of this bond.\u201d Sections 20-25, inclusive, of said act, were also printed upon said bonds, and contained all the provisions of said act relative to the action of the board of county commissioners in determining upon the necessity of creating an indebtedness for the purpose of erecting necessary public buildings, making or repairing roads and bridges, and by order specifying the amount required, and submitting the question of incurring the debt to a vote of the qualified electors at a general election, by posting of notices; also, prescribing the form of ballots and manner of voting and canvassing the vote, and the authority of the county commissioners in case the vote should be carried to contract the indebtedness, and the limitations upon, such authority, and the form and purport of the bonds to be issued, and provision to be made for the payment of the interest and principal of the bonds, and a provision that they should not be sold at a discount of more than 15 per cent, of their par value. Section 21 of said act contained a provision, as follows: \u201cProvided, that the aggregate amount of indebtedness of any county exclusive of debts contracted prior to July first, 1876, in which the assessed' valuation of property shall exceed one million of dollars, for all purposes, shall not be in excess of the following ratio, to wit: Oounties in which the assessed' valuation of property shall exceed five million of dollars, $6.00 on each thousand dollars thereof; counties in which the assessed valuation of property shall' be less than five millions, and exceed one million of dollars, $12.00 on each thousand dollars thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-8\">The action of the board of county commissioners preliminary to and in submitting to vote of the qualified electors of said county at the general election held October 7, 1879, the question of creating an indebtedness of $50,000, for the purpose of erecting necessary public buildings, and $5,000 for the building and construction of public roads and bridges, was strictly in conformity with said act. The election was duly held, and the vote on that question duly had! and canvassed, and found and declared to be carried. And all the acts and doings were properly recorded, and the bonds prepared, executed, and issued in strict accordance with the provisions of said act. And the bonds were sold for 95 cents on the dollar of their par value, and have, since within one year of their issue, been held and owned by purchasers for full value, without actual notice of any illegality or infirmity in said bonds. The plaintiff is the holder of the coupons sued upon, by delivery of the same with properly executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>written assignments thereof to him, by the former owners of such coupons, but without payment by him of any money therefor. The assessed valuation of taxable property in said county of Lake for the year 1879 was $3,485,628, and for the year 1880 was $11,124,489, and such assessment was completed on the 1st day of September in each of said years, by the action of the board of equalization. Section 30 of the act above referred to made it the duty of the board of county commissioners of each county to make out semiannual statements at the regular sessions in January and July, and publish them in some weekly newspaper published in the county, or, if no such newspaper be so published, to cause such statements to be posted in three conspicuous places in the county, one being the courthouse door, showing the amount of debt owing by the county, in what it consists, what payments have been made thereon, the rate of interest, and a detailed account of receipts and expenditures for the preceding months, and striking a balance showing the deficit or the balance in the treasury. \u201cAnd the statement thus made, in addition to being published as before specified, shall also be entered of record by the clerk of the board of county commissioners, in a book to be kept by him-for that purpose only, which book shall be kept open to the inspection of the public at all times.\u201d There was no evidence in the case that any such semiannual statement made by the board of county commissioners for said county of Lake at the January or July sessions of said board in the year 1880 had ever been entered of record in any book kept for that purpose only, as required by said act. The fair inference from the testimony is that no such record was ever made. TJpon the trial the defendant, to prove its allegation that on July 31, 1880, the date of said bonds, and also at the time they were issued, the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of said county of Lake was largely in excess of the amount of the extreme limitation fixed by the constitution of said state and the act aforesaid, offered in evidence a book kept in the years 1880 and 1881 by the county, clerk of said Lake county, called the \u201cCounty Clerk\u2019s Account Book,\u201d and purporting to contain, among other things, detailed statements of the financial condition of said county on January 1, 1880, July 1, 1880, and January 1, 1881; and the same was admitted in evidence by the court, over the objection and exception of plaintiff that it was not the record provided for by said act, nor the semiannual statement of the board required by said act. Much other evidence tending to show the existence of outstanding warrants and indebtedness of said county at the time of issuing said bonds to an amount largely in excess of the aggregate amount of indebtedness which the county could, under said constitutional limitations, lawfully incur, was offered by defendant, and admitted \u00a1by the court, over the objections of the plaintiff that the same was incompetent and immaterial. At the conclusion of the evidence the court refused all \u2022of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for instructions to the jury, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant; to which refusal and instruction exceptions were duly taken by the plaintiff. The jury accordingly found for the \u25a0defendant, and judgment for the defendant was entered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b708-4\">H. B.

A county is an organized political subdivision of the state. It has such power, and such only, to contract loans and incur other forms of indebtedness as is expressly or by fair implication granted to it by the legislature of the state, which has plenary authority over that subject, as it has over all ordinary subjects of legislation, except in so far as its authority .is taken away, curtailed, or restricted by the controlling force and effect of the provisions of the state constitution. Section 6 of article 11 of the constitution of Colorado is wholly restrictive in its effect and operation, and does not by its terms authorize any county to incur any form of indebtedness for any purpose. It forbids the contracting of a debt of a specified kind, except for specified purposes, and within specified limits, and forbids the contracting of indebtedness, of any and all kinds beyond specified limits, and then prescribes an enlarged limit as to indebtedness, after a county shall have been authorized by vote of the qualified electors, in the manner indicated, with a provision in respect to bonds, if any be issued. But it does not by its own terms grant to any county the power to incur indebtedness, even within the specified restrictions. The authority to grant such power, within such restrictions, therefore, necessarily remains in the legislature, which might, in its discretion, prescribe further limitations and restrictions, and provide in detail in respect to the manner in which the power should be executed, and in respect to what acts should be done, and what record made in the execution of such power, and as to the effect of such acts and records. The bonds in question in this case were issued under the provisions of the act of March 24, 1877, which is expressly referred to in the recital in the bonds, and six sections of which were printed upon the bonds. This act, by its terms, commits to the board of county commissioners the power to determine the necessity of creating an indebtedness for the erection of public buildings, and of submitting the question to a vote of the qualified electors at a general election, and of issuing the bonds, if the vote is favorable, keeping within the limitation contained in section 21 in respect to the aggregate indebtedness of the county at the time of issuing the bonds. The granting of these powers necessarily intrusts to the board of county commissioners the power and duty of determining whether the proposition to create the indebtedness was carried at the election, and the ascertainment of the fact that the aggregate amount of all forms of the county indebtedness was within such amount that it would not, by the issue of the bonds, be made to overpass the prescribed limitation. Hence, except for the provision contained in section 30 of the same act, requiring the board to make and publish the semiannual statements of the indebtedness and financial condition of the county, and requiring the clerk of the board to record such statements in a book to be kept for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>purpose only, and to be open to public inspection, the recitals in the bonds above quoted would be conclusive, and would estop the county in a suit by a bona fide holder of the bonds or coupons. Commissioners v. Aspinwall, 21 How. 539; Coloma v. Eaves, 92 U. S. 484; County of Clay v. Society for Savings, 104 U. S. 579; Commissioners v. Bolles, 94 U. S. 104; Evansville v. Dennett, 161 U. S. 434, 446, 16 Sup. Ct. 613; Wesson v. Saline Co., 20 C. C. A. 227, 73 Fed. 917; Chaffee Co. v. Potter, 142 U. S. 355, 12 Sup. Ct. 216. In Chaffee Co. v. Potter, last cited, where the recital in the bonds contained a certificate that the total amount of the issue did not exceed the limit prescribed by the constitution of Colorado, and had been duly authorized by a vote of the qualified electors of the county of Chaffee at the general election named, it was held that the county was es-topped to dispute these recitals in an action upon coupons by an innocent holder for value. The case of Sutliff v. Commissioners, 147 U. S. 230, 13 Sup. Ct. 318, deserves special attention, as the bridge bonds, coupons from which were sued upon in that case, were issued under the same act, and upon the authority of the same vote of the qualified electors, as were the public building bonds which are under consideration in this case. In the Sutliff Case it was held that as section 30 of the same act, under which the bonds were issued, made it the duty of the board of county commissioners to make out and publish semiannual statements showing the indebtedness, if any,, of the county, and that such statements should be entered of record by the clerk of the board in a book to be by him kept for that purpose only, and to be open to the inspection of the public, a person about to purchase such bonds was charged' with the duty of examining this-public record provided for by the very act under which the bonds were issued, and from that inform himself whether the amount of the issue stated in the bonds increased the aggregate indebtedness of the county beyond the constitutional limit, which was there held to be identical with the like limitation contained in the act, namely, $6 on the $1,000. of the assessed valuation,\u2014the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in' that county being more than $5,000,-000,\u2014and that because of such public record of such semiannual statements the county was not estopped to prove that before such bonds were issued the indebtedness of the county had passed the constitutional and statutory limit. The theory of that case is that a purchaser of bonds issued under that act would have constructive notice of what the record of the semiannual statement provided for by the act, and which it was his duty to examine, would have shown, had he in fact examined such record. The fact that such record actually existed was assumed and not questioned in the Sutliff Case. But in this case it is clearly shown that there never were any such semiannual statements, or record thereof, covering any of the time which could affect the legality of these bonds. As there was no such record in existence as the act required and contemplated, there was no record which a purchaser of these bonds was bound to examine, or which would be constructive notice to him of the aggregate indebtedness of the county when the bonds were issued. Such purchaser was therefore entitled to rely on the recitals in the bonds. And as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>one of these recitals was a certificate that all the provisions of the act had been fully complied with by the proper officers in the issuing of the bonds, and as a provision of that act limiting the issue of the bonds by the aggregate of all the indebtedness of the county was, in effect, identical with the constitutional provision on the same subject, the recital was equivalent to a certificate that this provision of the constitution had been complied with, and brings the case within the decision in Chaffee Co. v. Potter, supra. It has often been held that, in the absence of any statutory public record, a county or municipality may be estopped by similar recitals in bonds from showing that when the bonds were issued there was an aggregate outstanding indebtedness rendering the issue of bonds illegal. Marcy v. Oswego, 92 U. S. 637; Humboldt v. Long, Id. 642, 645; Buchanan v. Litchfield, 102 U. S. 278, 292; Sherman Co. v. Simons, 109 U. S. 735, 3 Sup. Ct. 502; Dalles Co. v. McKenzie, 110 U. S. 686, 4 Sup. Ct. 184; Wilson v. Salamanca, 99 U. S. 499. The debt created by the bonds in this case was incurred, not at the time the board of commissioners determined that it was necessary, nor when the qualified voters of the county gave authority to incur it, nor at the date of the bonds (they having been antedated), but at the date, later than September 6, 1880, when the bonds were in fact issued and sold. The bonds recite that the whole issue is $50,000, and this recital was notice to purchasers of the bonds of the creation of an indebtedness of the county to that amount. The assessed valuation of the taxable property of the county of Lake, according to the assessment which was completed by equalization on September 1, 1880, was $11,124,489. This assessed valuation, in view of the vote authorizing the creation of the indebtedness, would admit of a lawful aggregate of indebtedness of that county to the extent of upward of $66,000. So that the recited amount of that issue of bonds was not of itself notice to a purchaser that the lawful aggregate limit of indebtedness had been passed, even if such purchaser was bound to\u2019 take notice of the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the county, as was held in Dixon Co. v. Field, 111 U. S. 83, 4 Sup. Ct. 315. As said by the court in Chaffee Co. v. Potter, 142 U. S. 355, 363, 12 Sup. Ct. 216, 219:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">\u201cThe purchaser might even know\u2014indeed, it may be admitted that he would be required to know\u2014the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the county; and yet he could not ascertain, by reference to one of the bonds and the assessment roll, whether the county had exceeded its power, under the constitution, in the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The court therefore erred in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the county clerk\u2019s account book, the warrant register, and the proof of publication of financial statements. None of this evidence was materia], as none of it constituted constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">3. A question not suggested by the answer in the case remains to be considered. The first part of section 6 of article 11 of the constitution of Colorado, above quoted, as applicable .to the class of counties having an assessed valuation of taxable property exceeding $5,000,000, in the absence of any vote of the qualified electors, restricts the amount of debt by loan which the county can be allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to contract in any one year to $1.50 on each $1,000 of such assessed valuation. It is questioned whether this limitation upon the amount of debt by loan which the county may be allowed to contract in any one year does not continue, even after authority has been given by vote of the qualified electors, to create an aggregate indebtedness to the extent, it may be, of $6 on each $1,000 of such assessed valuation. The contention that the restriction referred to, respecting the amount of debt by loan which a county may be allowed to contract in any one year without such vote, continues after the changed condition effected by such vote, appears to rest upon what seems to us to be a misconception of a sentence in the opinion in Lake Co. v. Rollins, 130 U. S. 662, 669, 9 Sup. Ct. 651. Under the stipulation in that case (page 664, 130 U. S., and page 651, 9 Sup. Ct.), the only question in the case was whether the limitations contained in section 6 of article 11 aforesaid were restrictive only of the power of counties to create debts by loan, or restricted further the power to create and incur all forms of indebtedness; it being admitted by the stipulation that if the general limitations expressed in that section covered all forms of indebtedness, and were not confined to debts by loan exclusively, the defendant in that action was entitled to judgment. Mr. Justice Lamar pointed out that the first clause of the section, down to where the subject of aggregate indebtedness is considered, speaks only of debts by loan. He then added, \u201cHere the matter of indebtedness by loan is completed, and the section passes to a broader subject.\u201d In view of the exact question then under consideration, this language means that at the point of the section indicated the matter of debt by loan exclusively is.completed, and that thenceforward the section passes to a broader subject, embracing all other forms of indebtedness as well as debt by loan. It is obvious that every sentence of the entire section may enlarge, limit, or in some way qualify the power to contract debts by loan. The provision in respect to submitting the question of incurring indebtedness to the qualified electors contemplates the submitting of specific propositions, and, if the vote is in favor of incurring the debt, the provision that, if bonds are issued, they shall run not less than 10 years, necessarily provides that such debt, when so authorized, may be created by loan. The case of People v. May, 9 Colo. 80, 10 Pac. 641, does not touch the question of how much indebtedness by loan may be contracted by a county in any one year, after authority has been given by a majority vote of the qualified electors to contract the indebtedness. In that case, as in the Eollins Case, the sole question considered arose upon the contention that the constitutional restriction contained in said section 6 as to the aggregate amount of county indebtedness-should be regarded only as a limitation of county indebtedness by loan. The court held, as in the Eollins Case, that the general limitations as to aggregate indebtedness embraced all forms of county indebtedness. The provisions of section 6 aforesaid divide themselves into two general clauses, distinct from each other, and each applicable to a condition differing from that to which the other is applicable. The first clause, extending down to the preposition \u201cunless,\u201d prescribes the restrictions and limitations in respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>power of contracting indebtedness by counties where there has been no vote of the qualified electors authorizing the creation of specific indebtedness, and not only limits the aggregate amount of indebtedness that can be incurred for all purposes and in all forms, but also limits the amount of indebtedness by loan that can be created in any one year. The second clause, following the preposition \u201cunless,\u201d provides for a changed and different condition, in which a county, by vote of a majority of its qualified electors, upon a proposition submitted to them at a general election, has been authorized to create a specific indebtedness. In that case a single and different limitation is prescribed, namely, that the aggregate debt of the county shall not be made to exceed twice the amount limited in the other case, and a provision (contemplating debt by loan) that the bonds, if any be issued therefor, shall not run less than 10 years. But there is no limitation in such case as to the amount of the indebtedness so authorized which can be created in any one year. It would be singular, indeed, if, after authorizing a county, upon vote of its qualified electors, to create a specific indebtedness for the erection of necessary public buildings, the same provision should cripple the power to erect such buildings by requiring that the longtime bonds authorized should only issue and be sold in small annual installments; making the county wait, perhaps, a series of years before getting enough money to warrant it in beginning the erection of the necessary public buildings, and be paying in the meantime interest on the earlier bonds, the proceeds of which would-be lying idle, awaiting the accumulation of enough to begin with. Neither the grammatical construction of the section nor any sound reason justifies the importation into the last clause of the section of the restriction in the first clause as to the amount of debt by loan which can be created in any one year. It may be added that the legislative construction of this section of the constitution, as shown by section 21 of the act of March 24, 1877, under which these bonds were issued, conforms to the views here expressed, and that the supreme court, in Sutliff v. Commissioners, 147 U. S. 230, 234, 13 Sup. Ct. 318, refers to this statute as being, in respect to limitations, in conformity with the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">4. The county of Lake received full consideration for these bonds. Most of them were taken directly by the contractor who erected the public buildings for which they were issued. They passed immediately to bona fide holders for full value. The county acknowledged and ratified them by paying the interest upon them, as it matured, for several years. If it were conceded that after the board of county commissioners of Lake county had been, by vote of the qualified electors, empowered to create a debt of $50,000 to erect necessary public buildings, they were required to execute that power by issuing not more than $16,500 of the $50,000 in any one year, and they issued the whole $50,000 at once, instead .of issuing the same in yearly installments, the case would not be one of lack of power to issue all the bonds, but a case where the power existed, but was irregularly exercised. In such case the payment of interest on the bonds for several years estops the county from asserting such irregu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>larity as a defense.

I am unable to concur in the views expressed by my associates in' the foregoing opinion. My disagreement with them arises out of the fact that I am not able to read section 6, art. 11, of the constitution of Colorado, quoted in the statement, as they have seen fit to construe it. Without going into the subject at length, it will suffice to say that in my judgment the first paragraph of section 6, art. 11, of the constitution of Colorado, fixes an absolute limit to the amount of indebtedness created by loan which a county may contract in any one year, either with or without the sanction of a popular vote; such limit being $1.50 per $1,000 of the assessed valuation of taxable property in counties where such valuation exceeds $5,000,000. This was the construction of the constitutional provision in question which seems to have been adopted in Lake Co. v. Rollins, 130 U. S. 662, 669, 9 Sup. Ct. 651, and in People v. May, 9 Colo. 80, 86, 87, 10 Pac. 641; but in th\u00e9 absence of these adjudications I should entertain the same view, founded upon the language of the statute and the probable motive of the lawmaker. The framers of the Colorado constitution intended, as I think, to impose such restrictions upon counties as would compel them to act prudently, no matter what might be the will of the people, and such restrictions as would prevent them, as far as possible, from exhausting their power to contract debts by overborrowing in a single year. To this end they prohibited counties absolutely from borrowing money, except for one purpose, and limited the amount that might borrowed even for that purpose during a single year. Such being my interpretation of the constitutional provision in question, it follows therefrom that the trial court acted properly in directing a verdict for the defendant, because each bond showed on its face that the aggregate debt thereby created in a single year was $50,000, and because the purchasers of the bonds were bound to take notice of the amount of the assessed valuation, which valuation did not authorize the creation of a debt by loan in a single year to an amount exceeding $16,500. Dixon Co. v. Field, 111 U. S. 83, 4 Sup. Ct. 315; Hedges v. Dixon Co., 150 U S. 182, 14 Sup. Ct. 71; Lake Co. v. Graham, 130 U. S. 674, 9 Sup. Ct. 654. The plaintiff below was not an innocent purchaser of the bonds in suit, but was affected with knowledge of a want of power in the county to issue the bonds, which rendered the same void. My associates apparently agree with me that the debt evidenced by the bonds in suit was a debt contracted by loan, so that nothing need be said on that point. The judgment being, in my opinion, for the right party, on uncontradicted facts disclosed by the record, I think it should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
