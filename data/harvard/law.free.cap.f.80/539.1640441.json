Prieth, and Benedict Prieth, for alleged infringement of letters patent Uo. 376,-053, issued January 3, 1888, to John H. Stonemetz, for an improvement in printing presses. The court below granted a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>injunction, on the strength of a decision by the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts (64 Fed. 782) sustaining the patent. 77 Fed. 976. From the order granting said injunction the defendants have appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-4\">Arthur E.

Marden, 64 Fed. 782; the court below declining to consider any question involving the regularity and validity of that adjudication. The learned judge below in his 'opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cSo long as the decree of the circuit court of the district of Massachusetts stands unrevoked and unmodified, the comity which exists between federal \u2022courts justifies this court, upon an application of this kind, in accepting its conclusions.\u201d 77 Fed. 976.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Uow, pending this appeal,\u2014on March 9, 1897,\u2014the United States, circuit court of appeals for the First circuit reversed the decree of the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts, and directed the dismissal of the bill of complaint there. The decree of the court of appeals, as appears from a duly-certified copy filed in this court, is in the words following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201cThe petition for a rehearing is granted, and, having been fully heard, the judgment heretofore entered is vacated, the decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court, with directions to dismiss the bill because of accord and satisfaction, and without costs to either party in \u2022either court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">This latter decree, while not decisive of the merits of the controversy, nevertheless deprives the adjudication of the circuit court of the district of Massachusetts of the conclusive effect which the court below felt constrained to give to it; and, in view of the changed condition of the litigation touching this patent, we are of the opinion that the appellants should be relieved from preliminary injunction. It is therefore ordered and decreed that the injunction granted by the circuit court against the appellants be, and the same is, dissolved, with costs in this court to the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
