There was evidence that the plaintiff was exercising proper care and Craft was negligent. A verdict was directed for the defendant on the ground that there was no evidence that the defendant \" was responsible for the acts or defaults of said Craft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant testified that Craft asked if he could take the automobile to go home and leave his luggage, \" he would drive the car back.\u201d Craft testified that he was returning to the defendant\u2019s house when the collision happened. The plaintiff testified that in the course of conversation with the defendant at the place of the accident, shortly after the occurrence, he asked her, \" how it happened,\u201d and she replied, \u201c Your man was driving so fast that he couldn\u2019t stop the car.\u201d She also testified that the defendant \u201c did not in any way remonstrate that Mr. Craft was not his man \u201d; that the defendant said to her, \u201c You are all right, I will adjust the damage to your car, but will probably have to pay for mine \u201d; that \"he would like to have me give me [him?] a post-dated check for the amount to enable him to borrow the money to pay the damages on his car so that he could get it to use it, \u2014 to show my good faith, provided he adjusted the damages on my car and \u201c he advised me to have my repair man make my bill larger, to cover the damages to both cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The defendant denied that he offered to settle the plaintiff\u2019s damage. He testified he said to her that he would not settle her damages, because he did not think that Craft was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The defendant\u2019s promise to adjust the'damages to the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was not an offer of compromise but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>an admission that he was at fault, and if the jury believed he gave this promise, they could infer from this that Craft was in fact acting as his agent when the collision took place. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>172 Mass. 220. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>232 Mass. 183, 186. <em>Mielke </em>v. <em>Dobrydnio, </em>244 Mass. 89, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The evidence of the.conversation concerning the method of settlement of the damages to both automobiles, and the defendant\u2019s request that the plaintiff\u2019s claim should cover the entire damages to both the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s property, as well as the defendant\u2019s silence and his failure to dissent when Craft was spoken of as <em>\u201c </em>your man,\u201d was some evidence for the jury that the driver of the machine was acting as his agent when the accident happened.
