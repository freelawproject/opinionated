The contract contains the following recital: \u201c All verbal, or written agreements not mentioned in this contract are void.\u201d The defendants seek to rescind the sale because of the alleged false representations. We need not decide whether the representations of the agent could be found to be ground for such rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">To entitle a buyer to rescind a sale, he must have notified the seller within a reasonable time of his election to rescind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>and must return or offer to return the goods sold in substantially as good condition as they were in at the time when the property passed. This rule applies under the sales act, St. 1908, c. 237, \u00a7 69, cl. 3, now G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 58, cl. 3, and is in accord with the rule of the common law. <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>1 Cush. 271, 274. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>105 Mass. 551. <em>Skillings </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>224 Mass. 275, 277. <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>234 Mass. 101, 107. Williston on Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 610, 611. The undisputed evidence shows that the defendants have used the goods sold ever since the sale was made, and that no offer has been made to return them. In these circumstances, they cannot rescind the sale but are chargeable for the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial judge rightly allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
