Austin, without the knowledge of the plaintiff, had insured his mortgage interest with an insurance company other than the defendant company. This policy was in force at the time of the fire and has not been paid. This insurance of the mortgagee was not in violation of the condition that the company shall not be liable <em>\u201c </em>(b) If at the time a loss occurs there be any other insurance . . . which would attach if this insurance had not been effected.\u201d It was an insurance obtained by the mortgagee on his own interest in another insurance company and it could not have been controlled or prevented by the plaintiff. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Watertown Fire Ins. Co. </em>131 Mass. 1, 8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Whether the words \u201c The automobile described is fully paid for by the assured and is not mortgaged or otherwise encumbered, except as follows,\u201d contained in paragraph <em>\u201c </em>3 \u201d of the <em>\u201c </em>Warranties,\u201d are to be treated as a declaration of fact by the assured, or as a question of the insurance policy to be answered by the assured in a blank space beneath these words, and whether, if not a declaration of fact, an answer thereto was waived by the issuance of the policy without such an answer, need not be determined; because in any event it sufficiently appears that the interest of the assured in the property insured was other than that of unconditional and sole ownership. The defect in the plaintiff\u2019s title went to the essence of the contract of insurance and the policy under its conditions never took effect. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins.
