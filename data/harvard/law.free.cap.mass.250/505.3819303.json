The action was tried with another by the same plaintiff, against Michael Rome, for damages growing out of the same accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">There was evidence that the name \u201c Rome \u201d was on the truck; that a short time after the collision the defendant was present at the place of the accident and said to a police officer, who had stated he was going to put Michael under arrest, that \u201che owned the truck, that he wanted to take Michael home,\u201d and \u201cwould make good anything he [Michael] had done\u201d; that he \u201cwould give a thousand dollars to be allowed to take him home, and make everything all right\u201d; that Michael \u201cwas his boy, \u201d and had a right to drive the car; and that he, the defendant, would assume all responsibility. There was evidence that Michael was asked \u201cwhere he was bound for, \u201d and answered, \u201che was going on a job\u201d and testimony tending to show that Michael was drunk and was put under arrest. The statements of the father that he assumed responsibility, that he would \u201cmake good\u201d and pay money, may have been made with reference to securing the boy\u2019s release. This, however, was a question for the jury. They could have found that the defendant assumed responsibility for the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and from this it could be inferred that Michael was his agent and engaged in his business at the time of the collision and that it resulted from his fault. From the defendant\u2019s admission of responsibility it could have been found that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>admitted his liability for the agent\u2019s acts, and that the acts of the agent were authorized. This evidence was not an offer of compromise, it was in the nature of an admission, and for this reason could be considered by the jury. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>172 Mass. 220. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>232 Mass. 183, 186. <em>Mielke </em>v. <em>Dobrydnio, </em>244 Mass. 89, 92. <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Swerdlove, post, </em>507.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">As there was- evidence sufficient to warrant the court in submitting the case to the jury on the question of agency, according to the terms of the report judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
