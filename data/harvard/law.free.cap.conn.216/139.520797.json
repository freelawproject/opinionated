On appeal, the defendant raises the sole issue of whether the trial court should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>overruled his objections to the so-called \u201cpoliceman at the elbow\u201d questions that the state asked his expert witness on cross-examination. He claims that these questions elicited opinions from the expert regarding ultimate issues of fact reserved for the jury, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86\u00cd,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as in contravention of the trial court\u2019s prior ruling on the state\u2019s motion in limine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The murder charge against the defendant arose from his admitted shooting of Sheila Ann Kelly, his former girlfriend. In November, 1987, Kelly purportedly attempted to terminate her relationship with the defendant, who had a history of psychological problems, including a suicide attempt. Kelly nonetheless attended a Christmas party with the defendant on December 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1987. After the party, the defendant and Kelly went to his grandparents\u2019 house, where the defendant then lived, and engaged in sexual intercourse in the defendant\u2019s room. Kelly thereafter told the defendant not to believe that they would get back together just because they had sexual relations that night. When the defendant was driving Kelly home, he became angry, stopped his car in a secluded area, and removed a rifle from the trunk of the car, allegedly intending to commit suicide. He then went to the front of the car and shot Kelly in the head three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The principal issue at trial was whether the defendant specifically intended to kill Kelly as alleged by the state, or rather killed Kelly while under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance as the defendant claimed in an affirmative defense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a. Prior to the presentation of the defendant\u2019s case, the state filed a motion in limine requesting a ruling that the defense experts be prohibited, under \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, from expressing \u201can opinion or inference as to whether the defendant was under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the acts alleged in the information.\u201d After defense counsel agreed with the trial court\u2019s statement that \u00a7 54-86\u00cd prevented the parties from seeking an \u201copinion or inference as to whether the defendant was under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the alleged act,\u201d the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Subsequently, the defendant called an expert witness, Kenneth Selig, a psychiatrist, to testify as to his diagnosis of the defendant\u2019s mental condition. Without objection by the state, defense counsel asked Selig if he had an opinion whether at the time of the shooting the defendant suffered \u201cfrom a mental disease or defect that would rise to the level of insanity under our [pjenal [c]ode,\u201d to which Selig answered that in his opinion the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>defendant did not. The state then requested that the jury be excused, and expressed its concern to the trial court that the defense would next ask Selig, in violation of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, whether the defendant had a mental disease or defect that rose to the level of extreme emotional disturbance. The state argued that Selig might \u201crespond . . . by saying [the defendant] lost control .... Now, those are issues for the jury to determine whether or not he could control himself in this particular instance. ... I do not think he can say it would cause [the defendant] to [lose] control . . . [b]ecause that is an essential part of extreme emotional disturbance . . . because that is a part of the definition of extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d The trial court, rather than expressing agreement with the state\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, noted that \u201cthe ultimate question here, the element is whether it is extreme emotional [disturbance],\u201d and permitted the state to voir dire Selig in order to resolve the state\u2019s doubts.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After a voir dire of Selig, in the jury\u2019s absence, satisfied the state that his testimony would fall within the permissible bounds of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, Selig testified further on direct examination that as a result of the defendant\u2019s break-up with Kelly, \u201c[the defendant] was devastated. His world was shattered. He was enraged, despondent, felt hopeless, felt that he couldn\u2019t go on, felt that life wasn\u2019t worth living without her.\u201d Upon cross-examination of Selig, the following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Okay. Doctor .... Do you think if there was a policeman in that secluded area, standing there and then [the defendant] drove in with his headlights [on] and saw the policeman there, do you think that he would have gone to the back of the car and gotten the gun and walked over to the side of the car and shot . . . Kelly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection. Relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Claim it. It deals with mental state, if Your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Relevance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: It deals with mental state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201c[The Court]: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201c[The Court]: Exception is noted. Can you answer the question Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: ... I haven\u2019t thought about it yet. I could give it some thought right now if you would like. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: No . . . Then I gather as you sit there right now, you do not have an opinion that he would have shot her even if there was a policeman standing there. Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Let\u2019s forget the policeman in uniform. . . . Supposing there was another couple in the car there making love or right close by, would he have drove up close by and parked his car and gone to the trunk and gotten his rifle, his loaded .22 rifle and gone to the side of the car and shot . . . Kelly through the head twice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-17\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Claim it, if Your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-18\">\u201c[The Court]: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-19\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Exception, please, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-20\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Do you have an opinion on that, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-21\"><em>\u00a1it </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-22\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: I think that that would have been sufficient to have stopped him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Okay. Now, Doctor . . . why did you think so long about that? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: I think it\u2019s an extremely important question. ... I gave a different amount of thought to that [than] I would have in a different case. And I, in order to reflect on it, part of what I needed to consider was [the defendant\u2019s] susceptibility to structure and authority. And I think that generally with authority figures, he attempted to behave appropriately. And that given that degree of structure, it probably would have stopped him. I needed to consider those things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Now, in responding just a moment ago, I believe I heard you say that he reacts to authority figures. I think my second question said, suppose there is another couple in the car nearby. I want to ask you, do you consider another couple in a car to be authority figures?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: And the policeman. And I would change my answer to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: You would change your answer to the policeman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: Yes, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: All right, tell us how you would change your answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">\u201c[Dr. Selig]: That he, a policeman being there probably would stop him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">It is this exchange that the defendant claims violated the proscriptions of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, as well as the trial court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s motion in limine. Furthermore, the defendant contends that the harm resulting from the exchange is apparent from the state\u2019s reduction of its case down to Selig\u2019s answers by referring the jury to Selig\u2019s answers in closing argument and stating \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the whole case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We note first that the defendant, by objecting to the state\u2019s questions on relevancy grounds, failed to preserve properly the issue he has raised on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 requires that appealable claims of error be distinctly raised at trial. See also Practice Book \u00a7 288; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 273, 533 A.2d 545 (1987). Nor is the defendant entitled to <em>Evans </em>review of this issue, for the admissibility of expert opinion testimony is a matter of state evidentiary law, rather than a matter of constitutional significance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>209 Conn. 423, 426, 551 A.2d 742 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 46-47, 540 A.2d 42 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Since the defendant\u2019s claim is not \u201cof constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); one of the four preconditions to <em>Evans </em>review, his claim to <em>Evans </em>review is without merit. See id., 239-40. Because the parties have raised and briefed a single issue on appeal, and the record in this case provides an adequate basis for appellate review, we nonetheless exercise our discretion and review the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201c \u2018The true test for the admissibility of expert testimony is \u201cwhether the witnesses offered as experts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>any peculiar knowledge or experience, not common to the world, which renders their opinions founded on such knowledge or experience any aid to the court or the jury in determining the question at issue.\u201d \u2019 <em>Schomer </em>v. <em>Shilepsky, </em>169 Conn. 186, 191, 363 A.2d 128 (1975), quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>43 Conn. 36, 44 (1875). . . . \u2018Generally, expert testimony may be admitted if the witness has a special skill or knowledge, beyond the ken of the average juror, that, as properly applied, would be helpful to the determination of an ultimate issue.\u2019 <em>Siladi </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>164 Conn. 510, 513, 325 A.2d 277 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 166, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985). The trial court has broad discretion in applying these concepts and in ruling on the admissibility of expert opinions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>207 Conn. 646, 651, 542 A.2d 1136 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986). \u201cThe exercise of such discretion is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>203 Conn. 445, 452, 525 A.2d 101 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The defendant claims, as noted, that the state\u2019s questions and Selig\u2019s answers regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to control himself in a hypothetical situation violated \u00a7 54-86\u00cd. In support of his claim, the defendant first notes that in order to prevail on his affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, the trier of fact must find: (1) the emotional disturbance is not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of insanity as defined by the penal code; (2) the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness; and (3) the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there was a loss of self-control, and reason was overborne by extreme intense feeling, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 9, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). Because Selig\u2019s testimony was directed to the defendant\u2019s capacity for self-control, the defendant maintains that it tended to disprove the existence of the third of these criteria. He thus argues that Selig\u2019s testimony amounted to an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the defense of extreme emotional disturbance in violation of \u00a7 54-86L</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The defendant, however, mischaracterizes the three criteria set forth in <em>Elliott </em>as \u201celements\u201d of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional distress. Section 53a-54a describes the two elements of that defense as: (1) the defendant committed the offense under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance; and (2) there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the defendant\u2019s extreme emotional disturbance. When we adopted the three criteria set forth in <em>Elliott, </em>we did not rewrite \u00a7 53a-54a, nor did we substitute our own \u201celements\u201d for those specified by the legislature. We merely interpreted the meaning of the phrase \u201cextreme emotional disturbance,\u201d and as we explained in <em>Elliott, </em>enumerated \u201cunderstandable guidelines\u201d for \u201cinstructing a jury\u201d in determining the presence or absence of that mental condition. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, 8-9. These guidelines also serve to focus the presentation of evidence on three factual bases that we have deemed essential to support the inference that a defendant suffered from extreme emotional disturbance at a particular time. They are neither conclusive nor exclusive, however, for \u201c[i]n the final analysis . . . the ultimate determination of the presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance [is] one of fact for the trier, aided by expert testimony of both sides, but left to its own factual determinations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 395, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Moreover, in construing \u00a7 54-86\u00cd narrowly, we have assumed that the legislature enacted the statute to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332-33, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987). A broad construction of the statute, taken to its extreme, would arguably bar experts from fully testifying to their diagnoses of a defendant and to their resulting professional opinions, from which the jury could infer the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of a particular act. Jurors would thus be left without adequate expert assistance in making an informed decision upon the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state, the precise issue expressly reserved to them by \u00a7 54-86\u00cd. Additionally, a defendant\u2019s ability to prove affirmative defenses involving mental state would be severely curtailed. Consequently, we do not believe that the legislature intended to proscribe expert opinion testimony with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state so strictly as to render it an ineffective aid to the jury, or to eclipse the role of expert opinion testimony in substantiating a defendant\u2019s claim to have suffered from a certain mental condition at the time of an act alleged to be criminal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Therefore, in the present case, \u00a7 54-86\u00cd proscribed expert opinion testimony only with respect to whether the defendant was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time he killed Kelly. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. Since the state\u2019s questions neither called for nor elicited Selig\u2019s expert opinion as to whether the defendant was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time he killed Kelly, we hold that the questions and the resulting testimony did not violate \u00a7 54-86L Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to the state\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative DEFENSES.

Since we affirm the judgment of the trial court, we need not address these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\"> We summarily dispose of that portion of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court contravened its prior ruling on the state\u2019s motion in limine when it overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to the state\u2019s subsequent questions. The trial court\u2019s ruling, as noted, merely precluded the parties from seeking direct expert opinion as to whether the defendant suffered from extreme emotional disturbance. Therefore, we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the element of control was foreclosed from the jury\u2019s consideration by the court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s motion in limine. The question of control arose later in the trial and an examination of the record reveals that the trial court never expressly ruled inadmissible expert opinion testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s capacity for self-control.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
