The question comes to us upon certification from a decision rendered by the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>19 Conn. App. 478, 563 A.2d 730 (1989); affirming the conviction of the defendant, Michael Joseph Marsala, for two violations of the state dependency producing drug law, General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that a \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule is incompatible with the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, that the decision of the Appellate Court, applying such an exception, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The facts underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction are set forth in an opinion rendered by the Appellate Court after the defendant had appealed from that judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>15 Conn. App. 519, 520-22, 545 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 816, 550 A.2d 1087 (1988) <em>(Marsala I). </em>Incriminating evidence was seized from both the defendant\u2019s person and his home, pursuant to a search warrant issued for the purpose of allowing police officers to search those two places. More pertinent to our decision today, however, are the legal conclusions reached by both the trial and Appellate courts on the basis of the facts set forth in <em>Marsala I. </em>After a hearing conducted for the purpose of ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized, the trial court granted the motion as to the evidence taken from the defendant\u2019s home but denied the motion as to the evidence obtained from his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The trial court concluded that the affidavit, submitted in support of the search warrant application, contained no information from which the issuing judge could have determined the basis of knowledge of two informants whose observations had been relied on by the affiants. Further, the trial court concluded that information contained in the affidavit detailing a surveillance of the defendant conducted by police officers did nothing to corroborate, in regard to a search of the defendant\u2019s home, the informants\u2019 descriptions of the defendant\u2019s activities. <em>Marsala I, </em>supra, 522; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235-36, 496 A.2d 498 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied, however, the motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>suppress the evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s person, reasoning that observations of the defendant\u2019s activities, made by one of the affiants, had corroborated the details provided by the informants and that the combined information, therefore, constituted probable cause to arrest the defendant. <em>Marsala I, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Before the Appellate Court, the state conceded that the \u201cwarrant executed upon the person and residence of the defendant was fatally defective in that the underlying affidavit lacked the requisite indicia of reliability and basis of knowledge\u201d of the two informants. Id., 523. The state argued, however, that the admission of the items seized from the defendant\u2019s person could be justified under the investigative stop doctrine as set forth in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).The Appellate Court rejected this contention; <em>Marsala I, </em>supra, 523-24; but relying upon its prior decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Conn. App. 605, 543 A.2d 750, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 816, 546 A.2d 283 (1988), remanded the case to the trial court so that it could resolve certain factual matters and determine whether the admission of the seized items could be justified under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), and <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984). <em>Marsala I, </em>supra, 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On remand, the trial court issued a written decision in compliance with the directive of the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to make four specific determinations. The trial court concluded: (1) \u201cthe affiants did not mislead the issuing judge\u201d; <em>see Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978); (2) there was \u201cno evidence that the issuing judge wholly abandoned his judicial role\u201d; see <em>Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>442 U.S. 319, 99 S. Ct. 2319, 60 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1979); (3) \u201cthe police officers did have a reasonable belief that the warrant was valid\u201d; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 610-11, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring); and (4) \u201cthe warrant was not so facially deficient in its lack of particularity, regarding the place to be searched or the articles to be seized, that the executing officers could not reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 923. In his appeal from this decision, the defendant did not contest the trial court\u2019s first, second or fourth conclusions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>19 Conn. App. 478, 480, 563 A.2d 730 (1989) <em>(Marsala II). </em>Thus, the issue before the Appellate Court was \u201cwhether the trial court erred in concluding on remand that the officers executing the warrant acted in objectively determinable good faith and that, therefore, the \u2018good faith\u2019 exception to the exclusionary rule applied.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court concluded, upon its own independent review of the record and transcripts, that the trial court had not erred and that the evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s person was properly admitted at his trial. Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification; see Practice Book \u00a7 4126 et seq.; limited to the following issue: \u201cDoes a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule exist under Connecticut law; and if so, did the Appellate Court err in concluding that the good faith exception was applicable in this case?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>213 Conn. 805, 567 A.2d 836 (1989). We answer the first portion of this question in the negative and, therefore, need not consider the second portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The defendant claims that apart from any constitutional considerations, General Statutes \u00a7 54-33f<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> mandates the exclusion of illegally seized evidence and that the statute\u2019s operation is unimpeded by any good faith exception. See Practice Book \u00a7 822.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant relies principally on: (1) \u00a7 54-33f (c), which provides that if a suppression motion is granted, \u201cthe property shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention and <em>it shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial\u201d </em>(emphasis added); (2) Practice Book \u00a7 821, which provides that, upon motion of the defendant, \u201cthe judicial authority shall suppress potential testimony or other evidence if he finds that suppression is required under the constitution or laws of the United States or the state of Connecticut\u201d; and (3) the fact that there have been two unsuccessful legislative attempts to amend \u00a7 54-33f, so as to include a good faith exception to the'exclusionary rule. See 1983 House Bill No. 5125;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1985 House Bill No. 7011.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance upon Practice Book \u00a7 821 is without merit. That provision establishes no substantive standard for the suppression of illegally seized evidence, but, rather, depends upon the applicable interpretation of either the United States or Connecticut constitution to determine whether evidence should be suppressed. If the provisions of either constitution, as currently interpreted, require the suppression of any evidence seized, \u00a7 821 merely directs the judicial authority to carry forth that suppression. In that regard, it is the constitution either of the United States or the state of Connecticut that requires the suppression, not \u00a7 821. Accordingly, \u00a7 821 incorporates the existing standards of search and seizure jurisprudence, as set forth by this court, our Appellate Court and the United States Supreme Court, leaving to trial courts the task of determining whether suppression is required in a particular case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Regarding the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 54-33f and the virtually identical provisions of \u00a7 822 preclude the adoption of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, we agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s resolution of this issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 623-26, holding that the statute and Practice Book provisions are procedural rather than substantive and, therefore, do not define the extent of the exclusionary rule under Connecticut law. We have previously noted that \u00a7 54-33f was enacted in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that prior to that decision there was \u201cno [express] provision in our practice for a motion to suppress.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mariano, </em>152 Conn. 85, 89, 203 A.2d 305 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 943, 85 S. Ct. 1025, 13 L. Ed. 2d 962 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Section 54-33f provides expressly that evidence may be suppressed on the ground that \u201c[t]he property was seized without a warrant,\u201d and that if the motion is granted, \u201cthe property . . . shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial.\u201d If we were to accept the defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 54-33f provides substantive rights rather than a procedure for implementing motions to suppress evidence, numerous decisions of this court, upholding the introduction of evidence seized without a warrant, simply could not be justified, since the introduction would have been in direct violation of the statutory provision. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 271, 528 A.2d 760 (1987) (exigent circumstances); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gasparro, </em>194 Conn. 96, 107, 480 A.2d 509 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 828, 106 S. Ct. 90, 88 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1985) (inventory searches); <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 443-45, 441 A.2d 857 (1982) (plain view doctrine); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>186 Conn. 45, 48-49, 438 A.2d 872 (1982) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(search incident to a lawful custodial arrest); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 155-57, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981) (automobile exception to warrant requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendant also argues that the legislature\u2019s failure to adopt two proposed amendments to \u00a7 54-33f, which would have included a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, \u201care powerful signals that (1) our legislators did not believe that we already had a statutory good faith exception, (2) nor were they convinced that we should adopt one.\u201d We conclude that the legislature\u2019s failure to adopt these proposed amendments, although possibly indicative of both of the \u201csignals\u201d advanced by the defendant, cannot transform a procedural statute or Practice Book provision into one that provides criminal defendants with substantive rights. In cases in which this court has considered the legal effect of failed attempts to amend existing law, we have viewed those failures as indicative of legislative approval of an existing interpretation of substantive law. \u201cThe legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation placed upon its legislation by the courts and the effect which its own nonaction thereafter may ha <em>ye.\u201d Buxton v. Ullman, </em>147 Conn. 48, 56, 156 A.2d 508 (1959), appeal dismissed, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 327,334 n.13, 471 A.2d 646 (1984); <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 63, 111 A.2d 4 (1955); see generally 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (1984) \u00a7 48.18; D. O\u2019Con-nor,\" \u201cThe Use of Connecticut Legislative History in Statutory Construction,\u201d 58 Conn. B.J. 422, 437-39 (1984). We discern, however, little or no inferential value in the failed amendments in this case, since \u00a7 54-33f has never been interpreted by this court as providing anything more than a procedural mechanism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>for the bringing of motions to suppress evidence. Thus, even if both of the defendant\u2019s assumptions regarding \u201csignals\u201d from the legislature concerning a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule are correct, those \u201csignals\u201d are simply inapplicable when they concern substantive rights and the existing law is one of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim, which we find persuasive, is that a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule is incompatible with article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, which provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d This language has remained unchanged since it was first adopted as article first, \u00a7 8, of our 1818 constitution,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and is quite similar to the protections afforded by the fourth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We have frequently relied upon decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>amendment, as well as other amendments to the United States constitution, to define the contours of the protections provided in the various sections of the declaration of rights contained in our state constitution. We have also, however, determined in some instances that the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 112, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 166, 537 A.2d 446 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235-36, 496 A.2d 498 (1985). In so doing, we have recognized that \u201c[i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties\u2014which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014we sit as a court of last resort, subject only to the qualification that our interpretations may not restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter. In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut residents have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641-42, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In this case, we are called upon to determine whether the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, as adopted by the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, and applied by that court in this case, upon \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d is to become the law of this state. In <em>Leon, </em>after \u201caccepting the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that probable cause [for issuance of a search warrant] was lacking under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>prevailing legal standards\u201d; <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 905; the United States Supreme Court held, nevertheless, \u201cthat the marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion.\u201d Id., 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In arriving at this conclusion, the court began its analysis by noting that: (1) the fourth amendment \u201ccontains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands\u201d; id., 906; (2) \u201cthe use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure \u2018work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong\u2019 \u201d; id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 354, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974); (3) \u201c[t]he wrong condemned by the Amendment is \u2018fully accomplished\u2019 by the unlawful search or seizure itself\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>supra; and (4) \u201cthe exclusionary rule is neither intended nor able to \u2018cure the invasion of the defendant\u2019s rights which he has already suffered.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, quoting <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 540, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (1976) (White, J., dissenting). On these grounds, the court reiterated that the exclusionary \u201crule thus operates as \u2018a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>supra, 348. Stating that the issue before it was \u201c[wjhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case,\u201d and not \u201c \u2018whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct\u2019 \u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, quoting <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 223, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983); the court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>question \u201cmust be resolved by weighing the costs and benefits of preventing the use in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief of inherently trustworthy tangible evidence obtained in reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that ultimately is found to be defective.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Leon, supra, 906-907.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">According to the court in <em>Leon, </em>\u201c[t]he substantial social costs exacted by the exclusionary rule for the vindication of Fourth Amendment rights have long been a source of concern.\u201d Id., 907. Thus, according to the <em>Leon </em>court, \u201c \u2018[o]ur cases have consistently recognized that unbending application of the exclusionary sanction to enforce ideals of governmental rectitude would impede unacceptably the truth-finding functions of judge and jury.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payner, </em>447 U.S. 727, 734, 100 S. Ct. 2439, 65 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1980). Despite noting that many researchers \u201chave concluded that the impact of the exclusionary rule is insubstantial\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 908 n.6; the court declared that \u201c[a]n objectionable collateral consequence of this interference with the criminal justice system\u2019s truth-finding function is that some guilty defendants may go free or receive reduced sentences as a result of favorable plea bargains.\u201d Id., 907. The court justified this observation by noting that the relatively small percentage of cases resulting in nonprose-cution or nonconviction because of the exclusionary rule<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cmask a large absolute number of felons who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>released because the cases against them were based in part on illegal searches or seizures.\u201d Id., 908 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s conclusion regarding the costs of the exclusionary rule has been criticized on numerous levels. First, there is the obvious inconsistency between the \u201csubstantial\u201d costs of the exclusionary rule, as identified by the court, and the \u201cinsubstantial\u201d impact of the rule, as found by the research on which the court relied. As one commentator has stated, \u201c[t]o date, the most careful and balanced assessment of all available empirical data shows \u2018that the general level of the rule\u2019s effects on criminal prosecutions is marginal at most.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 1.3 (c), p. 52, quoting, T. Davies, \u201cA Hard Look at What We Know (and Still Need to Learn) About the \u2018Costs\u2019 of the Exclusionary Rule: The NIJ Study and Other Studies of \u2018Lost\u2019 Arrests,\u201d 1983 Am. B. Found. Research J. 611, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Second, the <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s assessment of the costs of the exclusionary rule is based on the effect of the rule in all cases instead of on the effect it would have in those cases in which evidence was suppressed despite the objectively reasonable behavior of the police offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cers involved. As Justice Brennan noted, the <em>Leon </em>majority \u201cignores this distinction and mistakenly weighs the aggregated costs of exclusion in <em>all </em>cases, irrespective of the circumstance that led to exclusion . . . against the potential benefits associated with only those cases in which evidence is excluded because police reasonably but mistakenly believe that their conduct does not violate the Fourth Amendment .... When such faulty scales are used, it is little wonder that the balance tips in favor of restricting the application of the rule.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 951 (Brennan, J., dissenting). \u201cThis is not an insignificant error, for had the Court\u2019s \u2018cost\u2019 inquiry been properly focused it would have been apparent that the relevant costs are insubstantial.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 1.3 (c), p. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Finally, the <em>Leon </em>court \u201cconsistently and repeatedly refers to the costs of the exclusionary rule as if they were somehow a matter quite distinct from the Fourth Amendment itself.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 1.3 (c), p. 53. In this regard, we agree with former Justice Stewart, who has noted that \u201c[mjuch of the criticism leveled at the exclusionary rule is misdirected; it is more properly directed at the fourth amendment itself. . . . The exclusionary rule places no limitations on the actions of the police. The fourth amendment does. The inevitable result of the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and its requirement that no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause is that police officers who obey its strictures will catch fewer criminals. That is not a political outcome impressed upon an unwilling citizenry by unbeknighted judges. It is the price the framers anticipated and were willing to pay to ensure the sanctity of the person, the home, and property against unrestrained governmental power.\u201d P. Stewart, \u201cThe Road to <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Seareh-and-Seizure Cases,\u201d 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1392-93 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Although we recognize that the exclusionary rule exacts a certain \u201ccost\u201d from society in the form of the suppression of relevant evidence in criminal trials, we conclude, nevertheless, that this \u201ccost\u201d is not sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to overcome the benefits to be gained by our disavowal of the <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. We base this conclusion on both the criticism leveled against the <em>Leon </em>opinion itself and our willingness in other areas of the law to uphold the exclusion of concededly reliable and relevant evidence on the basis of some greater benefit that will be realized by its suppression. Thus, for example, an otherwise voluntary and reliable confession is excluded from a criminal trial on the basis of a violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), an exclusionary rule that we have adopted as an interpretation of the due process clause contained in article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 447, 534 A.2d 219 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 47, 51 n.3, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 45 n.12, 463 A.2d 573 (1983). Similarly, numerous categories of reliable and relevant evidence are excluded from both civil and criminal trials on the basis of either a common law or statutorily created privilege against disclosure. See generally C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 12.5 (Attorney and Client), \u00a7 12.6 (Husband and Wife), \u00a7 12.7 (Minor and Advisor), \u00a7 12.8 (Physician and Patient), \u00a7 12.9 (Psychiatrist and Patient), \u00a7 12.10 (Psychologist and Patient), \u00a7 12.11 (Priest and Penitent), \u00a7 12.12 (Journalist and Source), \u00a7 12.13 (Identity of an Informer), \u00a7 12.14 (Management and Labor), \u00a7 12.15 (Deaf or Hearing-Impaired Persons), \u00a7 12.16 (Battered or Raped Victim and Counselor), and \u00a7 12.17 (Family Relations Officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In its own analysis of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the exclusionary rule, the <em>Leon </em>court first concluded that operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of the rule could have no deterrent effect upon the judicial authorities who actually issue search warrants. According to the <em>Leon </em>court, \u201cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates. Second, there exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion. Third, and most important, we discern no basis, and are offered none, for believing that exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant will have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge or magistrate.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 916; see S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mertens, \u201cThe Exclusionary Rule on the Scaffold: But Was it a Fair Trial?\u201d 22 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 85, 106 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Having concluded that the exclusionary rule could have no deterrent effect on those who issue search warrants, the <em>Leon </em>court next reasoned that \u201c[i]f exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect ... it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 918. Responding to arguments that the exclusionary rule without a good faith exception would deter inadequate presentations by the police in the affidavits submitted in support of search warrant applications and would discourage \u201cmagistrate shopping,\u201d the <em>Leon </em>court found \u201csuch arguments speculative and conclude[d] that suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d Id. Virtually foreclosing any exclusion when the police \u201cofficer\u2019s conduct is objectively reasonable\u201d; id., 919; the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>concluded that \u201c[i]n most such cases, there is no police illegality and thus nothing to deter. It is the magistrate\u2019s responsibility to determine whether the officer\u2019s allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. . . . Penalizing the officer for the magistrate\u2019s error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d Id., 920-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We simply cannot accept the conclusion reached by the <em>Leon </em>court as a result of its weighing of the relevant costs and benefits of excluding evidence obtained through police officers\u2019 good faith reliance upon a warrant issued by a detached and neutral judicial official. Initially, we note that the exclusionary rule, although primarily directed at police misconduct, is also appropriately directed at the warrant issuing process, and that \u201cit is somewhat odd to suppose that the exclusionary rule was not designed to deter the issuance of invalid warrants.\u201d S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mertens, supra, 106. Just as with the fourth amendment, when article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution was adopted, \u201cits purpose plainly was to prohibit the issuance of warrants that did not satisfy its requirements of probable cause and particularity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id. The text of article first, \u00a7 7, is clear: \u201c[N]o warrant . . . <em>shall issue . . </em>. without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While we might agree that the exclusionary rule was not designed \u201cto <em>punish </em>the errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of judges and magistrates\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 916; we cannot agree that the rule as it stood before <em>Leon </em>was not a significant factor inducing judges to take seriously their obligation to ensure that the probable cause requirement of article first, \u00a7 7, had been met before issuing search warrants based on information contained in affidavits provided to them by police officers. We are confident that, at least in this state, search warrants failing to meet the probable cause requirement more often \u201cresult from carelessness than from intentional constitutional violations, and just as surely the exclusionary rule is logically directed to those more common violations.\u201d 1W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 1.3 (d), p. 55. In this sense, the issuing authority, when the determination of probable cause is overturned on appeal, is not being \u201cpunished\u201d for a mistake, but is, rather, being informed that a constitutional violation has taken place and is also being instructed in how to avoid such violations in the future. \u201cIn other words, the longstanding applicability of the exclusionary rule in with-warrant cases has served not only to deter the occasional ill-spirited magistrate, but more importantly to influence judicial behavior more generally by . . . creating an \u2018incentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 561, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982). Thus, \u201c[t]he more important issue ... is not the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule on the conduct of individual magistrates, but the extent to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the rule helps preserve the integrity of the warrant issuing process as a whole.\u201d S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mer-tens, supra, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We conclude that a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would have several negative effects upon this constitutionally mandated warrant issuing process. First, under the good faith exception, \u201cpolice need concern themselves only with getting a warrant and not with getting a warrant that will hold up on review.\u201d Id. Thus, although we are confident that most police officers take very seriously their obligation to present a reviewing authority with a constitutionally adequate basis for the issuance of a warrant, the good faith exception would encourage some police officers to expend less effort in establishing the necessary probable cause to search and more effort in locating a judge who might be less exacting than some others when ruling on whether an affidavit has established the requisite level of probable cause. Second, the \u201cexception for good faith reliance upon a warrant implicitly tells magistrates that they need not take much care in reviewing warrant applications, since their mistakes will from now on have virtually no consequence . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 956 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Finally, despite the <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s assertion that there \u201cis no need for courts to adopt the inflexible practice of always deciding whether the officers\u2019 conduct manifested objective good faith before turning to the question whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated\u201d; id., 924, it is unlikely \u201cthat overburdened trial and appellate courts will take the time and effort to write advisory opinions on [search and seizure] law when they can just as easily admit the evidence under the good faith exception.\u201d S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mer-tens, supra, 111; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 957 n.15 (Brennan, J., dissenting). If we were to adopt the good faith exception, our practice of declining to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>doubtful constitutional issues unless they are essential to the disposition of a case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> would preclude our consideration of probable cause beyond reviewing whether an officer had an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d belief in its existence. Absent a meaningful necessity to review probable cause determinations, we conclude that close cases will become \u201cboth the hardest to decide and the easiest to dispose of under the good faith exception; in such cases the officer\u2019s objective good faith is clearest.\u201d S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mertens, supra, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We also disagree with the <em>Leon </em>court\u2019s assertion that \u201cwhen an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 920; \u201c[penalizing the officer for the magistrate\u2019s error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d Id., 921. As a threshold observation, we note again that the exclusionary rule is not designed to \u201cpunish\u201d anyone. Id., 953 (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is, however, designed to deter future police misconduct and ensure, as nearly as can be, institutional compliance with the warrant issuing requirements of article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is not whether the officer should be punished for his past behavior, but, rather, whether the sanction of the exclusionary rule is appropriate in cases where the officer in question believed that he was doing everything correctly, but in fact had not supplied the issuing authority with information sufficient to meet the constitutional requirement of probable cause. We conclude that the rule is appropriate in these situations. \u201c[I]t is not as though we cannot expect the police to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>accurate assessments of probable cause without the help of a magistrate, for we expect them to make such assessments whenever they search or seize without a warrant, something they do far more often than search or seize with warrant in hand.\u201d S. Wasserstrom &amp; W. Mertens, supra, 113-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Further, \u201c[i]f the overall educational effect of the exclusionary ride is considered, application of the rule to even those situations in which individual police officers have acted on the basis of a reasonable but mistaken belief that their conduct was authorized can still be expected to have a considerable long-term deterrent effect. If evidence is consistently excluded in these circumstances, police departments will surely be prompted to instruct their officers to devote greater care and attention to providing sufficient information to establish probable cause when applying for a warrant, and to review with some attention the form of the warrant that they have been issued, rather than automatically assuming that whatever document the magistrate has signed will necessarily comport with Fourth Amendment requirements.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 955 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In short, we are simply unable to sanction a practice in which the validity of search warrants might be determined under a standard of \u201cclose enough is good enough\u201d instead of under the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard mandated by article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution. We hold, therefore, that a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not exist under Connecticut law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 7, provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235-36, 496 A.2d 498 (1985), held that the determination of \u201cprobable cause\u201d under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution is to be determined, when informants are relied upon, on the basis of the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d and the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d tests set forth in <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.
