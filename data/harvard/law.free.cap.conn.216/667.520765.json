J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIl\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether an error in the form of a required citation requires dismissal of an administrative appeal to the Superior Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, Lynn McQuillan and Mexican Cafe of Westport, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>sought judicial review of an order of the defendant department of liquor control (department) suspending the named plaintiffs restaurant liquor permit for five days. In the trial court, the department successfully moved for a dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal because of their alleged failure to include a citation as required by law. The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal from this judgment of dismissal in the Appellate Court. We transferred their appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal arises out of alleged liquor law violations at the Viva Zapata Restaurant in Westport.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The named plaintiff is the holder of the restaurant\u2019s liquor permit, and her coplaintiff is the restaurant\u2019s corporate backer. When the department denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for reconsideration of the five day suspension of their liquor permit, they took the present appeal to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">To initiate their administrative appeal on August 25, 1988, the plaintiffs simultaneously filed an application for temporary injunction, an order to show cause, and a verified complaint on their appeal. On September 1, 1988, these papers were simultaneously served on the department, and on the attorney general, in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>verified complaint contained a return date of September 27, 1988, while the show cause order summoned the department to appear on September 12,1988. The only citation contained in the papers, however, authorized the sheriff to summon the department to appear \u201cat the place and time specified ... to show cause why a Temporary Injunction should not be issued against it as prayed in the foregoing Appeal, Verified Complaint and Application . . . .\u2019\u2019On its face this citation does not expressly direct the department to appear in, or to answer, the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The plaintiffs did not pursue their judicial application for a temporary injunction because the department agreed administratively to stay enforcement of the liquor permit suspension order during the pendency of the administrative appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the department filed its general appearance in timely fashion, it did not move to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action until November 15,1988. The department\u2019s motion, based on Practice Book \u00a7 142,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>claimed that the appeal should be dismissed \u201cfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it does not contain a citation as required by law.\u201d The trial court, concluding that the plaintiffs had not properly cited the department to answer their appeal, granted the motion and rendered judgment for the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The principles that govern the validity of an administrative appeal are undisputed. Because the right to take an administrative appeal depends upon statutory authority, this court has regularly held that noncompliance with the statutory requirements of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act implicates subject matter jurisdiction and renders a nonconforming appeal subject to dismissal. <em>Tarnopol </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>212 Conn. 157, 163, 561 A.2d 931 (1989); <em>Hillcroft Partners </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>205 Conn. 324, 326-27, 533 A.2d 852 (1987); <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356, 514 A.2d 749 (1986); <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 324, 497 A.2d 48 (1985). Failure to include the citation required by \u00a7 4-183 (b) is fatal to the validity of an administrative appeal. <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 356-57; <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>148 Conn. 336, 338-40, 170 A.2d 732 (1961); <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>18 Conn. App. 13, 16, 555 A.2d 1007 (1989); see <em>Tarnopol </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>supra; <em>Donis </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>207 Conn. 674, 682-83, 542 A.2d 726 (1988). A procedural default that implicates subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be raised at any time. Practice Book \u00a7 142; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 543, 550-52, 489 A.2d 368 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The dispositive issue, therefore, is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal in fact failed to include the citation required by \u00a7 4-183 (b). In administrative appeals, the citation is the writ of summons that directs the sheriff or some other proper officer to seek out the defendant agency and to summon it to a particular sitting of a particular court on a specified day. 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 18. \u201cThe citation, signed by competent authority, is the warrant which bestows upon the officer to whom it is given for service the power and authority to execute its command. . . . A citation is not synonymous with notice.\u201d <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra, 339; <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 413, 419-20, 533 A.2d 879 (1987), modified, 206 Conn. 374, 538 A.2d 202 (1988); <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 408, 412, 378 A.2d 519 (1977). For administrative appeals from the liquor control commission, Practice Book Form 204.9<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contains a preferred form for citation, which the plaintiffs concededly did not use.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 mistaken failure to use the preferred form to commence an appeal is the functional equivalent of the use of an improper form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>to commence an appeal. In the latter circumstance, we held in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 356-57, that \u201c[a]s long as it contains a proper citation, signed by a competent authority, [the] use [of an improper form] does not call into question the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to entertain the appeal. ... If the form [that was used] clearly apprises all concerned that a lawsuit is being instituted, and contains notice of the return date, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the requirement for filing an appearance, and also directs a competent authority to summon the defendant, then the policy of giving notice to the defendant of the nature of the proceedings has been served. Cf. <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra. Absent an affirmative showing of prejudice by the defendant . . . the mistaken use of [a form] does not warrant the dismissal of an administrative appeal.\u201d The package of papers filed simultaneously by the plaintiffs in this case, as in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc., </em>informed the department of the appeal that was being taken and of the return date on the verified complaint, and directed a competent authority to summon the department to appear at a designated court. Since the department has raised no claim of prejudice, the plaintiffs\u2019 inadvertent deviation from the preferred Practice Book form did not deprive the citation that they employed of all legal effect. The trial court, therefore, improperly granted the department\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> The department found that two violations of the state liquor laws had occurred at the Viva Zapata Restaurant. On May 30,1987, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 30-22, a group of at least ten people were consuming alcoholic beverages on the front porch of the restaurant, a location not approved for such consumption. On February 20,1988, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 30-86, three young men below the legal age were being served alcoholic beverages at the restaurant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> Their appeal alleged that the suspension of the liquor permit was illegal, arbitrary and in abuse of discretion, for a number of substantive and procedural reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> At the time this action was instituted, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) provided in relevant part: \u201cProceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the aggrieved person resides . . . within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d This statute was amended by Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 107, effective July 1, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"> At the time this action was instituted, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c) provided: \u201cThe filing of the petition does not of itself stay enforcement of the agency decision.
