We conclude that article first, \u00a7 10 of the state constitution did not authorize the trial court to make such an award and, therefore, reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">This case began on August 20,1981, when the named plaintiff and her physician brought a class action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging the legality of a regulation issued by the defendant commissioner of income maintenance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulation restricted the funding of abortions under the Connecticut Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-134a through 17-1347; to only those abortions \u201cnecessary because the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a trial on the merits, the trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>on April 9, 1986, held that the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>exceeded the statutory authority of the commissioner of income maintenance and violated the plaintiffs\u2019 right to due process under \u00a7 10 of article first of the state constitution and to equal protection of the laws under \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20 of that article. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 394, 395, 515 A.2d 134 (1986). Accordingly, the trial court enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the regulation and ordered the defendants to pay for all medically necessary abortions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the same extent that the defendants pay for all other medical costs under the Medicaid program. The defendants did not appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment of April 9, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">After a further evidentiary proceeding pursuant to a bifurcation order,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court, on June 26,1986, awarded $164,942.83 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the named plaintiff\u2019s class of indigent women.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants appealed that decision to this court. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 33-34, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987), we concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the administrative remedy available to them of first presenting their claim to the claims commissioner in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165b. We determined that because a \u201cprivate party in the same position as the state in this case would not have been liable for attomeys\u2019*fees\u201d; id., 36; any authorization to sue the state would be fruitless because the state\u2019s liability in such a suit is \u201ccoextensive\u201d with that of a private person. General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a). Nevertheless, we noted that if the claim had been filed with the commissioner, \u201cthe commissioner would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>been empowered to consider whether the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for attorneys\u2019 fees constituted a \u2018just claim,\u2019 one that \u2018in equity and justice the state should pay . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 4-141.\u201d Id., 36-37. Because the plaintiffs had failed to pursue this administrative remedy, we held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the issues presented. Accordingly, we concluded that the trial court should have dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We, therefore, set aside the supplemental judgment awarding the plaintiffs counsel fees and costs and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The date that our decision in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz </em>was released, June 9, 1987, the plaintiffs filed a notice of claim with the claims commissioner requesting the state to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u201cincurred to implement their right to judicial redress of injuries for violations by the state of the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d In the alternative, they sought permission from the claims commissioner to sue the state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the plaintiffs had not timely filed their claim in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-148. On December 21,1987, the claims commissioner rejected the defendants\u2019 argument, and granted the plaintiffs permission to sue the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The plaintiffs, thereafter, brought this action on March 17, 1988, seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $164,942.83, \u201cincurred [while] remedy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ing the state\u2019s violations of their constitutional rights.\u201d After a trial on the merits, on June 28,1989, the trial court, <em>Hodgson, </em>J., awarded the plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $134,505.29.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred this appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In appealing from the judgment rendered June 28, 1989, the defendants maintain that the trial court erred by concluding that: (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was timely filed with the claims commissioner; (2) the claims commissioner had the authority to grant the plaintiffs permission to sue the state; and (3) article first, \u00a7 10 of the Connecticut constitution requires the state to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On appeal, the defendants argue, as a threshold issue, that the trial court erred when it held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not time-barred by General Statutes \u00a7 4-148. The following facts are relevant to this argument. On April 9,1986, the trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>rendered a declaratory judgment that the regulation at issue was invalid because it contravened General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-134a through 17-134Z and because it violated the rights of the plaintiffs under certain provisions of the Connecticut constitution. The court enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the regulation and ordered the defendants to pay the costs of all medically necessary abortions on the same basis as other claims under the Medicaid program. After the decision, the court conducted further hearings on the plaintiffs\u2019 bifurcated claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys prepared a court ordered judgment file and monitored the defendants\u2019 compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>anee with the court\u2019s order to provide notice to each member of the class that medically necessary abortions would be paid for by Medicaid. The plaintiffs required the services of their attorneys through August 5, 1986.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The defendants contend that the plaintiffs failed to file their claim with the claims commissioner on a timely basis in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-148 (a), which states in pertinent part: \u201cNo claim shall be presented under this chapter but within one year after it accrues.\u201d Because the legislature has chosen not to define the term \u201caccrues,\u201d the defendants urge us to construe it to mean the date on which judgment was entered. They argue that because the plaintiffs failed to file their claim with the claims commissioner until June 9,1987, more than one year after April 9,1986, the date that judgment was entered, the claim was not timely filed. Consequently, they contend, the claims commissioner lacked jurisdiction to consider it. We need not decide that issue at this time, however, because we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs timely filed their claim in accordance with \u00a7 4-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">When the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is based upon continuous legal representation, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the legal services are complete. See <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 253, 571 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>A.2d 116 (1990); <em>Gaylord Hospital </em>v. <em>Massaro, </em>5 Conn. App. 465, 467, 499 A.2d 1162 (1985); <em>Cannell </em>v. <em>Buli-cek, </em>8 Ohio App. 3d 331, 335, 457 N.E.2d 891 (1983); <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Day, </em>17 Wash. App. 407, 413, 563 P.2d 227 (1977), review denied, 89 Wash. 2d 1018 (1978). The statute of limitations is tolled during the pendency of the continuous representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In this case, the plaintiffs are seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u201cwhich were incurred to implement their right to judicial redress of injuries for violations by the state of the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d As part of that continuing legal representation, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys were obligated to perform services for the plaintiffs after the date judgment was entered, April 9, 1986. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys were ordered, by the court, to prepare a judgment file and to assist in the implementation of notice of the availability of Medicaid funds to the members of the class of indigent women in need of medically necessary abortions. Since the plaintiffs were seeking an award for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in obtaining necessary health related benefits, their claim would not fully accrue until those services were completed. See <em>Handler </em>v. <em>Remington Arms Co., </em>144 Conn. 316, 321, 130 A.2d 793 (1957) (\u201c[w]hen the wrong sued upon consists of a continuing course of conduct, the statute does not begin to run until that course of conduct is completed\u201d). In order to effectuate the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel were obligated to carry out the court\u2019s orders. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not ascertainable in toto until August 5, 1986. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiffs had timely filed their notice of claim with the claims commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The defendants next contend that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>neys\u2019 fees. First, they argue that the claims commissioner cannot authorize lawsuits against the state in derogation of General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe rights and liability of the state in each such action shall be coextensive with and shall equal the rights and liability of private persons in like circumstances.\u201d Relying upon our determination in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 36, that \u201ca private party in the same position as the state in this case would not have been liable for attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d the defendants argue that the claims commissioner lacked the authority to grant the plaintiffs permission to sue the state and therefore the waiver of sovereign immunity was a \u201cnullity.\u201d In the alternative, the defendants assert that, even if the claims commissioner could authorize the lawsuit, if a private party in like circumstances could not be held liable for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, the state cannot be held responsible for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Both of these arguments, however, ignore the basis of the trial court\u2019s conclusion. The trial court held that in order to effectuate article first, \u00a7 10 of our state constitution, the court could award the indigent plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The trial court squarely determined that the \u201crequirements of article first, \u00a7 10 create a constitutional necessity\u201d that supersedes \u00a7 4-160 (a) and hence the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we must determine whether article first, \u00a7 10 of the state constitution authorizes the court to order the state to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel fees. See <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 345, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The defendants\u2019 principal claim on appeal is that the trial court erred by ruling that, in order to \u201ceffectuate\u201d article first, \u00a7 10 of our constitution, the plaintiffs are entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. At the proceedings below, the plaintiffs advanced a number of theories to justify such an award. While the trial court rejected most of these arguments, recognizing the weight of legal precedent barring a monetary award against the state, it did conclude that the \u201copen courts\u201d and the \u201cright to redress\u201d provisions of article first, \u00a7 10 of the state constitution authorized an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In arriving at its conclusion, the court formulated the following list of \u201cstandards\u201d: (1) the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d must arise under the state constitution; (2) \u201cthe deprivation of constitutional rights by the state must be the result of an intentional policy\u201d; (3) the constitutional claim must be sufficiently complex to require the services of an attorney; (4) the plaintiff must be unable to afford legal counsel because of his or her poverty; (5) \u201cresort to the courts for relief\u201d must be necessary to end the constitutional deprivation; and (6) the private interest affected must be \u201csubstantial.\u201d Because the plaintiffs satisfied all of these \u201cstandards,\u201d the trial court concluded that an award of counsel fees was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In the absence of any legal precedent authorizing such a monetary award against the state, the trial court relied, in part, upon our decision in <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 493 A.2d 213 (1985), to derive its standards. In <em>Lavertm, </em>we concluded that an indigent defendant in a state-supported paternity action had a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel at state expense under the due process clause of the fourteenth</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>amendment to the United States constitution and under article first, \u00a7 10, of our constitution. Id., 412. The defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Lavertue </em>relied upon: (1) the state action requirement of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution; and (2) the unique configuration of paternity actions in this state. Id., 405. We determined that the state involvement in paternity actions was significant enough to trigger the constitutional right to court-appointed counsel under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640, reh. denied, 453 U.S. 927, 102 S. Ct. 889, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1023 (1981), provided the basis for our analysis in <em>Lavertue. </em>\u201cThe pre-eminent generalization that emerges from [the United States Supreme Court\u2019s] precedents on an indigent\u2019s right to appointed counsel is that such a right has been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.\u201d <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>supra, 25. It is the defendant\u2019s interest in personal freedom that triggers the right to appointed counsel. Id.; see <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967) (juvenile has right to appointed counsel in a delinquency proceeding, even though it may be considered a \u201ccivil\u201d proceeding, when it may result in committing the juvenile to an institution). \u201cSignificantly, as a litigant\u2019s interest in personal liberty diminishes, so does his right to appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>supra, 26. Thus, in <em>Lavertue </em>we balanced a \u201cmix of factors\u201d against each other, and then weighed the result against the presumption that there is no right to court-appointed counsel unless a loss of physical liberty is at stake. <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>supra, 412; <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>supra, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Although in <em>Lavertue </em>we recognized that \u201cthe threat of imprisonment is only indirectly implicated in the paternity suit itself\u201d; <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>supra; our ultimate conclusion was that, based upon \u201cthe unique configuration of paternity actions in this state,\u201d the defendant was entitled to court-appointed counsel. Id. When describing the \u201cunique configuration\u201d of paternity actions, we stated, \u201c[t]he significance of the state\u2019s involvement in actions involving the paternity of children receiving public assistance is enhanced by the fact that all paternity proceedings have \u2018 \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d overtones.\u2019 <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>[452 U.S. 1, 10, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981)]. A paternity action results in a finding of \u2018guilt\u2019 or \u2018innocence,\u2019 and nonpayment of support orders attendant to a finding of \u2018guilt\u2019 may lead to contempt and imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-171, 46b-215, 53-304.\u201d <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>supra, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We need not decide in this case, however, whether the risk of impairment of a plaintiff\u2019s health, safety and personal integrity implicates a loss of physical liberty similar to that represented in <em>Lavertue. </em>The plaintiffs in this case, unlike those in <em>Lavertue, </em>do not maintain that they were entitled to court-appointed counsel. Rather, they retained their own counsel and now request the state to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. See <em>In re Smiley, </em>36 N.Y.2d 433, 438-39, 330 N.E.2d 53, 369 N.Y.S.2d 87 (1975) (while trial court had discretion to appoint counsel, it had no power to direct the state to pay the costs of providing counsel absent statutory authority). <em>Lavertue, </em>therefore, does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Any analysis of the question presented, i.e., whether article first, \u00a7 10 requires the state to pay the costs of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, must begin with the clear language of the constitution itself. Article first, \u00a7 10, contained in our Declaration of Rights, provides: \u201cAll courts shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d This language has remained unchanged since the adoption of the state constitution of 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The historical background of article first, \u00a7 10 provides a useful framework to address the question presented. That provision, which originated in the Magna Carta, has been adopted in substantially the same form, in the constitutional provisions of most of the states. See, e.g., Florida, Article I, \u00a7 21; Missouri, Article I, \u00a7 14; Oklahoma, Article 2, \u00a7 6; Pennsylvania, Article I, \u00a7 11; Wisconsin, Article I, \u00a7 9. We may look to the precedents of sister states when construing similar language in our own constitution. E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 585 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Early state court opinions have generally construed the \u201copen courts\u201d provision as prohibiting the state from selling justice by imposing unreasonable charges on the litigants in the courts; <em>Malin </em>v. <em>La Moure County, </em>27 N.D. 140, 152, 145 N.W. 582 (1914); and as ending the practice by a corrupt judiciary of demanding gratuities for giving or withholding decisions in pending cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Christianson </em>v. <em>Pioneer Furniture Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>101 Wis. 343, 347-48, 77 N.W. 174 (1898); 16A Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 613. The provision was \u201cnever intended to guarantee the right to litigate entirely without expense to the litigants, nor to impose upon the public the entire burden of the expense of the maintenance of the courts.\u201d <em>In re Lee, </em>64 Okla. 310, 312, 168 P. 53 (1917); <em>Lommen </em>v. <em>Minneapolis Gaslight Co., </em>65 Minn. 196, 208, 68 N.W. 53 (1896). Thus, the imposition of reasonable court fees has been found to pass constitutional challenges under the open courts provision. <em>Lommen </em>v. <em>Minneapolis Gaslight Co., </em>supra, 208-209; <em>In re Lee, </em>supra, 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The trial court analogized this case to <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 380-81, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1971), in which the the United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause of the federal constitution forbade the imposition of filing fees that denied indigents, who were unable to pay the fees, access to the courts, the sole means in Connecticut for obtaining a divorce. Implicitly relying on <em>Boddie, </em>the trial court reasoned that, in order to ensure that the plaintiffs had access to the courts, it could impose a positive financial burden upon the state for attorneys\u2019 fees. Such a broad interpretation of <em>Boddie, </em>however, is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>In Robertson v. Apuzzo, </em>170 Conn. 367, 371, 365 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 852, 97 S. Ct. 142, 50 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976), the defendant had a right to a jury trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-438, but, because of his indigency, he was unable to pay \u201cthe jury fee required by statute to be paid by any party to a civil action who desires a jury rather than a court trial.\u201d Id., 377. After acknowledging the limitations the due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>process clause<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> places upon a state\u2019s ability to require fees under <em>Boddie, </em>this court stated, \u201c[subsequent decisions by the [United States] Supreme Court concerning the constitutionality of filing fees in civil cases reinforce the conclusion that the principle enunciated in <em>Boddie </em>is not to be extended further.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Apuzzo, </em>supra, 378; see <em>Ortwein </em>v. <em>Schwab, </em>410 U.S. 656, 93 S. Ct. 1172, 35 L. Ed. 2d 572, reh. denied, 411 U.S. 922, 93 S. Ct. 1551, 36 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1973) (requirement of a filing fee, when applied to indigents seeking to appeal an adverse welfare decision, does not violate due process); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kras, </em>409 U.S. 434, 93 S. Ct. 631, 34 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1973) (statute requiring the payment of a filing fee as a condition to a discharge in bankruptcy did not violate access to court under due process clause). Accordingly, we concluded that an indigent defendant in a paternity action was not entitled to a waiver of the statutory fee for a jury trial. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Apuzzo, </em>supra, 383. The United States Supreme Court \u201cobviously stopped short of an unlimited rule that an indigent at all times and in all cases has the right to relief without the payment of fees.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kras, </em>supra, 450. Thus, we have never recognized a rule that indigency alone requires the state to waive the fees and costs, and bear the entire financial burden of litigation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">On the basis of the record before us and the plain meaning of the open courts provision, it is clear that, in this instance, our courts were \u201copen,\u201d and that the plaintiffs had \u201caccess\u201d to them. Unlike the defendant in <em>Boddie, </em>the plaintiffs successfully brought their action to court. The Connecticut Civil Liberties Foundation, Inc., acted as the legal counsel for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tiffs throughout all phases of the protracted litigation. After a trial on the merits, the trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>declared the challenged regulation invalid and enjoined the commissioner from enforcing it. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 394, 450, 515 A.2d 134 (1986). The attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the plaintiffs, unlike the filing fees in <em>Boddie, </em>were not imposed upon the litigants by the state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Having concluded that the state did not impede the plaintiffs in their pursuit of constitutionally adequate \u201caccess\u201d to the courts, the question that remains to be resolved is whether the state is obligated, pursuant to article first, \u00a7 10, to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees of indigent persons to ensure they have \u201caccess to a remedy for a violation of the state constitution.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the state must pay their attorneys\u2019 fees because the state intentionally passed a regulation that infringed upon their constitutional entitlement to medically necessary abortions at state expense and therefore forced them to go to court to vindicate their rights. Without an award of counsel fees, the plaintiffs argue, indigents would be unable to pursue their right to judicial redress for injuries as provided by our state constitution. The plaintiffs cite no case which has so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">When addressing whether a statute unconstitutionally restricts a plaintiff\u2019s right to a remedy pursuant to article first, \u00a7 10, we have long adhered to the principle that \u201c[although this constitutional provision safeguards a person\u2019s \u2018right to redress\u2019 in the courts, it does not protect this right unless \u2018one suffers a recognized injury.\u2019 <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 284, 363 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976). Thus, a necessary prerequisite to the constitutional \u2018open court\u2019 requirement is that a person must suffer a cognizable \u2018injury.\u2019 Such an injury has been defined as \u2018 \u201ca legal injury, that is, one violative of established law of which a court can properly take cognizance.\u201d \u2019 Id., 285, quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. Keefe, 134 Conn. 156, 163, 56 A.2d 768 (1947).\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 684-85, 513 A.2d 66 (1986). \u201c[A]n injury is not compensable absent recognition of that injury either by our courts or by specific statutory provision.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>supra, 285. \u201cThus the right of redress for injury is constitutional in its nature but the nature of a specific injury is a right derived from the common law or statute.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The plaintiffs contend that they have suffered a \u201ccognizable injury,\u201d the \u201c \u2018necessary prerequisite\u2019 for the right to redress,\u201d on the basis of the trial court\u2019s holding in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher </em>that the challenged regulation was invalid. The trial court did not hold nor do the plaintiffs contend, however, that all litigants who prevail in constitutional claims against the state, regardless of their economic status, are entitled to an award of counsel fees pursuant to article first, \u00a7 10. Rather, it is the plaintiffs\u2019 indigency which becomes the keystone of their argument. Their analysis thus confuses the claim on which they have already prevailed with their claim for counsel fees. Their current claim is that, as prevailing <em>indigents, </em>they are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees, not that the constitutional violation from which they suffered a cognizable injury has not been redressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">After a trial on the merits, the trial court declared the regulation invalid. Consequently, it enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the regulation and ordered the commissioner to pay for medically necessary abortions to the same extent as the defendants pay for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>other costs under the Medicaid program. On the basis of this record, it is clear that the plaintiffs received a \u201cremedy by due course of law\u201d for the <em>constitutional violation. </em>Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argue that the fact that they \u201cobtained relief is not dispositive.\u201d They urge this court to uphold the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiffs as an \u201cancillary remedy\u201d to encourage couns\u00e9l to represent indigents in future litigation. Without the possibility of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the plaintiffs contend that they are concerned that other indigents, unable to afford counsel, would lack access to a judicial remedy to enforce their constitutional rights. Thus, they advocate a general rule awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs who have satisfied the trial court\u2019s \u201cstandards\u201d so that the right to access to our courts does not depend upon the \u201ccharitable impulse of the private bar or public interest groups\u201d who provide legal services without cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Although the plaintiffs do not explain why the indigents could not receive a remedy, their argument implicitly assumes that the indigents\u2019 inability to afford counsel would also prevent them from obtaining either the assistance of lawyers who provide pro bono services<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or, if warranted, court-appointed counsel. To the extent that the plaintiffs make their argument on behalf of others not in a direct adversarial posture before the court, that claim is not properly before us on appeal. \u201cA litigant may only assert [her] own constitutional rights and immunities. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 429, 81 S.

Similarly, other states have recognized the legislature\u2019s authority to place statutory limits on the amount that a plaintiff can recover; <em>Estate of Cargill </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>supra; and to impose governmental immunity; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wichita State University, </em>219 Kan. 2, 10, 547 P.2d 1015, appeal dismissed, 429 U.S. 806, 97 S.

In addition, other states have recognized that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not violate similar constitutional provisions.

While it is unfortunate that the plaintiffs cannot afford to pay their attorneys, it is a problem caused by their indigency and not by anything that the state has done to prevent their access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The constitutional right to a remedy for all cognizable injuries does not delegate to the courts the legislative authority to create new rights under the law. <em>Cason </em>v. <em>Baskin, </em>155 Fla. 198, 213-14, 20 So. 2d 243 (1944). The text of article first, \u00a7 10 is explicit: \u201c[EJvery person, for an injury done to him in his person . . . shall have a remedy <em>by due course of law. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 right to a remedy must be recognized by an established legal principle, either in the common law or by statute, to be enforceable.

These courts uniformly recognize that the \u201credress provision\u201d was intended to ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to present a cognizable claim before an unbiased judiciary and, if the claim is meritorious, obtain judicial relief in an equitable and fair manner. A right must be recognized in law, however, before a court has the proper authority to provide a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We are bound by the command of the text of the constitution. We do not have the authority to require the expenditure of public funds to the prevailing parties in cases where we, based upon our own predilections, might favor an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. \u201cThis court has never viewed constitutional language as newly descended from the firmament like fresh fallen snow upon which jurists may trace out their individual notions of public policy uninhibited by the history which attended the adoption of the particular phraseology at issue and the intentions of its authors. The faith which democratic societies repose in the written document as a shield against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power would be illusory if those vested with the responsibility for construing and applying disputed provisions were free to stray from the purposes of the originators.\u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 62, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We conclude that article first, \u00a7 10 does not independently create a \u201cright\u201d to attorneys\u2019 fees. If the plaintiffs could have shown that they were entitled to counsel fees under either the common law or a statutory provision, then article first, \u00a7 10 guaranteed them \u201ca constitutionally adequate system of justice capable of securing\u201d their right to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 675-76,480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984). They did not make such a showing, however, and therefore, if the plaintiffs are to prevail, we must determine whether there is an alternative basis upon which to affirm the trial court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is well entrenched in our jurisprudence that Connecticut adheres to the American rule. <em>Marsh, Day &amp; Calhoun v. Solomon, </em>204 Conn. 639, 653, 529 A.2d 702 (1987). Under the American rule, a party cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees in the absence of statutory authority or a contractual provision. Id.; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 22-23; <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 14-15, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); <em>Gino\u2019s Pizza of East Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>193 Conn. 135, 140, 475 A.2d 305 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The plaintiffs do not claim that there is any statute or contract provision which would entitle them to attorneys\u2019 fees in this case. Instead, the plaintiffs renew their arguments, first raised in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 21-29, that this court should exercise its equitable powers to affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiffs. Specifically, they urge this court to adopt either the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d doctrine or the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d doctrine as a court-authored exception to the American rule. Although we have previously rejected both of these doctrines as excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tions to the American rule; id., 25-26; the plaintiffs urge us to reconsider them in light of the concurring opinion in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz. </em>Id., 38 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The private attorney general doctrine \u201c \u2018seeks to encourage suits effectuating a strong [public] policy by awarding substantial attorney\u2019s fees, regardless of defendants\u2019 conduct, to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.\u2019 <em>[D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>11 Cal. 3d 1, 27, 112 Cal. Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10 (1974)].\u201d <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>20 Cal. 3d 25, 43, 141 Cal. Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 271, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975), the United States Supreme Court declined to adopt the private attorney general doctrine as an exception to the American rule. While recognizing that commentators have criticized the American rule in recent years, the court found it clear that Congress had not chosen to pass a statute abrogating the rule. Id., 260. Instead, the court found that Congress had fabricated a statutory structure in which it had specifically delineated when a prevailing party is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. Having done so, \u201cit is not for [the court] to invade the legislature\u2019s province by redistributing litigation costs in the manner suggested\u201d by the plaintiffs. Id., 271. The court concluded that any exception to the American rule should properly be made by Congress and not the court. Id., 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Likewise our legislature has not chosen to repudiate the American rule, but rather has made specific provisions for attorneys\u2019 fees in selected cases. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 52-251b allows the prevailing party in any civil action seeking damages for injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>arising out of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 (discriminatory practices) to also recover costs, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-251a (allowing attorneys\u2019 fees in a small claims matter transferred to regular docket); \u00a7 52-249 (allowing attorneys\u2019 fees in an action for foreclosure). \u201cIndeed, the legislature has specifically authorized the recovery of reasonable fees and expenses not exceeding $7500 against the state in a successful appeal of an administrative agency decision in a contested case for all but the most affluent of aggrieved persons. General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a. In view of this legislative policy of selecting the special situations where attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded, we [conclude] . . . that it is inappropriate for the judiciary to establish under the private attorney general doctrine a broad rule permitting such fees whenever a private litigant has at substantial cost to himself succeeded in enforcing a significant social policy that may benefit others.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Under the substantial benefit doctrine, \u201cwhen a class action or corporate derivative action results in the conferral of substantial benefits, whether of a pecuniary or nonpecuniary nature, upon the defendant in such an action, that defendant may, in the exercise of the court\u2019s equitable discretion, be required to yield some of those benefits in the form of an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>supra, 34. Under this theory, \u201cthose receiving the benefit should contribute to the costs of its production.\u201d Id., 38. The rationale for such fee shifting is that \u201c[t]o allow the others to obtain full benefit from the plaintiff\u2019s efforts without contributing equally to the litigation expenses would be to enrich the others unjustly at the plaintiff\u2019s expense.\u201d <em>Mills </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>v. <em>Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 392, 90 S. Ct. 616, 24 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1970); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 6, 93 S. Ct. 1943, 36 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The plaintiffs argue that they have conferred a \u201csubstantial benefit on all poor women in Connecticut, [i.e.] the right to state aid for medically necessary abortions.\u201d Leaving aside the question of whether the plaintiffs bestowed a benefit upon all poor women or only those poor women who seek a state financed abortion, we conclude that the plaintiffs have not conferred a substantial benefit upon all those on whom they seek to impose the financial burden of their counsel fees. To request the state, and hence the public, to pay for the plaintiffs\u2019 litigation expense imposes a financial burden on the state treasury, \u201ca fund in which all citizens of this state, not just the plaintiff class of indigent women who may seek abortions, have a common interest.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">To avoid this conclusion, however, the plaintiffs argue that they have conferred a benefit upon all citizens of this state by challenging unconstitutional actions by the state. To adopt such an abstract definition, however, would expand the substantial benefit doctrine beyond its underpinnings. We conclude that this is an inappropriate case for the application of the substantial benefit doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The plaintiffs next urge this court simply to exercise its equitable powers to award them attorneys\u2019 fees. Citing the equitable maxims that \u201cevery wrong has its remedy\u201d; <em>Chappell v. Jardine, </em>51 Conn. 64, 69 (1884); and \u201c 'in an equitable action the court endeavors to do complete justice. . . .\u2019; <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>152 Conn. 460, 465, 208 A.2d 540 (1965) [overruled on other grounds, <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>182 Conn. 545, 551, 438 A.2d 755 (1980)]\u201d; <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>393, 404, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1747, 84 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1985); the plaintiffs, in effect, advocate that we judicially undermine the well established American rule. The trial court rejected this argument, concluding that the rule requiring each party to bear his or her own litigation expenses has never been recognized as inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">To support their argument, the plaintiffs assert that General Statutes \u00a7 52-251b, enacted three years after commencement of this action, evinces a broad legislative policy to allow fee-shifting under the facts of this case. To the contrary, we conclude that \u00a7 52-251b manifests an intent by the legislature to delineate specific exceptions to the American rule. Section \u00a7 52-251b (a) allows the prevailing party in \u201cany civil action to recover damages for injury to the person or to real or personal property arising out of a violation of section 46a-58\u201d to recover his costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 (a) makes it a discriminatory practice for any person to subject another to \u201cthe deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">By its terms, \u00a7 52-251b applies only to civil actions to recover damages. Therefore, even if it applied retroactively, it would not apply to the current case because \u201cno damages were awarded by the court or even sought in the complaint [in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher] </em>as finally amended.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 28; General Statutes \u00a7 52-251b (a). Second, the statute explicitly rejects the expansive view advanced by the plaintiffs. Section 52-251b (b) distinctly provides that subsection (a), cited above, does not create a new cause of action against the state. \u201cStatutory analogies may furnish guidance in filling a void in the law, but cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>be utilized to extend a statute tailored for a precisely defined situation to others not included within its terms.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 27. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees as a matter of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that by requiring proof that the six factors set forth in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision are satisfied, see part III, supra, this court could and should use its equitable powers to formulate a narrowly circumscribed rule to authorize fee awards. We are unpersuaded. The legislature is in a far better position than the courts to balance the myriad of factors necessary to formulate policy on matters that so intimately concern the state budget. We must respect the \u201clegislative prerogative of choosing the special circumstances under which such awards may be made.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We recognize that our decision may lead to harsh results where plaintiffs might be unable to vindicate their rights because they lack the necessary funds to hire an attorney and have no contractual or statutory right to attorneys\u2019 fees. Recognizing this problem, attorneys and organizations throughout the state provide pro bono services to needy clients. To the extent this solution is inadequate, it is the prerogative of the legislature, not the courts, to determine the circumstances under which an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party will be authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-14\"> At the inception of this litigation, the named plaintiff obtained an order of the trial court that permitted her to prosecute the action under a fictitious name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> After a hearing, on October 9,1981, the trial court certified two classes of plaintiffs: \u201c(1) indigent pregnant women eligible for Medicaid who seek a medically necessary abortion, represented by the named plaintiff; and (2) physicians certified by the state to provide medical care under Medicaid who agree to perform medically necessary abortions or advise women concerning them, represented by the named plaintiff\u2019s physician.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 20, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> The treasurer of the state of Connecticut was also a party defendant. Because the plaintiffs sought to sue both state officers in their official capacities, the suit, in effect, was against the state of Connecticut. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn.

In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>the United States Supreme Court had upheld the validity of an earlier version of the Hyde Amendment that denied public funding for certain medically necessary abortions. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 100 S.

The court rejected claims that the Hyde Amendment: (1) violated the due process right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy; (2) interfered with her freedom of religion; and (3) denied indigent women equal protection of the laws. Id., 326-27. The court also concluded that a state participating in the Medicaid program is not obligated by that program to pay for medically necessary abortions for which Congress has withheld federal funding.

Plaintiffs\u2019 counsels\u2019 work in securing the defendants\u2019 initial compliance with this portion of the remedy was part and parcel of its representation of the plaintiffs in the litigation and was part of the initial securing of a remedy.\u201d The order dated May 15, 1986, was subsequently amended by the trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>directing the defendants to send notice on or before August 1, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> The plaintiffs argue that when the claims commissioner granted them permission to sue the state, he implicitly denied their request for payment.

Its history dates back to the days of Magna Carta. It was designed to prevent a species of official exactions made as the price of delaying or expediting justice. From the lowest officer to the king himself, in the olden times, bribes were freely demanded and taken to procure the benefits of the laws. They bore no relation whatever to our system of exactions for expenses of litigation, called costs, or the charge as a tax on suits, imposed under laws which bear equally upon all; but they were arbitrary exactions sanctioned by the manners of the times, that went to the personal benefit of the judicial head or body controlling the execution of the law, or to servants or officers connected therewith. It was such abuse, among others, that the barons of England forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>King John to abolish by granting the Magna Carta. . . . <em>They da not grant the right, but guarantee the preservation of one that existed under the constitution of England.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Christianson </em>v. <em>Pioneer Furniture Co., </em>101 Wis. 343, 347-48, 77 N.W. 174 (1898).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Apuzzo, </em>170 Conn. 367, 371, 365 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 852, 97 S.
