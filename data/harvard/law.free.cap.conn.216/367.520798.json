He appeals the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues: (1) that the trial court should have excused a juror who recognized the victim\u2019s former wife; (2) that the court did not adequately explain the element of \u201cremaining unlawfully\u201d for the offenses of burglary in the first degree and felony murder with burglary as its predicate felony; (3) that the court should have required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201centered or remained unlawfully\u201d on the premises as required to support the charges of burglary in the first degree and the alternative form of felony murder based on burglary as the underlying felony; (4) that the court improperly instructed the jury on the requirements of felony murder by (a) including accessory liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in its instructions on felony murder, and (b) refusing to instruct in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the defendant\u2019s requests to charge numbered eight and nine regarding the limits of liability and the \u201cin furtherance\u201d requirement of the charge of felony murder; and (5) that the court should not have instructed the jury on an unsupported theory of liability for the charges of robbery in the first degree and felony murder with robbery as its predicate felony. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The following evidence was presented at trial. In July, 1987, the victim, Theodore G, lived at a condominium complex in Branford. He owned a 1985 navy blue Chevrolet Celebrity. He was divorced from his wife, and lived alone. The victim engaged in homosexual activity, and he and David Mooney, who had a history of \u201chustling\u201d homosexual men, were at some point involved in a relationship. On occasion, Mooney and the victim had been observed together outside Partners, a gay club in New Haven, as well as at the victim\u2019s place of employment and his condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The victim was last seen alive between 6:30 and 7 p.m. on Wednesday, July 29,1987, by a security guard who was working at a beach near the victim\u2019s condominium. Family members of the victim entered his condominium at approximately 9:30 a.m. on Friday, July 31,1987. The family members found the front door unlocked and no signs of forced entry, and nothing appeared out of the ordinary on the first floor. They then discovered the victim\u2019s naked body on the floor in the master bedroom upstairs. In reporting their observations to the police, the family also stated that the victim\u2019s automobile was missing, and that a large amount of coins, which the victim had accumulated, was also missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>On August 5, 1987, the Branford and New Haven police observed the defendant driving a blue car matching the description of the victim\u2019s car, but bearing a different registration plate. Upon questioning, the defendant stated that the car belonged to his brother who had rented it. The police, however, determined that the vehicle belonged to the victim, and the defendant was then arrested. At trial, the state introduced four taped statements given by the defendant to the police during the course of the evening and early morning of his arrest. These statements were given at 9:37 p.m., 12:20 a.m., 3:40 a.m. and 4:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The defendant first stated that Mooney, his accomplice, had owed him $3200 for some drugs. Specifically, the defendant explained that on the afternoon of July 30,1987, Mooney had offered him a bank bag full of rolled quarters, and that he and Mooney had changed the quarters into bills at a check cashing facility, where Mooney had given him $240 in cash from the quarters. Later that evening, Mooney told the defendant that he would give him a television to pay off more of the debt. When the defendant met Mooney the next day to receive the television, Mooney did not have it, but he offered the defendant the blue car as collateral. He also told the defendant that he did have a television for him and, with the defendant driving the blue car, they left to get the television. While the defendant drove, Mooney tried to open a metal box that he thought might contain money. When he saw that it contained only papers, Mooney threw the box in a dumpster at Ken-sington Square, and ran away, leaving the defendant with the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In his second statement, the defendant added that Mooney told him that he had made a \u201cscore,\u201d that he had somebody he called \u201cTheo\u201d tied up, and that that was how he had gotten the coins. The defendant stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that Mooney told him that the television that he had planned to give the defendant was from Theo\u2019s house. The defendant also stated that he had helped Mooney sell a VCR to a person named Eric Daniels.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In his third statement, the defendant admitted that he actually drove Mooney to the victim\u2019s condominium in the victim\u2019s car on the evening of July 30,1987. The defendant claimed that Mooney had explained to him that he used to date the owner of the condominium. When they arrived at the condominium, the victim was upstairs in the master bedroom, naked, tied up and gagged. The defendant stated that he and Mooney took a VCR, some coins and a box from upstairs. As Mooney went through closets and drawers in both bedrooms, the defendant stated that the victim was \u201clooking to me like help me.\u201d The defendant said that he had not touched the victim, but that Mooney had \u201csmacked him.\u201d Mooney also told the victim to shut up or he would kill him. The defendant stated, however, that the victim had been alive when he left the condominium, and that Mooney never told him that he had killed the victim, although he did say that he was coming back to the condominium to party.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In his fourth statement, the defendant stated that he had taken the VCR when he and Mooney entered the condominium. They then went upstairs where the victim was tied up and making a lot of noise. The defendant stated that Mooney said that he had to shut the victim up. Mooney then began choking him with a cord and the defendant watched for two to five seconds. The defendant stated that he did not know if Mooney untied the victim after he finished choking him because he left the condominium and went outside to sit in the car. After a while, he went back to the door of the condominium and told Mooney to come on. When Mooney came down, he had fresh bleeding scratches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>on his back. Mooney took off his shirt, threw it into a bedroom and put on a blue shirt. The defendant stated that Mooney said that the victim would not stop scratching him, and that the victim had passed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The next morning the defendant also told the police that, if they looked in the woods behind the International House of Pancakes parking lot in Hamden, they would find the registration plate of the victim\u2019s car and a pair of bloody pants. The defendant also assisted the police in recovering the VCR from Daniels. Additionally, the prosecution introduced the testimony of another incarcerated prisoner, who testified that, while he was in a holding cell with the defendant, the defendant told him that he had strangled the victim to death when the victim had entered the condominium and caught him and Mooney stealing items.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">At trial, the defendant testified that he had driven Mooney to the victim\u2019s condominium to get a television to repay part of the money that Mooney had owed him for the drugs. He saw a VCR downstairs and, since the television was old, he decided to take the VCR instead. He then joined Mooney upstairs, and saw the victim on the bed, naked and loosely tied while Mooney was poking him in a playful manner. He testified that he knew that Mooney had a sexual relationship with the victim, and, not wanting to get involved in that type of activity, he left. The defendant then picked up the VCR, left the condominium, and waited for Mooney in the car. Mooney came out in about fifteen minutes, and they both drove away. The defendant also presented testimony from the victim\u2019s former wife. She testified that the victim had been engaged in homosexual activity since the early 1970s.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court should have granted his request to excuse a juror for cause when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the juror acknowledged that she recognized the victim\u2019s former wife, who ultimately became a witness for the defense. Moreover, the defendant argues that the court should not have concluded that, absent disqualification for cause, it lacked the authority to excuse the juror and substitute an alternate. The following additional facts serve as the basis for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On the second day of trial, the clerk informed the court that a juror had indicated to him that on the first day of trial she believed that she recognized someone who was seated in the courtroom \u201cand inquired as to whether or not that person was the former wife of the victim . . . .\u201d The court, with counsel in agreement, conducted a voir dire of the juror that revealed that she and the woman she recognized worked in the same building. The juror stated: \u201cIn the morning, as I go in, sometimes she is going up with me and I say \u2018good morning and how are you.\u2019 That is all. I don\u2019t know her name or who she is.\u201d The juror was, at that time, unaware of any connection between the woman she recognized and the case, but assumed that she might be a member of the victim\u2019s family. The court then asked the following questions to determine whether her recognition of this woman would adversely affect her ability to serve on the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cThe Court: You have made some sort of an assumption that she was someone connected with the family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cJuror: I would imagine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cThe Court: Be that as it may, would that, in any way, affect your ability to leave sympathy out of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cJuror: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cThe Court: It would not affect you at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cJuror: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201cThe Court: In other words, you would still be able to function as a juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cJuror: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. It is not necessary if you know who that person is or is not, and that person may be in this courtroom during the course of the trial, would you be uncomfortable in any way or feel a little concerned about the fact that if you should make a ruling in this matter or make a determination in this matter, that you think might be contrary to the way she would want you to do it, that might cause you some concern when you go back to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cJuror: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Have you discussed this situation with the other jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">\u201cJuror: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201cThe Court: You have not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201cJuror: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">\u201cThe Court: Fine. Counsel want to ask any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Defense counsel, however, expressing concern about possible contact between the juror and the victim\u2019s former wife after the completion of the case, then requested that the court excuse the juror. He also asserted that if he had known at voir dire the information disclosed by the inquiry, he would have peremptorily excused the juror.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated that it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not disagree with defense counsel\u2019s representation that he would have excused the juror had the information elicited by the court\u2019s inquiry been known at voir dire. Nonetheless, the court determined that, if the information elicited during the inquiry had been disclosed to the court at voir dire, the court would not have excused the juror for cause. The court stated further that once the jury is selected the only reason the court would excuse a juror would be for cause and, since the court could not find cause to excuse this juror, the court therefore denied defense counsel\u2019s request. The defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied his request. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The state argues, and the defendant concedes, that the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that, absent disqualification for cause, it lacked the authority to excuse the juror is unpreserved. The claim, therefore, would not ordinarily be reviewable. It requires no elaboration, however, to recognize that it is settled law under the federal and state constitutions that the right to an \u201cimpartial jury\u201d is a fundamental constitutional right and is one of the exceptions recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, because of the particular factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>basis of this claim, and its potential impact on the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury, we will review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 64, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985); see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 542, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). \u2018 \u201cImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the [constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d \u2019 <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>supra, 724-25, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>299 U.S. 123, 145-46, 57 S. Ct. 177, 81 L. Ed. 78 (1936). The trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the competency of jurors to serve, and that judgment will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 509 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlin, </em>698 F.2d 1133, 1135 (11th Cir.), reh. denied, 705 F.2d 471, cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958, 103 S. Ct. 2431, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1317 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>663 F.2d 896, 900 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Werner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>455 U.S. 1027, 102 S. Ct. 1731, 72 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra. In exercising this discretion the trial court must zealously protect the rights of the accused. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 429-30, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 88-89, 523 A.2d 495 (1987). This court has stated, however, that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]o succeed on a claim of bias the defendant must raise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 313, 455 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>1326 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>167 Conn. 526, 532, 356 A.2d 162 (1975).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 65; see also <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>339 U.S. 162, 168, 70 S. Ct. 519, 94 L. Ed. 734, reh. denied, 339 U.S. 950, 70 S. Ct. 799, 94 L. Ed. 1364 (1950).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>supra, 89. \u201cIn challenging the competency of [a] juror to remain on the panel it [is] the defendant\u2019s burden to prove actual bias on behalf of the juror. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>supra, 532.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>supra, 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court should not have concluded that it could only have excused the juror for cause. Specifically, the defendant argues that General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c) mandates that the trial court could have excused the juror absent cause. We disagree. Section 54-82h (c) states, in pertinent part, \u201c[i]f, at any time, any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to perform his duty, the court may excuse him. . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 54-82h (c) expressly premises the trial court\u2019s power to excuse a juror on its finding that the juror had \u201cbecome unable to perform his duty.\u201d This is a finding of cause. Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that it could have excused the juror only upon a finding of cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">As for the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse the juror, defense counsel\u2019s expressed concern was about the juror\u2019s contact with the victim\u2019s former wife after the completion of the case. The following facts, however, indicate that the defendant has not met his burden of proving bias on behalf of the juror and abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court regarding its conclusion that the juror was still able to perform her duty: (1) the juror did not know the former wife; (2) the juror\u2019s only contact with the former wife was an occasional encounter as they entered the same building in the morning; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(3) the juror maintained to the trial court that she could remain impartial and still function as a juror. In addition, the fact that the former wife became a defense witness who testified as to the victim\u2019s homosexual activity does not alter this conclusion. The defense called the former wife to the stand; thus, if anything, an argument can be made that the former wife was called in support of the defendant. Accordingly, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court did not adequately explain in its charge the element of \u201cremaining unlawfully\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the offenses of burglary in the first degree and felony murder with burglary as its predicate felony. The defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence regarding the element of \u201centering or remaining unlawfully.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b). We first consider the defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">For the state to prove burglary it must establish that the defendant \u201centered or remained unlawfully\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>victim\u2019s home. \u201c \u2018A person \u201centers or remains unlawfully\u201d in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public and when the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u2019 (Emphasis [omitted].) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b). ... \u2018A <em>license </em>in real property is defined as a personal, revocable, and unassignable <em>privilege, </em>conferred either by writing or parol, to do one or more acts on land without possessing any interest therein.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) 25 Am. Jur. 2d, Easements and Licenses \u00a7 123. Generally, a license to enter premises is revocable at any time by the licensor. Id., \u00a7 128. It is exercisable only <em>within the scope of the consent given. </em>[Emphasis added.] <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Grossman Shoes, Inc., </em>[186 Conn. 229, 237, 440 A.2d 302 (1982)]. . . . The phrase, \u2018licensed or privileged,\u2019 as used in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b) is meant as a unitary phrase, rather than as a reference to two separate concepts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>6 Conn. App. 24, 29-30, 502 A.2d 945 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendant argues that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he entered or remained in the victim\u2019s condominium without license or privilege to do so. \u201c \u2018Appellate analysis of a claim of insufficiency of the evidence requires us to undertake a twofold task: We must first review the evidence construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 468, 534 A.2d 230 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 206, 479 A.2d 237 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 421, 441 A.2d 846 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>182 Conn. 603, 606, 438 A.2d 1149 (1981). \u201c \u2018 \u201cWe then determine whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .... In this process of review, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 458, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 665-66, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987), and cases cited therein.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 309, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 44, 561 A.2d 897 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The state presented to the jury several statements of the defendant, his confession to a cellmate, and various exhibits. Additionally, the jury had for consideration the defendant\u2019s own testimony and the testimony of others that the defense presented. Particularly significant and relevant to whether the defendant entered or remained in the victim\u2019s condominium unlawfully was the defendant\u2019s second taped statement to the police where, inter alia, he stated that Mooney told him that he had made a \u201cscore,\u201d and that he had somebody he called \u201cTheo\u201d tied up so that he could not contact anyone. In his third statement, the defendant stated his purpose for going with Mooney to the victim\u2019s home: \u201cWe took the VCR. I say we, I mean Mooney took the VCR. I was there to get what he owed me. If he was going to steal it from this guy, I didn\u2019t care, I just wanted what was mine.\u201d When the parties arrived at the victim\u2019s home, the defendant stated that Mooney opened the door with a key, but after they entered the house and went upstairs the defendant saw the victim naked on the floor, gagged and tied up with a cord. The defendant stated that \u201c[the victim] was looking to me like help me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is the defendant\u2019s contention, however, that Mooney entered the premises with the permission of the victim or with a key provided by the victim. The defendant argues further that, since he entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>premises with Mooney\u2019s permission, and neither the victim nor Mooney ever ordered him off of the premises, he was not unlawfully on the premises and, therefore, cannot be guilty of burglary. First, this argument assumes that Mooney had the house key with the victim\u2019s permission. The jury, however, was not compelled to accept that contention. Moreover, this argument is weakened by the defendant\u2019s own statements. In particular, the defendant stated that, when he saw the victim tied up, gagged, and naked on the floor, the victim looked at him as if he were asking for help. The defendant also stated that the victim was making a lot of noise so Mooney had to \u201cshut him up.\u201d Moreover, the defendant stated that he watched Mooney choke the victim with an extension cord for about two to five seconds. Therefore, even if the defendant initially entered the victim\u2019s condominium lawfully, it is clear that \u201cconsent to remain was implicitly withdrawn and thus that the [defendant] \u2018unlawfully remained\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>19 Conn. App. 179, 193, 562 A.2d 27 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial court did not properly explain in its charge to the jury the element of \u201cremaining unlawfully\u201d for the offenses of burglary in the first degree and felony murder with burglary as its predicate felony. Specifically, the trial court, in detailing the elements of burglary for the jury, made the following statement concerning the state\u2019s position on \u201cremaining unlawfully\u201d as it applied to the case: \u201c[E]ven if [the defendant] believed that Mooney had the right to invite him in, at the least, once he observed the predicament of [the victim] as the defendant\u2019s own testimony revealed, then his remaining from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>position\u2014from that time on became without license and became unlawful. That is the State\u2019s position as I gather it from the presentation of evidence and you are to deal with that as you see fit.\u201d The defendant argues that these comments by the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the element of \u201cremaining unlawfully.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Because there was no exception taken to the trial court\u2019s instruction on this point, we must first determine if the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. Since \u201c \u2018the failure to instruct the jury adequately on each essential element of the crime charged may have resulted in a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights implicating the fairness of his trial . . . \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 36, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 537, 522 A.2d 277 (1987); we will review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u201cIt is, of course, constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged.\u201d (State v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988); <em>see In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). We do not, however, conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction was improper. In paraphrasing the state\u2019s position, the trial court simply explained to the jury that it could find that, even if the defendant had initially entered the victim\u2019s condominium lawfully, consent to remain could be implicitly withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The defendant maintains that <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>210 Conn. 199, 554 A.2d 1048 (1989), holds to the contrary. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Thomas, </em>however, is misplaced. In <em>Thomas, </em>we held that, when premises are \u201copen to the public,\u201d a defendant does not lose his status as a member of the public by manifesting a criminal intent. Id., 207. Thus, the holding of <em>Thomas </em>does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>not apply to a private dwelling that requires the continued consent of its occupant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 31. Moreover, we stated in <em>Thomas </em>that the purpose of the definition of \u201centers or remains unlawfully\u201d under \u00a7 53a-100 was \u201c \u2018to make clear that only the kind of entry or remaining which is likely to terrorize occupants is prohibited by the crime of burglary. Thus, when the building is, at the time, open to the public, or the actor is otherwise licensed or privileged to be there, the element of terror is missing and the requirement is not met. This does not mean, however, that an initial lawful entry followed by an unlawful remaining would be excused. For example, A enters an office building during business hours\u2014a lawful entry since the building is open to the public\u2014and remains, perhaps hidden, after the building is closed, with intent to steal. A is guilty of burglary.\u2019 (Emphasis [omitted].) Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1969) pp. 52-53.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 207-208. In addition, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>supra, 192-93, the Appellate Court held that \u201c[e]vidence that a defendant subsequently pointed a gun at one who had the right to admit him to the premises, and did admit him to the premises, clearly can form the basis for the inference that consent to remain was implicitly withdrawn and thus that the individual \u2018unlawfully remained\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Therefore, it is clear that the element of terror was present in the instant case. Just as pointing a gun in <em>Reyes </em>implicitly withdrew consent to remain, seeing the victim naked, gagged, and tied up on the floor, and seeing Mooney threaten, strike and choke the victim while the victim, in terror, looked for help, all clearly indicated to the defendant that, even if there were consent for his initially entering the condominium, it had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the requirements of felony murder: (a) by including accessory liability under \u00a7 53a-8 in its instructions on felony murder; and (b) by refusing the defendant\u2019s requests to charge numbered eight and nine regarding the limits of liability and the \u201cin furtherance\u201d requirement of the charge of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court should not have included the statutory principles of accessory liability under \u00a7 53a-8 in connection with its instructions on felony murder because the felony murder statute incorporates the principles of accessory liability applicable to the charge of felony murder. The defendant concedes that he took no exception to the accessory instruction. Nonetheless, he argues that the claim is reviewable because the accessory liability instructions violated his due process rights and implicated his right to a fair trial. Although we reviewed an identical claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 415, 518 A.2d 35 (1986), we concluded in <em>Simms </em>that such a claim did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. In particular, we stated that \u201c[w]e fail[ed] to see how the trial court\u2019s reference to the accessory statute unduly expanded the scope of criminal liability imposed under [the felony murder statute].\u201d Id., 417. Thus, having found in <em>Simms </em>that the trial court\u2019s reference to accessory liability under \u00a7 53a-8 in its instruction on felony murder did not rise to the level of constitutional magnitude, the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim does not satisfy the second prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239, and therefore is not reviewable on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly refused to charge on his requests numbered eight and nine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These requests dealt with a murder for personal motive and a murder committed during the felony but in a separate and distinct act to satisfy one participant\u2019s own end. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. A refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 418, 473 A.2d 300 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Cooper, 182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 178, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986). \u201cThis court has often repeated that \u2018 \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Estep, </em>186 Conn. 648, 651, 443 A.2d 483 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>172 Conn. 223, 226, 374 A.2d 203 (1977); <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Desenti, </em>117 Conn. 612, 617, 169 A. 611 (1933). In reviewing a challenge to a portion of the jury instructions, the proper test is \u2018whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Estep, </em>supra, 652.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 143, 486 A.2d 637 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">When the charge in the present case is viewed as a whole, it is clear that, although the trial court did not use the exact language of the defendant\u2019s requests numbered eight and nine, their substance was indeed included in the charge. Specifically, the trial court instructed: \u201c[T]he State . . . would have to prove that the death of [the victim] was caused by [the defendant] or Mr. Mooney in the course of, and in furtherance of the crimes of either burglary or robbery. The phrase \u2018in furtherance of such crime\u2019 imposes the requirement of a logical nexus, that is a connection between the felony and the homicide. The connection between the underlying felony and homicide must be more than the mere coincidence of time and place. The nexus or connection must be one of logic or plan. This means that the felony murder statute excludes those deaths which are so far outside the plan of the felony and its execution as to be unrelated to that. In other words, a felony murder does not include any killing incidentally committed with the felony but only includes those felonies in the attempted execution of the felony of burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and robbery. Although the homicide itself need not be in the common design, the act which results in death must be in furtherance of the unlawful purpose. In other words, [the victim\u2019s] death must have been caused in furtherance of committing the burglary or robbery and not merely incidental to it.\u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s charge adequately instructed the jury on the requirement of a logical nexus between the felony and the homicide. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on both alternative acts of robbery set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the victim was forced to \u201cdeliver up\u201d any of his belongings as required for the second alternative, \u00a7 53a-133 (2). First, it must be noted that the defendant did not except to the trial court\u2019s instruction on \u00a7 53a-133 (2). \u201cOur holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 362-63, 521 A.2d 150 (1987), however, makes clear that a claim that the jury was presented with alternative forms of committing the offense for which there is no evidence or insufficient evidence is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70, because it implicates a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to be convicted only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 687, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201cThis court has stated that \u2018[w]here a person may have been convicted under more than one statutory alternative, the judgment cannot be supported unless the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt under each statutory provision which the trier may have relied upon.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 650-51, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>197 Conn. 67, 79, 495 A.2d 1054 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 687-88. The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to \u00a7 53a-133 (2) that a person commits robbery if \u201cthe threatened use of physical force was to compel the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property, or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support an instruction on \u00a7 53a-133 (2) in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 687-89, the defendants raised this precise issue. In <em>John, </em>the defendants were convicted of felony murder, with robbery as the predicate felony, as the result of beating the victim to death. Id., 654. The evidence indicated that the victim had been struck by a brick near the front of his house and then dragged by his feet to the rear where his body was discovered. His car keys and his car were later determined to be missing. Id., 658. While instructing on the elements of robbery, the trial court in <em>John </em>read both subsections of \u00a7 53a-133. This court then rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that there was insufficient evidence to warrant an instruction on subsection two. Specifically, this court stated: \u201cFrom this evidence [of a struggle], the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendants used this force to compel the victim to \u2018deliver up\u2019 the keys to his car, and having so failed, they \u2018[overcame his] resistance to the taking of [his] property.\u2019 \u201d Id., 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the present case, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the force that was applied to the vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tim, i.e., tying him up, striking him, and choking him, was applied, at least in part, to force him to divulge the location of valuables.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c.
