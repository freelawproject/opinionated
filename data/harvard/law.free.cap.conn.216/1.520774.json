(Metro Mobile), that authorized Metro Mobile to construct a cellular telecommunications antenna tower (tower) on property leased by Metro Mobile in Greenwich. The plaintiffs, Jeffrey W. Mobley and Susan R. Mobley, owners of property allegedly abutting the tower site, were granted a temporary and permanent injunction by the trial court enjoining Metro Mobile from the construction of the tower.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Most of the relevant facts essential for the disposition of this, matter are stipulated or undisputed. Metro Mobile is one of two entities authorized by the federal communications commission to provide cellular telephone service in Fairfield county. On October 13,1987, Metro Mobile applied to the Council for a certificate. In its application, Metro Mobile requested permission to construct cellular telephone transmission facilities at seven proposed sites in the towns of Fairfield, Greenwich and Wilton. Only one of those sites, the so-called AC/A Greenwich site, is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-50Z (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on October 3 and 5, 1987, Metro Mobile gave notice by certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>fied mail of its intent to file an application for approval of its proposed construction sites. Notice was sent to sixty-eight property owners in the vicinity of the proposed tower sites as reflected by the town land records on September 15,1987. The plaintiffs acquired title to their property on September 21,1987, and their deed was recorded in the Greenwich town hall on the same day. As of September 15,1987, the predecessor in title to the plaintiffs\u2019 property was Hillsbury Builders, Inc., which received a certified mail notice sent by Metro Mobile on October 3,1987. Metro Mobile did not send the plaintiffs notice by certified mail of its intent to file an application with the Council. Metro Mobile published notice of its application in The Stamford Advocate, on October 6 and 8, 1987, and in the Greenwich Time on October 17 and 19,1987. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-50m,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on November 11, 1987, the Council pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>lished notice of the date, time and location of the hearing on Metro Mobile\u2019s application, in The Stamford Advocate, the Greenwich Time and the Bridgeport Post. The Council also mailed notice of the date, time and location of the hearing to the persons entitled to receive a copy of the application under \u00a7 16-50m (c). As agreed in the stipulation on file, the plaintiffs were not entitled to be sent notice of the hearing by mail from the Council under \u00a7 16-50m (c) as such notification is required only for those named in \u00a7 16-50Z upon whom service of a copy of the application must be made. The public hearing on Metro Mobile\u2019s application was held on December 14 and 21, 1987, at the times and places specified in the notice of the hearing. On February 19,1988, the Council issued a certificate to Metro Mobile that authorized it to construct a cellular telecommunications tower facility on the Greenwich AC/A site.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On June 29,1988, approximately four months after the Council had issued a certificate to Metro Mobile, the plaintiffs filed an application for an ex parte temporary injunction to enjoin Metro Mobile from constructing the tower. At the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 application, Metro Mobile had already begun construction of the tower\u2019s foundation. The application for an ex parte restraining order was denied and the trial court ordered that the defendants be served with the writ, summons, complaint and related papers by June 30,1988, and that the parties appear in court on July 5, 1988. The trial court held a chambers conference on July 5, 1988, and ordered the parties to file briefs. Construction of the tower was completed by July 14, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">During July and August, 1988, the parties filed mem-oranda of fact and law and another chambers conference was held on August 16,1988. Metro Mobile moved to dismiss the action, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Metro Mobile argued that since the Council has exclusive jurisdiction over the approval of a cellular telephone tower, the power of the Superior Court is limited to hearing an administrative appeal from a decision of the Council. Metro Mobile argued further that the \u201cplaintiffs ha[d] no independent right to [attack collaterally,] in a separate suit, the jurisdiction, actions and procedures of the Siting Council or to prosecute an independent action to seek to enjoin [its] construction of the cellular tower.\u201d The court, however, by a memorandum of decision dated September 8,1988, ruled that \u201cthe failure by defendants to give plaintiffs proper notice constitute[d] a violation of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights and, therefore, plaintiffs [were] irreparably injured.\u201d Thus, the court held that the Council was without jurisdiction to issue Metro Mobile\u2019s certificate, and therefore granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>On October 11,1988, Metro Mobile moved to dissolve the temporary injunction and requested a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a permanent injunction. On December 20, 1988, the court heard arguments on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a permanent injunction and Metro Mobile\u2019s motion for the dissolution of the temporary injunction. On May 2, 1989, the court \u201cadjudged that a permanent injunction be entered ordering [Metro Mobile] to restore the property to its original condition and that a stay of said permanent injunction be entered pending the appeal of this matter.\u201d Thereafter, on May 18,1989, Metro Mobile appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment rendered by the trial court, and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, this court transferred the case to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">On appeal, Metro Mobile argues: (1) that the trial court should not have concluded that the Council lacked jurisdiction to hear and decide its application for a certificate; (2) that the trial court should not have concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to due process of law were violated; (3) that even if it were assumed that the plaintiffs were \u201crecord owners,\u201d their property did not \u201cabut\u201d the proposed site and they were therefore not entitled to notice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-50Z; (4) that the trial court should not have granted a permanent injunction directing Metro Mobile to dismantle its cellular telephone tower, a form of relief that the plaintiffs had not requested and that the trial court had no authority to grant; (5) that the trial court failed to balance the hardship to Metro Mobile claimed by the plaintiffs against the substantial hardship involved in dismantling its cellular telephone tower and facilities; and (6) that its rights to due process of law as guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution and by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution were violated by the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>refusal to allow it to be heard and present evidence in opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary or permanent injunction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The trial court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 property abuts the tower site property, and, therefore, that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive notice of Metro Mobile\u2019s application for a certificate by certified or registered mail as provided under \u00a7 16-50Z (b). The court further concluded that Metro Mobile\u2019s failure to give the plaintiffs certified or registered mail notice \u201c constitute^] a violation of [the plaintiffs\u2019] constitutional rights, and therefore rendered the Siting Council without jurisdiction to issue Metro Mobile\u2019s certificate.\u201d Because we do not agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights were violated we conclude that the Council properly had jurisdiction to issue Metro Mobile its certificate. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to consider the defendants\u2019 other claims since there was no appeal by the plaintiffs from the action of the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Under \u00a7 16-50\u00cd (b), an application for a certificate must be accompanied by proof of service of a copy of the application on specified municipal and state agencies and officials designated in parts A through F of the statute. Additionally, notice of such application must be given to the general public by publication, in the form prescribed by the Council\u2019s regulations, in such newspapers as will substantially inform the public of the application. At the same time that notice of the application is given to the general public by publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cation, \u201c[a] notice of such an application for a certificate . . . shall also be sent, by certified or registered mail, to each person appearing of record as an owner of property which abuts the proposed primary or alternative sites on which the facility would be located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The plaintiffs do not claim that they were entitled to receive a copy of the application as required by \u00a7 16-50Z for designated municipal and state agencies and officials, nor do the plaintiffs claim that they did not receive the notice given to the general public by publication. Similarly, they do not claim that the notice by publication given by the Council was improper. Nor is there any claim of impropriety in the mailing by the Council of the notice of the hearing to the applicant and each person entitled to receive a copy of the application under \u00a7 <em>16-501 </em>(b) (A) through (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We agree with the argument of the Council that the only notice of constitutional dimension in this case is the notice of the <em>hearing, </em>not the notice of the filing of the application. If it is assumed for the sake of argument that the plaintiffs were abutters within the meaning of \u00a7 16-50Z, and that they were thereby entitled to notice of the filing of the application, the only notice that the plaintiffs did not receive that they were entitled to receive was notice of the filing of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Therefore, under the facts of this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 collateral attack on the Council\u2019s action could only succeed if the Council lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs were deprived of some notice granted them by the principles of due process of law. The purpose of such constitutional notice \u201c \u2018is to advise all affected parties of their opportunity to be heard and to be apprised of the relief sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 100, 291 A.2d 721 (1971); see also <em>Wright </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>174 Conn. 488, 491, 391 A.2d 146 (1978); <em>Sachem\u2019s Head Assn. </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>168 Conn. 365, 369-70, 362 A.2d 519 (1975); <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>168 Conn. 8, 14, 357 A.2d 488 (1975); <em>Jarvis Acres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>163 Conn. 41, 47, 301 A.2d 244 (1972). That required notice, however, has traditionally been held to apply to notice of the hearing. See <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>190 Conn. 746, 462 A.2d 1042 (1983); <em>Brazo </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>177 Conn. 515, 518, 418 A.2d 883 (1979); <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 83, 411 A.2d 42 (1979); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 375, 355 A.2d 265 (1974); <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra; <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 690, 693, 137 A.2d 542 (1957); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>F.

It does not extend to notice of a prehearing application as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">All of the cases cited by the plaintiffs for the proposition that the failure to comply with the notice require^ ment of \u00a7 16-50Z was a jurisdictional defect involved notice of a hearing. See <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>supra. None involved, as here, a statutory notice of the filing of an application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the mere fact that the plaintiffs were abutters, as has been assumed, gave them no significant interest protected by the due process clause and did not entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>them to more than published notice of the hearing. <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>State, </em>815 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-9\"> The Council is the state agency that oversees, inter alia, the location, design, construction and maintenance of cellular telephone transmission facilities.
