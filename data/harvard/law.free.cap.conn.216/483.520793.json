Lougee, that the information sought by the respondent, Jeannie B. Grinnell, was immaterial and unnecessarily duplicative. The court ruled that the statutory criteria for issuing a deposition subpoena had been satisfied and that Lougee had not shown good cause as to why he should not be deposed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">The relevant procedural history of this case is as follows. Grinnell is the plaintiff in an action brought in Texas against the American Tobacco Company (Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>can). In that action, Grinnell alleges that her husband died of lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes produced by American. Lougee was employed by American from 1950 to 1965 as an engineer and master mechanic prior to serving as American\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) from 1981 to 1985, when he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">During his tenure as CEO, Lougee was responsible for American\u2019s policy on issues of \u201csmoking and health.\u201d Consequently, in responses to Grinnell\u2019s interrogatories he was designated by American as one of four individuals once holding policy-making positions and having the most knowledge regarding the chemical composition of certain cigarettes. Lougee may be the only one of these individuals presently alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">As a result of American\u2019s designation, Grinnell filed a deposition notice in her Texas action which was directed to American but sought Lougee\u2019s testimony. The Texas trial court determined that American could not be compelled to produce Lougee for a deposition because Lougee was no longer an employee of American. Grinnell then hired a Connecticut attorney to subpoena Lougee to appear at a deposition in Connecticut. Lougee moved to quash the subpoena. The trial court, after determining that Grinnell failed to apply for the subpoena as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-148e (f),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On October 20,1989, Grinnell obtained an order from the District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, commissioning a Connecticut notary to take the deposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Lougee, \u201ca material witness,\u201d in Stamford, Connecticut. On October 27,1989, Grinnell applied to the Connecticut Superior Court for a subpoena requiring Lougee to appear at the Stamford deposition. Lougee was served with the subpoena in Darien, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Lougee promptly moved to quash the subpoena<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for a protective order, arguing that because the Texas court had recently granted summary judgment in favor of American on all of Grinnell\u2019s post-1965 claims, and because Lougee was responsible for American\u2019s policy on smoking and health issues only from 1981 to 1985: (1) the information sought by Grinnell was irrelevant; and (2) the deposition was unreasonable, oppressive and sought duplicative testimony. After a hearing, the trial court granted Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena application, denied Lougee\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena and issued an order requiring Lougee to appear at the Stamford deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Lougee appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. On appeal, Lougee claims that the trial court should not have denied his motion to quash Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena and for a protective order because: (1) the information sought was not material to a pending action; and (2) the information sought was unnecessarily duplicative. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Before addressing the merits of this appeal, we must determine whether the appeal is properly before this court. An order issued upon a discovery motion in a civil case does not ordinarily constitute an appealable final judgment. <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Conn. 252, 255, 520 A.2d 605 (1987). The discovery order appealed in this case, however, was not rendered in the context of a civil action pending in Connecticut. Compare <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 429 A.2d 478 (1980). In this case, the sole judicial proceeding instituted in Connecticut concerned the propriety of Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena, a proceeding that \u201cwill not result in a later judgment from which [Lougee] can then appeal. Thus, this appeal falls within the first prong of the test of finality of judgment stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983): \u2018(1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>17 Conn. App. 577, 578 n.1, 554 A.2d 1097 (1989). Because the separate and distinct judicial proceeding concerning Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena terminated when the trial court issued the orders appealed, Lou-gee has appealed from a final judgment, and we will address his appeal on the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Lougee\u2019s first claim is that the trial court should not have denied his motion to quash Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena and for a protective order because the information she seeks is not material to the Texas action. In support of his claim, Lougee points out that on April 11,1989, the Texas trial court granted summary judgment in favor of American on all of Grinnell\u2019s post-1965 claims. Since only those claims for the period ending December 31, 1965, remain viable, and since his knowledge derives from the years 1981 to 1985, Lou-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>gee contends that his testimony is immaterial to the legal issues remaining in the Texas action. Lougee also maintains that he acquired no direct knowledge specific to Grinnell\u2019s decedent while he was CEO for American.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">At the outset, we note that the limited statutory requirements for the issuance of a subpoena for the taking of a deposition to be used in a foreign civil action have been met in this case. General Statutes \u00a7 52-148e (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]ach judge or clerk of any court, justice of the peace, notary public or commissioner of the superior court in this state, may issue a subpoena, upon request, for the appearance of any witness before him to give his deposition in a civil action ... if the party seeking to take such person\u2019s deposition has complied with the provisions of sections 52-148a and 52-148b . . . .\u201d The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 52-148a and 52-148b have no relevance to this case, and Lou-gee does not contest the fact that an authorized official issued Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In addition, \u00a7 52-148e (f)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part that \u201c[deposition of witnesses living in this state may be taken in like manner to be used as evidence in a civil action . . . pending in any court ... of any other state ... on application of any party to such civil action. . . .\u201d It is undisputed that Grinnell is a party to a civil action pending in Texas where Lougee\u2019s deposition is to be used in evidence, and that Lougee is living in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Despite Grinnell\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 52-148e on its face, Lougee urges us to overturn the trial court\u2019s rulings on the ground that his testimony is immaterial to the legal issues remaining in the Texas action. Practice Book \u00a7 218, however, liberally permits discovery of information \u201cmaterial to the <em>subject matter </em>involved in the pending action . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Information material to the subject matter of a lawsuit certainly includes a broader spectrum of data than that which is material to the precise issues raised in the pleadings. Accord <em>In the Matter of Surety Assn. of </em>America, 388 F.2d 412, 414 (2d Cir. 1967). Thus, the fact that the issues in Grinnell\u2019s action relate to a time period ending before Lougee became CEO for American does not necessarily render his knowledge immaterial to the Texas lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Further, because the role of Connecticut courts in the Texas action is confined to supervising a deposition, we decline to speculate upon whether the information Lougee possesses is actually immaterial to the subject matter of that action. See <em>Horizons Titanium Corporation </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>290 F.2d 421, 425 (1st Cir. 1961); <em>E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deening Milliken Research Corporation, </em>72 F.R.D. 440, 442-43 (D. Del. 1976). It may well be that Lougee lacks the information that Grinnell desires, but Grinnell need not blindly accept Lougee\u2019s claimed lack of knowledge as reported by his attorney. Grinnell is entitled to test that claim by deposing Lougee, and any objections raised by Lougee can adequately be preserved on the record of the deposition. See <em>Travelers Rental Co. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>116 F.R.D. 140, 143 (D. Mass. 1987); <em>Amherst Leasing Corporation </em>v. <em>Emhart Corporation, </em>65 F.R.D. 121, 122-23 (D. Conn. 1974). We are satisfied that the Texas court will thereafter determine the evidentiary issue of materiality presented here, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and if Lougee\u2019s deposition, or any part of it, is offered into evidence in the Texas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Lougee next claims that the trial court should not have denied his motion to quash Grinnell\u2019s deposition subpoena and for a protective order because the information she seeks is unnecessarily duplicative. Specifically, he claims that Grinnell now possesses the transcript of Lougee\u2019s testimony from an unrelated \u201csmoking and health\u201d case previously litigated in New Jersey, as well as depositions taken from Robert Hei-mann, CEO at American from 1969 to 1980, and Preston H. Leake, current director of research and development. Lougee notes further that American has offered to stipulate that its position on \u201csmoking and health\u201d issues remains the same as that stated by both Lougee in his testimony in the New Jersey action and Heimann at his deposition in the Texas action. We find this claim equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In support of his claim that Grinnell\u2019s possession of his testimony in the New Jersey action should excuse a present deposition, Lougee principally relies on <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 303 A.2d 709 (1972). In <em>DiPalma, </em>the witness actually testified for two days at trial and was released. When the witness failed to comply with a subpoena requiring a second appearance in court, the trial court refused to issue a capias to secure his presence. This court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to issue the capias in light of the witness\u2019 prior submission to two days of trial examination. In this case, where Lougee has not testified with respect to the Texas action, we find no duplication of testimony analogous to that in <em>DiPalma.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>DiPalma </em>aside, we note that it is uncertain at this point in time whether the transcript of Lougee\u2019s New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Jersey testimony will be admissible in the Texas action. Even if we were assured of its admissibility, we do not think that Grinnell should be bound by the testimony taken by another plaintiff in an unrelated action, notwithstanding American\u2019s willingness to be so bound. Neither does American\u2019s willingness to be bound by Heimann\u2019s deposition, nor Grinnell\u2019s possession of Heimann\u2019s and Leake\u2019s depositions render Lougee\u2019s testimony unnecessarily duplicative. It is possible that Lougee could disclose information that the others did not, and, at any rate, our discovery rules do not exempt a prospective deponent from testifying merely because the applicant has access to alternative sources of information. Accord <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Hearst Corporation, </em>519 F.2d 418, 429 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Dykes </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>85 F.R.D. 373, 375 (D. Ill. 1980); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn., </em>72 F.R.D. 161, 164 (S.D.N.Y. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Consequently, it is our view that Grinnell is entitled to explore by deposition Lougee\u2019s personal knowledge of American\u2019s position on \u201csmoking and health\u201d issues. We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lougee\u2019s motion to quash Grin-nell\u2019s application for a deposition subpoena and for a protective order. See <em>Standard Tallow Corporation </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 57, 459 A.2d 503 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-148e. issuance of subpoena foe taking OF DEPOSITIONS.
