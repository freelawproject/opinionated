The plaintiff moved for a deficiency judgment following the strict foreclosure of a mortgage that secured a promissory note of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied the motion for a deficiency judgment because it found none of the evidence regarding the value of the mortgaged property to be credible. Based on that finding, the court concluded that the plaintiff had not met her burden of proof. From that ruling, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred the appeal to this court. We hold that implicit in General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 is the requirement that the party seeking a deficiency judgment satisfy her burden of proof regarding the fair market value of the property as of the date title vests in her. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The following facts are undisputed. On May 25,1982, the defendants executed a promissory note in favor of the plaintiff in the principal amount of $30,000, with interest payable at the rate of 16 percent per annum. As security, two of the defendants mortgaged to the plaintiff an undeveloped lot located in Litchfield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In September, 1988, the plaintiff instituted mortgage foreclosure proceedings against the defendants. On August 14,1989, the court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure and established the amount of the debt at $47,802.93, including attorney\u2019s fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>costs. The law days for the defendants and the subsequent lienor; General Statutes \u00a7 49-19;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were set as September 25 and 26,1989, respectively. Since no one redeemed, title to the property vested in the plaintiff on September 27, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">On October 2, 1989, the plaintiff moved for a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 and Practice Book \u00a7 528.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 22,1990, after several continuances requested by the parties, the trial court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>heard the motion for a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">At the beginning of the hearing, the parties stipulated that the only issue before the court was the value of the property that was the subject of the mortgage. Additionally, the parties stipulated that $51,297.60, representing the original amount of the debt plus accrued interest, was the appropriate figure to be used to determine if a deficiency judgment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The plaintiff and the defendants presented the testimony of two appraisers to establish the fair market value of the property. Both the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Arthur Oles,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the defendants\u2019 expert witness, Fletcher Waldron,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> used the comparable sales approach to determine the fair market value of the property. Oles valued the property at $31,000, while Waldron valued it at $60,000. Both experts were cross-examined as to the appropriateness of their valuations of the subject property. During the cross-examination of Oles, he testified that the assessed value of the property for tax purposes was $42,480, representing 70 percent of a purported fair market value of $61,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The court, in an oral ruling from the bench, found that neither the experts\u2019 testimony nor the evidence regarding the assessed value was credible. It ruled, therefore, that the plaintiff had not satisfied her burden of proof to establish the value of the property, and denied the motion for a deficiency judgment. This appeal followed. In a subsequent, written supplemental memorandum of decision, the court reiterated its inability to find a fair market value of the property from the evidence presented and its conclusion that, accordingly, the plaintiff had failed to meet her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The plaintiff claims that: (1) the court was required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 to determine the fair market value of the property involved in the deficiency judgment hearing; (2) the court improperly considered matters outside the record, which directly caused the court\u2019s determination that the expert testimony was not credible; and (3) the court\u2019s refusal to determine the value of the property in question was arbitrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>capricious and unsupported by the facts of the case. The plaintiffs third claim is simply a variation on the theme elaborated under her first claim. We therefore consider them together. We disagree with the plaintiffs first claim as restated, but agree with her second claim. We conclude, however, that the court\u2019s improper consideration of matters outside the record was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The plaintiff first claims that General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 imposed a duty on the trial court to determine a value for the property that was the subject of a deficiency judgment hearing. The plaintiff does not claim that the court\u2019s factual finding, determining that the testimony of the expert witnesses was not credible, was clearly erroneous. Instead, the plaintiff argues that the court had an affirmative duty, as a matter of law under the language of \u00a7 49-14, to set a value for the property, regardless of whether credible evidence upon which to base this determination was presented at the hearing. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201c[A] judgment of strict foreclosure extinguishes all rights of the foreclosing mortgagee on the underlying note, except those enforceable through the use of the deficiency judgment procedure delineated in General Statutes \u00a7 49-14.\u201d <em>First Bank </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>199 Conn. 368, 370, 507 A.2d 997 (1986); General Statutes \u00a7 49-1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Section 49-14 (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201cany party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment.\u201d At the hearing on the motion, \u201cthe court shall hear the evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a). \u201cSuch a deficiency judgment, in light of \u00a7 49-1, is, therefore, the only available means of satisfying a mortgage debt when the security is inadequate to make the foreclosing plaintiff whole.\u201d <em>First Bank </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>supra, 371; <em>Simsbury Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ray Carlson Lumber Co., </em>154 Conn. 216, 219, 224 A.2d 544 (1966). \u201cThe value of the premises on the date that title becomes vested in the mortgagee determines whether the mortgagee is entitled to a deficiency judgment.\u201d <em>Di Diego </em>v. <em>Zarro, </em>19 Conn. App. 291, 294, 562 A.2d 555 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The language at issue in this appeal provides that the trial court <em>\u201cshall </em>hear evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and <em>shall </em>render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. The plaintiff contends that, because the legislature used the word \u201cshall,\u201d the statute is mandatory in nature, and the court improperly declined to establish the value of the property. Contrary to the plaintiffs argument, however, although \u201cshall\u201d has often been held to be mandatory; see <em>Far-ricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeals Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 202-203, 440 A.2d 286 (1982); its use in this section does not mandate that the court must determine a value for a piece of property when the plaintiff has not satisfied her burden of proof by providing credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In determining whether the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory or directory, the test is \u201cwhether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 360, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); see also <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 710, 579 A.2d 1 (1990). \u201cThat test must be applied with reference to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>supra. The plaintiff contends that the \u201cessence\u201d of \u00a7 49-14 is the requirement that the court determine the actual value of the real property involved, and that if this requirement is within the court\u2019s discretion, the plaintiff\u2019s right to a deficiency judgment would be subject to the whim of the court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he plain object [of the deficiency judgment statute] is to require a mortgage creditor, who appropriates the property in part payment only of his debt, to apply the actual value of the security to the debt before collecting any claimed deficiency\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>People\u2019s Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>118 Conn. 568, 571, 173 A. 233 (1934), quoting <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Hendrick, </em>89 Conn. 100, 103, 93 A. 5 (1915); <em>Maresca </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>6 Conn. App. 691, 694, 506 A.2d 1096 (1986). Implicit in the purpose of the statute is the initial prerequisite that the plaintiff provide the court with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she is entitled to a deficiency judgment. Indeed, this court has held, in a deficiency judgment proceeding, that \u201cthe trier may not decide an issue which is wholly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>190 Conn. 60, 71-72, 459 A.2d 999 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The plaintiffs claim, at its roots, is that the trial court had a mandatory duty to arrive at some determination of value of the property despite the lack of any credible evidence upon which to determine that value. Relying on the authority of the court to arrive at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>compromise figure between those offered by expert witnesses; see <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra, 70; <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>4 Conn. App. 426, 429, 494 A.2d 624 (1985) (tax appeal); and on the fact that \u00a7 49-14 provides the sole procedure for securing a deficiency judgment, the plaintiff argues that the court was required to do so in this case. This argument founders on the \u201c \u2018elementary rule that whenever the existence of any fact is necessary in order that a party may make out his case . . . the burden is on such party to show the existence of such fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nikitiuk </em>v. <em>Pishtey, </em>153 Conn. 545, 552, 219 A.2d 225 (1966); see also C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 337. This rule is derived from the traditional principle that in a civil case \u201c[t]he general burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff . . . .\u201d <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>141 Conn. 126, 129, 104 A.2d 210 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">As a necessary element of her claim for a deficiency judgment, the plaintiff was required to prove that the property was worth less than the amount of the debt on the date of the vesting of title. She therefore had the burden of presenting sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine the value of the property on that date. <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra. She failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201c \u2018The determination of [a property\u2019s] value by a court is the expression of the court\u2019s opinion aided ordinarily by the opinions of expert witnesses, and reached by weighing those opinions in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing upon value and its own general knowledge of the elements going to establish it. <em>Appeal of Cohen, </em>117 Conn. 75, 85, 166 Atl. 747 [1933].\u2019 <em>Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>122 Conn. 228, 233, 188 A. 433 (1936).\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>196 Conn. 172, 183, 491 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 920, 106 S. Ct. 250, 88 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1985). \u201c[T]he determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is within the province of the trier of facts, who is <em>privileged </em>to adopt whatever testimony he reasonably believes to be <em>credible. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. \u201cWhen confronted with conflicting evidence as to valuation the trier may properly conclude that under all the circumstances a compromise figure most accurately reflects fair market value.\u201d <em>New Haven Savings Bank, </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra, 70; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>148 Conn. 513, 515-16, 172 A.2d 612 (1961); see also <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">While we have held that the trial court <em>may </em>set the property value at a compromise figure when confronted with conflicting expert testimony as to valuation; <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra; <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra; we have never held that the court <em>must </em>do so in the absence of any credible evidence. Indeed, <em>in New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra, we upheld the compromise value set by the trial court where the court, \u201cin determining valuation . . . accepted and rejected portions of each appraiser\u2019s testimony . . . .\u201d Thus, in that case the trial court found segments of the presented evidence credible. See also <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra, 430 (trial court \u201c \u2018accepted and rejected portions of each appraiser\u2019s testimony\u2019 \u201d [quoting <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra]).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Finally, the plaintiff attempts to analogize the affirmative duty of determining the value of real property applicable to a state referee in a condemnation proceeding to the fact-finding function of the trial court in a deficiency judgment proceeding. The analogy fails. The important public interest found in condemnation hearings is not present in deficiency judgment hearings. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>condemnation cases, \u201c[t]he property owner is required to yield involuntarily to the sovereign\u2019s demand. The only question in issue is the fair value of the property seized. The single objective . . . is to ensure that the property owner shall receive, and that the state shall only be required to pay, the just compensation which the fundamental law promises the owner for the property which the state has seen fit to take for public use.\u201d <em>Thomaston </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 166, 174, 239 A.2d 515 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In condemnation hearings, the \u201cstate referee sitting as a court on appeals ... is more than just a trier of fact or an arbitrator of differing opinions of witnesses. He is charged by the General Statutes and the decisions of this court with the duty of making an independent determination of value and fair compensation in the light of all the circumstances, the evidence, his general knowledge and his viewing of the premises.\u201d <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>163 Conn. 12, 21, 301 A.2d 262 (1972); see also <em>Minicucci </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>211 Conn. 382, 388, 559 A.2d 216 (1989). The duty imposed upon the court to set a value for the property stems from the nature of the action, namely, an involuntary taking by the state. No such important public interest inheres in a deficiency judgment proceeding, where the parties voluntarily entered into the arrangement, and where the plaintiff already possesses the property that secured the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Indeed, deficiency judgment hearings more closely resemble suits for collection than condemnation hearings. <em>Maresca </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>supra, 696 (\u201cthe deficiency judgment procedure is the functional equivalent of a suit upon the note\u201d); <em>City Savings Bank of Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Miko, </em>1 Conn. App. 30, 36-37, 467 A.2d 929 (1983) (award of attorney\u2019s fees appropriate in deficiency judgment hearing, which acts as part of the \u201ccollection pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>cess\u201d). In light of the different purposes underlying the two causes of action, we conclude that the trier of fact in a deficiency judgment proceeding has no analogous duty to determine value in the absence of some credible evidence as a basis therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court\u2019s refusal to set a value for the real property in the deficiency judgment hearing was arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the underlying facts, and created a windfall in favor of the defendants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The plaintiff argues that, because \u00a7 49-14 is the only remedy available to a creditor after strict foreclosure, allowing the trial court to refuse to set a value to the property deprives the plaintiff of a meaningful judicial determination of her claim and, therefore, is arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiff also argues that, by affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, this court will open a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d where every tax appeal, condemnation appeal, and deficiency judgment hearing will result in a claim of insufficient evidence to determine a property value, and that this decision will result in appeals in all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We determine, however, that this decision does not change the present status of the law in these areas. A litigant is presently entitled to raise on appeal the issue of whether the valuation was properly supported by sufficient evidence. <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra (claim that there was no evidence to support deficiency judgment); <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra (claimant alleged insufficient evidence to support tax assessor\u2019s valuation). Additionally, the plaintiff incorrectly concludes that because this court has previously held that the trial court <em>may </em>use a compromise figure in setting property value; <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Development, </em>supra; <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra; it was arbitrary and capricious for the court not to do so in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u201cWe are aware . . . that the deference given to the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion should not be interpreted as meaning that its exercise is insulated from meaningful review.\u201d <em>State v. S&amp;R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 312, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987). \u201c \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 means \u2018[wjithout adequate determining principle . . . not governed by any fixed rules or standard.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). \u201cCapricious\u201d is defined as \u201c[cjhangeable in purpose or view; freakish; whimsical.\u201d Ballantine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.). \u201c \u2018Where there is room for two opinions, an action taken after due consideration is not arbitrary or capricious even though a reviewing court may believe it to be erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although we might have decided the issue differently, a review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, as well as the evidence presented at trial, indicates that the finding that the plaintiff provided insufficient credible evidence at trial with which to determine property value was properly based upon the underlying facts and, therefore, was not arbitrary or capricious. Furthermore, because the plaintiff has already obtained the mortgaged property by way of strict foreclosure, the defendants did not receive a windfall as a result of the trial court\u2019s decision. Any benefit the defendants might have received was simply the result of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to carry her burden of persuading the court that she was entitled to a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly considered matters outside the record, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the court\u2019s consideration of those matters directly resulted in its finding that the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness was not credible. We agree that the court should not have considered certain matters because they were outside the scope of the deficiency judgment hearing. We conclude, however, that any such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">This claim stems from the fact that, when the court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>rendered its oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing on January 22,1990, it referred to two facts: (1) the original amount of the mortgage note, in May, 1982, was $30,000; and (2) when the court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>on August 14,1989, rendered judgment of strict foreclosure and found the amount of the debt, Judge Pickett set what Judge Moraghan regarded as \u201ca short law day which would suggest little equity . . . in the property.\u201d Judge Moraghan also referred, however, in addition to the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser, to that of the defendants\u2019 appraiser and the evidence of the assessed value of the property. He then concluded that he did not find either expert credible and that he was \u201cnot comfortable with the assessed value . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The plaintiff reads the court\u2019s reference to the original amount of the mortgage debt in 1982 as an inference that the property must have been worth more than $30,000 in 1982 and, therefore, a further inference that in 1989 it must have been worth more than the $31,000 attributed to it by the plaintiff\u2019s expert. Although these inferences are not required by the court\u2019s language, they do represent a reasonable reading of the transcript. These inferences, the plaintiff suggests, were impermissible because they were based on speculation and not on any evidence produced at the hearing. The plaintiff also argues that these inferences, and any inference drawn from the length of the redemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>period as compared to the amount of the mortgage debt found in August, 1989, were irrelevant because the sole question for the court at the deficiency judgment hearing was the value of the property on September 27, 1989.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that the court should not have drawn these inferences. Although, in deciding a claim for a deficiency judgment, the court may properly consider certain uncontested matters that were previously adjudicated in the case; see <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra, 72 n.13 (court may rely on previous foreclosure judgment in determining debt due); that discretion does not extend to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">No inference regarding the value of the property in 1989 could logically be drawn from the amount of the 1982 mortgage debt; any such inference would be speculative. Furthermore, the value placed on the property by the court for the purposes of rendering judgment of strict foreclosure and setting law days was irrelevant to a subsequent deficiency judgment proceeding. \u201cIt is irrelevant to the determination of a deficiency under \u00a7 49-14 that the court had placed a prior value on the premises for purposes of the earlier foreclosure proceeding.\u201d <em>Di Diego </em>v. <em>Zarro, </em>supra, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We are not persuaded, however, that this was harmful error. The court subsequently filed a supplemental memorandum of decision because \u201cupon reading the transcript of its order in the . . . case, [the court] recognizes the need and urgency of filing a supplemental memorandum in view of the condition of that transcript.\u201d In this memorandum of decision, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>reiterated its opinion that it did not find credible the evidence presented to it. The supplemental decision contains no suggestion that the court\u2019s ultimate lack of confidence in the experts\u2019 credibility was affected in any way by either the original amount of the note or the length of the redemption period. Indeed, in the supplemental decision the court did not even refer to the original amount of the note and did not repeat its characterization of the length of the redemption period. Although a trial court may not alter its initial findings by way of a further articulation; see <em>Koper </em>v. <em>Koper, </em>17 Conn. App. 480, 484, 553 A.2d 1162 (1989); we do not regard the court\u2019s supplemental memorandum of decision as having done so. In view of that supplemental decision, we conclude that the plaintiff has not carried her appellate burden of establishing that the error of the trial court was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 provides in pertinent part: \u201cdeficiency judgment. (a) At any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment.
