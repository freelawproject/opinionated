Greco, was charged in a substitute information with the crimes of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>553L-54C,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>robbery in the first degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In setting forth the predicate offenses, the felony murder count alleged that the defendant \u201cdid commit or attempt to commit a robbery of [the victim] and burglary of [the victim\u2019s] residence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The defendant pleaded not guilty to all three counts of the substitute information and elected to be tried by a jury. He thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the first degree robbery count and the first degree burglary count pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>for the defendant\u2019s motion was his claim that the state, by charging first degree robbery and first degree burglary as separate offenses, violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy because robbery and burglary were also the predicate offenses of the felony murder count. The trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The Appellate Court dismissed, sua sponte, the defendant\u2019s appeal of the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Subsequently, the defendant changed his plea on all three counts to guilty pursuant to the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). Prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>provided the following information to the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 711:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1) for the crime of felony murder, the minimum mandatory prison sentence was twenty-five years, while the maximum possible sentence was life imprisonment;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) for the crime of robbery in the first degree, the minimum mandatory prison sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>five years, while the maximum possible sentence was twenty years imprisonment; (3) for the crime of burglary in the first degree, the minimum mandatory prison sentence was five years while the maximum possible sentence was twenty years imprisonment; (4) the maximum prison sentence possible from consecutive sentences on all three counts was eighty years notwithstanding the opinion of the prosecutor that it was one hundred years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court also informed the defendant that it would impose a total effective sentence of fifty years imprisonment if the defendant pleaded guilty to all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Before the court accepted his guilty plea the defendant argued that, assuming the validity of his claim that the double jeopardy clause barred punishing him for both felony murder and the predicate offenses, the maximum possible prison term from consecutive sentences was sixty years. The defendant claimed that the uncertain status of his double jeopardy claim and its impact on his possible maximum sentence raised a question as to whether his guilty plea could knowingly be made under such circumstances. The trial court told the defendant that the double jeopardy issue would not be preserved if the defendant were to plead guilty and that he would have to go to trial if he wished to litigate that issue. The defendant rejected this offer and the trial court accepted his guilty plea after finding that it was made voluntarily and with the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The defendant subsequently filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that his plea was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4) because he had not been properly informed of the maximum possible sentence he faced from consecutive sentences. In his motion, the defendant noted that, at the time he changed his plea to guilty, his attorney had informed him that the maximum possible sentence was either sixty or one hundred years, while the court had informed him that the maximum possible sentence was eighty years. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The court, as it had previously indicated, then sentenced the defendant to fifty years imprisonment on the felony murder count, and concurrent ten year sentences on both the first degree robbery count and the first degree burglary count. The defendant appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The defendant claims that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea under Practice Book W 720 and 721.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He maintains that because the dou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ble jeopardy clause prevents the state from punishing him for felony murder, first degree robbery and first degree burglary, the maximum sentence possible was sixty years. The defendant argues that, since the trial court informed him that the maximum sentence possible from the imposition of consecutive sentences was eighty years, the plea was accepted without substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and consequently the court should have allowed his plea to be withdrawn pursuant to \u00a7 721 (1). In addition, the defendant claims that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea under \u00a7 721 (2) because the court\u2019s allegedly erroneous advice as to the maximum sentence made it impossible for him voluntarily to waive his constitutional rights by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant conceded at oral argument that the success of his claim that his guilty plea was involuntary and was accepted without substantial compliance with \u00a7 711 (2) and (4) is dependent upon our agreement with his double jeopardy argument. Because we find that the double jeopardy clause would not bar the court from imposing consecutive sentences upon the defendant for the felony murder conviction and for the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>degree robbery and first degree burglary convictions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Although the trial court incorrectly told the defendant that the maximum possible prison sentence he faced from consecutive sentences was eighty years, the defendant conceded at oral argument that this error does not support the claim that his plea was involuntary and was accepted without substantial compliance with \u00a7 711. Since the defendant pleaded guilty and accepted a fifty year sentence when informed that he faced a maximum possible prison sentence of eighty years, his plea certainly would have been the same if the trial court had properly informed him that the maximum possible sentence for the crimes charged was one hundred years.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>213 Conn. 74, 78, 566 A.2d 677 (1989), cert. denied, U.S. , 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>S. Ct. 2586, 110 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1990). This constitutional guarantee prohibits not only multiple trials for the same offense, but also multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 35, 561 A.2d 897 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 693, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the maximum possible prison sentence was sixty years involves that aspect of double jeopardy analysis that protects against multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial. \u201cWith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1983); <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 793, 105 S. Ct. 2407, 85 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1985); <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344, 101 S. Ct. 1137, 67 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 566, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). \u201c[T]he role of the constitutional guarantee [against double jeopardy] is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 165. \u201cThe issue, though essentially constitutional, becomes one of statutory construction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. 111, 120, 502 A.2d 374 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 109, 503 A.2d 136 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 222, 506 A.2d 125 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 693. There is no dispute in this case that each of the three crimes with which the defendant was charged arose out of the same transaction. Thus, the question is whether robbery in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, and felony murder based on the predicate offenses of \u201crobbery and burglary\u201d are the same offense for the purposes of double jeopardy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The traditional approach to analyzing whether two offenses constitute the same offense was set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). \u201c[Wjhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d Id., 304; <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 695. \u201c Tn conducting this inquiry, we look only to the relevant statutes, the information, and the bill of particulars, not to the evidence presented at trial.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>197 Conn. 588, 593, 500 A.2d 547 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test to this case, we conclude that first degree robbery and first degree burglary constitute the same offense as felony murder under that test, where the felony murder count alleges \u201crobbery and burglary\u201d as the predicate offenses. This conclusion is dictated by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 601-605, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980), where we concluded that first degree robbery and first degree burglary are lesser included offenses of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The felony murder indictment in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>supra, 602, alleged that the defendant \u201cdid commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>burglary </em>and <em>robbery\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant appealed the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on first degree robbery and first degree burglary as lesser included offenses of the felony murder indictment. Although <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin </em>involved the application of the test used to determine when a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense, as opposed to the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the former test includes an inquiry into whether \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser . . . .\u201d Id., 601. This prong of the test is satisfied if the lesser offense does not \u201c \u2018require any element which is not needed to commit the greater offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 428, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 97, 384 A.2d 326 (1977). We concluded that it was not possible to commit felony murder in the manner indicated in the indictment without having also committed first degree robbery and first degree burglary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>supra, 602. Since, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>there are no elements of first degree robbery and first degree burglary which are not also elements of felony murder when the felony murder count alleges \u201crobbery and burglary\u201d as the predicate offenses, these offenses constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d as the felony murder charge under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, however, does not end our analysis of the double jeopardy issue. \u201c[T]he <em>Blockburger </em>rule is not controlling when the legislative intent is clear from the face of the statute or the legislative history.\u201d <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 779; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>supra, 368; <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 340; <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 691-92, 100 S. Ct. 1432, 63 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 695-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>19 Conn. App. 245, 251-52, 562 A.2d 539 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Double jeopardy protection against cumulative punishments is only \u201cdesigned to ensure that the sentencing discretion of the courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 499, 104 S. Ct. 2536, 81 L. Ed. 2d 425, reh. denied, 468 U.S. 1224, 105 S. Ct. 20, 82 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1984). \u201cWhere ... a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the \u2018same\u2019 conduct under <em>BlocJcburger, </em>a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>supra, 368-69. \u201cThe <em>BlocJcburger </em>test is a \u2018rule of statutory construction,\u2019 and because it serves as a means of discerning congressional purpose the rule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u201d <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 340; <em>Beam </em>v. <em>Foltz, </em>832 F.2d 1401, 1411, cert. denied, 485 U.S. 980, 108 S. Ct. 1278, 99 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1988). The language, structure and legislative history of a statute can provide evidence of this intent. <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 779. Because we conclude that the legislature clearly intended multiple punishments for felony murder and the predicate offenses of robbery and burglary, the maximum possible prison sentence faced by the defendant was one hundred years and thus the defendant has no grounds for his claim that the trial court should have allowed the withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>Brimmage </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>793 F.2d 1014, 1015-16 (9th Cir. 1986) (although robbery lesser included offense of felony murder, cumulative punishments do not violate double jeopardy because legislature intended to impose multiple punishments).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, the felony murder statute, and the related penalty provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sions in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a753a-54a(c) and 53a-35a (2)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provide the first source of evidence that the legislature clearly intended multiple punishments. In <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 779, the United States Supreme Court found evidence of congressional intent to provide multiple punishments for the violation of a continuing criminal enterprise statute and for the predicate offenses where the language of the statute \u201caffirmatively state[d] an offense for which punishment will be imposed.\u201d The court found additional evidence in the fact that the statute in question contained no reference to other statutory offenses and set forth a separate penalty rather than using a multiplier of the penalty for another offense. Id., 781; see <em>Birr </em>v. <em>State, </em>744 P.2d 1117, 1121-22 (Wyo. 1987). Section 53a-54c clearly states a separate offense for which pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ishment will be imposed. Although its penalty provisions are set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (e) and 53a-35a (2), the penalty established for felony murder, a prison term of at least twenty-five years and not more than life, stands alone and is not based on a multiplier of the penalty for the predictate offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision (2) of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-35a. imprisonment for any felony committed ON OR AFTER JULY 1, 1981: DEFINITE SENTENCES; TERMS AUTHORIZED.

See <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 306, 559 A.2d 179 (1989); <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Our conclusion as to the legislature\u2019s intent is also based upon the distinct nature of the interests protected by the felony murder, robbery and burglary statutes. The United States Supreme Court found support for its conclusion that Congress intended multiple punishment for violations of two conspiracy statutes in the fact that the statutes were \u201cdirected to separate evils presented by drug trafficking,\u201d namely importation and distribution. <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 343. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 565-66, we employed similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>reasoning in concluding that the legislature authorized multiple punishments under the felony murder statute where the defendant was convicted of three felony murders arising from the same incident. \u201cWhere crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d Id., 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">An obvious purpose of the felony murder statute, or any murder statute, is to protect human life. See id. In contrast, \u201c[t]he basic rationale [of the robbery statutes] is protection against the terror of the forcible taking\u201d; Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1971) p.41; while the primary rationale of the crime of burglary is \u201cprotection against invasion of premises likely to terrorize occupants.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, supra, p. 32. Each of these three statutes penalizes a different type of evil. Since the felony murder statute and the underlying felony statutes are designed to address separate evils, they provide clear evidence that the legislature intended multiple punishments. <em>Talancon </em>v. <em>State, </em>102 Nev. 294, 300, 721 P.2d 764 (1986) (felony murder and robbery with use of a deadly weapon); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>694 S.W.2d 934, 937 (Tenn. 1985) (felony murder and assault with intent to commit rape); <em>Birr </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 1121 (felony murder and aggravated robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u201cThe legislative history of the felony murder statute, \u00a7 53a-54c, indicates that its purpose was to fill an omission in the statutory definition of murder in \u00a7 53a-54a. In restoring the concept of felony murder, which had been omitted from the original enactment of the penal code, the legislature intended to specify another manner in which the crime of murder could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>be committed, rather than create a new crime. Such a purpose would have been in keeping with this state\u2019s murder statute prior to the enactment of the penal code, when the felony murder principle was simply included in the statutory definition of first degree murder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>supra, 696. The legislative history of \u00a7 53a-54c indicates that the felony murder statute was enacted to provide prosecutors with a means of proving murder in cases where a homicide occurs during the commission of certain felonies but specific intent to kill cannot be proven. 17 H.R.

It would be unreasonable to conclude that in correcting this omission from the penal code the legislature, without saying so, also intended that the underlying felony could not be punished.

Although I agree with the result reached by the majority, I disagree with its declaration that \u201cthere are no elements of first degree robbery and first degree burglary which are not also elements of felony murder when the felony murder count alleges \u2018robbery and burglary\u2019 as the predicate offenses\u201d and its conclusion that \u201cthese offenses constitute the \u2018same offense\u2019 as the felony murder charge under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). As charged in this information, both first degree robbery and first degree burglary contain an element, being \u201carmed with a deadly weapon,\u201d not included in the felony murder count and, therefore, are separate offenses. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that the maximum possible sentence for the three crimes was one hundred years and that the trial court\u2019s erroneous reference to a maximum of eighty years could not have been a material inducement in the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The second count of the information charges the defendant with robbery in the first degree by virtue of having robbed the victim while \u201che or another participant in the crime was armed with a deadly weapon; to wit, a handgun\u201d in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). Similarly, the third count alleges that the defendant unlawfully entered the victim\u2019s residence, \u201cwith intent to commit a crime therein, and he or another participant in the crime was armed with a deadly weapon; to wit, a handgun,\u201d thus committing burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1). The first count, charging felony murder in violation of General Statues \u00a7 53a-54c, alleges, without reference to any deadly weapon, that the defendant \u201cdid commit or attempt to commit a robbery of [the victim] and burglary of his residence, and, in the course of and in furtherance of said crimes he, or another participant in the crimes, caused the death\u201d of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Since, as the majority acknowledges, we are limited to the charging documents and specified statutes in applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test in this state; <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>187 Conn. 216, 222, 445 A.2d 585 (1982); it clearly was possible for the defendant to have committed felony murder in the manner charged in the first count without either him or his companion being armed, as alleged in the second count of robbery in the first degree and in the third count of burglary in the first degree. In this information neither first degree robbery nor first degree burglary is included in the felony murder charge, because that offense <em>could </em>have been committed without violating \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) or \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1) in the manner alleged in the second and third counts, both of which require that the offender or another participant be armed. The contrary view of the majority is wholly at variance with our precedent on this subject. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 518, 525 A.2d 509 (1987) (robbery in the first degree while armed with a deadly weapon does not include robbery in the second degree requiring the display, use or representation of a deadly weapon); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 495, 508 A.2d 22 (1986) (\u201csexual assault in the second degree is an offense separate and distinct from sexual assault in the first degree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">As the information plainly sets forth three separate offenses, none of which is included in another, the trial court was authorized to impose the maximum sentence provided by each of the three statutes involved, \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c, 53a-134 (a) (2) and 53a-101 (a) (1), for a cumulative total of one hundred years imprisonment, as the majority has concluded. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the ground of affirmance upon which the majority relies, that the legislature has manifested an intention to punish each of these offenses separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>even if they were included in the felony murder charge under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. That issue raises problems of multiplicity and notice that are best left to another time when we are presented with an information not plainly alleging separate and distinct offenses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 680, 684-85, 366 A.2d 1168 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"> The majority declares that its \u201cconclusion is dictated by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 601-605, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980), where we concluded that first degree robbery and first degree burglary are lesser included offenses of felony murder.\u201d <em>In Morin, </em>both the state and the defendant filed requests to charge on first degree robbery and first degree burglary that this court \u201ccharacterized as a mutual acknowledgment that the allegations of the indictment supported a charge on those crimes as lesser included offenses under <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 61-62, 301 A.2d 547 (1972).\u201d Id., 602 n.4. The court relied upon that mutual understanding and made no independent <em>Blockburger </em>analysis. See <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). Furthermore, in <em>Morin </em>there were no separate counts alleging use of a deadly weapon in the commission of first degree robbery and first degree burglary, as in the present case, but only a single count indictment for felony murder alleging a robbery and burglary without specifying the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>those predicate felonies were committed. In the present case, having expressly relied on the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) and 53a-101 (a) raising simple robbery and burglary to first degree crimes when a defendant is \u201carmed with a deadly weapon,\u201d the state could not have claimed that the commission of robbery and burglary in some other manner might have satisfied alternative enhancement provisions of our first degree robbery and first degree burglary statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
