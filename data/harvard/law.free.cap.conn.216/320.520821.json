In the factual context presented at trial involving the application of the regulation to tracts of undeveloped land, we conclude that the regulation is valid and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> own undeveloped land, containing wetlands and watercourses, located in the town of Somers, and were, at the time these actions were initiated, engaged in the business of constructing residential developments within the town of Somers. The defendant commission<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> revised its inland wetlands and watercourses regulations on July 5, 1988, adopting a regulation that, in general, establishes distances from the seasonal high water level of a watercourse or inland wetland, inside of which certain construction activities are prohibited. For example, the regulation prohibits, with minor exceptions, any septic system or any building constructed for the purpose of sheltering animals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>within 150 feet of the seasonal high water level, and prohibits any other building within fifty feet of the same level.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In the first case, the plaintiffs sought to challenge the adoption of the regulation by means of an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>held, however, that the plaintiffs had not been \u201caggrieved\u201d by the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations, since the same restrictions had been adopted in 1986, as part of the zoning regulations of the town of Somers. The trial court reasoned: (1) \u201cThe adoption of the new [inland wetlands and watercourses] regulation could not affect the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties because the same regulation already was in existence in [the zoning] regulations\u201d; and (2) \u201c[t]he plaintiffs failed to appeal the adoption of the [zoning] regulation in 1986 and having failed to do so, are trying for a \u2018second bite from the apple.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In the second case, the plaintiffs, alleging that the value of their property for development purposes had been \u201csubstantially reduced,\u201d challenged the validity of the regulation, seeking declaratory and other relief. The plaintiffs claimed that the regulation: (1) does not conform to the stated purposes and policies of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (IWWA); see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-37;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) does not conform with regulations promulgated by the commissioner of environmental protection; (3) has no reasonable relation to the stated purpose of the IWWA; (4) contains mandatory restrictions that are not necessary to preserve and protect inland wetlands and watercourses within the town of Somers; (5) detrimentally affects the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to develop their property fully; and (6) is unconstitutional and confiscatory, since it substantially reduces the value of their property without a legitimate reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The trial court referred to the following facts and relevant testimony in its memorandum of decision. Section 6.4 of the Somers regulations had as its origin the virtually identical provisions of the zoning regulations adopted previously by the town of Somers. Although restrictions similar to those contained in \u00a7 6.4 do not exist in regulations adopted by the department of environmental protection (DEP) pursuant to the IWWA, or in any \u201cmodel\u201d regulations, \u00a7 6.4 was adopted by the commission \u201cto prevent injury to the wetlands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Douglas E. Cooper, an employee of the DEP, testified that his department had assisted in the adoption of the Somers regulations, and that it was his, as well as the department\u2019s, opinion that those regulations did comply with the IWWA, even though the IWWA did not set forth any specific set-back requirements for buildings or septic systems. Cooper also stated that the set-back requirement was adopted to avoid pollution of wetlands and watercourses, although he conceded that \u201cthere is nothing magic about the 150 foot set back.\u201d Cooper regards wetlands as a \u201cfragile national resource,\u201d and noted that many towns had adopted setback requirements after this court\u2019s decision in <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 441 A.2d 30 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Cooper also testified that he had witnessed many septic systems that had failed, even though they had been adequately designed for the use for which they had been intended. He stated that problems could result from a variety of causes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that, in his opinion, one-half</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of all septic systems would fail within twenty years. He said that a town relying on ground water supplies had a significant interest in protecting the quality of the water in those sources, and concluded that the restrictions contained in \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations were reasonable, on the basis of his experience at the DEP as well as his observations of problems at the local level.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Steven R. Jacobs, the sanitarian of the town of Somers, testified that he was concerned with the quality of the town\u2019s water sources, since only 5 to 10 percent of the town is serviced by public sewer systems. Jacobs stated that there are two major aquifers in the town of Somers capable of rendering an adequate water supply to the town, and that five of the six wells being operated by the Connecticut Water Company draw their water from these aquifers. According to Jacobs, 20 percent of the town\u2019s 9500 residents are serviced by the water company, while the remainder rely upon private wells. Jacobs stated that about forty septic systems are repaired in Somers each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Finally, Simon Lipton, a resident of Somers for over seventy years and chairman of the commission, testified that failed septic systems had been a problem in Somers for many years. Lipton stated that the soil in two areas of the town had a clay base and could not, therefore, handle any sewage runoff from failed sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tic systems. Lipton testified that these areas of the town were heavily populated and that it had become necessary to install small disposal facilities, since sewage from failed septic systems had run onto lawns, into the streets and then into drainage pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">After reviewing this evidence, the trial court concluded, in its memorandum of decision, that the issue before it was whether the regulation\u2019s prohibitions were \u201crationally related to the protection of the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.\u201d <em>See Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>212 Conn. 570, 583, 563 A.2d 285 (1989). Noting that the prohibition of certain activities, by means of zoning regulations, had been upheld by courts of this state, the trial court ruled that, in light of the evidence presented, there was a rational basis for the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations. The court also concluded that the regulation did not go beyond the limits of the relevant enabling legislation, and, therefore, held that the regulation was \u201ca valid exercise of the police power and [was] entirely consistent with the goals and policies contained in the [IWWA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the first case, an administrative appeal from the adoption of \u00a7 6.4, the plaintiffs seek to attack the trial court\u2019s conclusion that they had not been aggrieved by the adoption of that amendment to the Somers regulations because the prohibitions it contains were already to be found in the town\u2019s zoning regulations. The basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that a land owner may, by means of an application for a variance, obtain relief from the prohibitions of the applicable zoning regulations under special circumstances, but, as they maintain, may not \u201cobtain similar relief from [\u00a7] 6.4 of the inland wetlands regulation.\u201d We have no need to address this claim, however, because the issues under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>lying the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal will be rendered moot by our resolution of the appeal in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In the first case, the plaintiffs challenged the validity of \u00a7 6.4 on grounds that were, with one exception, virtually identical to those on which they relied in the second case, in which they sought a declaratory judgment that the regulation was invalid. The sole exception was the allegation, in the complaint in the first case, that the commission\u2019s adoption of \u00a7 6.4 was unlawful because it had \u201c[voted] to amend, in its entirety, the Somers Inland Wetlands Regulations without stating on the record at the meeting during which the vote was taken the reasons for the particular changes.\u201d The plaintiffs conceded, during oral argument, that this claim was neither briefed nor presented to the trial court and was, therefore, abandoned before that court. See <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 17 n.4, 523 A.2d 467 (1987). They concede further that the remaining grounds on which they sought to challenge the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 will necessarily be decided by our resolution of the issues in the second case. The plaintiffs\u2019 concessions are amply supported by the record and, therefore, the appeal in the first case must be dismissed as moot. See <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Palten, </em>214 Conn. 195, 202 n.1, 571 A.2d 97 (1990) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In their appeal in the second case, the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations is invalid because: (1) it exceeds the scope of the relevant enabling legislation, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201cnecessary\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to effectuate the purpose of the IWWA, \u201cbecause the regulated activities which are prohibited . . . may or may not have a detrimental impact on . . . wetland areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">At the outset, it is appropriate to note the reasons set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 for the enactment of the IWWA. The legislature has found that \u201c[t]he inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed\u201d and that \u201c[t]he preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and Safety of the citizens of the state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36. The purposes of the act, therefore, are, inter alia, to \u201cprotect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority .. . and protecting the state\u2019s potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of . . . pollution ... by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In order to carry out these objectives, the legislature has required each municipality in this state either to \u201cestablish an inland wetlands agency or authorize an existing board or commission to carry out the provisions of [the IWWA].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c). Each municipality is expressly authorized through its designated agency to adopt regulations that \u201care necessary to protect the wetlands and watercourses within its territorial limits\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c); provided that any regulations adopted are \u201cin conformity with the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to section 22a-39<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c). \u201cAs we stated in <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 541, \u2018[i]t is this broad statutory mandate authorizing regulations on both the state and local levels, with specific legislative findings and declaration of policy, that serves as the setting in which we evaluate the claims of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 560, 552 A.2d 796 (1989). \u201cIn doing so, we are mindful that the statutory scheme of this legislation envisages its adaptation to infinitely variable conditions for the effectuation of the purposes of these statutes.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal claim in the second case is that \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations is invalid because it is not in \u201cconformity\u201d with the statutory scheme set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>forth by the legislature in the IWWA. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 6.4 conflicts with the IWWA because regulated activities that might be permitted under the IWWA, after approval of a permit application by the relevant governing agency, are absolutely prohibited by \u00a7 6.4. Having concluded in <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 542, that the IWWA authorizes local regulation of activities beyond the actual boundaries of a wetland or watercourse that may be adversely affected by such activities, we must now decide the extent of such regulatory authority with respect to future developments of tracts of land near wetlands and watercourses. More precisely, the question is whether the authority of an agency to regulate activities on land outside the boundaries of a wetland or watercourse may be exercised with respect to new subdivisions by creating a uniform buffer zone rather than by imposing such a condition as each separate application for agency approval is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The IWWA provides that \u201cno regulated activity shall be conducted upon any inland wetland and watercourse without a permit.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c). \u201c \u2018Regulated activity\u2019 means any operation within or use of a wetland or watercourse involving removal or deposition of material, or any obstruction, construction, alteration or pollution, of such wetlands or watercourses, but shall not include the specified activities in section 22a-40.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-38 (13). \u201cAny person proposing to conduct or cause to be conducted a regulated activity upon an inland wetland and water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>course shall file an application with the inland wetlands agency of the town or towns wherein the wetland in question is located.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c). Finally, \u201c[i]n granting, denying or limiting any permit for a regulated activity the inland wetlands agency shall consider the factors set forth in section 22a-41, and such agency shall state upon the record the reason for its decision.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In support of their claim that the regulation conflicts with the statute, the plaintiffs rely on the language of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (e), which states in part: \u201cAny ordinances or regulations [adopted by a municipality or district] shall be for the purpose of effectuating the purposes of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, and, a municipality or district, in acting upon ordinances and regulations <em>shall give due consideration to the standards set forth in section 22a-41.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) On the basis of this language, the plaintiffs argue that the standards of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 must be applied on a case-by-case basis and that \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations, which makes no provision for variations of its requirements through the permit process, is invalid because it conflicts with the proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>dures contemplated by the IWWA. Those procedures include \u00a7 22a-41 (a), which requires that \u201c[i]n carrying out the purposes and policies of [the IWWA] . . . the commissioner shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances . . . . \u201d This broad inquiry must include, but is not limited to, six factors related to the consequences, alternatives to and suitability or unsuitability of any proposed activity. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41; see footnote 13, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Aaron, </em>we stated that an appropriate test \u201cused to determine whether a conflict exists [between a local ordinance and a statute] is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids, or prohibits that which the statute authorizes; if so, there is a conflict. If, however, both the statute and the ordinance are prohibitory and the only difference is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition than the statute, but not counter to the prohibition in the statute, and the ordinance does not attempt to authorize that which the legislature has forbidden, or forbid that which the legislature has expressly authorized, there is no conflict.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 544. This test is founded upon the principle that \u201c[a] local ordinance, enacted pursuant to the police power, is not necessarily inconsistent with a state law on the same subject just because the ordinance provides higher standards than the statute.\u201d Id., 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We perceive no conflict between \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations and the IWWA. First, the IWWA specifically authorizes the rejection of permit applications for conducting regulated activities, so long as the evaluation process set forth in \u00a7 22a-41 is complied with. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d). Thus, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the IWWA does not \u201cexpressly authorize\u201d that which is prohibited by \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations. Second, \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>does not prohibit all activity in areas adjacent to wetlands or watercourses, the commission having chosen, instead, to limit the scope of \u00a7 6.4 to activities that pose a significant pollution threat to those areas. Other regulated activities, therefore, might be allowed under \u00a7 6.4, provided that the permit application is approved by the commission. Finally, we have previously stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he power to regulate . . . entails a certain degree of prohibition\u2019 <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 20; and have recognized that prohibitions of certain activities within municipalities have been upheld when \u201cthe prohibitions were rationally related to the protection of the municipalities\u2019 public safety, health and general welfare.\u201d <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 583, and cases cited therein. In light of these considerations, \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations can be viewed as a legislative determination that, regardless of the circumstances present in each case, no permits will be issued for the specified activities, since they pose an unacceptable hazard to the wetlands or watercourses within the town of Somers. In this regard, the remaining issue before us is not whether the standards of \u00a7 22a-41 must be utilized by municipal authorities on a case-by-case basis for the evaluation of proposed activities adjacent to a wetland or watercourse, but whether the commission considered and applied the statutory standards when it adopted \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The plaintiffs have not, however, claimed before this court or the trial court that the commission failed to consider the standards contained in \u00a7 22a-41 prior to the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>absence of any evidence to the contrary, we will presume that the commission fulfilled, when it adopted the regulation, its statutory obligations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-41 and 22a-42 (e). See <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 105, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990). Even if we were to entertain such a claim at this late stage of the proceedings, we note that the trial court had before it evidence regarding why the commission chose, when enacting \u00a7 6.4, to adopt a blanket prohibition rather than a process of permit application subject to review and approval or denial. This decision was based in large part on: (1) the poor drainage capability of the soil in Somers; (2) past sewage drainage problems within the town; (3) the town\u2019s reliance on local aquifers for potable water supplies; and (4) the potential pollution hazard posed to the aquifers by the drainage of sewage. Further, the trial court was also furnished a copy of a letter which indicated that the commissioner of the DEP had found the proposed Somers regulations to be in \u201cconformance\u201d with both the IWWA and the applicable regulations enacted by that department. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-39-ll.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, even if this issue had been presented to the trial court, there was evidence before it from which it could have concluded that the factors specified by \u00a7 22a-41 were adequately taken into account prior to the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Under all of these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations was not in conflict with the IWWA or the regulations adopted by the commissioner of DEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiffs also claim that \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations is invalid because it is not \u201cnecessary to protect the wetlands and watercourses within [the] territorial limits\u201d of the town of Somers and thus does not comply with that criterion for regulations of an inland wetlands agency. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c). We conclude that the plaintiffs have not met the significant burden facing them in making such a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201c[W]hen a statute authorizes a municipality to regulate a certain activity, a prohibition of that activity will be valid if it is rationally related to the protection of the community\u2019s public health, safety and general welfare.\u201d <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 583. In regard to the \u201cnecessary\u201d requirement of \u00a7 22a-42 (c) for wetland regulations, we have previously stated that \u201c \u2018necessary\u2019 should not be interpreted as meaning indispensable, but rather, as that which is reasonably designed to effectuate the stated purposes of the wetlands statutes.\u201d <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 561. Although we have recognized that the policy decision to protect wetlands and watercourses must be balanced against the productive use of privately owned land; <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 719, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989); we have also indicated that this balancing process is more appropriately conducted in a legislative rather than a judicial setting. Thus, \u201c[a]n agency which has the authority to enact regulations is vested with a large measure of discretion, and the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>showing that the agency has acted improperly rests upon the one who asserts it.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 537; see <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 23. \u201cEvery intendment is to be made in favor of the validity of the ordinance, and it is the duty of the court to sustain the ordinance unless its invalidity is established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Connecticut Theatrical Corporation </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>147 Conn. 546, 553, 163 A.2d 548 (1960); <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra; <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On the basis of the evidence presented to it, the trial court concluded: \u201cThe soil in Somers was basically clay in substance providing very poor drainage; the Town had been faced with severe sewage drainage problems for years; the Town\u2019s basic water supply consisted of two large [aquifers] of water; 80% of the homes depended on well water; and the private water company serves five (5) of its six wells by drawing from the [aquifers].\u201d The court held, therefore, that \u201cthe Somers regulation does have a rational basis.\u201d We conclude that the court was justified in reaching its conclusion, since the adoption of \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations was \u201creasonably designed to protect the town\u2019s wetlands and watercourses.\u201d <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 561. The commission could reasonably have concluded that, regardless of whether a specific prohibited activity may or may not adversely affect the town\u2019s wetlands, the risk of pollution outweighed in all instances the benefits to be gained by allowing case-by-case analysis of each application for a regulated use.

I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that there is \u201cno conflict between \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers [Conservation Commission] regulations and the [Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act. (IWWA)].\u201d I submit that \u00a7 6.4 conflicts with the statutory mandate set out in the IWWA that requires a case-by-case balancing of the tension that exists between society\u2019s determination to protect its ecologically fragile wetlands and watercourses and the private landowner\u2019s inalienable right to make productive use of his land. The Somers regulation, by absolutely barring certain activities, subverts the expressly articulated legislative mandate to balance the competing interests involved through a permitting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Section 6.4 establishes mandatory separation distances outside of a wetlands area that must exist between the wetlands area itself, and either: (a) any portion of a septic system; or (b) a structure as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">A. Septic System</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Wetland or Watercourse 100'</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">B. Building Sheltering Animals</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Wetland or Watercourse 150'</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">C. All Other Buildings</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Wetland or Watercourse 50'</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Section 6.4 establishes these minimum separation distances irrespective of the effect of the proposed septic system or structure on a particular wetland area. There are no mandatory separation distances in either the IWWA, the Department of Environmental Protection regulations dealing with the IWWA, or the state Model Inland Wetlands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 provides that the purpose of the IWWA is to provide \u201can orderly process to <em>balance </em>the need for the economic growth of the state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.\u201d (Emphasis added.) An absolute prohibition against all building within arbitrarily established distances from a wetland or watercourse is scarcely consistent with a legislative mandate \u201cto balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">That the framers of the IWWA envisaged a balancing of these interests on a case-by-case basis is borne out by the fact that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36, 22a-38 (13), 22a-41 and 22a-42a (d) all speak in terms of \u201cregulated activities,\u201d activities that may be approved on a permit basis, and may in fact pollute a given wetland or watercourse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In determining if a regulated activity is to be permitted, local inland wetlands commissions are required to consider the specific criteria set forth in \u00a7 22a-41.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These include a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of \u201c[t]he suitability or unsuitability of such activity to the area for which it is proposed,\u201d \u201cinterference with . . . the reasonable use of property\u201d and, in the event of the issuance of a permit, a finding \u201cthat a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist.\u201d Such language that seems to me to call for individualized consideration of each \u201carea,\u201d is hardly consistent with a regulation that in all events prohibits certain activities throughout an entire town.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Further, a local regulation that absolutely prohibits certain \u201cregulated activities\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>outside </em>of a wetland or watercourse is inconsistent with a statutory protocol that establishes a permit process to allow \u201cregulated activities\u201d <em>within </em>a wetland or watercourse. It seems to me totally illogical that \u00a7 6.1 of the Somers regulations authorizes regulated activities within a wetland or watercourse upon receipt of a permit to do so<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u00a7 6.4 contains a blanket prohibition against what would otherwise be a \u201cregulated activity\u201d outside of a wetland or watercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cA test frequently used to determine whether a [local ordinance is inconsistent with a state statute] is whether the ordinance . . . prohibits that which the statute authorizes; if so, there is a conflict.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 544, 441 A.2d 30 (1981). The IWWA specifically allows an individual to conduct regulated activities either in or near a wetlands area upon issuance of a permit. By not providing for the permit process and by absolutely forbidding certain regulated activities within prescribed distances from a wetland, \u00a7 6.4 prohibits that which the statute has expressly authorized, i.e., the right to apply for a permit to conduct regulated activities within or near a wetland. Since \u00a7 6.4 of the Somers regulations clearly exceeds the scope of its enabling legislation, I submit that the enactment is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-38 (13) provides: \u201c \u2018Regulated activity\u2019 means any operation within or use of a wetland or watercourse involving removal or deposition of material, or any obstruction, construction, alteration or pollution, of such wetlands or watercourses, but shall not include the specified activities in section 22a-40.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 provides: \u201cfactors for consideration of COMMISSIONER.
