Presnick, an attorney at law, from a judgment of the Superior Court that suspended him from the practice of law for two years. The principal issues are: (1) whether grievance panels, reviewing committees and the statewide grievance committee function as an unconstitutionally created court in violation of article fifth, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut constitution; (2) whether the defendant was denied due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 10 of the Connecticut constitution; (3) whether clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>evidence is the appropriate standard of proof in attorney disciplinary proceedings; (4) whether the defendant could be suspended from the practice of law absent a finding that he possessed a corrupt motive or evil intent; (5) whether, on remand, the trial court abused its discretion or engaged injudicial vindictiveness when it suspended the defendant from the practice of law for two years, where the term of suspension imposed upon the defendant in the first presentment proceeding was ninety days; (6) whether the evidence supported a finding that the defendant misappropriated his client\u2019s funds; and (7) whether the trial court should have dismissed the presentment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Examination of the record discloses that on August 11, 1987, the plaintiff filed a presentment of attorney misconduct against the defendant alleging that he had committed two acts of misconduct involving his character, integrity and professional standing and conduct. On September 8, 1987, the trial court, <em>Downey, J., </em>conducted an evidentiary hearing concerning these allegations. The trial court concluded that the defendant had violated the Code of Professional Responsibility<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (code) as to both allegations of misconduct and rendered judgment suspending the defendant from the practice of law for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 475, 559 A.2d 227 (1989), the Appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial court and ordered a new trial on the ground that the proper standard of proof to use in determining whether an attorney had violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the code is the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence standard, rather than the \u201cfair preponderance\u201d standard used by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Upon remand, following a second hearing, the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>concluded that, as to the first allegation of misconduct, the defendant had violated DR 1-102 (A) (1) and (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and DR 9-102 (A) and (B) of the code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment suspending the defendant from the practice of law for two years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>As to the second allegation of misconduct, the trial court concluded that the defendant had violated DR 2-101 (A) through (D) of the code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment reprimanding the defendant and ordered the return of a $75 legal fee collected on the basis of misleading advertising. The defendant appealed both sanctions to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The majority of the issues raised by the defendant have been disposed of in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>215 Conn. 162, 575 A.2d 210 (1990) <em>(Presnick I). </em>The issues remaining are whether: (1) the trial court abused its discretion when it suspended the defendant for two years when the term of suspension imposed upon the defendant in the first presentment proceeding was ninety days; (2) imposing the increased period of suspension after the rehearing of a matter that the defendant had successfully appealed con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>stituted judicial vindictiveness in violation of the principles articulated in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 109 S. Ct. 2204, 104 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1989); (3) the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding; and (4) the trial court should have dismissed the presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it suspended him for two years. In the context of attorney disciplinary proceedings, we have observed that \u201c[t]he trial court upon such a complaint is not engaged in the trial of an ordinary action but is investigating the conduct of an officer of the court to the end that the courts and the public may be protected from his misconduct or unfitness. \u2018Into its determination there naturally and necessarily enters a large measure of judicial discretion.\u2019 It \u2018is not an absolute, but a reasonable\u2019 discretion which the court exercises.\u201d <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Broder, </em>112 Conn. 263, 266, 152 A. 292 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cThe fact that the court exercises a large measure of discretion and is in a position to most intelligently exercise it, furnishes no obstacle to a review to ascertain not only whether a reasonable discretion was used, but also whether the proceedings were regular and fair. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u201cIt does not follow, however, that the review which the court will make is one which will be permitted to take as wide a range, or assume the same character, as where the judicial action sought to be reviewed concerns the rights of parties as between themselves. . . . [A]n attorney whose fitness is challenged before the authority to which he owes and is responsible for the privileges he enjoys, has a right to an opportunity to be heard, a fair and dispassionate investigation, and a reasonable exercise of the judicial discretion; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>his relation to the tribunal, and the character and purpose of the inquiry, are such, that unless it clearly appears that his rights have in some substantial way been denied him, the action of the court will not be set aside upon review.\u201d <em>In re Durant, </em>80 Conn. 140, 149-50, 67 A. 497 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The trial court found that the defendant had received ten child support payments totaling $730 on behalf of his client. When queried by the client, he specifically told her that he had not received any support payments from her former husband. He never disclosed that he had received the payments and applied them toward his outstanding legal charges. On appeal, the defendant has not claimed that any of the trial court\u2019s predicate findings are unsupported by the evidence nor does our examination of the record disclose this to be the case. In light of such conduct, it does not \u201cclearly appear that [the defendant\u2019s] rights have in some substantial way been denied him\u201d and we find, therefore, no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court engaged injudicial vindictiveness when, upon remand and following a rehearing of the identical allegations, it imposed a two year suspension that far exceeded the ninety day suspension imposed in the first proceeding. The gravamen of such a claim is that the trial court had retaliatory motives when it imposed the two year suspension and was, in effect, punishing the defendant for having successfully challenged his first suspension on appeal. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 725-26, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[d]ue process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cIn order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Although the United States Supreme Court has subsequently reexamined and qualified the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is sufficient for present purposes to observe that the trial court, in imposing the harsher sanction, did exactly what <em>Pearce </em>required. The trial court stated: \u201cEffective July 28,1989 [18 months after the first sanction was imposed], respondent was suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. ... In said proceeding, the court found respondent in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Canon 5 and DR 5-104 (A) and DR 1-102 (A) (4). Respondent has now been found to have, for the second time, violated DR 1-102 (A) (4) by engaging in conduct which is deceitful. Accordingly . . . respondent is suspended from the practice of law for the period of two years.\u201d Thus it is clear that the harsher sanction was not motivated by vindictiveness but rather by the fact that the respondent had, in the interim, been found for a second time to have \u201cengag[ed] in conduct [that was] deceitful.\u201d We conclude that the claim of judicial vindictiveness is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We have examined the defendant\u2019s remaining claims and conclude that the factual findings placed in issue are supported by clear and convincing evidence and that the'trial court correctly applied the applicable law to the facts so found.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> The Code of Professional Responsibility applies to attorney conduct that occurred, as in this case, before October 1, 1986, at which time it was replaced by the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> The Code of Professional Responsibility provides in part: \u201cDR 1-102 misconduct.
