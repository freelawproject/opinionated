Because at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement \u00a7 51-287 did not require him to choose between retaining his benefits or accepting a judgeship, the court held that the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e), enacted after the plaintiff\u2019s retirement but previous to his appointment, constituted the retrospective imposition of a \u201cnew obligation\u201d in violation of \u00a7 55-3. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred the case to ourselves. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The facts are undisputed. In 1962, the plaintiff was appointed a per diem assistant state\u2019s attorney and, in 1963, was appointed an assistant state\u2019s attorney for Fairfield county. In 1969, the plaintiff was appointed state\u2019s attorney for that county and thereafter, in 1973, was appointed Connecticut\u2019s chief state\u2019s attorney. From 1962 until his retirement in 1978, the plaintiff contributed 5 percent of his salary to SARF as statutorily mandated. General Statutes \u00a7 51-278 (b) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SARF is administered and funded separately from the state employees retirement fund (SERF).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In October, 1978, the plaintiff retired and began receiving an actuarially reduced retirement income, having satisfied the statutory requirements of at least ten years of creditable service. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of his retirement, \u00a7 51-287 (e) was not a part of SARF and, as distinguished from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>SERF, SARF contained no provision for the suspension of pension rights upon a retiree\u2019s reemployment with the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In 1985, the legislature enacted No. 85-517, \u00a7 4, of the 1985 Public Acts, which provided: \u201cAny such [state\u2019s] attorney who is retired under this section and who is appointed a judge shall not receive a retirement salary pursuant to this section during the period such retired attorney serves as a judge.\u201d The 1985 public act is now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 (e). In July, 1987, the plaintiff was sworn in as a Superior Court judge, and continued to collect his SARF pension until November, 1988. At that time, the commission, acting pursuant to \u00a7 51-287 (e), suspended the plaintiff\u2019s retirement income and demanded repayment of $26,049.18, the amount paid to the plaintiff after his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The plaintiff sought a declaratory ruling from the commission claiming that his pension income from SARF became a vested contractual or statutory right upon his retirement in 1978, and, therefore, that either \u00a7 55-3 or the impairment of contracts clause of article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>one, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of the United States<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibited the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) to him. After a fact-finding hearing, the commission issued a declaratory ruling that, although the plaintiff had acquired statutory rights in SARF, \u00a7 51-287 (e) operated to suspend those rights during the time of the plaintiffs appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) to him (1) constituted an impermissible retroactive application of the statute, and (2) impaired vested contractual or statutory rights in his pension in violation of the federal constitution\u2019s contract clause. See footnote 6, supra. The trial court reversed the decision of the commission, concluding that the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) to the plaintiff operated as an impermissible retroactive application of that statute. In view of that conclusion, the court did not address the issue of whether \u00a7 51-287 (e) unconstitutionally impaired the vested rights of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In enacting \u00a7 51-287 (e), the legislature intended to prevent \u201cdouble-dipping,\u201d the collection by one person of a pension and a salary, both paid by the state. The parties agree that the legislature intended this statute to apply prospectively only.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They disagree, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>over whether the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) to the plaintiff constitutes a retrospective application. The commission claims that the application of the statute to the plaintiff was prospective only, because it was the appointment to a judgeship seventeen months after the statute was enacted, and not the retirement and receipt of retirement income seven years prior to the enactment, that triggered the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, according to the commission, no new obligation was being placed upon the plaintiff in violation of \u00a7 55-3. The plaintiff claims that because he possessed vested statutory or contractual rights in his pension on retirement, the application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) to him after his retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ment would impose a \u201cnew obligation\u201d in violation of \u00a7 55-3, because it would require him to choose between maintaining his pension or accepting the judgeship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 51-287 (e) must be interpreted narrowly so as not to apply to the plaintiff, because to do otherwise would impose a \u201cnew obligation\u201d on him in violation of \u00a7 55-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In describing the application of new legislation to preexisting transactions, \u00a7 55-3 provides that \u201c[n]o provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have a retrospective effect.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018obligations\u2019 referred to in the statute are those of substantive law\u201d; <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>178 Conn. 180, 186, 423 A.2d 875 (1979); and \u201c [legislation which limits or increases statutory liability has generally been held to be substantive in nature.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>158 Conn. 452, 457, 262 A.2d 174 (1969). \u201c[W]e have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only.\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467, 556 A.2d 145 (1989); <em>Westport </em>v. <em>State, </em>204 Conn. 212, 219, 527 A.2d 1177 (1987). \u201cThe legislature only rebuts this presumption when it \u2018clearly and unequivocally\u2019 expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra, 468; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 741, 517 A.2d 610 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">It is undisputed that prior to the enactment of \u00a7 51-287 (e), the plaintiff would have been entitled to collect both his retirement income and a salary upon being appointed a judge. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 51-287; Opinion of the Attorney General, Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ary 30, 1984 (state\u2019s attorney retired under SARF entitled to collect pension and to collect salary once appointed as a judge). The commission does not contend otherwise. The dispositive fact is not that the plaintiff was appointed as a judge seventeen months after that enactment, but that seven years earlier, when he had retired as chief state\u2019s attorney, he was statutorily entitled to receive a pension. See footnote 8, supra. He then began receiving his pension, and it is the provisions of the plan at that time that are controlling on him. The application of \u00a7 51-287 (e) would impose upon the plaintiff a new obligation, that of choosing between the continuing receipt of his pension benefits or accepting a judgeship, an obligation \u201cto which he was not subject prior to its passage.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 457. The plaintiff\u2019s substantive right to continue to receive his pension regardless of his future employment would be implicated by the imposition of this new obligation. Such an implication would violate the presumed legislative intent embodied in \u00a7 55-3, unless the legislature \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d indicated that the statute was to apply retrospectively. <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra. We can find no such clear and unequivocal indication that the legislature intended \u00a7 51-287 (e) to apply to persons already collecting SARF retirement benefits. Neither the statute\u2019s language nor its legislative history; see footnote 7, supra; provides that clarity or lack of equivocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The commission argues that two cases, <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra, 188, and <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Nastri, </em>125 Conn. 144, 148, 3 A.2d 839 (1939), nevertheless support its claim that the statute is being applied prospectively to the plaintiff. These cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Nastri, </em>supra, the court addressed whether a statute allowing a guest passenger to recover for personal injuries where the driver was a negligent operator, as opposed to a heedless or reckless operator, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>be applied to a driver who had negligently injured a party prior to the statute\u2019s passage. The court determined that the defendant\u2019s legal exemption from a demand of another was as much of a vested property interest as was the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. Id., 148. The court also held that to allow the plaintiff a cause of action against the defendant for mere negligence, when at the time of the accident the defendant could be held liable only for heedless or reckless conduct, constituted the imposition of \u201can unexpected liability that if known might have caused those concerned to avoid it\u201d; id.; an impermissible result because the legislature did not clearly provide for such a retroactive interpretation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">To support its claim that \u00a7 51-287 (e) is not being applied retrospectively to the plaintiff, the commission relies upon the court\u2019s reference to \u201can unexpected liability\u201d that could have been avoided. The commission asserts that if \u00a7 51-287 (e) were in effect at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement, he could not have taken any other action to avoid its application, and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot demonstrate \u201can unexpected liability.\u201d This argument, however, is based upon a selective reading of <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Nastri, </em>supra. In that case the court also stated that \u201c \u2018[l]aws which create new obligations . . . because of past transactions, have been universally reprobated ....\u2019\u201d Id., 148. The court in <em>Massa </em>was simply applying to those particular facts the test of determining retroactivity of statutes by looking for an \u201cunexpected liability\u201d that could have been avoided. In this case, however, the statute would be applied retrospectively to the plaintiff because he would be required to choose between his pension or his salary as a judge, an obligation to which he was not subject prior to the passage of \u00a7 51-287 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The commission also relies upon <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra. That case involved an amendment to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 45-274 allowing illegitimate children to inherit from their natural father if paternity was adjudicated by a court or if the father acknowledged paternity in writing under oath, thereby expanding prior law, which prohibited illegitimate children from inheriting from the father unless the father later married the mother. Id., 184. The court, relying on the general rule that laws providing for future descent of property are prospective; id., 187; held that the amendment was not retrospective because it \u201crelated to future inheritances by illegitimate children and it conferred or took away no present right.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The commission argues that, like the amendment to \u00a7 45-274 in <em>Nagle, </em>the enactment of \u00a7 51-287 (e) in this case took away no present right from the plaintiff and related only to the effect on the plaintiffs retirement benefits by a future judicial appointment. The commission also attempts to analogize the plaintiff in this case to hypothetical <em>legitimate </em>children in <em>Nagle, </em>arguing that the plaintiff, like those children, lost no present right to future benefits by the enactment of \u00a7 51-287 (e). The commission\u2019s reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Unlike the statutory amendment in <em>Nagle, </em>\u00a7 51-287 (e) did take \u00e1way a right that the plaintiff possessed\u2014a right to continue to receive his pension benefits regardless of his future employment. It proves too much to say, as the commission\u2019s argument suggests, that a statute suspending pension benefits that one is already receiving has no retrospective effect simply because that suspension will occur upon the happening of a future event. It takes little imagination to recognize that such a rule would set such benefits down a slippery slope that would undermine legitimate and settled expectations. Our case law does not go that far, and we decline to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 (e) provides: \u201cAny such attorney who is retired under this section and who is appointed a judge shall not receive a retirement salary pursuant to this section during the period such retired attorney serves as a judge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 55-3 provides: \u201climitation of effect of certain acts.

All other persons appointed under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 66.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> At the time of the plaintiffs retirement, General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 provided: \u201cIf any such attorney resigns or is removed from office before his retirement under this section, he shall be entitled to the return of all contributions made by him under section 51-278, without interest thereon, except that, if such attorney has completed at least ten years of service creditable under this section, he may, at his option, elect instead to receive a retirement income on a reduced actuarial basis, as determined by the comptroller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">That provision was later labeled \u00a7 51-287 (c) by Public Acts 1982, No. 82-248, \u00a7 143.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> SERF has contained a provision since 1965 preventing its participants who have retired from a state position and who are receiving a pension from collecting both a salary and pension benefits upon securing another state position. See No. 504 of the 1965 Public Acts, codified as General Statutes \u00a7 5-164a (c). General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-164a (c) provides: \u201cNo member reemployed under this section or under section 5-164 or elected to serve in the general assembly or otherwise reentering state service shall receive a retirement income during his reemployment or other state service except (1) if his services as an employee are rendered for not more than ninety working days in any one calendar year, provided that any member reemployed for a period of more than ninety working days in one calendar year shall reimburse the state retirement fund for retirement income payments received during such ninety working days; or (2) if his services are as a member of the general assembly, his retirement income payments shall not be suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Until the enactment of No. 85-517, \u00a7 4, of the 1985 Public Acts, no com- \u2022 parable provision existed in SARF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 10, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> The legislative history behind No. 85-517, \u00a7 4, of the 1985 Public Acts provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201cSenator [Thomas F.] Upson: Does this apply to people who are already in the system, or is this a prospective section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201cSenator Richard Johnson: My feeling is that this section is a prospective one, that is, it applies to those who will be appointed.\u201d 28 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1985 Sess., pp. 5019-20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">While this exchange indicates that the legislature intended the statute to apply prospectively, that is, to those appointed as judges in the future, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>it sheds little light on whether those people \u201calready in the system\u201d described individuals who were still employed as state\u2019s attorneys and who had not yet become eligible for a pension, individuals who were presently receiving pension benefits under the retirement plan, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> The commission also raised an entirely new claim at oral argument in this court, namely, that pursuant to <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 416, 488 A.2d 803 (1985), the plaintiff did not possess constitutionally protected vested rights to the pension, and, therefore, that the application of General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 (e) was not retrospective. This claim was an attempt to revive on appeal the issue that the trial court did not decide, namely, whether the plaintiff had vested contractual rights that were constitutionally protected. Nonetheless, in its brief the commission refers to \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s rights <em>vested </em>in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Retirement Fund.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the commission failed to brief the issue of vested rights in this court, however, we consider this claim abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 178, 448 A.2d 837 (1982); <em>Pastir </em>v. <em>Bielski, </em>174 Conn. 193, 384 A.2d 367 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In any event, it is difficult to see how <em>Pineman </em>would help the commission, since under <em>Pineman </em>state \u201cemployees have <em>statutory </em>rights to retirement benefits once they satisfy the eligibility requirements of the [retirement] act by becoming eligible to receive benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>supra, 416. Thus, the plaintiff, whom the court found to have satisfied those requirements and who was <em>receiving </em>pension benefits, obviously had acquired statutory rights to his pension. The commission does not claim that the state may retrospectively diminish statutory pension benefits that a former state employee is collecting simply because they are statutory, rather than contractual, in nature. Indeed, the entire thrust of the commission\u2019s brief is that there is no retroactivity effected by \u00a7 51-287 (e), not that the issue of retroactivity vel non depends on the source of the plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Although the plaintiff also argued in the trial court that the application to him of General Statutes \u00a7 51-287 (e) would violate article one, \u00a7 10, of the United States constitution, in light of the trial court\u2019s decision, he has not reasserted that claim in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
