J.</author>\n<p id=\"aih-dedup-0\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether a convicted felon who has permission to serve his sentence in a private home may be found guilty of the crime of escape under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a single failure to report to his designated supervising officer. In response to the state\u2019s filing of an information charging the defendant Richard Lubus with escape, for such failure to report, he filed a motion to dismiss the information that challenged the applicability and the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2). When the trial court denied the motion, he entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere, pursuant to General Statutes 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> preserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling. After an appropriate canvass, the court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea and imposed a one year sentence consecutive to the defendant\u2019s prior sentence. We transferred the defendant\u2019s subsequent appeal to the Appellate Court to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and now reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The facts are undisputed. In the case underlying the defendant\u2019s original sentence, he pleaded guilty to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>charge of possession of narcotics with the intent to sell, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a). This conviction resulted in a sentence of five years imprisonment, suspended after two years, with three years probation. His probation required the defendant to undergo drug screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The commissioner of correction, exercising his authority under General Statutes \u00a7 18-100 (e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> immediately prepared to transfer the defendant to a \u201ccommunity residence\u201d program that permitted him to live in his own home. As part of the transfer process, the defendant signed a Community Residence Agreement expressly providing that his failure to report as scheduled to his supervising officer, Juan Castillo, would be considered an \u201cescape\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53a-169. The defendant entered the \u201ccommunity residence\u201d program and was placed under parole supervision on March 24, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Although directed to report to Castillo on June 27, 1989, the defendant failed to do so. After a status conference with a parole supervisor, Castillo applied for an arrest warrant on August 15, 1989, that led to the initiation of the present proceedings. The record is silent about what contact, if any, the defendant had with Castillo between late June and mid-August.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss because his conduct does not constitute an \u201cescape\u201d within the terms of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) impose criminal sanctions for \u201cescapes from . . . [a] community residence to which [a defendant has been] transferred pursuant to subsection (e) of section 18-100. . . . \u201d We have not previously had the occasion to address the narrow issue before us, i.e., whether a single failure to report to a supervising officer may be punished as an \u201c[escape] from . . . [a] community residence.\u201d As a general proposition, we recently noted by way of dictum in <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>213 Conn. 38, 48, 566 A.2d 663 (1989), that, for an individual on home release, \u201cabsconding [from supervision] constitutes a new crime, escape, that may lead to an added prison term. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).\u201d That observation arose, however, in the context of our determination in <em>Asherman </em>that an individual on home release does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest to resist official inquiry into his psychological status. Id., 47-49. Because our decision in <em>Asherman </em>did not purport to define what conduct would constitute absconding, it provides no answer to the issue posed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Interpretation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) must begin with the proposition that penal statutes \u201care to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>Nowak </em>v. <em>Nowak, </em>175 Conn. 112, 125, 394 A.2d 716 (1978); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 579, 556 A.2d 584 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 430, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). This principle of strict construction informs the general rule of statutory interpretation that \u201c \u2018in the interpretation of statutes, the intent of the legislature is to be found not in what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>meant to say, but in what it did say.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 150, quoting <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 526, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979). \u201c \u2018If the words are clear and unambiguous, \u201cit is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature\u201d . . . and we need inquire no further.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mat-tioli, </em>supra, 576. The rule that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>supra, 579; also guides our interpretive inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In this case, neither the defendant nor the state argues that the word \u201cescape\u201d in 53a-169 (a) (2) is unclear or ambiguous, nor does the fact that opposing counsel contend for different meanings support such a characterization. See <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 198, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981). Furthermore, the text of the statute nowhere indicates that the legislature intended to assign to the word anything other than its ordinary meaning. Accordingly, in the absence of other statutory guidance, we may appropriately look to the meaning of the word as commonly expressed in the law and in dictionaries. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Our task, then, is to determine whether, strictly construed, the ordinary meaning of the criminal prohibition against \u201cescapes from ... [a] community residence\u201d in \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) encompasses a single failure to report to a supervisor. The paradigmatic example of an \u201cescape\u201d is a prison break. A lawfully incarcerated person who \u201cbreaks out\u201d of his confinement behind steel bars and concrete walls has unquestionably committed an \u201cescape.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) underscores the assumed nexus between escape and custody when it defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cescape\u201d as \u201c[t]he departure or deliverance out of custody of a person who was lawfully imprisoned before he is entitled to his liberty by the process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The New York Penal Code and the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code, upon which our legislature relied when it revised the state penal code in 1969; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1969 Sess., p. 11; both contain \u201cescape\u201d provisions that have custodial overtones. The Court of Appeals of New York, interpreting the escape provisions of its penal code, understood escape to mean \u201c To get away (as by flight or conscious effort): break away, get free or get clear (the prisoner <em>escaped </em>from prison) . . . .\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original; citations omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>56 N.Y.2d 868, 870, 438 N.E.2d 1109, 453 N.Y.S.2d 394 (1982). Under the Model Penal Code, a person commits the crime of \u201cescape\u201d if he \u201cunlawfully removes himself from official detention or fails to return to official detention following [a] temporary leave granted for a specific purpose . . . .\u201dII A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1962) \u00a7 242.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The provisions of \u00a7 53a-169 in their entirety lend further support to the proposition that \u201cescape\u201d in \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) was intended to incorporate misconduct commonly understood as arising out of unauthorized departures from custodial constraints. Section 53a-169 (a) (2) itself criminalizes, in addition to \u201cescape\u201d from \u201cany . . . community residence,\u201d \u201cescape\u201d from \u201cany public or private, nonprofit halfway house, group home or mental health facility.\u201d Section 53a-169 (a) (6) criminalizes \u201cescape\u201d from \u201ca hospital for mental illness.\u201d Section 53a-169 (a) (7) provides that a person is guilty of \u201cescape\u201d if, \u201cwhile under the jurisdiction of the psychiatric security review board, but not confined to a hospital for mental illness, he leaves the state without authorization of the board.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Consistently with the Model Penal Code, the legislature has also defined \u201cescape\u201d to include the failure of a person to return from an authorized furlough; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (4); or from work or education release. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (5). These various subsections of \u00a7 53a-169 represent two decades of legislative redefinition of the crime of \u201cescape\u201d to accommodate the needs of changing rehabilitation practices and prison overcrowding. The unifying overall theme of \u00a7 53a-169 is that an individual will risk punishment for \u201cescape\u201d for an unauthorized departure from, or failure to return to, whatever may be designated as his place of incarceration or confinement. That theme illuminates the meaning of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2). See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 110, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Read in context, \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) simply identifies another environment\u2014a community residence\u2014from which an unauthorized departure, or to which a failure to return, is possible and made culpable. The subsection does not, in this one instance, impose criminal sanctions for an \u201cescape\u201d that has no demonstrated custodial nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In sum, taking into account the applicable principles of statutory construction, we are persuaded that \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) does not penalize as an \u201cescape\u201d a single failure to report to a supervisor. We conclude, rather, that \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) employs the term \u201cescape\u201d to contemplate an unauthorized departure from, or failure to return to, a \u201ccommunity residence.\u201d We need not decide today whether, at some juncture, repeated failures to report as scheduled would reasonably support an inference of present or imminent custodial irregularity and thus evidence a violation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2). A single failure to report cannot, however, reasonably be construed as an unauthorized departure or failure to return. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>On the sparse record of this case, therefore, the defendant\u2019s conviction for violation of \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2) cannot be sustained. We know nothing about the defendant\u2019s actual whereabouts at the time when he was required to report to his supervisor and, in this one instance, failed to do so. The state has neither alleged nor proved that the defendant had absented himself, or threatened to absent himself, from his \u201ccommunity residence\u201d at any relevant time. We hold only that proof of his single failure to report was insufficient to prove him guilty of the crime of \u201cescape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The defendant also argues, secondarily, that the commissioner of correction\u2019s authority under General Statutes \u00a7 18-100 (d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to promulgate rules of conduct for persons transferred to a \u201ccommunity residence\u201d does not include the authority to define \u201cescape\u201d to include conduct that the legislature itself has not criminalized. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">It is fundamental that the power to enact laws resides with the legislature and may not be delegated to an administrative agency. <em>New Milford </em>v. <em>SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 149, 384 A.2d 337 (1977). The legislature may, however, \u201cdelegat[e] to an administrative agency the power to \u2018fill in the details,\u2019 \u201d of a statutory scheme, provided that it establishes an articulable standard for the agency to follow. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Section 18-100 (d) authorizes the commissioner of correction to promulgate \u201csuch regulations as he deems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>necessary for the administration of [\u00a7 18-100]\u201d and to suspend privileges, such as the release to a community residence, of persons who violate those regulations. Relying on this authority, the commissioner promulgated a Community Residence Agreement, which the defendant signed, expressly informing the defendant that failure to report to his supervising officer would subject the defendant to criminal sanctions for \u201cescape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The question before us is whether \u00a7 18-100 (d) authorizes the criminal enforcement of the \u201cescape\u201d sanctions described in the Community Residence Agreement. The state argues that, in treating a failure to report as an \u201cescape\u201d under \u00a7 53a-169, the commissioner was not enacting a new statute, but was merely \u201cclarif[ying] for the defendant precisely what is an \u2018escape\u2019 from his community residence placement.\u201d The defendant correctly notes, however, that enforcing the commissioner\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d in this case would, in effect, include within the ambit of a criminal statute conduct that the statute itself, as we have held above, does not expressly proscribe. Such an enlargement of penal sanctions exceeds the authority of the commissioner. Accordingly, we conclude that although \u00a7 18-100 (d) confers upon the commissioner extensive rule-making authority over persons transferred to a community residence,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it does not authorize the prosecution of a single failure to report to a supervising officer as an \u201cescape\u201d under \u00a7 53a-169 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to set aside the defendant\u2019s conviction and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-169 provides in relevant part: \u201cescape in the first degree: class c felony, (a) A person is guilty of escape in the first degree ...
