Thereafter, the trial court acquitted the defendant of assault in the first degree, but convicted him of murder and attempted murder. He was sentenced to a total effective term of sixty years imprisonment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court should not have admitted into evidence: (1) the testimony of two police officers describing the extrajudicial identification of the defendant from a photographic array by the victim of the attempted murder, Fitzroy Phillip; and (2) the transcript of the probable cause hearing at which Phillip identified the defendant in the courtroom. We conclude that the trial court should have excluded the police officers\u2019 extrajudicial identification testimony, and we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At approximately 1:15 a.m. on September 24, 1988, New Haven police officers were dispatched to investigate several gun shots fired in the Church Street South Project area in New Haven, an area known for its high volume narcotics activity. Upon their arrival, the officers discovered Sterling Williams lying in a pool of blood and suffering from fatal gunshot wounds. Two guns and approximately one thousand dollars in cash were later found on Williams\u2019 person.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On the same morning, at approximately 1:20 a.m., a woman residing at Salem Street, New Haven, awoke to the sound of Fitzroy Phillip pounding on her back door. The woman\u2019s mother called the police, and then allowed Phillip, who was bleeding profusely, to enter her home. Phillip was taken to the hospital and treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>for multiple gunshot wounds to the back, and two gunshot wounds to the leg. At the hospital, in the presence of police officers Gilbert Burton and Joseph Pettola, Phillip identified the defendant from a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">On October 18,1988, the trial court conducted a hearing in probable cause at which Phillip identified the defendant in the courtroom as the person who had shot both him and Williams. Phillip also testified to the following facts. He had ridden in a truck with Williams to the Church Street area at approximately 1 a.m. on September 24, 1988, and Williams had gotten out of the truck to speak with the defendant, who was standing among a group of six or seven black males near an abandoned car. Five minutes later, Phillip had approached the group, and had stood within a few inches of the defendant and Williams. A few minutes later, Phillip had seen the defendant pull out a gun and shoot Williams in the head. The defendant had then shot Phillip in the leg, and as Phillip fled, the defendant had shot him once more in the leg and three times in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Sometime after the probable cause hearing, the state learned that Phillip had left Connecticut, possibly for the Brooklyn, New York area. An attempt by the New York police to locate Phillip proved fruitless. Nonetheless, at trial, the state offered the testimony of Burton and Pettola describing Phillip\u2019s identification of the defendant from the photographic array. The defendant moved to suppress the testimony as hearsay and, in the alternative, on the ground that the unnecessarily suggestive nature of the photographic array had violated his constitutional right to due process. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, ruling that the photographic array was not unnecessarily suggestive and that the police officers\u2019 testimony, although hearsay, was admissible under the exception to the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>say rule for extrajudicial statements of identification, as well as the \u201cresidual\u201d exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The state also sought at trial to introduce the transcript of the probable cause hearing. The defendant promptly moved to suppress the transcript, arguing that: (1) Phillip\u2019s identification of the defendant at the probable cause hearing was tainted by the earlier due process violations inherent in the photographic identification procedure; and (2) his inability to cross-examine Phillip at trial regarding the photographic procedure and the extent of the alleged taint violated his constitutional rights to confrontation. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and permitted the transcript to be read to the jury. These two evidentiary rulings form the basis of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim stems from Phillip\u2019s extrajudicial identification of him from a photographic array. The identification occurred at the hospital, approximately twenty-four hours after Phillip was shot. After approaching Phillip in his hospital bed, Burton and Pettola asked Phillip to examine a ring-bound tray into which they had inserted a photograph of the defendant among 249 other photographs of black males. They placed the tray on Phillip\u2019s chest, and flipped the pages for him. Both officers testified at trial that Phillip was alert and conscious, and that he carefully examined the photographs without comment until, upon observing the defendant\u2019s photograph, he pointed and unhesitatingly stated: \u201cThis is the guy.\u201d Pettola testified that Phillip was 100 percent certain of his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The defendant maintains that the officers\u2019 testimony describing this identification was inadmissible hearsay. We agree that the testimony should have been excluded as hearsay, not falling within any exception to the rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and accordingly we conclude that a new trial is necessary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall consider the trial court\u2019s alternate grounds for admitting the officers\u2019 testimony in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The trial court\u2019s first ground for admitting the officers\u2019 testimony was that it fell within our exception to the hearsay rule for extrajudicial statements of identification. When arguing at trial for admission of the testimony, the state relied in large part upon <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 539 A.2d 114 (1988), wherein we reaffirmed in a different context our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>199 Conn. 5, 505 A.2d 685 (1986), that an exception to the hearsay rule for prior identification testimony was warranted where \u201cthe identifications were reliable and the witnesses were available for cross-examination.\u201d Id., 11. The trial court\u2019s ruling admitting the testimony was premised in part on the proposition that Phillip\u2019s availability for cross-examination at the probable cause hearing sufficed as a substitute for exposure to cross-examination before the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">A consideration integral to our holding in <em>McClen-don </em>was that the declarants testified at trial to the facts and circumstances surrounding their extrajudicial identifications, and thus defense counsel had the opportunity <em>at trial </em>to cross-examine them, procedurally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>restricted only by the court\u2019s exercise of discretion. Id., 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Townsend, </em>although the declarant did not testify to the facts and circumstances of his extrajudicial identification on direct examination, he was available for cross-examination <em>at trial </em>when hearsay evidence of that identification was offered by the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 623-24; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 274 A.2d 545 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In this case, Phillip did not testify at trial to the facts and circumstances surrounding his extrajudicial identification, We therefore conclude that he was not \u201cavailable for cross-examination\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in <em>McClendon. </em>Nor do we believe that Phillip\u2019s availability for cross-examination at the probable cause hearing renders the officers\u2019 testimony admissible under <em>Townsend. </em>A fundamental, and we think disposi-tive, difference between the facts of <em>Townsend </em>and those in the case at bar is that the state did not offer the officers\u2019 testimony at the probable cause hearing, at which Phillip testified so that he could have been cross-examined about his previous identification of the defendant from the photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We therefore hold that the trial court should not have admitted the officers\u2019 testimony under the exception to the hearsay rule for extrajudicial statements of identification. We turn now to the trial court\u2019s alternate ground for admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The trial court stated as its alternate ground for admitting the officers\u2019 testimony: \u201c[M]ost of the safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>guards that normally go with the exception to the hearsay rule do exist. It was given very close in time after the event, and it would appear to be reliable.\u201d The state urges us to uphold this ruling under the authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). In <em>Sharpe, </em>we held that hearsay inadmissible under one of the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule may be admitted if (1) there is a \u201creasonable necessity for the admission of the statement,\u201d and (2) the statement is \u201csupported by the equivalent guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness essential to other evidence admitted under the traditional hearsay exceptions.\u201d Id., 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The circumstances present in this case disclose that Phillip\u2019s statement was not imbued with guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness sufficient to support its admission. First, unlike the declarant in <em>Sharpe, </em>Phillip was not \u201ca witness at the trial and available for cross-examination.\u201d Id., 665. Cross-examination, \u201cthe greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth,\u201d was therefore absent in this case with respect to the extrajudicial identification. 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1974) \u00a7 1367, p. 32. The shortness of time between an event and the statement it provokes is ordinarily a significant indicator of reliability where the circumstances suggest that the statement was not the product of reflective thought. See C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 297, pp. 856-57. We cannot presume, however, that the excitement of the shoot-out suspended Phillip\u2019s powers of reflection and fabrication because officers testified that Phillip was alert, conscious and careful in his identification. See C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 297, p. 855; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>120 Ariz. 120, 584 P.2d 584 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Lack of knowledge as to Phillip\u2019s role in the events at the Church Street projects, in addition, leaves us unable to conclude that \u201c \u2018the circumstances are such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>a sincere and accurate statement would naturally be uttered, and no plan of falsification be formed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 665, quoting 5 J. Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 1422. Whatever Phillip\u2019s role, it was certainly unlike that of the <em>Sharpe </em>declarant, a disinterested neighbor whose role in the crime was limited to copying down a license plate number and reporting it to the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the absence of circumstances surrounding Phillip\u2019s statement to the police officers that establish a \u201cmotivational basis for truth-telling\u201d equivalent to those associated with the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule, we hold that the officers\u2019 testimony was hearsay not falling within any exception to the hearsay rule, and should have been excluded. <em>State </em>v. <em>Apperson, </em>85 Or. App. 429, 433, 736 P.2d 1026 (1987). In view of the state\u2019s emphasis upon the officers\u2019 testimony in its closing argument, and the scant additional evidence implicating the defendant in the crime, we agree with the defendant that the officers\u2019 testimony was improperly admitted as corroboration on the issue of identity. Thus, the admission of the testimony probably prejudiced the jury as to his guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 196-97, 435 A.2d 3 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Therefore, we must reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial. Because the defendant\u2019s remaining claim is likely to arise during retrial, we review it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The defendant advances two arguments in support of his claim that the trial court should have excluded the transcript of the probable cause hearing at which Phillip identified the defendant in the courtroom. First, he contends that the admission of the transcript violated his constitutional right to due process of law. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the alternative, he claims that the admission of the transcript violated his constitutional right to confrontation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We will consider these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the transcript of Phillip\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing should have been excluded on due process grounds is rooted in the earlier, photographic identification procedure employed by the police officers. He initially argues that the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, in violation of his constitutional right to due process of law. This allegedly unconstitutional procedure, he maintains, tainted Phillip\u2019s later in-court identification testimony at the probable cause hearing, thus rendering the admission of the transcript of that testimony a further deprivation of his due process right.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In determining whether the extrajudicial identification procedure violated the defendant\u2019s due process right, we must conduct an ad hoc, two-pronged inquiry: \u2018[Fjirst, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, and second, if it is found to be so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on an examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Monteeth, </em>208 Conn. 202, 206, 544 A.2d 1199 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980). An identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive when it \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018give[sj rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 243-44, 476 A.2d 550 (1984), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In claiming that the extrajudicial identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, the defendant focuses on two characteristics of the photographs contained in the array. He argues first that the date displayed on the placard in the foreground of his photograph, April 10,1986, caused it to stand out from the others because 245 of the photographs were arranged in roughly chronological order and dated from October through December, 1983, while only three photographs other than his were marked with dates from subsequent years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant claims that the format of his photograph was unduly distinctive because the date-bearing placards in his and two other photographs were flat, shiny, and exhibited information in smaller characters and in a different order than the placards in the remaining photographs, which were ridged and non-reflective.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We do not agree that these slight differences rendered the photographic array unnecessarily suggestive. Like differences in size and color composition of photographs, we hold that marginal discrepancies in texture, lettering and the order of information on placards in photographs do not automatically, in and of themselves, render an array unnecessarily suggestive. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 727, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987). As for the date displayed on the placard in the defendant\u2019s photograph, it was barely readable due to overexposure, as were many of the dates displayed on the placards in the 1983 photographs. The date was not, moreover, meaningfully related to September 24,1988, the date the crime occurred, nor was it the most recent of all of the dates. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>81, 93, 523 A.2d 495 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>199 Conn. 557, 565, 508 A.2d 430, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 989, 107 S. Ct. 583, 93 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Conn. 680, 683, 504 A.2d 1372 (1986). Absent significant information displayed on the placard, it is reasonable to assume that Phillip selected the defendant\u2019s photograph on the basis of his scrutiny of the characteristics of the individual depicted therein, rather than by focusing on the placard information or its physical attributes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>129 N.H. 654, 531 A.2d 329 (1987). We conclude, therefore, that the photographic identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Having so concluded, we need not analyze the factors determining the reliability of the extrajudicial identification. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 49, 570 A.2d 680 (1990). Nor need we consider whether Phillip\u2019s subsequent in-court identification at the probable cause hearing was tainted by the extrajudicial identification. \u201cSince the initial identification of the defendant . . . was not the result of a suggestive identification procedure, there was no constitutional infirmity in the identification process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 474, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The defendant also attacks the admission of the transcript of Phillip\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing as violative of his right to confrontation under the United States constitution. Cases involving the admission of an unavailable declarant\u2019s prior statements of identification \u201c[give] rise to Confrontation Clause issues \u2018because hearsay evidence was admitted as substantive evidence against the [defendant].\u2019 \u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fen-sterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 18, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985), quoting <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 413, 105 S. Ct. 2078, 85 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>According to the defendant, the trial court should have excluded the transcript because the defendant was unable, due to Phillip\u2019s absence at trial, to explore with \u201cfull and fair\u201d cross-examination <em>at trial </em>the extent to which Phillip\u2019s identification of the defendant at the probable cause hearing had been influenced by the earlier, allegedly unconstitutional photographic identification procedure. In reply, the state argues that Phillip\u2019s testimony was properly admitted under the \u201cformer testimony\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, and was coupled with \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d adequate to satisfy the demands of the confrontation clause. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While a literal interpretation of the confrontation clause could bar the substantive use of any hearsay statement made by an unavailable declarant, the United States Supreme Court has rejected that view as \u201cunintended and too extreme.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980); see also <em>Bourjaily </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 182, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987). The confrontation clause, however, does operate to \u201c[bar] the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. , 110 S. Ct. 3139, 3146, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court fashioned a two-part test designed to protect a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>facilitate the admission of prior statements of an unavailable declarant under an exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cFirst . . . [t]he prosecution must either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u201d Id., 65. Even after the declarant is satisfactorily shown to be unavailable, \u201chis statement is admissible only if it bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 id., 66; which serve to \u201cafford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 160-61, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cReliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 66. By engaging in a search for \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d in <em>Roberts, </em>the United States Supreme Court implicitly held that the exception to the hearsay rule for statements given by an unavailable declarant at a preliminary hearing was not so firmly rooted as to obviate further inquiry and search of the record. Thus, we must engage in a similar search here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A review of the record indicates that Phillip\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing bears adequate indicia of reliability to warrant submission of the transcript to the jury. The record indicates that Phillip\u2019s testimony was given under oath, subject to criminal penalties for perjury. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 165. Furthermore, his testimony was given before a judicial tribunal that kept an accurate judicial record of the proceedings. See id. The defendant was present in court, and he was represented by the same counsel who later represented him at trial. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In addition, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, we believe that defense counsel tested Phillip\u2019s statements at the probable cause hearing with \u201cthe equivalent of significant cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 70. The transcript of the probable cause hearing reveals that defense counsel exposed the details of what Phillip claimed to have observed at Church Street, the inaccuracies in his memory of the event, and the basis for his identification of the defendant in the courtroom. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination \u201ccomported with the principal <em>purpose </em>of cross-examination: to challenge \u2018whether the declarant was sincerely telling what he believed to be the truth, whether the declar-ant accurately perceived and remembered the matter he related, and whether the declarant\u2019s intended meaning is adequately conveyed by the language he employed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 71, quoting D. Davenport, \u201cThe Confrontation Clause and the Co-Conspirator Exception in Criminal Prosecutions: A Functional Analysis,\u201d 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1378 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">For example, defense counsel asked questions at the probable cause hearing about Phillip\u2019s reasons for going to the Church Street projects, and his reasons for getting out of the truck, to which Phillip replied \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cno reason,\u201d respectively. Phillip also divulged at defense counsel\u2019s request the duration of his presence at the Church Street projects, and the extent of his relationship with Williams. Defense counsel elicited, further, that although Phillip claimed to have observed several other men at the scene, he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>not recall how tall or heavy they were because he \u201cwas just looking.\u201d Phillip also stated that he stood within a few inches of the defendant and Williams, and that they were talking, but, in response to defense counsel\u2019s inquiries, admitted that he could not remember the subject of their conversation. Moreover, despite his proximity to the defendant, Phillip\u2019s abbreviated description of the defendant before pointing to him in the courtroom was \u201c240, 260, Black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant argues that at the probable cause hearing he was unable to cross-examine Phillip about his prior extrajudicial photographic identification of the defendant because (1) he did not have access to the photographs until the trial, and (2) even if he had had sufficient information at the hearing to challenge that prior identification, General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> would have barred him from doing so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">First, the record discloses that, although the defendant did not then have the photographs available to him, he did know from the police report, which he did have, that Phillip had made a prior extrajudicial photographic identification. Second, \u00a7 54-46a (b) bars suppression and discovery motions in probable cause hearings, and the trial court has broad discretion under that statute concerning the scope of cross-examination in such hearings. Third, and most important, the only aspect of cross-examination that the defendant claims to have lost in this respect concerns Phillip\u2019s prior extrajudicial identification. While that may or may not have been helpful to the defendant, given the trial court\u2019s and our conclusion that the prior extrajudicial identification was not suggestive, and given the broad scope of cross-examination that the defendant did exercise, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>say that the absence of cross-examination regarding the prior extrajudicial identification was fatal to the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In light of the cross-examination conducted at the probable cause hearing and the circumstances surrounding Phillip\u2019s testimony, we believe that the testimony possessed indicia of reliability sufficient for the jury to evaluate its truth. We thus decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s position that \u201cthe equivalent of significant cross-examination\u201d can take place at a preliminary hearing only when a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine is identical to that afforded at trial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>658 F.2d 445 (6th Cir. 1981); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>578 F. Sup. 1063 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 738 F.2d 418 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1020, 105 S. Ct. 438, 83 L. Ed. 2d 363 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>415 A.2d 570 (Me. 1980). \u201c \u2018[A]n insistence upon the equivalent of a present opportunity to cross-examine disregards the other elements of special reliability in former testimony such as the oath, the solemnity of the occasion, and in the case of transcribed testimony, the accuracy of reproduction of the words spoken.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>161 Conn. 500, 504, 289 A.2d 894 (1971), quoting C. McCormick, Evidence (1954) \u00a7 230, p. 481. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly admitted the transcribed testimony of Phillip\u2019s identification of the defendant at the probable cause hearing into evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative defenses, evidence of mental condition, classification, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) provides: \u201cassault in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-8. criminal liability for acts of another.

Although our decision with respect to the defendant\u2019s hearsay claim obviates the necessity of addressing his due process claim as a ground for exclusion of the officers\u2019 testimony, we note that because the defendant has advanced the identical argument as the basis for exclusion of the transcript of Phillip\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing, we have addressed the claim in part II A of our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> In a number of jurisdictions, extrajudicial statements of identification are admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule only where the declarant testifies and is available for cross-examination at trial.
