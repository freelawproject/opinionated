The defendant claims that: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s comments during final argument were an appeal to the jurors\u2019 passions and sympathies that denied him his state and federal constitutional rights to due process; (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the trial was a \u201csearch for the truth\u201d; and (3) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on an element of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant, William Watlington, resided in Waterbury with his wife, Nadine Beamon Watlington, and their three children. The defendant and his wife had a history of drug abuse and marital problems. Several months prior to the incident in question, the defendant voluntarily admitted himself into an inpatient drug program at the Institute of Living in Hartford. After he completed the program and returned home, he continued to attend outpatient treatment sessions six days a week and maintained a drug free life. The defendant encouraged and assisted his wife in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>attending several outpatient treatment sessions, including Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The defendant\u2019s brother-in-law, Tommy Beamon, moved into the defendant\u2019s house in late February, 1988, because of his own marital problems. After Bea-mon moved in, the defendant\u2019s wife stopped attending outpatient treatment sessions and began drinking and using crack coeaine. The family began to disintegrate and the defendant blamed Beamon for the family\u2019s problems. On April 15, 1988, the defendant told Beamon to leave the house. He helped Beamon pack his clothes and drove him to his parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The following night, the defendant went to a gospel concert at the University of Bridgeport and later went out to dinner with Mends. When the defendant arrived home, Beamon was lying on the living room floor. He asked Beamon what he was doing there and told Beamon he did not want him in his house again. According to the defendant, Beamon stated that the defendant\u2019s wife gave him permission to stay there. The defendant went upstairs to his wife\u2019s bedroom to ask her why she let Beamon into their house. After receiving no response from his wife, he went back downstairs and again ordered Beamon out of his house. When Bea-mon refused to leave, the defendant left his house and drove to his brother\u2019s house where he stored his .38 snubnose revolver. After obtaining his revolver, the defendant drove baek to his house and again ordered Beamon to leave, but he refused. The defendant then shot Beamon in the buttocks. Upon hearing the shot, the defendant\u2019s wife came downstairs. She told the defendant that \u201cif you are going to shoot my brother, you are going to have to shoot me also.\u201d The defendant shot his wife in the right side. He then shot Bea-mon a second time in the left side of the upper back. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Beamon died as a result of the bullet to the upper back, which punctured his left lung and his heart. The defendant\u2019s wife recovered from her wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The defendant testified at trial and admitted to firing the fatal shot at Beamon and injuring his wife. He claimed, however, that he had done so under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. In support of this defense, the defendant presented twelve lay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The defendant first claims that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument were so egregious that they deprived him of his constitutional right to due process under the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that the prosecutor on three separate occasions appealed to the jurors\u2019 passions and sympathies during his closing argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly stated to the jurors not to \u201cforget\u201d Beamon and the \u201cvictims.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>preserve this claim at trial, however, and now seeks review under the \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d provision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), we reformulated the standard announced in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, for appellate consideration of constitutional claims that were not preserved at trial. We stated that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. We noted that we would remain free to dispose of the claim \u201cby focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d Id., 240. In this case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is insufficient to satisfy the second condition in <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>It is true that a \u201cprosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors\u201d because such appeals \u201c \u2018 \u201chave the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>[194 Conn. 530, 562, 482 A.2d 300 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 545, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). It is also improper for a prosecutor to inject extraneous issues into the case by encouraging the jury to identify with the victim. Id., 547. Nonetheless, we have held that <em>\u201cEvans </em>review of such a claim is unavailable when the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 393, 572 A.2d 944 (1990); because in such a case the claimed misconduct is insufficient to infect \u201cthe fundamental fairness of the trial itself.\u201d Id. The defendant bears the burden of \u201cdemonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240; rather than a common law or statutory claim wearing a constitutional mask. <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>supra. Although we disapprove of the prosecutor\u2019s references in his closing argument to the victims and their families, we conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that these remarks did not rise to the level of egregious misconduct implicating the denial of the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 421, 568 A.2d 439 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>207 Conn. 646, 654, 542 A.2d 1136 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler-Barcomb, </em>197 Conn. 666, 672-74, 500 A.2d 1324 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1109, 106 S. Ct. 1518, 89 L. Ed. 2d 916 (1986). Accordingly, we dismiss this claim of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the trial is a \u201csearch for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the truth\u201d rather than an evaluation of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant maintains that the court\u2019s instructions negated the presumption of innocence and diluted the burden of proof, thereby leaving the jury without any standard to decide the case, in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights to due process of law. See footnote 1, supra. Although the defendant did not properly preserve this claim at trial, he now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, and the plain error rule of Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that this claim is not of constitutional magnitude, but simply masquerades as such, and we therefore dismiss it under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 241.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also conclude that the instruction did not involve plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The defendant challenges the following instruction of the trial court: \u201cNow, in every trial there should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>a search for the truth. And, the duty of the members of the jury in a criminal case is to search the evidence for the truth. Having found it to your satisfaction, then report it and your findings to the court by means of a proper verdict under the law, as I am instructing you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It is well established that individual jury instructions will not be judged in isolation from the entire charge; rather, the charge must be read as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>214 Conn. 118, 570 A.2d 1123 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 554 A.2d 713 (1989). Furthermore, isolated passages from a jury instruction must be read in the context in which they were given and with regard to how the jury was likely to have understood them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 548, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In the present case, the challenged instruction was given as part of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury on its role in gauging the credibility of witnesses. Near the end of the court\u2019s instruction regarding credibility, immediately after its instruction on how to evaluate expert opinion testimony, the court gave the instruction that the defendant now challenges. That instruction was immediately followed, however, by the following instruction: \u201cWhen you go into the jury room, analyze the testimony that you have heard from the witness chair and decide what credibility you are to give to those witnesses. You are not expected to abandon your common sense while sitting in the jury room, the jury box or in the courtroom. <em>Your function is to decide where the truth lies, obviously. </em>I use the word testimony, I am also using a concept of considering all of the exhibits that have been presented to you. It will be a matter for you to determine and decide how much weight and what credibility you are to give to the witnesses and the exhibits in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Furthermore, prior to and numerous times after this instruction, the court properly charged the jury on the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Nothing in those instructions suggested any linkage between, on one hand, the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and, on the other hand, the court\u2019s instruction that, in determining the credibility of witnesses, the jury should search for the truth. The court did not repeat the challenged instruction, and the defendant does not contest any other part of the court\u2019s instruction. In fact, at the end of the court\u2019s charge, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI have no objection. I thought it was an excellent charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is clear that there is no basis for the defendant\u2019s claim that this instruction, although perhaps worded too broadly, negated the presumption of innocence and diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Reading the instruction in its context and viewing the jury charge in its entirety, we cannot conceive that the jury heard that instruction as a statement by the court that the jury should exercise its factfinding function unburdened by the presumption of innocence or by the necessity that it be persuaded of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">For much the same reason, the defendant\u2019s claim is unreviewable as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Plain error review \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018is reserved for truly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 120. In this case, after a careful review of the record, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s instruction affected the fundamental fairness of the trial or resulted in any manifest injustice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant\u2019s claim is based on the following instruction: \u201cNow, the second element, the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is more than mere annoyance or unhappiness. And, the next element, the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to <em>that state, </em>as a result of which, there was a loss of self-control and his reason was overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation, other similar emotions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court, at the request of the jury and after deliberations began, repeated the same instruction on the affirmative defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The defendant maintains that the court\u2019s use of the words \u201cthat state\u201d in its instructions on the \u201cthird element\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the defense was an inaccurate statement of the law. According to the defendant, the court\u2019s use of the words \u201cthat state\u201d referred to the circumstances in which the defendant found himself rather than to the defendant\u2019s mental state. The defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that the court should have used \u201cit,\u201d which would have properly referred to the defendant\u2019s mental state, as the defendant had provided in his request to charge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and as stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 9-10, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). Therefore, according to the defendant, the trial court\u2019s improper instruction violated his due process right to establish a defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">It is well established that when a proper request is filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852 and the trial court has failed to charge the jury in the exact language of the request, the test is whether the court\u2019s instructions properly covered the substance of the written request. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>199 Conn. 255, 269, 506 A.2d 1041 (1986). \u201cA request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 178, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986). \u201cThe trial court is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>under a duty in a criminal proceeding to charge in the identical language requested if its charge is accurate, adequate and, in substance, properly includes material portions of the defendant\u2019s request; its responsibility is performed when it gives instructions to the jury in a manner calculated to give them a clear understanding of the issues presented for their consideration, under the offenses charged and upon the evidence, and when its instructions are suited to their guidance in the determination of those issues.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 322-23, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The defendant\u2019s request to charge on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance provided in part: \u201cIn determining whether [the defendant] has proven the affirmative defense . . . you must find that the [defendant] was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming <em>state, </em>that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness, and he had an extreme emotional reaction to <em>it . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cit\u201d in the request to charge is used as a pronoun to substitute for and to represent the word \u201cstate\u201d in the \u201csecond element\u201d of the defense. Similarly, the use of \u201cthat state\u201d in the trial court\u2019s instructions on the \u201cthird element\u201d of the affirmative defense was used as a referent to the type of \u201cstate\u201d mentioned in the second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The word \u201cthat\u201d preceding \u201cstate,\u201d in the court\u2019s instructions, is used as an adjective. As an adjective it refers to \u201cthe thing, or idea, pointed to, mentioned, or understood from the situation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The only type of \u201cstate\u201d mentioned or that the jury could reasonably understand from the court\u2019s instructions was the type of \u201cstate\u201d in the \u201csecond element\u201d of the defense. Because the substitution of \u201cthat state\u201d refers to the type of \u201cstate\u201d mentioned in the \u201csecond element\u201d of the defense, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>thus, had the same effect as would the use of \u201cit,\u201d the court\u2019s instructions did not, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, convey or infer to the jury a different type of \u201cstate.\u201d Therefore, whether the court\u2019s substitution of \u201cthat state\u201d refers to the defendant\u2019s mental state or to the circumstances the defendant found himself in depends on the meaning of the word \u201cstate\u201d in the \u201csecond element\u201d of the affirmative defense. Because the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s instructions on the \u201csecond element\u201d of the affirmative defense, nor any other part of the court\u2019s instructions on the affirmative defense, we need not decide whether the word \u201cstate\u201d in that context refers to the defendant\u2019s mental state or the circumstances in which he found himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the affirmative defense covered the substance of the defendant\u2019s request and adequately apprised the jury of the law to guide them to a just determination. Therefore, the court\u2019s substitution of \u201cthat state\u201d for \u201cit\u201d did not prejudice the defendant or mislead the jury so as to constitute a violation of the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, provides in part: \u201cNo person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall excessive bail be required nor excessive fines imposed. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1, provides in part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Because the defendant has not presented a separate analysis under the state constitution, we consider his claims under the federal constitution only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> On three separate occasions during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the victims:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">(1) At the beginning of the opening portion of the state\u2019s closing argument: \u201cBut, again, on behalf of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, I would like to thank you for your time and your patience. And, I know that Mr. Bea-mon and his family would like to thank you and Mrs. Watlington.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">(2) At the end of the opening portion of the state\u2019s closing argument: \u201cAnd, in this case, although you have seen Mr. Watlington here for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>last couple of days and he may look like a nice fellow, may seem like a nice fellow, don\u2019t forget the victims. . . .

I mean, you know, Tommy Beamon, he had a life too. He had kids. He had a family. He served his country. He was only thirty years old.

In the present case, unlike <em>Giroux, </em>the challenged instruction was not given as part of the instructions on the burden of proof, nor was it linked to that instruction in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> Although we have recently held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>216 Conn. 139, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990), that the three guidelines this court established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), are not \u201celements\u201d of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, we refer to them as such for consistency purposes only, since the trial court used similar language in its charge, and the defendant has adopted that phraseology in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\"> The defendant requested the court to charge the jury as follows: \u201cIn determining whether . . . Mr. Watlington has proven the affirmative defense of an extreme emotional disturbance by a fair preponderance of the evidence as a mitigation of murder to manslaughter you must find that . . . Mr. Watlington was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state, that is, not mere annoyance or unhappiness, and he had an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there was a loss of self-control, and reason was overborne by extreme intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions. Consideration is given to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that his usual intellectual controls failed and the normal rational thinking for that individual no longer prevailed at the time of the act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> Although the defendant had properly preserved this claim for appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852, he sought review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and the plain error rule in Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 544, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990), disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, and the plain error rule. In <em>Foreshaw, </em>we held that an unpreserved challenge to an alleged erroneous instruction on an element of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance was not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error rule, because such claims of error do not raise a constitutional question and do not constitute a manifest injustice to the defendant so as to impair the effectiveness or integrity of his trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
