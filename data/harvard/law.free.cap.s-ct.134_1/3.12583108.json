App. to Pet. for Cert. 6. Stanton was familiar with the neighborhood, known for \"violence associated with the area gangs.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The officers-wearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicle-approached the place where the disturbance had been reported and noticed three men walking in the street. Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a nearby apartment complex. The third,\n   Nicholas Patrick, crossed the street about 25 yards in front of Stanton's car and ran or quickly walked toward a residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 7, 17. Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Stanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but he considered Patrick's behavior suspicious and decided to detain him in order to investigate.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Stanton exited his patrol car, called out \"police,\" and ordered Patrick to stop in a voice loud enough for all in the area to hear. App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. But Patrick did not stop. Instead, he \"looked directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly went through [the] front gate\" of a fence enclosing Sims' front yard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations omitted). When the gate closed behind Patrick, the fence-which was more than six feet tall and made of wood-blocked Stanton's view of the yard. Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code \u00a7 148 by disobeying his order to stop;\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn0\" id=\"fr0\" name=\"fr0\">\n     *\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Stanton also \"fear [ed] for [his] safety.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. He accordingly made the \"split-second decision\" to kick open the gate in pursuit of Patrick.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate when it flew open. The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sims filed suit against Stanton in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding that: (1) Stanton's entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he fled, and by Sims' lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home; and (2) even if a constitutional violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sims appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662073\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/954/\">\n    706 F.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The court held that Stanton's warrantless entry into Sims' yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and because Patrick had committed only the minor offense of disobeying a police officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662073\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/954/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662073\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/954/\">\n    at 959-963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174406\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/38/#p42\">\n    427 U.S., at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174406\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/38/#p42\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The only remaining question is whether [the suspect's] act of retreating into her house could thwart an otherwise proper arrest.

Second, to repeat, neither\n   <em>\n    Welsh\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   involved hot pursuit.\n   <em>\n    Welsh,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205546\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/740/#p750\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205546\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/740/#p750\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205546\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/740/#p750\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089207\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/895/#p908\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089207\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/895/#p908\">\n    at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, despite our emphasis in\n   <em>\n    Welsh\n   </em>\n   on the fact that the crime at issue was minor-indeed, a mere nonjailable civil offense-nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important\n   <em>\n    in cases of hot pursuit\n   </em>\n   . Third, even in the portion of\n   <em>\n    Welsh\n   </em>\n   cited by the Ninth Circuit below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never justified, but only that such entry should be rare.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205546\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/740/#p750\">\n    466 U.S., at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205546\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/740/#p750\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That is in fact how two California state courts have read\n   <em>\n    Welsh\n   </em>\n   .

The court stated in\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   : \"Where the pursuit into the home was based on an arrest set in motion in a public place, the fact that the offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the validity of the entry without a warrant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4413188\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/216/1425/#p1430\">\n    216 Cal.App.3d, at 1430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20422\">\n    265 Cal.Rptr., at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
