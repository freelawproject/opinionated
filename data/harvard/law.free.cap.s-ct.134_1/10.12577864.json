After explaining to respondent that the State's evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent's attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agreement to testify against Billie. Three days before Billie's trial, respondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony. The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the original plea. Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted. Respondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assistance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn the strength of the State's evidence. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim, concluding that Toca's actions were reasonable in light of his client's protestations of innocence. On federal habeas review, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals' ruling was reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief. The Sixth Circuit reversed. It found the factual predicate for the state court's decision-that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent's assertion of innocence-an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record, given Toca's explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision to withdraw was made because the State's original plea offer was higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guidelines. It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  <em>\n   Held:\n  </em>\n  The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the \"doubly deferential\" standard of\n  review recognized by the Court's case law when it refused to credit the state court's reasonable factual finding and assumed that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent.

Pp. 14 - 16.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  (b) Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Appeals' factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea only after respondent's proclamation of innocence. The facts that respondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when Billie's husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and hired Toca just three days before Billie's trial at which respondent had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to Toca. The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its contrary conclusion was that Toca's sole explanation at the withdrawal hearing focused on the fact that the State's plea offer was substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines. The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca's representations to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about a defendant's asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals' factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence to Toca, the Sixth Circuit's\n  <em>\n   Strickland\n  </em>\n  analysis cannot be sustained. More troubling is that court's conclusion that Toca was ineffective because the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea. The Sixth Circuit turned on its head the principle that counsel should be \"strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\"\n  <em>\n   Strickland v.

The single fact that Toca failed to retrieve respondent's file from former counsel before withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome\n  <em>\n   Strickland\n  </em>\n  's strong presumption of effectiveness. In any event, respondent admitted in open court that former counsel had explained the State's evidence and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecution's case. Toca's conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer's ethical violations do not make the lawyer\n  <em>\n   per se\n  </em>\n  ineffective, and Toca's questionable conduct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.

With help from attorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agreement with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead guilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sentence. As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the State's evidence with respondent \"over a long period of time,\" and respondent understood that that evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder. App. 43-44. The Michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Three days before Billie Rogers' trial was to commence, however, respondent retained a new lawyer, Frederick Toca. With Toca's help, respondent demanded a substantially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of seven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and testify. When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new demands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging in open court the consequences of withdrawal (including reinstatement of the first-degree murder charge). Without respondent's critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquitted, and later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Respondent subsequently stood trial. During the course of the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don Rogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered his mouth or poured vodka down\n   his throat, that Billie intended to harm him. Indeed, respondent testified to attempting to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   Billie from harming her husband. The jury, however, elected to believe respondent's previous out-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated participation in the killing, and convicted respondent of second-degree murder.

Respondent passed a polygraph denying planning to kill Don Rogers or being in the room when he died. Thereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, respondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact guilty. App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   That conversation \"set into motion\" respondent's decision to retain Toca.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Those facts, together with the timing of Toca's hiring-on the eve of the trial at which respondent was to self-incriminate-strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to Toca. That conclusion is further bolstered by respondent's maintenance of innocence of Don Rogers' death at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Indeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult. Respondent's first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal that was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by respondent in open court, that the State's evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder. This deal involved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year sentence-far less than the mandatory sentence of life in prison that results from a conviction for first-degree murder under Michigan law. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20750.316\">\n    Mich. Comp.

Yet after a jailer advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty,\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca (who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and then to maintain innocence at trial. If that something was not a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine what it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclusion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respondent's proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca moved to withdraw the guilty plea, he \"did not refer to Titlow's claims of innocence,\" but instead \"explained that the decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact that the State's plea offer was substantially higher than the Michigan guidelines\" for manslaughter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880342\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/577/\">\n    680 F.3d, at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Michigan Court of Appeals, however-unlike the Sixth Circuit-also correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent about a defendant's asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Indeed, a defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may have a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of acquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard bargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty. Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit improperly set aside a \"reasonable state-court determinatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable interpretation of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

But here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's strong presumption of effectiveness. The record does not reveal how much Toca was able to glean about respondent's case from other sources; he may well have obtained copies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the court. (Indeed, Toca's statement at the plea withdrawal hearing that \"[t]here's a lot of material here\" strongly suggests that he did have access to a source of documentation other than Lustig's file. App. 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In any event, the same considerations were relevant to entering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent admitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that Lustig had explained the State's evidence and that this evidence would support a conviction for first-degree murder. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecution's case and nevertheless wished to withdraw the plea. With respondent having knowingly entered the guilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of the State's evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a month later highly unlikely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal justification for overturning the state court's decision, we recognize that Toca's conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary. He may well have violated the rules of professional conduct by accepting respondent's publication rights as partial payment for his services, and he waited weeks before consulting respondent's first lawyer about the case. But the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to effective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer's violation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ineffective. See\n   <em>\n    Mickens v. Taylor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353765\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/162/#p171\">\n    535 U.S. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353765\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/162/#p171\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353765\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/162/#p171\">\n    152 L.Ed.2d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Troubling as Toca's actions were, they were irrelevant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth Circuit: whether the state court reasonably determined that respondent was adequately advised before deciding to withdraw the guilty plea. Because the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision that respondent was so advised is reasonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit's judgment is reversed.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n     3\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In my view, this case turns on Vonlee Titlow's failure to present enough evidence of what Frederick Toca did or did not do in the handful of days after she hired him and before she withdrew her plea. As our opinion notes, she bore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that Toca performed effectively and that the state court ruled correctly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not say more, and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately, however, to express my understanding of our opinion's limited scope, particularly with respect to two statements that it makes about the adequacy of Toca's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, we state that \"[a]lthough a defendant's proclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities under\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   it may affect the advice counsel gives.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 17. The first part of that statement bears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant asserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must \"make an independent examination of the facts, circumstances, pleadings and laws involved and then ... offer his informed opinion as to what plea should be entered.\"\n   <em>\n    Von Moltke v.

But a lawyer must abide by his client's decision in this respect only after having provided the client with competent and fully informed advice, including an analysis of the risks that the client would face in proceeding to trial. Given our recognition that \"a defendant's proclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 17, our further observation that such a proclamation \"may affect the advice counsel gives,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   states only the obvious: that a lawyer's advice will always reflect the objectives of the representation, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to reject respondent's claim, \"given that respondent was claiming innocence and only days away from offering self-incriminating testimony\" at her aunt's trial.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 17. This is true in context: Because respondent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca's performance was not adequate, the state court reasonably held that it was. But our statement about the facts of this case does not imply that an attorney performs effectively in advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever the client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to make the decision. Had respondent made a better factual record-had she actually shown, for example, that Toca failed to educate himself about the case before recommending that she withdraw her plea-then she could well have prevailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because (and only because) respondent failed to present enough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of AEDPA and\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   I join fully in the opinion of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While I join the Court's judgment, I find dubious the Michigan Court of Appeals' conclusion that Toca acted reasonably in light of Titlow's protestations of innocence. Toca became Titlow's counsel on the recommendation of the deputy sheriff to whom Titlow professed innocence. App. 298. As the Court rightly observes, Toca's conduct was \"far from exemplary.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 18. With virtually no time to make an assessment of Titlow's chances of prevailing at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had negotiated Titlow's plea, Toca told Titlow he could take the case to trial and win. App. 295 (Titlow's uncontradicted averment). With Toca's aid, Titlow's plea was withdrawn just three days after Toca's retention as defense counsel. At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that Titlow had been the \"victim of some bad advice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3427198\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/175/#p187\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3427198\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/175/#p187\">\n    at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear. The prosecutor's agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on Titlow's willingness to testify at her aunt's trial. See App. 42-43, 45.
