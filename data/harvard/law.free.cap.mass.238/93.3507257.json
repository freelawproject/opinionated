He was unmarried, and the next of kin surviving him was his sister Louise. The claimant, Elizabeth A. Murphy, was his aunt. The employee and his sister had lived with her most of the time since childhood. The house in which they lived had been owned for many years by the claimant\u2019s husband and, after his death in 1916, she owned one third interest therein and bought her stepson\u2019s two third interest in January, 1919. It is agreed that the average weekly wage of the employee was $24.58. He gave the claimant about $15 a week; and Louise, who earned $11 a week, after retaining what she needed, gave the remainder to her aunt. Mrs. Murphy owned the household furniture and paid the household bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The workmen\u2019s compensation act defines dependents as \u201cmembers of the employee\u2019s family or next of kin who were wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part V, \u00a7 2. Admittedly the claimant was not next of kin, since the employee\u2019s sister survived him. The Industrial Accident Board has found that she was not a member of the employee\u2019s family; and this finding must stand, as it finds support in the evidence. In the language of the board member: \"The deceased had, to a very considerable extent, been brought up by the petitioner. As a boy he certainly had not been the head of the family. While away from the household in later years, he had made no contribution to keep the household going. He at one time left the household because of trouble with . . . [his aunt\u2019s stepson^. This does not indicate that he had 'the exclusive management of the household affairs.\u2019 Nothing in the evidence tends to indicate that the deceased at any time thereafter assumed such control. The testimony of the claimant showed pretty plainly that she considered that she was the controlling and predominating factor in keeping the household intact.\u201d The board was warranted in finding that the employee was a member of his aunt\u2019s family, rather than the head of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>a family of which she was a member. <em>Kelley\u2019s Case, 222 </em>Mass. 538. <em>Cowden\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 66. <em>Mahoney\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 555. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
