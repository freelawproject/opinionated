At the close of the evidence, at the request of the plaintiff and subject to an exception by the defendant, the judge ruled: \u201cIf the plaintiff demanded of the defendant the balance of the lime juice due him under the contract of February 11, 1919, on May 24 or 26, 1919, he was entitled to receive it from the defendant and the defendant cannot escape liability on the ground that he was unable to deliver so much lime juice within so short a time.\u201d The judge also gave instructions as to the rights of the parties under the extension of time for delivery to which no exceptions were taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">Subject to exceptions by the defendant, the judge refused his requests for the following rulings:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">\u201c9. That the plaintiff was entitled to lime juice only in five barrel lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">\u201c 10. That if the plaintiff asked for thirty-five barrels before June 1 it was not a proper demand under contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\">\u201c11. In order to hold the defendant liable, the plaintiff must have demanded the balance of the lime juice in five barrel lots before June 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">\u201c12. If the plaintiff delivered all the five barrel lots of lime juice demanded before June 1, he is not liable in damages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-10\">The judge submitted questions to the jury, which, with the jury\u2019s answers, were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-11\">\u201c1. Did the plaintiff demand thirty-five barrels on or before June 1?\u201d Answer, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-12\">\u201c2. Did the parties prior to June 1 agree to extend time for delivery?\u201d Answer, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-13\">\u201c3.

Walker Bros. Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Boston, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Dear Sirs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">We enter your order for 50 barrels of Refined Lime Juice @ 80c per gallon 1% 10 days f. o. b. 93 Central Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">Barrels charged, allowed for when returned in good condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">Goods to be taken in 5 bbl. lots on or before June 1st, 1919.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">J. P. W. yon Laer &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">The signature is admitted to be that of the defendant, who apparently did business under the name signed to said letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Deliveries were made under this contract in lots of five barrels each on March 10, 14, May 5 and 29, 1919. On May 26 of that year, a demand was made upon the defendant for the thirty-five barrels of lime juice then undelivered. No other demand was made prior to June 1, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">The defendant testified that lime juice would not keep for any length of time in barrels, and that it was necessary to rectify or clarify it as ordered; that although he had plenty of crude limp juice with which to satisfy the final order, he could not clarify more than fifteen to twenty barrels per week; that it was a physical impossibility for him to fill the demand referred to before June 1,1919, on which day he claims his obligation ceased because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to order in five barrel lots; that he had repeatedly requested the plaintiff to give him shipping instructions, but that such had not been given except as above stated. He fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ther testified that the plaintiff knew it would be physically impossible for him to turn out so large a quantity in so few days. This the plaintiff denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The plaintiff testified that the defendant^ after giving the final order and before June 1, 1919, promised to deliver the lime juice to it at a later date, and that the company consented to this change in time; that in several conversations subsequent to June 1, 1919, the defendant promised to ship the balance of the orden The jury, answering a question submitted to them, found that the parties prior to June 1 agreed to extend the time for delivery. The question was not so framed as to require any broader answer than that stated. There was evidence that the defendant did on August 7, 1919, deliver one barrel under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The evidence so introduced and the question' submitted, both without objection or exception, clearly show that the case was not tried with the rights of the parties restricted by the declaration; hence no question of pleading is now open. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>201 Mass. 377. <em>Serabian </em>v. <em>Titian, </em>229 Mass. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Apart from any question of the interpretation of the original contract, the jury found that the time for delivery was extended before June 1,1919. They could further have found that the defendant did agree before then to deliver at a later time the thirty-five barrels ordered May 26, 1919, and that he failed to do so. Hence no verdict could have been ordered in the defendant\u2019s favor. The parties could orally modify the time and manner of performance fixed in the contract. <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>220 Mass. 324. <em>Gouzoulas </em>v. <em>F. W. Stock &amp; Sons, </em>223 Mass. 537. <em>Roxbury Painting &amp; Decorating Co. </em>v. <em>Nute, </em>233 Mass. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">It is unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining exceptions. Even if all were well founded, none went to the gist of the action and if sustained requires a defendant\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
