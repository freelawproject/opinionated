His hours of labor commenced at eight in the forenoon, and the accident happened shortly before that time while he was on his way to work on the fifth floor of a building. The employer was in possession of that floor under a lease which contained no reference to the use of the elevator, which was maintained for the use of all the tenants and w\u00e1s neither operated nor controlled by the employer. It did not open directly into the employer\u2019s leasehold, communication being through a hallway. There was also a stairway by means of which access could be had to the employer\u2019s factory. There was evidence that while both the elevator and stairway were used by those in the service of the employer, most of the employees used the elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">By clear implication and the obvious intent of the parties to the lease, as against the landlord, the employer and those in his service had a right to use the elevator for purposes properly connected with the occupancy of the premises leased, while it was maintained by the landlord. <em>Brande </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>154 Mass. 210. <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>219 Mass. 556. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>FitzGerald Dry Goods Co. </em>62 Neb. 270. <em>Shaft </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>107 Wis. 273. See also <em>McCall </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>201 Mass. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Although the elevator was not the only means of access provided for an employee, it was maintained for such use as was reasonably incidental to the employment. [When using it in going to and returning from work an employee of ICondazian was in a place where he had a right to be as against the landlord and as against the employer, who could have been found to have authorized its use. This right was dependent upon and arose from the employment; and the risk of injury while using the elevator was an incident and hazard of the employment. \u201cAn injury to a workman may arise out of and in the course of his employment even if he is not actually working at the time.\u201d <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">The case is within the principle of <em>Sundine\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 1, <em>O\u2019Brien's Case, </em>228 Mass. 380, <em>O\u2019Toole\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 165, 167, and <em>Hallett\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass, 49. See <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28. It is distinguishable from <em>Fumiciello\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 488, <em>Rourke\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 360, and <em>Bell\u2019s Case, ante, </em>46, where injuries were received at places not connected with and not in legal effect a part of the premises where the employees were employed. We do not fix any exact line of demarcation, as each case must be decided on application of the governing principles to the facts involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
