The jury took a view of the premises from which they might have found that no other vehicle could have struck the plaintiff without first colliding with the defendant\u2019s car. The driver of the defendant\u2019s car testified that \u201c he was looking back over the side all the time \u201d without seeing the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the questions, whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and whether the defendant\u2019s employee was negligent, were for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-11\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the plaintiff being run into by a motor car driven by an employee of the defendant.

The jury would have been warranted in finding that in the course of his employment at about six o\u2019clock in the evening as it was becoming dark, he was walking in a passageway leading from a public way to the rear of the company\u2019s freight house, when he noticed an automobile \u201c standing way down the driveway which he did not think belonged there,\u201d and also noticed an automobile \u201cstanding alongside the building of House No. 20, . . . up against the door, which he supposed belonged to the defendant.\u201d The second automobile stood in front of the side door about twenty feet from Massachusetts Avenue, while the first automobile \u201cfurther down . . . [was] near a lumber yard, just beyond the furtherest end of the warehouse building,\u201d and because of its position the plaintiff thought \u201c it looked suspicious . . . that it should be there at that time of night,\u201d and started \u201c to see what that automobile is doing down there.\u201d But while passing by the defendant\u2019s automobile one Tompkins seated therein, or one Jameson \u201c alongside of him, but standing outside the car \u201d told him, that the first automobile \u201c belonged to the lumberman,\u201d and the plaintiff replied, \u201c If that is the case I am not going to bother my head about it,\u201d and turned around from where he was standing in front of the defendant\u2019s car, and \u201cstarted to walk directly back toward the office \u201d which was in the building fronting on the avenue. But as he turned to walk back, he was struck \u201cright on my back . . . fell senseless\u201d suffering severe personal injury. The jury took a view of the premises, and could find on the evidence that the accident happened in front of freight house No. 20, and that almost immediately after the plaintiff had been informed as to the ownership of the first automobile the defendant\u2019s car began backing round into the freight house yard. It could also be found that no other vehicle could have passed around the corner of the yard and struck the plaintiff without first coming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>into collision with the defendant\u2019s automobile, and that the plaintiff was run down by its car, as it was backing out of the passageway. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s chauffeur that \u201che was looking back over the side all the time\u201d without seeing the plaintiff, was not conclusive, and whether under all the circumstances the defendant used ordinary care was rightly submitted to the jury. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583. <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Athol &amp; Orange Street Railway, </em>198 Mass. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
