In his opening statement to the jury, the counsel for the plaintiff said that the plaintiff \u201cwas not seeking to recover damages for breach of the oral contract but was seeking compensation for services rendered by her to said David Walsh and Walter Walsh for making a home for them and for taking care of and nursing them, for which services the plaintiff had received no compensation; . . . that evidence of the value of such services and of the value of the real estate at 207 Prospect Street would be offered but that the plaintiff disclaimed any right to recover as compensation for such services a sum greater than the value of the real estate at 207 Prospect Street, Cambridge, in case the value of the services exceeded that of said real estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">Other statements by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">At the completion of the opening statement of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and upon the pleadings and opening, the judge ordered the jury to return a verdict for the defendant and reported the case to this court for determination, it being agreed that, if \u201cthe plaintiff should have been allowed to have the case submitted to the jury upon any one or more of the four counts in her declaration upon showing evidence substantially as outlined by counsel in his opening, . . . judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $4,000; otherwise, judgment shall be entered upon the verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1920, before <em>Rugg, </em>C.

The plaintiff, with whose family the intestate had been intimately acquainted, was employed By him as a bookkeeper until her marriage. In March, 1902, she was living with her husband and child when the intestate \u201ctold her in substance that he was dissatisfied with the housekeepers whom he had employed; that his present housekeeper was leaving him and that he wanted the plaintiff to come to Cambridge and make a home for him and his brother Walter; that if she would come and make a home for them and take care of them that the house at 207 Prospect Street would be hers for a home when Walter and he were through with it; that he also said he would allow the plaintiff $7 per week for the board of himself and Walter in addition to his promise to give her the house; that the plaintiff, after getting her husband to consent to this arrangement, agreed to go to Cambridge ... to make a home for and to take care of them.\u201d The plaintiff accordingly removed with her husband and child \u201c and made a home for the two brothers during their lives, in all for a period of about fifteen years; got their meals . . . and cared for and nursed them when they were sick,\u201d and the intestate\u2019s last sickness \u201cextended over a,period of more than three years.\u201d The plaintiff or her husband ordered and paid for all interior repairs from 1902 to 1918, the date of the death of the intestate, who survived Walter. The plaintiff on two occasions told the intestate she intended to leave but he persuaded her to stay, saying \u201cthat the house and land would be hers.\u201d \u25a0 The intestate \u201cpaid the plaintiff $7 per week for board\u201d until Walter\u2019s death, but from that time until his own death \u201che paid $4 per week for his board by agreement.\u201d But he never stated in what manner he would transfer the title \u201cwhether by deed or by will,\u201d and died without having made any conveyance or devise, and without any demand therefor having been made. The jury would have been warranted in finding that, in consideration of the intestate\u2019s promise, the plaintiff agreed to act as his housekeeper, and to care for him and his brother in sickness and in health so long as either should live, and that the parties intended the contract should be bilateral and entire. The action was seasonably begun, and, the burden of proving payment averred in the answer being on the defendant and ho evidence having been introduced, the only remaining defence duly pleaded as matter of law is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>statute of frauds, the ground on which we assume the trial judge ordered a verdict for the defendant. The intestate promised the plaintiff that if she accepted his offer \"the house at 207 Prospect Street would be hers for a home when Walter and he were through with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahf\">While there is no reference to any legal form or mode by which he would make the transfer, the jury could find that it was contemplated and mutually understood that the intestate before his death would in some effectual manner perform his part of the contract. It is settled that without impairment of his or his brother\u2019s right of support he could have conveyed or devised the property to the plaintiff conditioned upon her performance which would terminate only upon the death of himself and of his brother. <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Case, </em>2 Allen, 546. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>9 Allen, 128. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>12 Allen, 586. We discover nothing in R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 6, that no agreement to make a will of real or personal property, or to give a legacy or make a devise shall be valid unless in writing signed by the person whose executor or administrator is sought to be charged, which is in conflict with this construction of the contract. The plaintiff, as the jury further could find, fully performed all she agreed to do, and if this appeared, the failure of the intestate, who survived his brother, to vest title in his lifetime or to provide for its vesting at his death, leaving the property to descend to his heirs at law, constitutes a breach. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>9 Allen, 128. <em>Daley </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Building, Loan &amp; Saving Association, </em>178 Mass. 13, 18. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>180 Mass. 480. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Slate, </em>184 Mass. 317. Even if in the beginning the plaintiff must be presumed to have known that, while not void, yet, the agreement being oral, if the statute was relied on, it could not be enforced, had no reason to anticipate' that, having acted in good faith, as the jury also could say, the administratrix, who was not bound to do so, would plead the statute. R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>2 Allen, 439. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>115 Mass. 508, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">But,.although the breach of an unenforceable contract affords no ground of action, <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>1 Pick. 328, an administratrix can have no greater rights by way of defence than her intestate, the exercise of which must be deemed as being in legal effect the same as if pleaded by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The first, second and fourth counts of the declaration resting on allegations of a breach of the contract, are insufficient to support the action. The third count on an account annexed \u201cfor value of real estate promised to be conveyed by or left to the plaintiff by the defendant\u2019s intestate,\u201d is also expressly rested on the contract. See <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>185 Mass. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">If it were found that the value of the real estate and the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services were treated by the parties in making the contract as commensurate, yet recovery can be had solely on the ground that, the contract having been repudiated by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled only to payment for services actually rendered. <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>116 Mass. 416, 417, and cases cited. <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>177 Mass. 290, 293. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>181 Mass. 122. <em>DeMontague </em>v. <em>Bacharach, </em>187 Mass. 128, 133, 134, 135. <em>Cromwell v. Norton, </em>193 Mass. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The plaintiff is given leave to amend within thirty days after rescript by adding a proper count to the declaration in accordance with the opinion, or by changing from law into equity for specific performance, joining with the administratrix the heirs at law as parties defendant, upon such terms as the trial court may order; and thereupon the verdict is to be set aside and the case is to stand for trial. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 125. <em>Williams </em>v. Carty, 205 Mass. 396. If, however, the plaintiff does not amend, the entry will be judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
