If the court finds as a matter of fact, that the defendant paid this money over to his ward, with the further fact, that the said ward has since reached his majority, and said defendant has filed his first and final account in said guardianship, and had the same allowed by Probate Court, this court must still find that that is no defence to the defendant in this action, and order a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d The judge ruled that the filing and allowance of a final account as guardian was not a defence but declined to order a verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">\u201c 3. If the court finds that the defendant received and cashed this check of $200 which was given him by John J. Flynn, Esquire, as a deposit on the Thomas McDonough property which was about to be sold by the plaintiff as administrator with the will annexed of said estate, and that the defendant did not turn over the same to said administrator, or account to him for the same, then the court must find as a matter of law that the defendant owes the plaintiff the sum of $200 for money had and received to the plaintiff\u2019s use, and order a verdict for the plaintiff under his second count in his declaration.\u201d The judge found that the defendant did account to the plaintiff for this $200 and for that reason denied this request.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">\u201c 4. If the court is satisfied that the shares of each of the three persons entitled thereto (after paying Bessie Been her $5) viz: the widow, Mary E.

Flynn, Esquire, as a deposit, a further check of $1,200 from the administrator with the will annexed, then the court must rule as a matter of law that the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>third count in said declaration, and order a verdict for the plaintiff upon said third count.\u201d The judge stated that he did not find that Mary E. McDonough was entitled to $1,040, and that this request therefore was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">\u201c 5.

The administrator also received $23.40 \u201cfrom an insurance policy\u201d making the total amount $3,523.40 for which he was chargeable, and after deducting debts and expenses of administration there remained for distribution $3,143.64. By his will the testator after a legacy of \u201cfive dollars\u201d to his daught\u00e9r Bessie Been, devised all his estate in equal shares to his daughter Mary E. McDonough, now by marriage Mary E.' Mangini, and his son Albert McDonough, a minor, subject however to the following condition: \u201c In the event of my said daughter Mary E. McDonough entering the married state it is my will and I hereby give bequeath and devise all my real estate to my said son Albert McDonough, said daughter Mary E. McDonough to receive in lieu of said real estate the sum of five hundred dollars.\u201d The daughter having married after the death of her father, and the real property having been converted into money, Albert, if nothing further appeared, would be entitled to $3,143.46 less the legacies to Bessie and Mary. <em>Thissell </em>v. <em>Schillinger, </em>186 Mass. 180. <em>Renwick </em>v. <em>Macomber, 225 </em>Mass. 380. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>233 Mass. 481. But the widow, who waived her rights under the will, having received as her distributive share $1,040.02 the balance coming to Albert would be $1,598.44. The plaintiff however having paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>to the assignee under Mary\u2019s assignment $700, as stated in the record and shown by his final account which has been duly allowed, and to the defendant as guardian of Albert $1,400, sues to recover back $360 of this amount, upon the ground as he testified that the payment to the guardian was made by mistake. We find no explanation in the record why the payment to the assignee was in excess of the legacy, but whatever the circumstances may have been the defendant apparently does not question its validity; nor is it material. If allowed, the amount still due Albert would be $1,398.44. It appears that the defendant actually received for his ward $1,384.04, for he testified and the judge could find, that the difference of $15.96 was retained in payment of an account between himself and the plaintiff. The judge accordingly was warranted in finding on the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, that there had been no overpayment to the guardian, and the fourth request was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The assignment given by Mary was rightly admitted. It was honored by the plaintiff and in the settlement of the estate she was entitled to her legacy, which proportionately diminished the amount coming to Albert, and the evidence, instead of being prejudicial, was for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The admission of the final account of the defendant as guardian, which had been allowed before the present action was brought, was not erroneous.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No contractual relations ever existed between the plaintiff and the defendant in his representative capacity. The ward had become of age, and the allowance of the account showed that the money received from the plaintiff had been duly paid over. It is settled that the ward during guardianship, and not the guardian, is the only party in all actions concerning his title or estate. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>99 Mass. 29. <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>155 Mass. 136, 137, 138. <em>Mee </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>190 Mass. 40. And when minority terminates and he comes into possession of personal property formerly in control of the guardian as in the case at bar, those who claim title thereto in whole or in part must sue him and not his former guardian. <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>128 Mass. 116, 118. <em>Lanman </em>v. <em>Lanman, </em>206 Mass. 488, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The fifth and sixth requests that as matter of law the plaintiff was entitled to recover could not have been given. The third request is disposed of by the judge\u2019s finding. The ruling under the second request, that, while the filing and allowance of the guardian\u2019s first and final account is no defence, yet the court declines to order a verdict for the plaintiff, was sufficiently favorable. See <em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>131 Mass. 397, 401-404; <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>190 Mass. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We perceive no reversible error of law at the trial, and the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The bill of exceptions stated: \u201cAlbert McDonough became' twenty-one years of age before the bringing of this action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
