The landlord must maintain the doors, door ways, entry ways and stairways used in common by the tenants and their families in proper condition and if through failure to do this in respect to any or all of these things the plaintiff,- in the exercise of due care, fell and was injured, your verdict should be for her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If you believe the defendant allowed any door, door way, entry way or stairway used in common by the tenants and .their families to be in a dangerous condition, any or all, that is in violation of St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, and evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">\u201c3. If you believe the defendant allowed the door, door way, entry way or stairway used in common by the tenants or their families to be in a dangerous condition, any or all, and in consequence thereof the plaintiff, in the exercise of due care, was injured, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>If you believe the tenement house where the plaintiff lived consisted of more than eight tenements in a building more than three stories high, the failure to light an entry way and stairway used in common by the tenants and their families is in violation of the Spec. St. 1915, c. 352, \u00a7 4, and evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">The first and third instructions were given substantially as asked.

The building was owned by the defendant and consisted of ten apartments and a store. The tenants had a right to use the roof for the purpose of drying clothes. It was reached from inside the building by means of a stairway to a pent house from which a door led directly to the closed area of the roof. Upon the elevated threshold of the doorway, there was a piece of zinc, and there was evidence that it projected above the threshold. Upon this zinc, the plaintiff testified, she tripped and fell down the stairs. The pent house, stairway and hallway were dark at the time of the accident, and there was no means of lighting them. This condition had existed from the beginning of the tenancy of the plaintiff\u2019s husband to the time of the accident. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The case is before us on exceptions to the exclusion of evidence, to the refusal of the presiding judge to give certain requests for rulings, and to his interpretation of certain statutes hereafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The defendant offered evidence to show that at the time of the accident the zinc on the threshold was not raised up, as witnesses for the plaintiff had testified. In order to meet this defence the plaintiff offered \u201cto show by more witnesses in rebuttal that a piece of tin or zinc . . . [had stuck] up from this threshold for at least three months next prior to the injury.\u201d This testimony was a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief and should then have been introduced; the judge in his discretion rightfully could exclude it. <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>186 Mass. 4. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Coal Co. </em>195 Mass. 399. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>220 Mass. 262, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s requests 1 and 3 were substantially covered by the instructions. The second request could not properly have been given. St. 1907, c. 550, is an act relative to the construction, alteration and maintenance of buildings in the city of Boston. Section 127 is as follows: \u201cEvery structure and part thereof and appurtenant thereto shall be maintained in such repair as not to be dangerous. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all buildings and structures . . . .\u201d This statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>does not in express terms attempt to modify or affect in any way the relations between landlord and tenant as they exist at common law, <em>Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>233 Mass. 451, <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Bixby, </em>237 Mass. 249; and such relations are not to be affected by implication in construing the statute, which is wholly inapplicable to the case at bar. <em>Palmigiani </em>v. <em>D\u2019Argenio, </em>234 Mass. 434, 436. The fourth request was rightly refused. The judge instructed the jury that to come ydthin Spec. St. <em>1915, </em>c. 352, \u00a7 4 (which statute amends St. 1907, c. 550), a tenement house must consist of more than three stories occupied as tenements. This was correct, and was in accordance with the language of the statute, which provides in part that \u201cPublic halls and stairs in all tenement houses now existing or hereafter erected more than three stories in height, and having more than eight suites, shall be provided with proper and sufficient lights to be kept lighted during the night.\u201d The judge rightly instructed the jury that the statute did not apply to the building in question. Manifestly a story in a building comprehends the space between floors. This building consisted of but three floors and therefore was not a building to which the statute applied. The definition of the story of a building in St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 11, as \u201cThat part of a building between the top of any floor beams and the top of the floor or roof beams next above\u201d is not at variance with the conclusion reached, \u2014 the top of the third story was the roof of the building. No error of law appears in the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
