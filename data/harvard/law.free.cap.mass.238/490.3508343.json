The plaintiff testified that he made an agreement in writing for the purchase of certain land free from all incumbrances except a certain mortgage; that he left this contract at the office of the defendant, telling the man in charge that he had purchased the property referred to therein and directing the examination of the title \u201caccording to this paper,\u201d adding \u201cThat tells you the whole story; \u201d that he did not ask for the issuance of a policy insuring the title; that later, on his inquiring as to when the title could be passed, he was asked by some one representing the defendant whether he wanted the title insured; that he replied, in substance, that he did not think it necessary to incur the expense thereof if the title was clear; that he then was told that he could have the insurance for the amount paid for the examination of title and that he assented to that arrangement; that, when papers were passed, he did not ask nor was he told whether the title was clear, and no abstract of title was read to him; that the defendant then gave him a receipt specifying that it was for money paid by him as a charge for examining title and passing papers; that conveyance was made to him by a warranty deed subject only to the mortgage specified in the agreement. Three months later a policy of insurance was delivered to the plaintiff by the defendant, insuring the real estate free from incumbrances except the mortgage and an easement. The plaintiff did not examine the policy until six months after he received it, when he first learned of the easement. The agreement for the purchase of the land was admitted in evidence subject to an exception by the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b516-9\">(1) The agreement was admissible in evidence as a part of the plaintiff\u2019s instructions to the defendant;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b516-10\">(2) The defendant\u2019s liability was not as a matter of law confined to the provisions of the policy, but a finding was warranted that the defendant acted not merely as an insurer but also as the plaintiff\u2019s paid agent in examining the title;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b516-12\">(3) A finding was warranted that the defendant\u2019s employees negligently had failed to communicate the existence of the easement to the plaintiff before he accepted conveyance of the premises.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>At the trial above described, one, who was a bookkeeper for the defendant at the time of the transaction in question, testified that a slip of paper shown to him was written in the ordinary course of his business and showed that the plaintiff wanted a title insurance policy in a stated amount, \u201cthat the work was to be completed \u201d by a certain date and the plaintiff notified when the defendant was ready to pass papers, and that the paper did not refresh his recollection of the conversation he had had with the plaintiff \u201calthough there was a standard conversation for every client.\u201d It did not appear that the paper ever was read by or shown to the plaintiff.

Hodge, called by the plaintiff, testified that he was in the real estate business about one and one half or two miles from Kendrick Street, that he had been in the real estate business for twenty years and in that time had built and sold one hundred houses and had also bought and sold land in several places; that in Brighton, about a mile from the plaintiff\u2019s property, he had bought land and built fifteen houses; that he had been a director and on the investment committee of the Brighton Co-operative Bank since it was organized in 1911 and had examined for the bank one piece of property in Newton upon which a mortgage was given; that at one time he lived in Watertown very near the Newton line and had occasion to go back and forth, driving by the property involved in this action, a great many times, although the bulk of his business had been done in Newton; that he had bought and sold two houses on Algonquin Road, which is about one half mile from Kendrick Street and about a mile from the plaintiff\u2019s land; that values in the place he built and around Kendrick Street are about the same, and that in Newton they are a little higher than in Brighton; that, within a quarter of a mile or so, there had been no particular development on a large scale for a great many years; that he was familiar with the plaintiff\u2019s property and had examined it at the request of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-13\">The judge having ruled that he might testify as an expert, the witness then testified that the fair market value of the land in question in July, 1915,. \u201c without the right of way was $30,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and that although $8,000 for the land was a very good buy it would be a better bargain without the right of way; that subject to the right of way the property was worth $1,500 less regardless whether the valuation of the land at $30,000 was correct; and that his reason for this statement was that the right of way might result in a one way street if the plaintiff should divide the land into house lots; that the value of the land was about ten cents a square foot, so that a strip alone being three hundred and forty-nine by twenty feet would be worth $698.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">Other material evidence is described in the opinion.

That if the policy of insurance issued to the plaintiff by the defendant specifically sets out the right of way which is the subject of the litigation between the parties, the plaintiff had notice of said defect of title and is not entitled to recover.\u201d Upon this request the judge ruled: <em>\u201c </em>In the sense that he could not recover on the policy, granted; in the sense that he cannot recover on the evidence, refused.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-11\">\u201c 6. That the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the land with the easement and what it would be worth without the easement and the plaintiff\u2019s damage is in proportion to the actual damage in the ratio that the sum of $2,000 bears to the full value of the property.\u201d Upon this request, the judge ruled: \u201c First part of sixth request granted; last part, viz: beginning with \u2018 and the plaintiff\u2019s damage, etc.,\u2019 refused.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $500; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-3\"><em>J.

It is agreed that the defendant Massachusetts Title Insurance Company was authorized to and often did \u201cact in the capacity of a conveyancer, that it examined titlejY] and furnished information in relation thereto, and also acted in the capacity of an insurer of titles in the conduct of its general business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the following facts could have been found: The plaintiff became a party to a written contract whereby he agreed to purchase land in Newton which was to be conveyed to him, by a deed of warranty, free from all incumbrances except a mortgage described in the agreement. He left this contract at the office of the defendant, telling the man in charge that he had purchased the property referred to therein and directing the examination of the title \u201c according to this paper,\u201d adding \u201c That tells you the whole story.\u201d He did not ask for the issuance of a policy insuring the title. At a later date on his inquiry as to when the title could be passed, he was asked by some one representing the defendant whether he wanted the title insured and he replied, in substance, that he did not think it necessary to incur the expense thereof if the title was clear. He was then told that he could have the insurance for the amount paid for the examination of title; to this he assented. When the papers were passed, he did not ask nor was he told whether the title was clear, and no abstract of title was read to him. The plaintiff then received from the defendant a receipt which specified that it was for money paid by him as a charge for passing papers and examining title. The deed was of warranty and purported to convey the premises free from all incumbrances except the mortgage referred to in the agreement. A policy of insurance.was made by the defendant, but it was not delivered to the plaintiff until about three months after the papers had been passed. It insured the plaintiff\u2019s title to the land as free from all incumbrances which are here of importance, except the mortgage referred to and a right of way twenty feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>width. The easement referred to in the policy in fact existed and was an incumbrance upon the plaintiff\u2019s land. The plaintiff did not know of its existence until about nine months after he had acquired title. He then for the first time examined the policy and found that the way was excepted from it, but that it was not mentioned in his deed. The evidence offered in behalf of the defendant was in many respects in sharp conflict with that of the plaintiff; but it need not be rehearsed. The judge, who was not bound to follow it, found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Certain exceptions of the defendant are not argued and are treated as waived. Others, however, fully present all the contentions made at the trial, except an exception to the admission in evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s agreement for the purchase of the property. It could have been found that this agreement had been delivered to the defendant for its use and guidance in representing the plaintiff. The agreement if so delivered clearly was aclmissible, as it defined the property and title which the plaintiff was entitled to receive; and it informed the defendant of the facts necessary to be known by it if it was properly to safeguard the plaintiff\u2019s interests. It constituted a part of the instructions given the defendant. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>191 Mass. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The defendant contends that its sole liability is as an insurer of title, and that its obligation to the plaintiff is measured by the terms of the policy. This contention is without merit. The judge was well warranted in finding that the defendant acted not merely as insurer but as the plaintiff\u2019s paid agent in examining the title, and that although those who acted in its behalf knew that there was a right of way over the property, they negligently failed to disclose its existence to the plaintiff, who relied solely on the defendant to protect his interests and was ignorant of the existence of any incumbrance until after he had paid his money and received the deed, which was silent as to any easement in the premises conveyed. The defendant was liable tp the plaintiff for the injury caused by this negligence of its authorized representatives. <em>Ehmer v. Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co. </em>156 N. Y. 10. <em>Trimboli </em>v. <em>Kinkel, </em>226 N. Y. 147. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>91 N. J. L. 404. <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>100 U. S. 195.

The person making the slip was permitted to testify as to all that occurred at the time it was made and to use it to refresh his memory. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>223 Mass. 152. <em>Rhoades </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>227 Mass. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">The assessors\u2019 valuation of the property was not admissible to determine its value. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>222 Mass. 504, 516, and cases cited. See St. 1919, c. 297; G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 35; G. L. c. 185, \u00a7109.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The witness called by the plaintiff to testify as an expert was properly permitted to express an opinion as to the damages caused by the existence of the right of way. The question of his competency was one of fact; it could not be said that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the admission of his testimony. <em>Klous </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Mass. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
