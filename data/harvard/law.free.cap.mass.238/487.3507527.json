The suit then was referred to a master before whom it proceeded against the defendant superintendent \u00f3f streets only. Material findings \"of 'the master are described in the opinion. After the filing of his report the suit was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., by whose order there were entered an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report and a final decree dismissing the bill; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-7\"><em>H.

It is settled by <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>188 Mass. 301, that, even if the defendant was superintendent of streets, he is liable for acts of personal misfeasance in the performance of his duty when operating the quarry leased by the town for the purpose of obtaining material in maintaining its highways. The plaintiff asks for injunctive relief restraining him when quarrying from throwing fragments of rock on to her premises, or causing the house to shake, and its walls to crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The general law often has been stated. The defendant undoubtedly had the right to work the quarry to obtain material for making or mending the public ways.' But in so doing he was bound to prevent fragments of rock from falling or being thrown upon the plaintiff\u2019s land and to take every reasonable precaution that the blasts should not be so violent and successive as to shake or materially injure the house. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>106 Mass. 194, 199. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Farren, </em>127 Mass. 481. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 377, 386, 387. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Hanreddy, </em>212 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>341. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>216 Mass. 486. See <em>Cremidas </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>223 Mass. 249, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The statements of the master that the \u201c operation of the quarry is a valuable asset to the town\u201d and the \u201c blasting operations have now reached a stage which renders it unlikely that any rocks from blasting will be thrown upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises during the future operations and the only source from which she may be likely to suffer is through concussion from the larger blasts,\u201d and that other houses in the neighborhood have not been shaken, is' neither a justification for what had been done, nor a guaranty' against repetition which the plaintiff is bound to accept. It appears from the report that pieces of rock have fallen on the premises, and some of the \u201cdeep blasts\u201d have caused vibrations of the house causing cracks to appear in the plastering, and glass has been cracked in the greenhouses. <em>'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The further finding that the probable danger of substantial damage or injury to the plaintiff from the operation of the quarry would not be commensurate with the injury which would result to the town if it should be obliged to give up the operation of the quarry, has a bearing only on the question whether the plaintiff should be remitted to an action at law for future wrongs reasonably to be anticipated, or threatened, from the manner in which heretofore the quarry has been continuously operated. But, even if there may be a remedy at law, this is not necessarily an objection, and much less is it a bar to relief by injunction. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>177 Mass. 230. <em>Szathmary </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>214 Mass. 42, 45. The defendant, moreover, as the report states, \u201cadmits that the quarry could have been and may be operated in such a manner that rocks would not be thrown upon adjoining premises and that houses in the vicinity would not be shaken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">It follows, that the decree dismissing the bill as to the town is affirmed, but as to the defendant it is reversed, and a decree with costs is to be entered enjoining him from so operating the quarry as to cause stones' or fragments of stone to fall, or be thrown upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and so to regulate the blasts that the house will not be damaged by the vibrations. <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Washburn Iron Co. </em>13 Allen, 95. <em>Boston Ferrule Co. </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>159 Mass. 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
