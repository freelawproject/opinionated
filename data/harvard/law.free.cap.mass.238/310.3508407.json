L. c. 186, \u00a7 12.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-10\">A landlord of premises, let by a tenancy at will to a tenant who had agreed to pay rent monthly in advance, also was mortgagee of certain furniture on the premises, and, four days after the tenant failed to pay the rent when it became due, gave to the tenant a notice in writing to quit in fourteen days and within fourteen days thereafter took formal possession of the mortgaged personal property on the premises and caused to be given to the tenant a letter, stating that he had \u201cstarted to foreclose the mortgage of personal property\u201d on the premises, and had \u201calso taken possession of the same, and therefore you have no right to remove the furniture etc. . . . even though\u201d the landlord \u201chas given you notice to quit the premises.\u201d The tenant surrendered the keys of the premises after the conclusion of the month. At the trial of an action of contract for rent due, the defendant contended that the above facts constituted an eviction which, occurring within the month, relieved the tenant of any obligation to pay rent for that month. The judge found that there was no eviction. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was warranted as a finding of fact and a ruling of law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-11\">Contract, with a declaration as amended upon an account annexed for $80 with two items as follow's: \u201c (1) To use and occupation of premises at 29 Upton Street, Boston, Mass., from April 20, 1919, to May 9, 1919, as tenant at will, $47.50; (2) To use and occupation of premises at 29 Upton Street Boston, Mass, from May 9, 1919, to May 22, 1919, as tenant at sufferance, $32.50.\u201d Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated May 22, 1919.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-12\">All the.material evidence at the trial in the Municipal Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for the following rulings:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">\u201c1. That upon all the evidence in the case the finding should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">\u201c2.

That if the plaintiff rented to the defendant the premises for a period of one month and payment of said rent was monthly and if the plaintiff had evicted the defendant from the said premises before the expiration of the month, he cannot recover any rent for the whole period of said month under the terms of the month as rented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\">\u201c4. That when the plaintiff notified the defendant that she cannot remove from the premises furniture which she owns and which are in the said premises, the same amounts to an eviction, if she was notified to vacate the said premises by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-9\">\u201c5. That if the plaintiff sues the defendant a woman, for necessaries and the said woman is married and has a husband living in the Commonwealth, before the plaintiff can recover he must prove that he has complied with the provisions of the statute as therein provided, before he can recover against the female defendant in an action for necessaries.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">The rulings were refused.

The case is before this court on the appeal of the defendant from a decision, \u201cReport dismissed,\u201d of the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">The report discloses that on March 20, 1919, the plaintiff sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to the defendant certain furniture and good will of a lodging house business at 29 Upton Street, Boston, for $1,000, receiving for the same the sum of $500 in cash and a mortgage for $500. It also discloses that the plaintiff on the same day demised by paroi the premises at 29 Upton Street to the defendant at a rent of $75 per month, payable in advance; that the defendant paid one month\u2019s rent and received the following receipt: \u201cMarch 20, 1919. Received of Mary Lawlor, seventy five dollars Rent of House No. 29 Upton St., for one month ending April 20, 1919. $75. . . . M. W. Dowd.\u201d On April 20, 1919, the plaintiff demanded of the defendant the payment of a month\u2019s rent, which the defendant refused to pay. On April 25, 1919, the plaintiff served on the defendant the following notice: \u201cBoston, Mass. April 25, 1919. Mrs. Mary Lawlor, Dear Madam: I hereby notify you to quit and deliver up in fourteen days from the date thereof the premises which you now hold as my tenant at 29 Upton St. in the city of Boston. . . . Michael W. Dowd.\u201d The plaintiff has not asked of the defendant any rent since April 20, 1919, when the defendant refused to pay him rent; and he received the keys from the defendant on May 25, 1919, she occupying the premises until May 22 or 23, 1919. Somqtime after April 25 and before April 29, the plaintiff took formal possession of the mortgaged property in said premises, and caused his attorney to write the following letter to the defendant: \u201cApril 28, 1919. Mrs. Mary Lawlor, 29 Upton St. Boston, Mass. Dear Madam: As you are aware, Mr. Dowd has started to foreclose the mortgage of personal property at 29 Upton St., which you gave him in March. He has also taken possession of the same, and therefore you have no right to remove the furniture etc. from 29 Upton St. even though he has given you notice to quit the premises. Sincerely Yours, . . . .\u201d The foregoing is stated to be \u201call the evidence material to the question reported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The defendant in the Municipal Court presented certain requests for rulings. He now argues those numbered 1, 3 and 4; and we assume waives those numbered 2 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The request for a ruling \u201cThat upon all the evidence in the case the finding should be for the defendant,\u201d was properly refused. The facts establish that on April 21, 1919, the defendant by her contract of March 20, 1919, was obligated to pay the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>$75 as advance rent. The premature demand of the rent by the plaintiff on April 20, 1919, and the justifiable refusal of payment by the defendant, had no legal effect on the rights arising under the contract. The plaintiff was not required to demand the payment of rent at the time it became due and payable as a condition to his right to sue for its recovery. Nor was he required to make such demand as a condition to his right to determine the tenancy at will upon the failure, neglect or refusal of the defendant to pay the rent when it fell due. R. L. c. 129, \u00a7 12. G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 12. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>6 Gray, 224. <em>Hodgkins </em>v. <em>Price, </em>137 Mass. 13, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The finding of the Municipal Court that the plaintiff did not evict the defendant from the premises is supported as a finding of fact and as a ruling of law by the reported facts, which show that the defendant had the use and actual possession of the premises and mortgaged furniture until she surrendered the premises and delivered the keys to the plaintiff on May 25, 1919. It follows that the requests for rulings numbered 3 and 4 were refused rightly, and that the order \"Report dismissed\u201d must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
