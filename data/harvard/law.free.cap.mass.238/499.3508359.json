At the request of the defendant the jury were asked special questions from the answers to which it appeared that, while they returned general verdicts for both plaintiffs, they assessed part of said damages for slander, part for assault and part for false imprisonment. <em>Held, </em>that the exception to the refusal of the request, even when the request was read in connection with the answers of the jury to the special questions, must be overruled.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">Two actions of tobt ob contbact with a declaration in five counts, all for the same cause of action, the first four counts in each action being in tort for trespass, assault and battery and false imprisonment, false arrest, and slander, respectively. In the fifth count in each action it was alleged in substance that the two plaintiffs, husband and wife, were upon application by the husband assigned to a room in the Hotel Langham, of which the defendant George H. Page (hereinafter called the defendant) was proprietor, and were escorted by an employee of the defendant to a room on the fifth floor of the hotel and were given the key to the room, \u201c and that the plaintiff and his wife became guests of said management, and became entitled to an exclusive right to the use of said room, free from annoyance, discomfort, insult or injury; \u201d that notwithstanding their exclusive right to the room as guests of the defendant innkeeper, on or about the morning of November 19, 1918, the defendant, personally and by his servants, agents and employees, together with a police officer there present at the instigation and by the procurement of the defendant, wrongfully and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>by force entered the sleeping apartment of the plaintiffs without cause, and disturbed their rest and quiet, intruded upon their privacy, and assaulted them and restrained them of their liberty against their will and to their great humiliation, and publicly and maliciously in the presence of divers persons used abusive, threatening and slanderous language of and concerning the plaintiffs accusing them of the crime of having had illicit sexual intercourse and of being in the hotel contrary to the provisions of St. 1918, c. 259, all by words substantially as follows: \u201cWhat do you mean being here with this woman? \u2014 You don\u2019t belong in this bedroom with this woman and if you don\u2019t get out, I am going to get a police officer and put you out. \u2014 I intend to put you out of here \u2014 Tell us, who is the little girl you have with yoii. \u2014 May be she is registered and he (meaning the plaintiff) has slipped into the room with her over night. \u2014 \u201d and so injured the character of the plaintiffs and caused them great humiliation and mental anguish and anxiety; and \u201cthat by this breach of duty to the plaintiff while a guest of the defendant innkeeper your plaintiff has suffered great damage as in his writs alleged. And this count in contract and the above counts in tort are for one arid the same cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">The actions were tried together before <em>Hall, </em>J. Material evidence and exceptions saved by the defendant are described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved that the plaintiffs be compelled to elect as to whether their cases would go to the jury on the counts in contract or on the counts in tort. The judge thereupon required the plaintiffs to elect and they elected to proceed on the counts in contract. The defendant thereupon requested the judge to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs could not recover on their counts in contract for any damages resulting from words spoken, the slander, false imprisonment, assault and battery or for the humiliation, but could only recover for the value of the room. The request was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">Special questions were put to the jury at the request of the defendant in both actions, which, with the answers were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">\u201c 1.

Page, and the question, whether they had been properly registered as required by St. 1918, c.259, \u00a7 5, has been answered in the affirmative by the jury. A finding would have been warranted that while in bed in a room assigned to them to which they had been escorted and given a key, three employees of the defendant entered, followed by the defendant with a police officer, and, although ordered to leave the hotel, the plaintiffs refused compliance with the order. And evidence was offered \u201c of an assault, of false imprisonment, and slander, all incidental to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the quiet enjoyment of their room, but the defendant offered evidence to dispute this.\u201d We assume that this summary refers to what took place after the defendant came in, arid that the jury could find that he acted as the proprietor in control of the hotel, and the employees and police officer were present at his direction and solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The action is in tort or contract. But, at the plaintiffs\u2019 election by order of the court, on motion of the defendants, the cases were submitted to the jury on the counts in contract, and general verdicts were returned for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The jury having specially found that the plaintiffs had duly registered, they were rightly in occupation. The defendants\u2019 fifth and sixth requests, that if the plaintiffs were violating the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>in occupying a room without having been properly registered \u201c they are precluded from recovering for any injury suffered while in the room,\u201d and the defendant was \"justified in entering the room for the purpose of learning whether the law had been complied with and if the occupants refused to assist him in his inquiry he is justified in assuming that their presence is unlawful and can use any reasonable means to remove them,\u201d are no longer material. See St. 1918, c. 259, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The questions raised by the seventh request, whether the defendant was \u201c responsible for the acts of the police officer done by the police officer while in the performance of his lawful duty,\u201d and \u201cthat the police officer was acting within the scope of his lawful duty in entering the room ... to investigate into the right of their presence there,\u201d were for the jury under suitable instructions. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jacot, </em>235 Mass. 521. The eighth request that if the defendant had no intention of frightening the plaintiffs but merely went to the room to ascertain whether they \u201chad a right to be there,\u201d he was not responsible \u201c for her fright or the consequent injury to her health;\u201d is not supported by any legal presumption. The defendant was not justified in assuming that the plaintiffs were not registered. The hotel registry disclosed their names,\"and he could not for this reason intrude upon their privacy. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>11 Pick. 379, 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">It is necessary however to ascertain the respective rights of the parties upon which the defendant\u2019s remaining requests must rest. The defendant urges that consequential damages for breach of contract are limited to such damages as were within the contemplation of the parties at the time of entering into the agreement. But it was held in <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>4 Cush. 114, 121; 50 Am. Dec. 760, that a plaintiff who had lost a trunk and its contents while a guest at the defendant\u2019s hotel could declare in case or assumpsit. \u201c The plaintiff may set forth a duty, and aver a fact in violation of it as a tort, or aver an implied promise to perform it, and a failure to perform that promise.\u201d <em>Vannah </em>v. <em>Hart Private Hospital, </em>228 Mass. 132. <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Norcross, </em>53 Maine, 116. The contract was not merely for the use of the room and entertainment, but for immunity from rudeness, personal abuse and unjustifiable interference, whether exerted by the defendant or his servants, or those under his control or acting under his orders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The plaintiffs having duly registered and been put in possession of a room for their exclusive use had the right of occupation for all lawful purposes until vacated, subject only to the access of the defendant at reasonable times and in a proper manner for such purposes as might be necessary in the general management of the hotel, or upon the happening of some unanticipated, controlling emergency. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>7 Met. 596, 601. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Carraher, </em>195 Mass. 392. <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>193 N. Y. 397. <em>Lehnen </em>v. <em>E. J. Hines &amp; Co. </em>88 Kans. 58. If, without any sufficient reason appearing in the record, the defendant, who is not shown to have given any previous notice or made any request for their departure, entered the room for the purpose of compelling them to vacate, he is liable in damages if excessive force or coercion or intimidation, was used, or his conduct toward the plaintiffs was abusive, insulting, and wanting in ordinary respect and decency. And his tenth request, that, if as owner of the hotel he entered the room \u201c for the purpose of inspecting the same and seeing that the rules of the hotel and all statutory regulations were complied with then he was acting within the scope of his legal right and was not a trespasser,\u201d is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions are not stated, and it must be inferred as against the excepting party, that they were correct and sufficient. <em>Khron </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>144 Mass. 516, 519. The jury could find that after entering the room he engaged in the wrongful acts charged without justification or excuse. See <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Carraher, </em>195 Mass. 392. The general law is well settled. The guest is entitled to respectful and considerate treatment at the hands of the innkeeper and his employees and servants, and this right created an implied obligation that neither the innkeeper nor his servants will abuse or insult the guest, or engage in any conduct or speech which may unreasonably subject him to physical discomfort or distress of mind or imperil his safety<em>. Lehnen </em>v. <em>E. J. Hines &amp; Co. </em>88 Kans. 58. <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>193 N. Y. 397. <em>Morningstar </em>v. <em>Lafayette Hotel Co. </em>211 N. Y. 465. <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Schlosser, </em>159 Penn. St. 480. 14 R. C. L. Innkeepers, \u00a7 11, and notes. And he can recover damages for injury to his feelings resulting from the humiliation to which he has been subjected. <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>71 Neb. 83. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>203 N. Y. 151. <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>193 N. Y. 397, 401. <em>Head </em>v. <em>Georgia Pacific Railroad, </em>79 Ga. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The plaintiffs are not shown to have annoyed or disturbed other .guests, or to have improperly demeaned themselves, or to have violated any rules of the hotel, and under suitable instructions the .jury on conflicting evidence could find the defendant had been guilty of assault, false imprisonment and slander, by \u201c words .spoken . . . imputing a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It follows that the plaintiffs\u2019 four requests, that if they were unlawfully restrained of their liberty the defendant is liable in damages, and if he incited, encouraged, or countenanced the presence and acts of the officer he is liable therefor, and that damages may be assessed for humiliation and injury to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings, as well as for unwarranted disturbance of his right of privacy and exclusive use of the room for himself and wife, and that even if the entry of the defendant arose from some mistake made by him or his agents \u201c in his records \u201d such mistake would not amount to a justification, were unexceptionable. The defendant\u2019s ninth request that if the plaintiff suffered no physical injury \u201c she cannot recover for mental suffering,\u201d was properly denied. As we have said he could not treat the plaintiffs with contumely by the use of insolent language concerning them, specifically set forth in the declaration, and referred to, and characterized in the record as \u201cslander,\u201d which the jury could say caused the plaintiffs not only physical\u2019 annoyance and discomfort, but also worry and distress of mind. <em>DeWolf </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>193 N. Y. 397, 401. The defendant\u2019s duty in this respect is analogous to that of a common carrier of passengers. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, 7 </em>Met. 596, 601. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>206 Mass. 477, 485. <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>97 Cal. 1. In uttering incriminating words in the presence of his servants, and the police officer, the defendant violated his contractual obligation to the plaintiffs as guests, of courtesy and respectful treatment, and freedom from humiliation, contempt and ridicule arising from slanderous verbal attacks. We are^ therefore of opinion that the cases come within the doctrine of <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>106 Mass. 180, and kindred decisions, and the plaintiffs can recover in contract, as fully as if they had sued in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The final request, that they \u201ccould not recover on their counts in contract for any damages resulting from words spoken, the slander, false imprisonment, assault and battery or for the humilia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tian, but could only recover for the value of the room,\u201d even when read in connection with the special answers of the jury to questions propounded by the defendant and submitted \u2018 at his request, is covered by what has been said, and the defendant having failed to show reversible error the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
