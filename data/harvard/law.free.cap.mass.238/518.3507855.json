On September 24, 1914, an order was entered by direction of <em>Wait, </em>J., which recited that, it appearing that the auditor, as master when the action was a suit in equity, \u201cheard the parties and their evidence at great length, and filed a report as master stating his findings of fact on the issues involved; that this report was confirmed by this court and that confirmation affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court; that the cause was held improperly before this court in equity and has been transferred to the law side of this court; that no new issues are involved; that the cause has been sent to . . . [the same man] as auditor; that the evidence presented to him as master was taken stenographically and is now accessible to him and to the parties; that unnecessary repetition of the testimony or arguments ought not to be permitted; it is ordered that said auditor may in his discretion, without further hearing of evidence, make as his auditor\u2019s report the whole or any part of his earlier report as master and that he shall not be required to hear anew any evidence offered before him when sitting as master. Any party may by objection or request raise any question of law by him de\u00e9med proper in regard to the admission or application of evidence, or otherwise, as though the witness were present and testifying, or the ruling were made at the hearing before the auditor at which such objection or request is made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">The auditor reviewed his own report formerly made as master and adopted his findings then made with changes now immaterial, neither considering anew a stenographic copy of the evidence taken before him when master nor hearing further evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-6\">After motions by the defendant to recommit and to discharge the report of the auditor had been denied, the action was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J., upon the report and other evidence.

The auditor\u2019s findings of fact shall be prima <em>facie </em>evidence upon such matters only as are embraced in the order; but the court at the trial shall exclude any finding of fact which appears in the report to be based upon an erroneous opinion of law, or upon evidence which is inadmissible. Whenever the auditor makes a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence and objection is taken thereto he shall, if requested so to do, make a statement of such ruling in his report.

L. c. 173, \u00a7 52, as amended by St. 1911, c. 275, changing the suit into an action at law, and the case was referred to an auditor who had acted as special master in the former proceedings. The auditor, subject to the objection of the defendant Miller to whom we shall refer as the defendant, admitted the master\u2019s report, and no further evidence being offered he found the facts substantially as set forth by the master, and upon the coming in of the report the defendant moved that it be discharged and recommitted. The motion having been denied, the plaintiff offered the report in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dence, to the admission of which the defendant excepted because the findings of the auditor did not appear to be based on any competent evidence, and that in so far \u201c as the report relied on the authority of the order \u201d of the court \u201c with respect to the taking of evidence and the use of the earlier report of the master, exceeding the ordinary powers of an auditor in such matters, it was inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">It was settled before the enactment of St. 1914, c. 576, that rulings of law contained in the report of an auditor constituted no part of a report which is to be dealt with in the trial before the court only as a recital of facts. <em>Zembler </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>234 Mass. 236. If a party deems himself aggrieved by the admission of incompetent evidence, he must make his objection by a motion to recommit, and, the rule havinig issued, on November 13, 1909, the report was properly admitted. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Wickwire, </em>162 Mass. 143, 145. <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Cawley, </em>218 Mass. 271. See now St. 1914, c. 576, \u00a7 6. <em>D\u2019Urso </em>v. <em>Leone, ante, </em>58.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The order of September 24, 1914, that the auditor may in his discretion without further hearing of evidence make as his report the whole or any part of his report as master, and \u201che shall not be required to hear anew any evidence offered before him when sitting as master \u201d did not exceed the discretionary power of the court. The case having been amended from law into equity, the master\u2019s report could have been treated as having the effect of an auditor\u2019s report. <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>227 Mass. 501, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">It is said in the exceptions that the evidence as reported by the auditor is substantially a correct statement of the facts appearing at the trial in so far as it purported to state them, but further evidence was introduced by the defendant, and upon all the evidence he contends as matter of law that a settlement between him and the plaintiff of all matters in dispute had been effected, and that the action cannot be maintained. It appeared that on March 4, 1904, one Flinn, purporting to act for the plaintiff, entered into an agreement under seal with the defendant whereby the plaintiff upon receipt of \u201cfifteen hundred dollars \u201d which was duly paid, discharged him from all further liability. If the plaintiff is bound by the agreement, it is conceded that the defendant\u2019s request for a directed verdict should have been granted. The defendant\u2019s first contention is, that under Flinn\u2019s contract of employment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the plaintiff, Flinn had authority to make the compromise. The judge rightly ruled as matter of law that the contract did not create a partnership. It shows that he was employed as the plaintiff\u2019s accredited representative in the New England States, \u201cand all business resulting from his efforts and secured by him and accepted by the . . . [plaintiff] within said territory,\u201d or all inquiries received by the plaintiff therefrom were \u201cto be referred\u201d to him. The charter of a plaintiff corporation moreover is the measure of its powers. It is a foreign corporation. It is not shown by any statute of its domicil to have been given authority to enter into a partnership with an individual, and at common law the capacity to form a partnership is not an inherent corporate power. If a \u201ccorporation may enter into partnership with an individual, there would be two principals, the legal person and the natural person, each having, within the scope of the society\u2019s business, full authority to manage its concerns, including even the disposition of its property.\u201d <em>Whittenton Mills </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>10 Gray, 582, 595. The contract of employment, while undoubtedly conferring on Flinn authority to make the agreement with Miller in the name of the company subject to the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance, which was given, and the performance of which by Miller left a very considerable balance due from him to the plaintiff for materials and supplies, did not expressly nor by necessary implication, empower him to accept in settlement a sum much less than ihe amount shown by the account to be due and to execute and deliver an instrument under seal releasing Miller from all indebtedness. <em>Upton </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Mills, </em>11 Cush. 586. <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Pomroy, </em>4 Gray, 128, 131. The power of <em>an </em>agent to cancel a contract of his principal, cannot ordinarily be inferred from a general authority to make the contract. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>10 Met. 160. <em>Craig Silver Co. </em>v. Smith, 163 Mass. 262, 269. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>177 Mass. 457, 466. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>217 Mass. 526. <em>Berthold </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>24 How. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The balance of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness as claimed by the plaintiff was $3,849.90. It appeared and the jury could find that on February 28, 1904, Flinn by letter informed the plaintiff\u2019s president that after a long talk with Miller, \u201c he is going to N. Y. tonight, &amp; will be in to see you in the morning. He proposes to give you a check for $2000.00 &amp; a note for the balance, &amp; clean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the matter up &amp; I advise you to take it,\u201d and that on or about February 29, 1904, the defendant in an interview in New York with the president, claimed that a reduction should be made, and a considerable discount allowed by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the terms of its contract. On March 3, 1904, the president wrote Flinn at Boston enclosing a statement of the account showing the balance due, and directing Flinn to see Miller \u201c without fail and obtain this settlement,\u201d which the jury also could find meant the payment in full of $3,849.90. Flinn on March 4 wrote the defendant enclosing a copy of the president\u2019s letter, and the bill was either transmitted with the letter, or was in the defendant\u2019s possession. It was on this date and under these circumstances that the agreement of compromise was made by Flinn in the name of the plaintiff, and the defendant thereupon paid \u201cfifteen hundred dollars ... to the attorney who accompanied Flinn.\u201d &gt; The plaintiff\u2019s president March 10 having been informed of what had been done sent a telegram to the defendant, saying that Flinn \u201cwas unauthorized to sign receipt as agent or otherwise. The settlement you offered Flinn unsatisfactory and will not be accepted.\u201d It is clear that Flinn\u2019s authority could not be enlarged by his own declarations or acts, <em>Mussey </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>3 Cush. 511, and the judge correctly held that the letter shown to the defendant \u201c did not as a matter of law give him authority to make a compromise settlement.\u201d The ostensible powers of an agent are his real powers, <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>237 Mass. 518, and the only substantial defence remaining is, whether Flinn had been given apparent authority on which the defendant could rely to make the settlement. This was a question of fact on all the evidence. <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Pomroy, </em>4 Gray, 128, 131. <em>Rintamaki </em>v. <em>Cunard Steamship Co. </em>205 Mass. 115. <em>Beaucage </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>206 Mass. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">But even if the jury determined that the compromise was unauthorized, the defendant further contends that acceptance and retention of the money was a ratification. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>157 Mass. 248, 249, 250. The answer is, there was no evidence that the money even came into the plaintiff\u2019s possession. If the settlement was unauthorized, the plaintiff was not chargeable with any payment made to Flinn, or to his counsel, no part of which had ever been forwarded to, or demanded by the plaintiff. \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>meaning of ratification is, and always has been, the adoption of an act purporting to be done, or, at least, done in fact, on behalf of the ratifier.\u201d <em>New England Dredging Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>149 Mass. 381, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The defendant\u2019s requests for a directed verdict, and that it sufficiently appeared that Flinn had authority to make the settlement, and that \u201c the contract between the plaintiff and Flinn and the written instructions to him so far as they were communicated to the defendant authorized Flinn to make the settlement in question,\u201d were rightly refused. The remaining requests, that, if Flinn had authority to employ counsel, a settlement made in pursuance of instructions to the attorney would bind the plaintiff, and that, if such apparent authority appeared, the defendant was justified in making the settlement in accordance with the terms agreed upon with the attorney, were sufficiently covered by the instructions or assumed conclusions of fact on conflicting testimony. <em>Dolphin </em>v. <em>Plumley, </em>175 Mass. 304. <em>Carnes </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>180 Mass. 569. The uncontradicted evidence of Flinn tended to show that in an action brought by him against the company he \u201cunderstood that this amount was credited to the plaintiff by the court,\u201d meaning the \u201cfifteen hundred dollars.\u201d The credibility of the witness however was for the jury, and the defendant as matter of law cannot complain of the instructions, that if the jury found for the plaintiff, the amount paid under the alleged compromise should be deducted, and a verdict returned for the balance, or of the question asked when the verdict was returned, whether such deduction had been made, and the answer in the affirmative, although neither the defendant nor his counsel was present. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>172 Mass. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We have examined all of the defendant\u2019s exceptions, and no error of law appearing they must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
