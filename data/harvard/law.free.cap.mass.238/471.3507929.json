There was evidence that a contract in writing for the purchase and sale of the real estate was signed by the defendant Annie Brooks and that she signed the name of her husband. There was also evidence that she could not read, that the contract was not read to her; that she was not authorized to sign her husband\u2019s name; that she objected to signing; \u201c that she did not know that the contract was right or if she had a right to sign her husband\u2019s name, and that the plaintiff told her it was all right, and she signed relying on his statement.\u201d In the Municipal Court of the City of Boston the judge found for the defendants; and from an order dismissing the report, the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">No question of law is open on this record.
