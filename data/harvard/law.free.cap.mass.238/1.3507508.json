Parts of the master\u2019s findings were in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">\u201cAfter the death of the mother of Mrs. Brett in 1886, a marked change appears in the relations between her and the plaintiff, who, theretofore, had been doing the housework for Mrs. Brett. The plaintiff became more of a companion than a helper. She now did all the cooking and continued this up to the death of Mr. Brett. The drudgery of the heavy housework was transferred to others and the washing was sent out. After Mr. Brett\u2019s death in 1892 the relation became still closer. They were together practically all the time with a fondness and affection, each for the other, the extent and warmth of which was properly described in the bill as \u2018 closely akin to the relationship of parent and child.\u2019 The evidence of this love and devotion comes not alone from the plaintiff, but from relatives and friends of both parties. The unanimous testimony of a large number of witnesses shows a constancy of affection, wonderful in its strength and simplicity. From no source is there a discordant note. Its existence is not disputed or seriously questioned. A report somewhat in detail on the phase of the case seems essential as a setting for subsequent events. Deceased often addressed plaintiff as 'Darling Delia;\u2019 \u2018You will never leave me Delia,\u2019 was a common expression to the plaintiff; \u2018You have given your life for me, you would have a nice home and family only for me,\u2019 was said to the plaintiff in the presence of witnesses. Referring to the plaintiff, deceased has made use of these expressions; \u2018I love Delia,\u2019 \u2018I could not live without her,\u2019 \u2018She is the only friend that will do anything for me,\u2019 \u2018She is the only one I love,\u2019 \u2018Delia has sacrificed her whole life and she will be well repaid,\u2019 \u2018She will always have a home and money enough to run the house,\u2019 \u2018She has looked out for me and I shall for her.\u2019 \u2018All happiness has come into my life through her.\u2019 After the deceased had given the plaintiff a deed of the homestead in 1914 as reported later, and after the alleged gift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>of the bonds in 1915 and on the second Sunday before her death she said, \u2018I have given the house to Delia and have provided for her to live comfortable.\u2019 These statements were also made referring to the plaintiff; 'She has seen me through faithfully.\u2019 'She is the best friend I ever had.\u2019 \u2018She has nursed me night and day.\u2019 \u2018I have given her the house and means to keep it.\u2019 Y wanted things fixed so she would have everything I ever had.' It was a common occurrence for the deceased to throw her arms about the plaintiff and kiss her, using endearing terms and avowals of love, exacting promises that she would never leave her. Whenever the deceased was tired and nervous she always found relief in the caress of the plaintiff. No other person was able thus to minister to her on these occasions. These demonstrations of affection with a request that she would return soon frequently occurred when the plaintiff would leave the house for a walk or to do an errand. For twenty-five years before her death the deceased never left home for pleasure, riding, visiting friends, or shopping without the companionship of the plaintiff. Starting together for church on Sundays they would separate only to attend their respective place of worship \u2014 plaintiff to the Catholic Church, and the deceased to the Unitarian. They occupied adjoining sleeping rooms on the second floor of the house, the beds being so placed that the occupants could see each other after retiring. Upon occasions in their earlier life the deceased did not like to sleep alone, and for a period of fifteen or sixteen years they slept together most of the time, and for the last twelve years, all of the time, alternating between the two rooms. They were thus together on the night when the deceased passed away. Upon that night the plaintiff ministered to her when she complained of not feeling as well as usual, and requested that she might call a doctor. The deceased did not care for medical attendance, but insisted that the plaintiff should not leave her, and her last words addressed to the plaintiff were, \u2018You are right there.\u2019 She died in the plaintiff\u2019s arms. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">\u201cOn March 31, 1914, the deceased executed and delivered to the plaintiff a deed of the home place, reserving to herself the right to use and occupy the premises during her life. The land and buildings were valued at that time at about $20,000. The lot was situated on the north side of Church Street [in Brockton] about one hundred and twenty feet east of Main Street, the prim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>cipal thoroughfare in the city. It had frontage of ninety-two feet. The house was a substantial structure, two stories high, in good repair, and in a desirable locality, rapidly passing however from a residential to a business section. At the request of the deceased, the deed was prepared through the assistance and under the direction of her cousin and business adviser, Charles Howard. In his presence the deed was delivered to the plaintiff by the deceased with this statement: \u2018Delia, this is your house and you will never, have to leave it as long as you live. No one can put you out.\u2019 \u2018Put the deed away and keep it.\u2019 . . . The deceased further stated that this was not all she ought to do for the plaintiff, and it was not all she intended to. The deceased told the plaintiff that it would be advisable, but not necessary, to have the deed recorded. . . .\u201d The deed remained in the plaintiff\u2019s possession, unrecorded, until the death of Mrs. Brett, when it was recorded at the suggestion of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. \u201cAfter the transfer of the property the relations of the parties with reference to it continued as before, the deceased paying the taxes and assessments, making repairs and improvements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">The circumstances of the gift of the bonds on March 25, 1915, are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">The master further found that all checks for interest on the bonds were drawn and mailed to Martha J. Brett at her address, 24 Church Street, Brockton, \u201cand all were indorsed by the deceased, stamped in each instance by the bank, \u2018Cash\u2019 indicating that cash had been paid when presented at the bank. All such checks were delivered to the plaintiff by the deceased and they were cashed at the bank by the plaintiff and the money received by her paid over to the deceased by the plaintiff in accordance with her usual practice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">The master\u2019s summary of his findings was as follows: \u201cI find the deceased was at all times possessed of a clear, vigorous mind, and a full mental capacity to make the gift in question. There is no evidence of fraud or undue influence exercised by the plaintiff or any other person to bring about the gift. No force, no threats, no duress, deception or importunity appears in the case; but rather a close intimacy a well nigh perfect confidence and an abounding affection between two congenial life companions. From this relationship, from an oft expressed purpose and inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tian, from statements made to the plaintiff at the time, from the actual physical delivery in hand of the bonds, from their retention by the plaintiff in her possession for four years and up to the death of the deceased, from admissions made to the plaintiff and others after the transaction confirming it, I find the deceased intended to make and did make a complete and absolute gift of these bonds to the plaintiff. I find that both so regarded it. Unless the court shall find to the contrary on the reported facts relative to the payment to the deceased of the interest accruing from the bonds, there was no retention of control or dominion over the bonds by the deceased, rendering the transaction of March, 1915, other than a present irrevocable gift.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">Other material findings of the master are described in the opinion. The suit was heard upon the pleadings and the master\u2019s report by <em>Fosdick, </em>J., by whose order were entered an interlocutory decree confirming the report, and a final decree for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-6\"><em>A. F. Barker, (J. W. Keith </em>with him,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-7\"><em>W. G. Rowe, (E. H. Fletcher &amp; H. K.

In either case by an unqualified delivery and acceptance the title passes, the gift becomes perfect and carries with it an implied irrevocable power to enforce it in the name of the donor. <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>24 Pick. 261. <em>Ensign </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>4 Pick. 1. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>119 Mass. 474. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>129 Mass. 425. <em>Slade </em>v. <em>Mutrie, </em>156 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>19. <em>Scrivens </em>v. <em>North Easton Savings Bank, </em>166 Mass. 255. <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>195 Mass. 495. <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>205 Mass. 290. <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Simson, </em>220 Mass. 480. Bliss v. Bliss, 221 Mass. 201, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In the case at bar the master found the ultimate fact, based upon undisputed subsidiary facts, that the deceased, the donor, \u201cintended to make and did make a complete and absolute gift of these bonds to plaintiff.\u201d This finding of fact would be conclusive were it not for the contention that the donor intended to retain and did retain dominion and control over the bonds by her declarations and the alleged qualifying words which accompanied the delivery of the bonds. The descriptive facts are as follows: \u201cWithout a word of comment deceased took the bonds from the drawer, locked at the time, and handed them, encased in an envelope, to plaintiff, with the information that they were two $20,000 bonds of the City of Boston, and that she was going to give them to her saying: \u2018I want you to have these and keep them for yourself. They are yours and I want you to keep them.\u2019 Deceased told plaintiff further that she had been good and faithful to her, that she had taken good care of her when sick, had looked after Mr. Brett, and that all the money she had would no.t pay for what she had done; that this was not all she was going to get, \u2018for,\u2019 she said, \u2018what good is the house without money to run it, and she expressed the hope that plaintiff would never leave the place nor have to work after she was gone. Deceased further stated that it was her purpose to have the dividends herself \u2018to run the house and do repairs, painting and paper hanging.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff took the bonds and always retained them. \u201cThere was no evidence that deceased knew where they were kept, except that she knew they were in the house in plaintiff\u2019s room.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Savings Bank, </em>64 N. H. 228. <em>Candee </em>v. <em>Connecticut Savings Bank, </em>81 Conn. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In the case at bar the findings of the master conclusively established that the intent of the donor at the time of delivery was to make a transfer to the donee of the absolute title, and that the donee accepted the gift as such; and we find nothing in the declaration of the donor when she made the delivery of the bonds to the donee which makes such a finding of fact clearly wrong and a legal impossibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
