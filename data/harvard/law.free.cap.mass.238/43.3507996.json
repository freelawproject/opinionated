She had gone through a form of marriage with the man about two months previous to the earliest purchase and they then lived together as man and wife in a housekeeping apartment until the day after the purchase of the fur coat, she assisting him in bis business and he introducing her to his friends as his wife and supposing her to be so. _ At that time he was worth from 88,000 to $10,000. No express authority for the purchase was given by the man. Upon his inquiry, he heard of the purchases on the day of the last sale and immediately orally and by letter \u201cinstructed\u201d the merchant \u201cnot to give any further credit to my wife,\u201d naming her. Subsequently the man procured a decree of annulment of the marriage on the ground that she was married when she went through the ceremony with him.

Washburne (hereinafter called Mrs. Hedtler) went through the form of marriage on September 12,1917. Thereafter until January 3, 1918, they lived together as husband and wife in Winchester, in a housekeeping apartment; she assisted him in his automobile supply business; and he introduced her to his friends as his wife. On November 8, .Mrs. Hedtler made an application to the plaintiff for credit, and gave references as to Mr. Hedtler\u2019s financial ability. The credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>manager made investigations looking up Hedtler\u2019s real estate, and making inquiries of the Winchester Trust Company, where he did business. During that month Mrs. Hedtler purchased from the plaintiff a scarf, book, table and four set saucepans, all of the value of $13.50; and on January 2, 1918, a fur coat, valued at $200. On the plaintiff\u2019s books the account was charged to the defendant. On January 3, Mr. and Mrs. Hedtler separated and she removed practically all the household goods, which belonged to her. In September the defendant petitioned for an annulment of said marriage, on the ground that she had a husband living at the time; and a decree of nullity was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Marriage imposes on the husband the general legal duty of supporting his wife; and if he neglects or refuses to supply her with what is necessary for decency and comfort in his condition in life, he is liable to third persons who furnish her with such necessaries. <em>Eames </em>v. <em>Sweetser, </em>101 Mass. 78. That liability need not be based on the wife\u2019s agency. It may exist even against the husband\u2019s will, or after any agency would have ended with the death of the wife. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>98 Mass 538. <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>134 Mass. 77, 79. In the present case, however, this legal liability resulting from the marital relation has no application, because there was no valid marriage; and the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant estopped himself in this case from denying that Mrs. Hedtler was his lawful wife. See Ann. Cas. 1913 A 236 note; 1913 D 1062 note. The only ground of liability on which the plaintiff can recover in this case is that of agency. We are of opinion however, that there was evidence entitling the plaintiff to go to the jury on the ground of implied agency and of ratification. It could be found that the defendant by cohabiting with Mrs. Hedtler and holding her out to the community as his wife, impliedly authorized her as his agent to purchase the necessaries for herself and the household, in accordance with the ordinary pr'actice of married people. And there was also evidence of his ratification of her agency when the defendant, on being notified of the purchase of the fur coat, did not deny his liability, but wrote to the plaintiff on January 2, 1918, instructing it \u201cnot to give any further credit to my wife, Winifred B. Hedtler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Some of the articles sued for manifestly fall within the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>necessaries. Even as to the fur coat, in view of the evidence as to the defendant\u2019s means, and the situation of the, parties, we think it was for the jury to say whether it was necessary in the legal sense. <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>114 Mass. 424. <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>133 Mass. 503. The question whether the defendant was in default in failing to supply her with money to buy clothes, and whether these goods were supplied on his credit, were also for the jury to determine. <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>168 Mass. 350.
