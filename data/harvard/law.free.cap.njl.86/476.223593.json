The precise question presented is whether in such a suit the District Court has jurisdiction to grant a new trial after thirty days have elapsed from the date of the original judgment; and the solution of this question depends on whether the District Court practice in mechanics\u2019 lien cases is to be regulated at such a juncture by the District Court act or by the Practice act.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">By section 17 of the District Court act <em>(Comp. Stat., p. 1959) </em>it is provided that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-15\">\u201cIn every case tried in any of said courts the judge ma}\u2019, if he sees fit, order a new trial to be had upon such terms as he shall think reasonable, and in the meantime stay proce\u00e9dings, provided that application for such new trial, except where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>said application is based upon newly-discovered evidence, shall l&gt;e made within thirty days after judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Consequently, it is plain that unless some other statutory provision takes precedence, the jurisdiction of the District Court to grant a new trial in any case before it is limited to the thirty days specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The defendant presented meritorious grounds for the opening of the judgment and relied upon section 68 of the District Court act <em>(Comp. Stat, p. </em>1977), which provides that\u2014 \u201cThe practice of the Circuit Courts, in so far as applicable, shall apply to District Courts, excepting, however, in cases whore there may he some express provision, of law providing otherwise;\u201d and claimed that so far as related to mechanics\u2019 lien suits, section 11? of the Practice act of 1903 <em>(Comp. Stat, p. </em>4087) was applicable. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAa\">\u201cIf in any action judgment shall pass against either party by reason of the failure of the attorney of such party to file any proper pleading, the court or a judge shall on application within one year after the entry of such judgment, open said judgment and permit a proper pleading to be filed upon terms, if in the opinion of the court or judge injury or wrong has resulted or may result from such failure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The judge took this view and held that as the recent legislation conferring upon the District Courts the power to take cognizance of mechanics\u2019 lien suits, transferred to them for the purposes of convenience, a jurisdiction theretofore exercised solely by the Circuit Courts, which were regulated by the <em>Practice </em>act, the legislative intent was that that act where applicable should control District Court practice in mechanics\u2019 lien cases, and that in consequence he was entitled to grant a new trial under section 11? of the Practice act. This, we ihink, was erroneous, for the reason that by the express terms of section 83 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien act <em>(Comp, </em>Stat., <em>p. </em>3307, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1912, <em>p. </em>470) it is provided that \u201cwhen the suit is brought in a District Court, the practice shall be as nearly as possible the same as now provided or may hereafter be provided by law in District Courts in actions on cojxtraet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The meaning of this language seems to .he perfectly plain, and there can be no question whatever but that by the practice of District Courts in actions on contract, a new trial cannot be granted after thirty days. <em>Rosner </em>v. Cohn, 81 <em>N. J. L. </em>343.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The .order opening the judgment and granting a new trial will therefore be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
