L., pp. </em>134, 763), known as the Employers\u2019 Liability act. The record shows that Sarah J. Jackson, the petitioner, was a sister of Walter H. Jackson, who suffered injuries, from which he died on July 24th, 1912. The trial court found,, as a fact, that the deceased was at the time of the accident in the employ of the Erie Eailroad Company, also, the petitioner was <em>partially </em>dependent upon the deceased, her brother. The record shows that the judge making the order had evidence before him which amply supports the order in these two particulars; hence this court will not sot the order aside, on either of these grounds, viz., that, at the time the deceased was killed, he was not in the employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of the Erie Railroad Company, or that the dependency of the petitioner on the deceased vras not proved. On the first ground it is argued that as the deceased, Avlien injured, Avas employed on a Avork train on the Ringwood branch of the Erie Railroad Company, the cars used were oAvned by the Wilson &amp; English Company, an independent contractor, for hauling gravel and sand in building a new branch for the Erie Railroad Company, but the contract between the two companies was not put m evidence, nor the exact relationship betAveen the two companies shown. In order to bring the ease Avithin the principle of <em>Delaware, &amp;c., Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>59 <em>N. J. L. </em>35, the plaintiff in <em>certiorari </em>must show that the servant has, in fact, consented to the transfer of his services to the neAv master and accepted him as his master <em>pro hue vice, </em>that ho has entered upon the service and submitted himself to the direction and control of the new master, but this Aims not shown. On the second ground, it is urged, because the statute provides <em>\u201cactual dependents\u201d (Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>139) and <em>\u201cno dependents.\u201d </em>The court having found <em>the </em>petitioner \u201cpartially\u201d dependent, the word \u201cactual\u201d does not include \u201cpartial;\u201d aa\u2019c cannot adopt this construction; dependents in these statutes mean dependent for the ordinary necessaries of life, one who looks to another for support or help; if partially dependent, they must necessarily he actually dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
