PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY, APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b719-15\">Submitted July 3, 1914</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aor\">Decided October 16, 1914.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-16\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which the following <em>per curiam </em>was filed: \u00ab</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-17\">\u201cThe defendant argues that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation act of 1911 is unconstitutional, because it embraces two objects, and one only is expressed in the tille. The point is thus stated in his brief: \u2018The act in its title prescribes only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the liability of an employer to make compensation for injuries received by an employe, &amp;c.,- and does not provide for compensation by an employer to the next of kin of an employe who is killed in the course of his employment/ We are unable to adopt defendant\u2019s view. It seems to us that the object of the act is single \u2014 to provide for the liability of an employer to make compensation for injuries received by an employe. Whether the compensation is to he made to the employe himself or to those who suffer pecuniary loss by reason of his injuries, it is equally a liability of the employer. Whether the injuries result in death or not, thev are naturally and properly spoken of as injuries received by an employe. The expression \u2018fatal injuries\u2019 is not uncommon or improper. That this single object of providing for the liability of the employer is expressed in the title sufficiently appears from a mere reading of that portion of the title we have already quoted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-5\">\u201cThe only other point suggested is that the trial judge allowed compensation based on the wages which the decedent was receiving at the time of the accident. These wages were somewhat greater than lie had previously been receiving. Section 2, paragraph 11, a and <em>b. </em>expressly provides that the compensation for temporary disability and for disability, total in character and permanent in quality, shall he fifty per centum of the wages received at the time of injury. Subdivision <em>c </em>bases the compensation on daily wages, while paragraph 12 speaks only of wages of deceased. But we think this must mean wages at the time of injury. This may, indeed, result in injustice to the employer when the employe is paid by the piece and his earnings are unusually high at the time of injury, and in injustice to the employe when his earnings are unusually low. That, however, is a defect that the legislature may correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-6\">\u201cThe judgment is affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b720-7\">For the appellant, <em>GasMll \u00a3 GasMll.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b720-8\">For the respondent, <em>James Russell Carrow.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The judgment under review will be affirmed, for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Ci-hee Justice, CtARrison, Trknchard, Parker, Minturn, Kalisch, Black, 1'ogert, Yri;denbt.'Rgh, Teehune, Rei-tenheimer, Williams, JJ. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 Hone.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
