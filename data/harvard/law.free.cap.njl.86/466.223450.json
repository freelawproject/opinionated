This payment, by section 95 of the School iaw <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>4755), is obligatory on the collector of the taxing district.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The writ is resisted on several grounds, the first of which is that relator is not <em>de- facto </em>or <em>de jure </em>the custodian of school moneys. To be entitled to such writ he must at least be custodian at the time it issues. <em>Silverthorne </em>v. <em>Warren Railroad Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>372. We proceed, therefore, to an examination of this question, which is a little complicated on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">By section 185 of the School act, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1912, <em>p. </em>507, the custodian of school moneys in a municipality is the collector when so designated by the board of education, otherwise he is the \u201cperson designated by law as the custodian of the moneys belonging to the municipality in which the school district shall be situate.\u201d In the case of a township such \u201cperson\u201d is the treasurer. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>5577, \u00a7 15. It satisfactorily appears that relator, Connolly, was township treasurer in June, 1913, and in that month was also duly appointed custodian of school moneys for the school year ending June 30th, 1914, and qualified as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">But in July, 1913, proceedings were instituted to put in force chapter 221 of the laws of 1911 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>462), known as the \u201cWalsh act,\u201d and it appears that in October two of the three commissioners were elected, there being a tie as to the third; that these two filled the vacancy by selecting the third: and that this board appointed Connolly as the treasurer of the reorganized government, which office lie accepted and drew salary therefor. It would seem that by this action his tenure of the office of township treasurer terminated. Relator argues that the validity of the adoption of the Walsh act is disputed and is now in litigation; but be this as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>it may, he accepted office under'a <em>d&amp; facto </em>government, and it may well be questioned whether he did not thereby vacate his tenure of the former treasurer ship. His resignation of the office under the commission in January, 1914, does not help the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">But even if there was no incompatibility, his term as township treasurer ran out on the second Saturday after the next annual township election (in March, 1914). <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>5571, \u00a7 6; <em>Id., p. </em>5577, \u00a7 15. So, putting the best face on it, relator\u2019s term as township treasurer under either government had expired several months before application for tire writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">It is true that by the act of 1912, page 507, <em>supra, </em>if the term of the \u201ccollector or other person\u201d designated or acting <em>ex-officio </em>as custodian, expires before the close of the school year, he is to continue as sirch custodian until the close of the then current school year. This would continue relator in office as custodian until June 30th, 1914; and in fact his title was recognized by payments of school moneys up to that time. But his term of office expired, quite plainly, as it seems to us, on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">A writ of <em>mandamus </em>will not be awarded unless the right to relief is clear at the time of the award. Hot only is such right not clear to us in this ease, but we are quite clear to the contrary. <em>We </em>do not undertake, of course, to adjudicate finally on relator\u2019s title to the office that he claims; but necessarily the determination of the question involved required such examination of the matter as would satisfy the court of the validity or otherwise of relator\u2019s claim to this money. Relator failing to show such title, the rule to show cause will be discharged. '</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The result reached makes it unnecessary to deal with the \u25a0 other phases of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
