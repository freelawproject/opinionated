Parrish appeals the conviction, raising the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Parrish\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b63 2.

Did the District Court commit plain error by failing to give a lesser included offense instruction to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u00b65 4. Was Defense Counsel ineffective in choosing not to propose a lesser included offense instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">\u00b66 In 2008, Parrish lived in Forsyth, Montana, with his girlfriend (B.H.) and her two children (M.G. and his sister). On June 16,2008, Parrish was watching the two children when M.G.\u2019s arm was injured. Parrish promptly obtained medical treatment for M.G.. While at the facility, Child and Family Services (CFS) Regional Supervisor Grant Larson (Larson) and a deputy sheriff spoke with Parrish, but no charges were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">\u00b67 On August 5, 2008, Parrish again watched the children. After returning home, B.H. observed that M.G. was behaving abnormally and she took him to the medical clinic in Forsyth that same day. At the clinic, B.H. learned that M.G. had sustained a skull fracture, internal bruising, and broken ribs. M.G. was transported by ambulance to the Billings Clinic and eventually to Children\u2019s Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. Parrish told B .H., Larson, and the deputy sheriff that he was unaware of any cause for M.G.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">\u00b68 Due to Parrish\u2019s failure to seek treatment for M.G. on August 5, 2008, he was charged with criminal endangerment. After the charges were filed, Parrish developed a different story, this time explaining M.G.\u2019s injuries. Parrish alleges that he did not report the injuries immediately because he feared the State would take the kids away, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>given the investigation concerning the events of June 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b69 Parrish\u2019s counsel filed a discovery request for \u201c[a]ll medical reports of any nature prepared in reference to M.G.,\u201d \u201c[a]ll [Department of Health and Human Services (DPHHS)] reports relating to M.G.,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll legal pleadings or reports in any pending [dependant and neglect] action concerning M.G. pertinent to M.G.\u2019s physical or mental condition.\u201d The State responded and agreed to proffer all documents not precluded by \u00a7 41-3-205, MCA. Regarding the discovery request for DPHHS reports that may be precluded by statute, the State offered to provide the entire investigative file subject to <em>in camera </em>screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b610 The District Court held an <em>in camera </em>proceeding and issued an order prior to trial. Attached to the order were copies of DPHHS documents for Defense Counsel\u2019s use in preparation for trial. An Investigative Safety Assessment (assessment) accompanied the court\u2019s order and provided a description of a meeting on June 17, 2008, wherein DPHHS Child Protection Specialist Lisa Reiger (Reiger) met with B.H. at her home. At this meeting Reiger had B.H. sign information release forms (releases).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b611 At trial, Larson testified that he called B.H. at home on June 17, 2008, and informed her that the investigation regarding M.G.\u2019s broken arm was closed and that a social worker would stop by the house. On redirect-examination of Larson, the State attempted to admit the assessment into evidence. Defense Counsel objected. On recross-examination of Larson, Defense Counsel moved to admit the first two pages of the seven page assessment into evidence for the purpose of impeaching Larson\u2019s testimony that the broken arm investigation concluded on June 16,2008. The District Court admitted the first two pages into evidence as Defense Exhibit B on the condition that the remaining five pages were also admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b612 Parrish and B.H. both testified that CFS did not contact the couple to inform them that the investigation regarding the broken arm incident had concluded. They both testified that they had lived in fear of having their children taken away subsequent the June 16, 2008, incident. On day four of trial, the State introduced the signed releases to impeach B.H.\u2019s testimony that she was not contacted by CFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b613 Defense Counsel did not offer an instruction on negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>endangerment or any lesser included offense. The jury found Parrish guilty of criminal endangerment. Thereafter, Parrish filed a motion for a new trial, which the District Court denied. Parrish now appeals his conviction and denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 391, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 113, 197 P.3d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b615 We may also apply the common law plain error doctrine to review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no objection is made, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>2009 MT 427, \u00b6 42, 354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b616 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Parrish\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation?</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u00b617 In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, defendant must show (1) the State possessed evidence favorable to the defense; (2) the defendant did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it with reasonable diligence; (3) the State suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b618 We recently observed in <em>State v. James, </em>2010 MT 175, \u00b6 36, 357 Mont. 193, 237 P.3d 672, that no <em>Brady </em>violation exists where both parties are aware of the existence of specific evidence and defense counsel could uncover the evidence with reasonable diligence. In James, defense counsel requested that the State provide \u201cevidence that would mitigate or negate guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. Defense counsel then motioned for a new trial alleging a <em>Brady </em>violation for the State\u2019s failure to provide the victim\u2019s booking photo. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32. The district court found that both parties knew prior to trial that the assault victim had been arrested the night of the incident and it was common knowledge that booking photos are taken of persons who are arrested. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33. In <em>James, </em>we concluded that since counsel for the defendant was generally familiar with booking procedures, counsel was constructively aware that a booking photo was probably in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>existence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 33-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b619 Here, where the assessment document put Parrish on actual notice of the existence and substance of the releases, the <em>James </em>rationale is even more compelling. Parrish was aware of the releases and clearly in a position to specifically request production of the releases themselves. This argument is belied by the fact that Parrish\u2019s counsel successfully moved to introduce the first two pages of the assessment and then objected when the State sought to introduce page seven, the page containing the summary of the releases. Since Parrish has failed to show that he could not have obtained the releases with reasonable diligence, he has not satisfied the second prong of the <em>Brady </em>test and we need not discuss the other three prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b620 2, Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Parrish\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the discovery of new evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b621  Parrish contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial due to newly discovered evidence, i.e. the releases. In order to prevail on a motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence, a defendant must meet the five part <em>Berry </em>test that we restated in <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6 34, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099. Inter alia, a defendant must establish that the failure to discover the evidence sooner was not the result of the defendant\u2019s lack of diligence. <em>Id. </em>As discussed above, Defense Counsel was aware of the releases before trial and Parrish could have obtained the releases themselves with reasonable diligence. Since Parrish failed to satisfy the diligence requirement, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b622 3. Did the District Court commit plain error by failing to give a lesser included offense Instruction to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b623 Parrish requests that we review the District Court\u2019s jury instructions for plain error. Specifically, Parrish contends that the District Court should have <em>sua sponte </em>instructed the jury as to the lesser included offense of \u00a7 45-5-208, MCA, Negligent endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\">\u00b624  Although we have exercised discretionary authority to review claimed errors that affect a defendant\u2019s fundamental rights under the common law plain error doctrine where no objections are made at trial, <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), the plain error doctrine is \u201cto be employed sparingly\u2019 and \u201cpursuant to narrow circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 34, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252. According to \u00a7 46-16-410 (3), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">A party may not assign as error any portion of the instructions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>omission from the instructions unless an objection was made specifically stating the matter objected to, and the grounds for the objection, at the settlement of instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Absent request by the parties, the trial court has no duty to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense. <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>253 Mont. 118, 124, 832 P.2d 370, 373 (1992). As we explained in <em>Sheppard, </em>\u201cdefense counsel may want to omit such an instruction as a matter of strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the District Court\u2019s discretion not to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of negligent endangerment <em>sua sponte </em>does not warrant plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b625 4. Was Defense Counsel ineffective in choosing not to propose a lesser included offense instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b626  When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 67, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. Additionally, there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and was based on sound trial strategy. <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 33, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Parrish asserts that Defense Counsel had no plausible justification for not submitting a lesser included offense instruction on negligent endangerment. Given that we have recognized that counsel can, for strategic reasons, choose not to offer a lesser included offense instruction, <em>Sheppard, </em>253 Mont. at 124, 832 P.2d at 373, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b627 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> The assessment is actually dated June 16,2008, despite its inclusion of the June 17,2008, visit summary. Neither party raises this issue, therefore the Court notes this discrepancy, but finds the file error inconsequential.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
