Christiansen appeals his conviction. The sole issue is whether the District Court\u2019s instruction on \u201cactual physical control\u201d at Christiansen\u2019s second trial prejudicially affected Christiansen\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b62 In May 2008, Deputy County Sherriff Geer found Christiansen sleeping in his vehicle, which was parked in the parking lot of a bar in Havre. Christiansen\u2019s pickup was running and the brake lights were activated. Geer attempted to wake Christiansen by pinching him several times. When Christiansen finally awoke, he responded that his name was \u201cCoors.\u201d Eventually, Geer arrested Christiansen for driving under the influence. Christiansen does not dispute that he was very intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b63 The case proceeded to a jury trial in December 2008. Prior to trial, the State proposed Instruction 5, that defined \u201cactual physical control\u201d as: \u201c[T]he Defendant is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle if the Defendant is not a passenger and is in a position to, and has the ability to, operate the vehicle in question.\u201d This instruction essentially mirrored Montana\u2019s Model Criminal Jury Instruction 10-106. At the close of evidence, the State proposed two jury instructions defining \u201cphysical control of a motor vehicle.\u201d The State\u2019s proposed Instruction 11 provided: \u201c \u2018Actual physical control\u2019 means that a person has existing or present bodily restraint, directing influence, domination or regulation of a vehicle.\u201d The State\u2019s proposed Instruction 12 provided: \u201cA motorist remains in a position to regulate a vehicle while asleep behind the steering wheel of a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b64 The District Court rejected the State\u2019s proposed Instructions 11 and 12, reasoning: \u201cThe correct statement of the law is represented by State\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 5.... As I see it, it is the application of that law as stated in State\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 5, that resulted in the statements given in <em>State v. Hudson.\u201d </em>The trial resulted in a hung jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b65 The case was re-tried in June 2009. Prior to trial, the State proposed jury instructions on \u201cactual physical control\u201d identical to Instructions 11 and 12 from the previous trial. On the morning of the second trial, Christiansen told the District Court that his proposed jury instructions on \u201cactual physical control\u201d would be the same as Instruction 5 from the first trial. During the settlement of instructions, the District Court rejected both Christiansen\u2019s and the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>proposed instructions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">I realize the defense proposed number is a pattern instruction. However, I find it to be confusing and I believe that to fully and fairly instruct this jury on the law, I\u2019m going to need a different instruction, as it relates to the meaning of the term actual physical control.... I believe that the <em>Hudson </em>decision more accurately relies on that 1958 decision of <em>Ruona </em>... which is also cited in the State\u2019s proposed [instruction].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">I know that <em>Taylor </em>is referenced in the <em>Hudson </em>case. And in the <em>Hudson </em>case you will find in Paragraph 13 of the <em>Hudson </em>decision, that the <em>Robinson </em>case is cited for the very proposition that is contained in [the State\u2019s proposed instruction].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">After considering all of these cases, I believe the better instruction would be the Defendant is actually in actual physical control of a vehicle, if the Defendant is not a passenger and has an existing or present bodily function that exercises restraint or directs influence, domination or regulation of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The court\u2019s definition was given to the jury as Instruction 9. During deliberations, the jury asked for a clearer definition of physical control, requested a legal dictionary and a legal definition of \u201cdomination\u201d and \u201cregulation,\u201d indicated that they could not reach a decision, and had difficulty understanding what \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d meant. The jury eventually convicted Christiansen of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b66 Christiansen appeals, claiming that the District Court committed reversible error because its instruction so confused the jury that it prejudicially affected his substantial right to a fair trial. Christiansen contends that the correct interpretation of the law is reflected in the instruction that the court gave to the jury at the first trial because it is the same as the Model Criminal Jury Instruction and is supported by our case law. Christiansen also argues that the jury instruction used at the first trial was the law of the case at the second trial because the District Court initially said it was the correct law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s decision pertaining to jury instructions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, \u00b6 25, 336 Mont. 6, 152 P.3d 698. While the district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>applicable law. <em>Id. </em>The instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights to constitute reversible error. <em>State v. Hudson, </em>2005 MT 142, \u00b6 10, 327 Mont. 286, 114 P.3d 210. The purpose of jury instructions is to guarantee decisions consistent with the evidence and the law, which can be accomplished when the instructions are as plain, clear, concise, and brief as possible. <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 373, 916 P.2d 122, 140 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court\u2019s instruction on \u201cactual physical control\u201dat Christiansen\u2019s second trial prejudicially affect Christiansen\u2019s substantial rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b69 Section 61-8-401(a), MCA, makes it unlawful for a person who is under the influence of alcohol to drive or be in \u201cactual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public.\u201d We have held that \u201cactual physical control\u201d means \u201cexisting or present bodily restraint, directing influence, domination or regulation, of an automobile.\u201d <em>State v. Ruona, </em>133 Mont. 243, 248, 321 P.2d 615, 618 (1958). More recently, this Court held that the Model Criminal Jury Instruction that defines \u201cactual physical control\u201d as \u201c[the individual is] in a position to, and [has] the ability to operate the vehicle in question\u201d is an accurate reflection of the law as developed by judicial interpretation. <em>Hudson, </em>\u00b6 15 <em>(citing State v. Ruona, </em>133 Mont. 243, 321 P.2d 615; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>203 Mont. 284, 661 P.3d 33 (1983); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>229 Mont. 7, 744 P.2d 1242 (1987); <em>Turner v. State, </em>244 Mont. 151, 795 P.2d 982 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b610  The District Court countermanded its decision from the first trial and concluded that its initial instruction about \u201cactual physical control\u201d was confusing and did not fairly and fully instruct the jury, even though the evidence presented and the issues at both trials was substantially the same. The court explained that because <em>Hudson </em>relied on <em>Ruona, </em>the definition from <em>Ruona </em>made the better instruction. We disagree. The instruction from the Model Criminal Jury Instruction-and the one used at the first trial-more clearly, concisely and accurately stated the law as developed by our judicial interpretation since <em>Ruona. See Hudson, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court\u2019s instruction did not clearly state the law, which resulted in the jury being confused about what it meant for Christiansen to be in actual physical control of his vehicle. This prejudicially affected Christiansen\u2019s substantial right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b611  The District Court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury at Christiansen\u2019s second trial that \u201cthe Defendant is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle if the Defendant is not a passenger, and has an existing or present bodily function that exercises restraint or directs influence, domination, or regulation of a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b612 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
