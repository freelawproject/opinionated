We reverse Sage\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">\u00b62 In the fall of 2007, Mary Graham (Mary) routinely spent time at Sage\u2019s house in Anaconda, Montana. Mary lived with her boyfriend Jeremiah Bell (Bell) in Anaconda in a camper trailer with no heat or running water. Sage and his then-girlfriend Marian Sage (Marian)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> allowed Mary to stay at the house on occasion in order to shower and use Sage\u2019s computer. Mary had originally been introduced to Sage by her godmother Martha Koffler (Koffler). Sage and Bell worked together delivering newspapers. Sage and Marian allowed other individuals to regularly use their house as a place to hang out and use Sage\u2019s computers. Sage and Marian provided food to the individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>who hung out at the house, and allowed them to drink beer and smoke marijuana there as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b63 Mary was a regular at Sage\u2019s house for over a month. In the course of spending time there, Mary testified that she came to regard Sage as a pretty good friend, and developed trust in both Sage and Marian. According to Mary\u2019s testimony, at some point Sage began paying Mary compliments and \u201csaying things\u201d to her. Sage told Mary he was a photographer who took \u201cexotic\u201d photographs. Sage showed Mary a number of these photographs. The photographs depicted women in various lurid poses, and women in some of the pictures were naked, or skimpily dressed. Some of the photographs also showed Sage himself, posing naked, and Sage\u2019s penis showing a \u201c69\u201d tattoo in his pelvic area. Two of the photographs which Sage showed to Mary depicted his penis ejaculating.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b64 Mary stated that Sage asked her what she thought about the photographs and made comments indicating that he wanted to take pictures of her. Sage suggested that he could take pictures of Mary for her boyfriend Bell as Christmas presents. Mary testified that she was disgusted by the photographs and considered them pornographic. Mary thought it strange that Sage had showed her these photographs, but decided to leave the topic alone. Mary testified that she would not stop going to Sage\u2019s house solely on account of the pictures, and also testified that she had nowhere else to go. Sage did end up taking some photographs of Mary although it appears that Mary was fully clothed in all of them. Mary also took some pictures of herself using Sage\u2019s camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b65 Mary testified that Sage had asked her on many occasions if she wanted him to shave her pubic area, but she always told Sage \u201cno.\u201d After she refused these advances, Mary thought that the whole issue was a \u201cdone deal,\u201d especially given the fact that she hung out at Sage\u2019s house with her boyfriend Bell and others. Despite Sage\u2019s advances and her refusals, Mary stated she was still comfortable at Sage\u2019s house and felt as though she could trust him.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b66 On December 11, 2007, Mary had been at Sage\u2019s house using the computer checking her \u201cMy Space\u201d page and talking to her friends. Marian went on an errand, leaving Sage and Mary alone in the house for the first time. Mary testified that Sage came into the computer room dressed only in his boxer shorts. Mary testified that Sage\u2019s boxers were pulled down and that his penis was exposed to her. Mary \u201cfreaked out\u201d and tried to leave, but Sage grabbed her arm, causing Mary a significant amount of pain due to nerve damage and scars she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>suffered after contracting meningitis. Mary testified that she ended up on the floor, and that Sage held her arms and told her to relax, enjoy it, and that he just wanted to give her pleasure. Mary resisted by kicking, crying, screaming and trying to get away, and testified that she repeatedly told him \u201cno.\u201d Sage then allegedly ripped off her pants and underwear, got between her legs, and continued to hold her arms above her head. Eventually, Mary gave up, laid on the floor, and attempted to \u201ctune out\u201d what Sage was doing to her. At trial, Mary testified that she was accustomed to \u201ctuning out\u201d when confronted with traumatic experiences in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b67 Mary testified that Sage then pulled out an electric razor and used it as a vibrator on Mary, telling her again that he only wanted to give her pleasure. Sage allegedly then asked Mary again if she wanted him to shave her, and ultimately penetrated her with his penis. Sage allegedly threatened Mary, stating that if she told anybody or mentioned it, he would either say that she begged him for it and \u201cwanted it,\u201d or he would deny the incident outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b68 Mary testified that she did not initially want to report the alleged rape, and wanted to put it out of her mind and go on with her life. She threw away the clothes she had been wearing, including the ripped pants. However, a week after the rape she told Koffler about the incident and Koffler made her report it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b69 On December 18, 2007, Koffler took Mary to the Anaconda police station to report that she had been raped by Sage. Mary was interviewed by Detective Steven Barclay of the Anaconda-Deer Lodge Police Department in Anaconda. Mary told Det. Barclay the version of events noted above. Based upon information provided by Mary, the officers obtained a search warrant for Sage\u2019s house. Mary informed the officers that there was a \u201cpot pipe\u201d in Sage\u2019s house, and described its location. During the search, officers seized two razors, Sage\u2019s computers, a digital camera, photographs, and the pot pipe in the location where Mary said it would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b610 Sage was arrested for misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia. Sage was interviewed by law enforcement and gave a voluntary statement to the police while in custody. Sage told the officers that he did not rape Mary. At trial, Sage claimed that when he and Mary were alone in the house, Mary approached him after taking a shower with towels wrapped around her head and middle, and asked him to shave her pubic area. Sage stated that he thought the request was weird, but nonetheless agreed to do it. Sage denied holding Mary down or penetrating her in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b611 Sage was subsequently charged with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia and SIWC. Prior to trial, Sage filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any reference to other crimes, wrongs, or acts which he may have committed. The motion sought to exclude the photographs he had shown to Mary of the various women, Sage himself, and his penis. Sage did not seek to exclude the photographs of Mary, because the digital stamp on the photos of Mary indicated they had been taken after the date of the alleged rape, thus demonstrating that Mary had returned to Sage\u2019s house after she claimed she was raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b612 Generally speaking, M. R. Evid. 404(b) prohibits the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts in order to show that the defendant acted in conformity therewith, but does allow the admission of such evidence for other purposes, such as to prove motive or intent. <em>State v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 198, \u00b6 15, 338 Mont. 395, 165 P.3d 1129. If the State intends to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, it must provide written notice pursuant to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule described by this Court in <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52 (1991). The \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d codified at \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits the introduction of evidence of prior bad acts which are inextricably linked to the charged offense, notwithstanding the criteria and requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 16. The State in this case did not comply with the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, but argued that the photographs were inextricably linked to the sexual intercourse without consent charge, and were thus admissible under the \u201ctransaction rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b613 The District Court agreed with the State and allowed the admission of the disputed photographs under the transaction rule. In its ruling from the bench at the final pretrial conference, the District Court expressed some discomfort with the idea that the photographs were admissible as evidence of Sage \u201cgrooming\u201d Mary in preparation to commit the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court observed that grooming evidence did not fit well with the forcible rape situation as alleged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the State, and also that Mary was of adult age, while \u201cgrooming\u201d usually involves an underage victim. However, noting that the transaction rule would allow the admission of evidence if it forms part of the disputed transaction, the District Court determined that if the photographs were actually a part of the conduct, communications, and relationship activity between Sage and Mary, then they would qualify as a part of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b614 Sage\u2019s trial was held on October 6-8, 2008. On the morning of the first day of trial, Sage entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. The District Court received his guilty plea in chambers, outside the presence of the jury. In light of his change of plea, Sage argued that all the evidence related to this charge was no longer relevant and therefore inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b). The State argued that it should be able to present evidence that Mary was a part of a group that hung out at Sage\u2019s house and regularly drank and smoked marijuana. The State contended that this group was \u201calmost like a subculture,\u201d and that it was important for the jury to understand how Mary fit into this group and came to trust Sage prior to the alleged rape. The District Court, however, ruled that such evidence would not be admitted under the transaction rule in light of the fact that the possession charge was no longer at issue and the drug-related other acts did not relate to the rape allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b615 The State filed a motion for the District Court to reconsider this ruling. The State argued that evidence of drug use and drug paraphernalia was contemporaneous to the sexual intercourse without consent charge, and that the prohibition of such evidence would deprive the State of its right to a fair trial. The State contended that the legs would be \u201ccut out from under the victim\u2019s case\u201d without this evidence. In response to the State\u2019s motion, the District Court reversed itself and ultimately allowed the drug-related evidence to come in. Noting the State\u2019s assertion that Mary witnessed Sage and the others at the house drinking beer and smoking marijuana the morning of the rape, and that she told officers where a marijuana pipe would be found in Sage\u2019s house, the court concluded this evidence would corroborate Mary\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that this evidence would be admissible under the transaction rule. As stated by the District Court, under \u201cthe State\u2019s theory of the case insofar as the County Attorney has described the situation is probably explanative of a question that[] may be in a juror\u2019s mind; \u2018what in the heck is this 50-some year old guy doing with these 19 year old kids and what not\u2019 and the Jury is entitled to context. That\u2019s part of the transaction rule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>However, after a brief recess, the State corrected itself, and told the court that Mary <em>had not </em>seen Sage and others smoking marijuana and drinking beer on the morning of the alleged rape because she was not at Sage\u2019s house. The District Court told the State that this new revelation made the court \u201creally unhappy,\u201d but it nonetheless declined to reverse its decision to allow the evidence to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b616 During trial, the jury heard from the officers involved in the investigation, Mary, Marian, Sage, and other individuals. The issue of drug use at Sage\u2019s house was referred to many times. Furthermore, the State attempted unsuccessfully to have the pot pipe seized at the house admitted into evidence. The disputed photographs were admitted into evidence as well. The District Court gave limiting instructions at Sage\u2019s request regarding the evidence of drug use and the disputed photographs. The District Court also gave the jury a lesser included offense instruction for sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b617 The jury ultimately convicted Sage of SIWC. Sage was sentenced to 30 years in prison on the SIWC charge, and 6 months for criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Sage was designated a Tier III sex offender. He was required to serve at least 10 years in prison, and would not be eligible for parole until he completed Phase I and II of the sex offender program at the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b618 Sage now timely appeals his conviction for sexual intercourse without consent. We state the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b619 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of drug use at Sage\u2019s house ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b620 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted the disputed photographs into evidence ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b621 A trial court has broad discretion when it determines the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. Generally speaking, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters for an abuse of discretion. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. An abuse of discretion can be found if the district court acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690). However, a district court is bound by the Montana Rules of Evidence as well as applicable statutes. \u201cThus, to the extent the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(citing <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458). Under these conditions, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions de novo to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b622 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of drug use at Sage\u2019s house ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b623 On appeal, the State concedes that the District Court erroneously admitted evidence of marijuana use and possession of drug paraphernalia under the transaction rule. The State admits that the marijuana evidence was only \u201ctangentially related to Sage\u2019s commission of sexual intercourse without consent.\u201d The State argues, however, this error was harmless relying on <em>State v. Insua, </em>2004 MT 14, 319 Mont. 254, 84 P.3d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b624 In <em>Insua, </em>defendant Insua was charged with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, sexual intercourse without consent upon a minor female, and three other instances of sexual assault. The drug and sex crimes charges were ultimately severed. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 6. At trial on the sex crimes, one of the victims testified that she had seen Insua smoking marijuana and the presence of pipes in an outbuilding referred to as \u201cthe pantry\u201d where Insua spent a lot of \u201calone time\u201d and where one of the sexual assaults allegedly occurred. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 9. Testimony at trial indicated that Insua kept candy, dolls, children\u2019s toys and a television in the pantry.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b625 After his conviction, Insua argued his conviction should be reversed and that evidence of his marijuana use was \u201cbad character\u201d evidence which should prohibited under M.R. Evid. 404(b), since the State failed to comply with the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 39. The State argued that the evidence was admissible under the transaction rule, and that it was explanatory of the circumstances surrounding the alleged sexual offenses. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 41. We held that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence in light of its earlier ruling severing the charges. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 43. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the admission of the evidence constituted trial error which was not prejudicial to Insua. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 44. Because the tainted evidence did not go to prove an element of sexual intercourse without consent or sexual assault, the State was required to prove that there was \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d that the tainted evidence contributed to Insua\u2019s conviction. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 45. We held the State met its burden in that case for several reasons. First, the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>use was mentioned by only one of the State\u2019s witnesses in 2 pages of a trial transcript totaling over 530 pages long. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 46. Second, we noted the prosecutor made only a very brief reference to marijuana use during closing argument, and then only in conjunction with other evidence that demonstrated Insua kept dolls, candy, TV, tequila, and other items in the pantry. Furthermore, the prosecutor did not imply that the conviction for a sex crime was warranted because of marijuana evidence. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b626 Sage argues that <em>Insua </em>is distinguishable and that the State has failed to prove the error in this case was harmless. Sage notes that the prosecutor here referred to marijuana use in her opening statement. Further, the lead investigating officer testified at trial that the application for the search warrant in this case was based in part on information related to marijuana use at the house. The State also tried to have the pot pipe seized at the house admitted into evidence, thus drawing the jury\u2019s attention to the fact of illegal drug use. Furthermore, the State elicited testimony about marijuana use from Sage himself during cross-examination. Sage contends that since there was no question that Mary and Sage had not smoked marijuana either before or after the alleged rape, the repeated references to marijuana use by the State were gratuitous and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b627 The parties agree that the complained error in this case is trial error, as opposed to structural error. Accordingly, harmless error analysis requires this Court to determine whether the tainted evidence was admitted to prove an element of the offense. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 47. \u201c[I]f the tainted evidence was not admitted to prove an element of the offense, then the admission of the evidence will be deemed harmless only if the State demonstrates that the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to the <em>conviction.\u201dDerbyshire, </em>\u00b6 47. Here again, the parties agree that the evidence of marijuana use was not used to prove an element of the offense. Thus, the question is whether the State can demonstrate there is no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b628 As noted by Sage, the State\u2019s harmless error argument on appeal is diametrically opposed to the argument it presented before the District Court. In arguing for the admission of the marijuana evidence in its motion for reconsideration, the State complained that the exclusion of such evidence would \u201ccut the legs out\u201d from under the State\u2019s case. Now the State argues just the opposite, claiming that there was no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction. This argument is disingenuous at best given the State\u2019s position before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b629  In any event, we conclude the State has failed to meet its burden and prove there is \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d that the tainted evidence might have contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction. This Court has recognized in previous cases the prejudicial nature of evidence concerning drug use. <em>See State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, \u00b6 47, 290 Mont. 18, 966 P.2d 103; <em>State v. Beachman, </em>189 Mont. 400, 616 P.2d 337 (1980). In some cases, of course, evidence of drug use is inextricably linked to the allegations in support of the charged offense, and thus the State has the right to bring such evidence to the jury. <em>See State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 79, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53. However, the State concedes this is not the state of affairs in the case sub judice. Moreover, given the numerous occasions throughout trial where drug use was mentioned, this case is distinguishable from <em>Insua </em>where the references to drug use by the defendant were relatively brief and minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b630  Furthermore, when evaluating the impact of tainted evidence it is \u201cthe <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence (more specifically, the qualitative impact the tainted evidence might have had on the fact-finder), not the <em>quantity </em>of the admissible evidence, [which] is the proper focus when determining whether trial error was harmless. To that end, the State must show that, <em>qualitatively, </em>there is no reasonable possibility the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 54 (citing <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 43-44, 46). It is patent in this case that the State wanted evidence of drug use at Sage\u2019s house to be firmly in the mind of the jury. We agree with Sage that this evidence likely painted him as either a person who gave \u201cpot parties\u201d at his house, or was possibly a drug dealer. At any rate, we simply cannot conclude that the State has satisfied its burden to show that there was \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d that evidence of drugs contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction. Thus, we conclude that the admission of this evidence was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">\u00b631 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted the disputed photographs into evidence ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b632 Sage argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted the photographs of the other women, himself, and the depictions of his penis under the transaction rule. Sage contends that the disputed photographs were not \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the charged offense and were highly prejudicial. Sage notes that the State told the jury the photographs would \u201cmake a sailor blush.\u201d Sage argues that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>recently noted in <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152, that the transaction rule \u201cshould not be permitted to admit propensity evidence that would otherwise be excluded by Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 46, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b633 The State contends the disputed photographs were properly admitted under the transaction rule. The State notes that in order to convict Sage of SIWC it was required to prove that: (1) Sage had sexual intercourse with Mary; (2) it was without Mary\u2019s consent; and (3) Sage acted knowingly. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-503(1), MCA. Further, Sage requested and received a lesser included offense instruction for sexual assault. In order to prove sexual assault, the State was required to show that: (1) Sage subjected Mary to sexual contact; (2) without Mary\u2019s consent; and (3) Sage acted knowingly. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-502(1), MCA. Sexual contact in this context includes \u201cthe touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely ... cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another ... [or] arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(67), MCA. Accordingly, the State contends that Sage himself broadened the scope of the transaction from a forcible rape, to include assertions that he shaved Mary\u2019s pubic area. Thus, the State argues that the photographs demonstrate the nature of Sage\u2019s sexual advances and interest in Mary, and show that his contact with Mary was done for purposeful or knowing arousal or sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b634 Furthermore, although the State notes the District Court\u2019s discomfort with admitting the photographs as evidence of \u201cgrooming\u201d behavior, the State argues that nothing in this Court\u2019s case law should be construed to limit grooming evidence to only those cases involving a minor. The State contends the evidence shows how Sage gradually introduced sexual elements into his relationship with Mary after he gained her trust, by complimenting her, showing her the photographs, asking her to pose for him, and telling her that he liked his women \u201cbald.\u201d The State argues that the photographs were properly admitted under the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b635 Alternatively, the State argues that if the admission of the photographs is found by the Court to be in error, their admission was harmless. In this connection, the State notes that Sage challenges only the admission of the photographs themselves, but not Mary\u2019s direct testimony that Sage showed her the pictures. The State contends, therefore, that the jury was presented with admissible evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>proved the same facts as the allegedly \u201ctainted\u201d evidence. Accordingly, the State argues that there was no reasonable possibility that the photographs themselves might have contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction. Finally, the State notes that the District Court gave a cautionary instruction when it admitted the photographs, and contends this instruction was sufficient to cure any prejudice to Sage.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b636 This case presents the Court with another opportunity to clarify the scope and application of the transaction rule. We note that our recent caselaw in this area has emphasized the fact that the transaction rule should not be used to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts in violation of M. R. Evid. 404(b) in order to prove the character of a defendant and show that he acted in conformity with that character in relation to the currently charged offense, when the State fails to comply with the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>Berosik, </em>\u00b6 46; <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 26. While this Court recognizes \u201cthe legitimacy of admitting properly limited evidence that is \u2018intrinsic to\u2019 or \u2018inextricably intertwined with\u2019 a charged crime,\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing authorities), courts must nonetheless exercise great caution when handling potentially inflammatory propensity or character evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfL\">[W]e explained in <em>State v. Croteau, </em>248 Mont. 403, 407, 812 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1991), and again in <em>State v. Ray, </em>267 Mont. 128, 133-34, 882 P.2d 1013, 1016 (1994), that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts must, as a general rule, be excluded because \u201cprior acts or crimes are highly prejudicial to the defendant, and usually irrelevant for purposes of the charged crime.\u201d Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or uncharged misconduct creates the risk that the jury will penalize him simply for his past bad character, <em>Croteau, </em>248 Mont. at 407-08, 812 P.2d at <em>1253; Ray, </em>267 Mont. at 134, 882 P.2d at 1016, or prejudge him and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against the particular crime charged, <em>State v. Gowan, </em>2000 MT 277, \u00b6 19, 302 Mont. 127, 13 P.3d 376.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfO\"><em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b637 Similarly, in <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S. Ct. 644 (1997), the United States Supreme Court also noted the dangers of such \u201cpropensity evidence\u201d in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cCourts that follow the common-law tradition almost unanimously have come to disallow resort by the prosecution to any kind of evidence of a defendant\u2019s evil character to establish a probability of his guilt. Not that the law invests the defendant with a presumption of good character, <em>Greer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>245 U.S. 559, 62 L. Ed. 469, 38 S. Ct. 209, but it simply closes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>whole matter of character, disposition and reputation on the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. The state may not show defendant\u2019s prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge. The overriding policy of excluding such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><em>Old </em>Chief, 519 U.S. at 181, 117 S. Ct. at 650-51 <em>(quoting Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 475-76, 69 S. Ct. 213 (1948) (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b638 On the other hand, we have recognized the importance of admitting evidence under the transaction rule in order to ensure that the jury hears the applicable evidence \u201cso that it may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the alleged criminal act occurred.\u201d <em>Berosik, </em>\u00b6 45 <em>(citing Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 29). In <em>Old Chief, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized the State\u2019s important interest in presenting its case in full narrative richness, and satisfying a jury\u2019s natural tendency to want to hear the full story of the alleged offense. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188-89, 117 S. Ct. at 654. In this connection, the Supreme Court noted that the State\u2019s ability to fully present its case is important to its overall credibility with the jury, and reassures the jury that the State is not withholding evidence necessary to decide the case. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 188 n. 9, 117 S. Ct. at 654 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b639  With these considerations in mind, we now turn to the disputed evidence. The District Court premised its decision to admit the disputed photographs primarily on the grounds that the jury needed the full context in order to understand and pass judgment on whether Sage committed the offense of SIWC. The District Court held the evidence was admissible under the transaction rule because it \u201chelps explain\u201d the charged conduct. However, we conclude that because the disputed photographs were not \u201cintrinsic to\u201d or \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the SIWC or sexual assault charges, the fact that these photographs might \u201chelp explain\u201d the charged conduct is insufficient to bring them under the ambit of the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u00b640 The allegations in support of the SIWC charge were that Sage forcibly raped Mary against her will. The disputed photographs underscore Sage\u2019s sexual interest in women in general and even Mary herself. The photographs of Sage\u2019s penis also speak to a prurient interest in pornography. Thus, from a certain perspective, they could certainly provide context for the circumstances under which the offense occurred, and fairly lead to the conclusion that Sage was attempting to get Mary to engage in some sort of sexual activity with him. However, it is quite another thing to conclude that such evidence is inextricably intertwined with the allegations that Sage forcibly raped Mary, or committed a sexual assault, simply because it provides some context for the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b641  Here, the photographs are not evidence of any of the facts in dispute and do not explain how Sage knowingly had sexual intercourse with Mary without her consent, or that he knowingly committed a sexual assault. Evidence of these disputed facts came from the testimony of Mary herself, or other testimony elicited at trial. Thus, we hold that the District Court erroneously admitted the disputed photographs under the transaction rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b642  Finally, we cannot conclude that the admission of the photographs was harmless error. These photographs are shocking, disgusting, and highly offensive; therefore the State cannot establish that there was no reasonable possibility their admission might have contributed to Sage\u2019s conviction. Indeed, the State characterized the photographs to the jury as sufficient to \u201cmake a sailor blush,\u201d thus emphasizing to the jury their prejudicial character. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to conclude that the cautionary instruction given by the District Court was sufficient to mitigate the prejudicial impact of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b643 We conclude the District Court abused its discretion when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>admitted evidence of marijuana use at Sage\u2019s house and the disputed photographs under the transaction rule. We reverse Sage\u2019s conviction and remand this matter for a new trial in a manner consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-13\"> Marian and Sage were married prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> The transaction rule reads as follows: \u201cWhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> \u201c \u2018Grooming\u2019 is \u2018the process of cultivating trust with a victim and gradually introducing sexual behaviors until reaching the point\u2019 where it is possible to perpetrate a sex crime against the victim.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 1279, 1283 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> The State suggests in its brief that the photographs could be admitted for \u201cother purposes\u201d under M. R. Evid. 404(b), such as to corroborate Mary\u2019s testimony that Sage showed her the disputed photographs and talked to her about his interests in \u201cexotic\u201d photography. We make two points in this connection. First, the State failed to comply with the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. Thus, the State\u2019s argument for admission of this evidence for \u201cother purposes\u201d under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is a nonstarter. Second, the State correctly notes that Mary\u2019s testimony <em>about </em>the pictures, and the fact that Sage showed them to her, has not been challenged on appeal. Accordingly, our Opinion expresses no view on these collateral issues and is solely concerned with the admission of the photographs themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b139-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AMz\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b644 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion that under the circumstances of this case the admission of drug use at Sage\u2019s house was not harmless error and, thus, the conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b645 However, I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding regarding the photographs.
