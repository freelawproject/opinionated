We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\u00b62 Sharon K. Snyder is the paternal grandmother of W.B.S. and D.C.S. Tanya N. Spaulding is the children\u2019s mother. Their father (Sharon\u2019s son) is deceased. Sharon commenced the instant action in September 2007 by filing a petition for grandparent visitation pursuant to \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA (grandparent-grandchild contact). Tanya initially objected to Sharon\u2019s request for contact with the children; however, \u201cwith misgivings,\u201d she eventually entered into a stipulation with Sharon under which Sharon would be allowed specified periods of contact with the children (alternating Saturdays, three days during Christmas/winter break from school, and one week during the summer). The District Court entered an order adopting the stipulation on May 27, 2008. Notably, the case had not yet proceeded to a hearing on the merits of Sharon\u2019s petition, and neither the stipulation nor the District Court\u2019s order recites any of the findings specified in \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, except that \u201cit serves the best interests of the children for there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>to be grandparent/grandchild contact as permitted by \u00a7 40-9-101, et seq., MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b63 Fifteen months later, in August 2009, Tanya terminated contact between Sharon and the children. According to Tanya, a number of factors led to this decision. First, she had recently seen a manuscript, written by Sharon about her own life, which Tanya found greatly disturbing. In it, Sharon expressed the view that W.B.S. is a \u201ccrystal child\u201d who has \u201chealing hands\u201d and can \u201csee the future.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a letter to Tanya, Sharon suggested that Tanya, \u201cas a responsible parent,\u201d should see to it that W.B.S. receives all the help he can get as he grows in his abilities. Sharon also suggested that she (Sharon) was the person to provide W.B.S. with the help and guidance he needs. These beliefs conflicted with Tanya\u2019s beliefs as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. Second, Tanya felt that Sharon was discrediting Tanya\u2019s family beliefs and interfering with Tanya\u2019s parenting of the children. Tanya stated that Sharon was instilling certain views in the children against Tanya\u2019s express wishes. Moreover, Tanya believed that Sharon was encouraging the children to be deceptive toward Tanya, and she noted that W.B.S. was hostile and distant toward her following his visits with Sharon. Lastly, Tanya cited Sharon\u2019s \u201cmental health issues,\u201d and in this regard, she pointed to Sharon\u2019s claim in the manuscript that she (Sharon) had been reborn as a different person with a different name and memories. Tanya concluded that Sharon should not be around the children and that contact between Sharon and the children was not in the children\u2019s best interests. Tanya thus decided to terminate the contact previously stipulated to.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b64 To that end, Tanya filed a motion in the District Court on September 14, 2009, to terminate the court-ordered contact between Sharon and the children. Sharon then filed a cross-motion for contempt, claiming that Tanya had violated the May 2008 stipulation by suspending all contact \u201cwithout sufficient justification.\u201d In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to this claim, Tanya asserted that her constitutional right to parent and protect her children gave her authority to remove the children from <em>\u201ca </em>harmful situation\u201d and that the court should not punish her or interfere with her decision as a parent in doing what she believed was best for her children. The District Court held a hearing in December 2009, at the conclusion of which it denied Tanya\u2019s motion to terminate and held her in contempt of the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 order adopting the stipulation. The court noted, though, that Tanya \u201ccan purge that contempt by honoring the stipulation and order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b65 In denying Tanya\u2019s motion, the District Court concluded that she had not met her burden. There was some uncertainty by all involved, however, as to the applicable law and the showing that had to be made. Section 40-9-102, MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sets out the procedures to be followed, the burdens of proof, and the showings to be made with regard to an initial petition for grandparent-grandchild contact. However, neither this statute nor any other statute in Title 40, chapter 9, MCA, purports expressly to address modifications to or terminations of previously entered orders for such contact (with one exception not applicable here, <em>see </em>\u00a7 40-9-102(7), MCA). Thus, Tanya argued that the court should simply follow the framework of \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, since this statute lists the factors that are relevant in determining whether grandparent-grandchild contact is appropriate. Sharon, however, suggested that the court should apply \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, which is applicable to amendments of parenting plans. This statute provides, in relevant part, that a court may amend a prior parenting plan \u201cif it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-219(1), MCA. Sharon thus argued that Tanya had to show that something had happened after the signing of the stipulation, or that something had come to light that was unknown at the time the stipulation was signed, which triggered or necessitated a modification to the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b66 The District Court disagreed with Tanya\u2019s approach, reasoning that \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, was inapplicable because a contact arrangement was already in place. Instead, the court essentially followed Sharon\u2019s approach. The court agreed that events occurring prior to the stipulation, as well as the parties\u2019 intentions upon entering into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>stipulation, were irrelevant. The court posited that the stipulation was a \u201ccontract,\u201d which Tanya had \u201cbreached,\u201d and that the issue was whether the contract should now be modified due to new circumstances. Ultimately, the court concluded that Tanya had not carried the burden imposed by \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, to show that an amendment was warranted. The court emphasized several times that Tanya had not established a \u201ccause and effect\u201d between Sharon\u2019s conduct and any harm to the children. It is apparent from the court\u2019s reasoning that it believed Tanya had to show demonstrable harm to the children as a result of their contact with Sharon before a modification would be warranted. The court did not consider the presumption in favor of a fit parent\u2019s wishes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA. Indeed, the court did not address whether Tanya is a \u201cfit\u201d parent under \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, nor did it give any special weight to Tanya\u2019s determination of her children\u2019s best interests. To the contrary, the court discounted Tanya\u2019s concerns relating to Sharon as mere \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cinnuendo,\u201d and the court basically chalked up their dispute to \u201creligious beliefs mixed up with family feuds\u201d and \u201can incredible amount of family dysfunction and accusations and simmering hatred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b67 The District Court entered an order on December 30, 2009. As noted, the court denied Tanya\u2019s motion to terminate the stipulation and held her in contempt of the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 order adopting the stipulation, though the court stated that she could purge this contempt by complying with the court\u2019s order for grandparent-grandchild contact. Tanya now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b68 Although Tanya articulates a number of issues, we conclude that the following issue (restated here) is dispositive: Did the District Court apply an incorrect standard for evaluating a parent\u2019s request to modify or terminate an order for grandparent-grandchild contact? We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes. <em>In re T.H., </em>2005 MT 237, \u00b6 35, 328 Mont. 428, 121 P.3d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b69 At the outset, we do not agree that the May 2008 stipulation was a \u201ccontract\u201d that Tanya \u201cbreached.\u201d The stipulation merely served as \u201c[a] voluntary agreement between opposing parties concerning some relevant point,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1455 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004), which the District Court in turn adopted as the disposition of Sharon\u2019s petition for grandparent-grandchild contact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Hence, contract principles concerning breach, remedy, and rescission do not govern here. Rather, the issue is simply whether the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 order providing for contact between Sharon and the children should be modified or terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b610 In this regard, the District Court erred in relying on \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. For one thing, this statute governs amendments to parenting plans adopted in the context of marriage dissolutions; and here, Sharon is not the children\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 order does not constitute a \u201cparenting plan,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 40-4-234(2), MCA. But more importantly, it is not appropriate to simply import wholesale into the context <em>o\u00ed grandparent-grandchild contact </em>the standards and procedures that govern the allocation of <em>parenting </em>functions upon a dissolution of marriage. In the latter context, the central issue is the division of parenting responsibilities between the parents, whereas in the former context, the issue is contact between a child and a nonparent over the parent\u2019s objection. This is a critical distinction. Both parties to a \u201cparenting plan\u201d are \u201cparents\u201d; and, in this sense, both are possessed of the same fundamental rights with respect to the parenting of their child. But the same is not true in grandparent-contact cases, where one party is a nonparent asking a court to overturn the decision of a parent notwithstanding the parent\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning her child\u2019s associates. This second scenario requires delicate balancing of the rights of the parent vis-a-vis the interests of the nonparent, as well as the interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b611 The question remains, then, as to the analysis the District Court was to conduct in considering Tanya\u2019s motion. As just explained, \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, is not the appropriate framework; yet, as noted earlier, the grandparent-contact statutes do not expressly address modifications to or terminations of a previously entered contact order (except where the child is adopted by a person other than a stepparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>or a grandparent, in which case contact is automatically terminated, <em>see </em>\u00a7 40-9-102(7), MCA, which is not the situation here). We must turn, therefore, to the underlying constitutional principles and legislative intent regarding initial petitions for grandparent contact and apply those to motions for modification or termination of an existing contact order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b612 The Supreme Court has held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the \u201cliberty\u201d specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause includes the right to direct the education and upbringing of one\u2019s children. <em>Washington v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 2267 (1997). Indeed, \u201cthe interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u201d is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests the Supreme Court has recognized under the Due Process Clause. <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2060 (2000) (plurality opinion). \u201cThe history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children,\u201d including \u201cthe inculcation of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good citizenship.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 232, 233, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 1541, 1542 (1972). \u201cThis primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 92 S. Ct. at 1541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b613 We have likewise recognized that \u201c \u2018a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re E.W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 190, 959 P.2d 951 <em>(quoting In re R.B., Jr., </em>217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848 (1985)). This Court has held that \u201cthe constitutional rights of a natural parent to parent his or her child\u201d require \u201c\u2018careful protection.\u2019 <em>\u201dIn re A.R.A., 277 </em>Mont. 66, 70, 919 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) (quoting <em>In re Doney, </em>174 Mont. 282, 286, 570 P.2d 575, 577 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b614 In <em>Troxel, </em>the Supreme Court considered a Washington statute (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 26.10.160(3) (1994)) which permitted \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to petition a superior court for visitation rights \u201cat any time,\u201d and which authorized that court to grant such visitation rights whenever \u201cvisitation may serve the best interest of the child.\u201d The Washington Supreme Court held this statute invalid on its face, <em>In re Smith, </em>969 P.2d 21 (Wash. 1998), and the Supreme Court affirmed, although under somewhat differing rationales.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b615 A plurality (Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer) concluded that the statute, as applied to Granville (the mother), unconstitutionally infringed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>fundamental parental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her two daughters. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 67, 120 S. Ct. at 2060-61. Essentially, the plurality found the trial court\u2019s decision problematic, not because the court had intervened in the dispute between Granville and the Troxels (the grandparents), but because its decision granting the Troxels\u2019 petition for visitation rights was based on \"nothing more than a simple disagreement\u201d with Granville, a fit custodial parent. <em>Id. </em>at 69, 72, 120 S. Ct. at 2062, 2063. The trial court gave no special weight at all to Granville\u2019s determination of her daughters\u2019 best interests; the court\u2019s presumption in favor of grandparent visitation directly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of her child; and in that respect, the court failed to provide any protection for Granville\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the rearing of her own daughters. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 72, 120 S. Ct. at 2062, 2063; <em>see also id. </em>at 67-68, 120 S. Ct. at 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b616 Writing separately, Justice Souter would have affirmed the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s determination that its statute was invalid on its face because it swept too broadly. <em>See id. </em>at 75-77, 120 S. Ct. at 2065-66 (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment). Also writing separately, Justice Thomas concluded that \"the State of Washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest-to say nothing of a compelling one-in second-guessing a fit parent\u2019s decision regarding visitation with third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 120 S. Ct. at 2068 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b617 Six years later, in <em>Polasek v. Omura, </em>2006 MT 103, 332 Mont. 157, 136 P.3d 519, this Court considered the interplay between <em>Troxel </em>and \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA. At the time, the statute authorized a district court to grant grandparent-grandchild contact \u201cupon a finding by the court, after a hearing, that the contact would be in the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6 10 n. 2. We concluded that while this criterion was not inconsistent with <em>Troxel, </em>the statutory scheme failed to delineate all of the criteria that must be considered in a grandparent-contact proceeding. After examining the <em>Troxel </em>decision, we concluded that the following procedure must be followed. First, the court must determine whether the child\u2019s parent is fit, i.e., whether the parent \u201c \u2018adequately cares for his or her children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at 2061). Second, if the parent is fit, then a presumption arises in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes, because \u201c \u2018the Due Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u201cbetter\u201d decision could be made.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S. Ct. at 2064). But if the parent is not fit, then no presumption arises and the parent\u2019s wishes are due no deference. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15. Lastly, we noted that the statute\u2019s best-interest standard \u201cremains intact as the standard by which a grandparent\u2019s request for contact must be judged.\u201d <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 20. But we held that the petitioning grandparent must prove \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to have contact with the grandparent and, in the case of an objecting fit parent, that the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15. We explained that the clear-and-convincing standard is proper given the \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d we apply to any infringement on a person\u2019s right to parent a child. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>In re Aschenbrenner, </em>182 Mont. 540, 544-45, 597 P.2d 1156, 1160 (1979), and <em>Pierce v. Pierce, </em>198 Mont. 255, 260, 645 P.2d 1353, 1356 (1982)). We then reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings given that the district court had not inquired into the mother\u2019s fitness as a parent and had failed to accord her wishes any deference. <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Indeed, not unlike the present case, the district court had reasoned that \u201c[ojther than Petra [the mother] and Dr. Allen\u2019s [the child\u2019s clinical psychologist] concern that the grandparents may impart something negative about the mother, there is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that unfettered visitation between grandparents and child would be in anyway [sic] harmful to the child.\u201d <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b618 Following our decision in <em>Polasek, </em>the Legislature amended \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, \u201cto make Montana statutes reflect [the holdings in <em>Troxel </em>and Polasek] regarding the constitutional rights of custodial parents to determine who a child may or may not have contact with.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 495, at 2228. As further explained in the preamble to SB 27 (2007), \u201cthe Legislature believes in the constitutional right of parents to control the actions and conduct of their children and believes that third parties should not be allowed, through the courts, to control the actions of those children if the parents are fit and proper parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To that end, the Legislature incorporated into the statute the procedure set out in \u00b6 15 of <em>Polasek. See id., </em>\u00a7 1, at 2229. Following another amendment in 2009, which clarified the standard for determining parental fitness, <em>see </em>Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 92, \u00a7 1, at 1377-78, the statute now states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (7), the district court may grant to a grandparent of a child reasonable rights to contact with the child....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(2) Before a court may grant a petition brought pursuant to this section for grandparent-grandchild contact over the objection of a parent whose parental rights have not been terminated, the court shall make a determination as to whether the objecting parent is a fit parent. A determination of fitness and granting of the petition may be made only after a hearing, upon notice as determined by the court. Fitness must be determined on the basis of whether the parent adequately cares for the parent\u2019s child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">(3) Grandparent-grandchild contact may be granted over the objection of a parent determined by the court pursuant to subsection (2) to be unfit only if the court also determines by clear and convincing evidence that the contact is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">(4) Grandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section over the objections of a fit parent may be granted only upon a finding by the court, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that the contact with the grandparent would be in the best interest of the child and that the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">(7) This section does not apply if the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or a grandparent. Grandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section terminates upon the adoption of the child by a person other than a stepparent or a grandparent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Section 40-9-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b619  As stated earlier, we must apply the principles underlying the <em>Troxel </em>and <em>Polasek </em>decisions and the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, to a motion by the parent to modify or terminate an existing order for contact. In so doing, we first observe that the constitutional rights discussed in <em>Troxel </em>and <em>Polasek </em>do not simply evaporate because a contact order has been issued. The parent still retains her fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her children. And, as a component of that right, the parent may obtain modification or termination of a previously issued contact order where it is in the best interests of the child or where the contact previously ordered by the court is unduly interfering with the parent\u2019s primary role in the child\u2019s upbringing, including the inculcation of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>citizenship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to Tanya\u2019s suggested approach, the parent (as the moving party) has the burden to show that modification or termination is appropriate. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 26-1-401, -402, MCA. However, we conclude that this showing must be made by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, in evaluating the evidence, a fit parent\u2019s estimation of her child\u2019s best interests is entitled to deference, and the judge may not disregard or reject a fit parent\u2019s views on continued visitation simply because he disagrees with them or thinks himself more enlightened than the parent. Finally, the parent is not required to establish that the previously ordered contact has, is, or will cause the child concrete harm. We reject the proposition that a child must suffer demonstrable harm as a result of the contact before the contact order may be modified or terminated (the \u201ccause and effect\u201d standard employed by the District Court in this case). Nor is the parent restricted in the presentation of evidence to \u201cfacts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan.\u201d Section 40-4-219(1), MCA (concerning parenting plan amendments). There are myriad facts-some occurring before the entry of a grandparent-contact order, and some occurring after it-that may inform a parent\u2019s views on the prudence of continued contact with the nonparent. To adequately protect the parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her child, the parent must be allowed to present any evidence which bears on those decisions as they relate to contact with the nonparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b620 In the present case, the May 2008 stipulation essentially short-circuited the process dictated by \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA. No determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>has been made as to whether Tanya is a fit parent-i.e., whether she adequately cares for her children. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at 2061; <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15; \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA. And no determination has been made (if Tanya is in fact a fit parent) as to whether the presumption in favor of her wishes has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA. Also, while the stipulation states that \u201cit serves the best interests of the children for there to be grandparent/grandchild contact,\u201d the District Court never made such a finding based specifically on clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-9-102(3), (4), MCA. At this late point, however, these omissions are essentially water over the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\">\u00b621  On remand, it will be necessary for the District Court to make a fitness determination under \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA, and to allow Tanya to present evidence that modification or termination of the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 contact order is in the best interests of her children or is necessary because the grandparent-grandchild contact previously ordered by the court is unduly interfering with Tanya\u2019s primary role in the children\u2019s upbringing. As noted, Tanya must show by a preponderance of the evidence that modification or termination is appropriate. And if the court finds that she is a fit parent, then Tanya\u2019s views on continued visitation and the best interests of her children must be given deference in the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b622  The District Court applied an incorrect standard for evaluating Tanya\u2019s request to modify or terminate the court\u2019s May 27, 2008 order for grandparent-grandchild contact. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s December 30,2009 Order and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIW\">\u00b623 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\"> Crystal children, also known as indigo children, were first described in the 1970s by a San Diego parapsychologist who noticed the emergence of children with an indigo aura, a vibrational color she had never seen before. This color, she reasoned, coincided with a new consciousness. <em>See </em>John Leland, <em>Are They Here to Save the World? </em>N.Y. Times (Jan. 12, 2006). Indigo children are said to have high IQs, acute intuition, and special abilities-e.g., the ability to read minds, predict the future, and bend silverware through sheer brainpower-and they are believed by some to play a significant role in human evolution, although skeptics argue that this is simply New Age credulity and \u201ca sham diagnosis\u201d for authority-resistant, disruptive, impatient, and easily bored children. <em>See </em>id.; Sharon Jayson, <em>Indigo Kids: Does the Science Fly ? </em>USA Today (posted May 31,2005; updated June 1,2005); Jesse Hyde, <em>Little Boy Blue </em>Dallas Observer (Mar. 9, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\"> Statutory references are to the 2009 Montana Code Annotated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\"> A \u201cparent\u201d is \u201c[t]he lawful father or mother of someone,\u201d which \u201ccommonly includes (1) either the natural father or the natural mother of a child, (2) the adoptive father or adoptive mother of a child, (3) a child\u2019s putative blood parent who has expressly acknowledged paternity, and (4) an individual or agency whose status as guardian has been established by judicial decree.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1144. The Montana Code Annotated contains similar definitions. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20-5-501(4)(e), 40-5-201(10), 40-5-804(10), 40-6-501(4)(e), 40-6-601(2)(b), 41-3-102(16), 41-5-103(32), 42-1-103(14), MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 40-4-211(6), MCA (defining \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d); \u00a7 40-4-234(1), MCA (defining \u201cparenting functions\u201d). In addition, \u00a7 40-4-228, MC\u00c1, provides that a nonparent may obtain a parental interest in a child. <em>See Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595. That is not the situation here, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-5\"> The Legislature, of course, may enact reasonable procedures designed to prevent frivolous or vexatious motions to modify or terminate a contact order. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 40-4-219(5), MCA (\u201cAttorney fees and costs must be assessed against a party seeking frivolous or repeated amendment if the court finds that the amendment action is vexatious and constitutes harassment.\u201d). As for the present case, however, there is no indication that Tanya\u2019s motion (which she filed after roughly 15 months of court-ordered contact) was frivolous or vexatious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> In <em>Polasek, </em>we held that <em>the petitioning grandparents </em>showings must meet the clear-and-convincing standard. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15. We adopted this high standard because of the close scrutiny we apply to any infringement on a person\u2019s right to parent a child. <em>Id. </em>But where <em>the parent </em>seeks to modify or terminate an existing order for contact, it is counterintuitive to require her to meet this same high standard, which as noted was adopted in the first place to protect her rights against infringement by the grandparent. We therefore adopt the lesser preponderance standard for a parent seeking modification or termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> Given our disposition of this appeal, we need not address Tanya\u2019s claims that the grandparent-grandchild contact statutes violate her fundamental right to parent by restricting her ability to modify or terminate court-ordered contact when the grandparent has interceded in the parent-child relationship. As for Tanya\u2019s request that we reverse the District Court\u2019s order holding her in contempt, our reversal of the court\u2019s December 30, 2009 order disposes of that particular contempt ruling. As for the subsequent contempt ruling of February 25,2010, that ruling is beyond the scope of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
