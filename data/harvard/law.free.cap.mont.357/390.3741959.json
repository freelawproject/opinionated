He challenges the disposition of his motion for appointment of new counsel and to withdraw his guilty pleas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err when inquiring into Happel\u2019s complaint that defense counsel had rendered ineffective assistance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b64 On January 5, 2009, the State charged Happel for assault with a weapon, two counts of tampering with physical evidence, felony theft, and sought designation of Happel as a persistent felony offender for his involvement in an altercation outside a Billings bar. The State alleged that, following removal of Happel\u2019s companion from the bar by a bouncer, a fight ensued and Happel attacked a party aiding the bouncer, stabbing the party multiple times in the back. Happel then handed his knife to a woman bystander and fled the scene in a black pickup truck, which police determined had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b65 After police apprehended Happel, Moira D Alton was assigned as his counsel. Happel initially entered not guilty pleas to all counts, and D Alton filed a notice of intention to interpose the defense of justifiable use of force and a notice to raise defense of a third person as an affirmative defense. Later, a plea agreement was reached wherein the State dismissed the two tampering charges and Happel agreed to plead guilty to criminal endangerment, reduced from assault with a weapon, and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b66 Happel initialed each page of the written plea agreement and at the end affirmed he was \u201csatisfied with my attorneys services and advice\u201d and signed his name. The agreement stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaYO\">This plea is being voluntarily made and not the result of force, threat, or coercion. I acknowledge that my attorney has explained to me and advised me of the following and I fully understand the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">There is a 1 (c) plea agreement in this case. The State and [Happel] will jointly recommend the sentence of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">Count I: Criminal Endangerment: Ten (10) years to Montana State Prison with Three (3) suspended, as Persistent Felony Offender, $ 2000 fine, and reasonable restitution</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjH\">Count II: Theft (Felony): Ten (10) years to Montana State Prison with Three (3) suspended, as Persistent Felony Offender, $ 2000 fine, concurrent with count I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Defendant may argue for a Boot Camp designation from the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">I further understand that if the plea is rejected by the Court that I will not be entitled to withdraw my plea of Guilty as a matter of law. [Emphasis omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The plea agreement also stated that the State intended to pursue designation of Happel as a persistent felony offender and set forth the maximum sentences which could be imposed upon Happel as a persistent offender for each charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">The State has filed Intent to Have Defendant Designated a Persistent Felony Offender, [and] pursuant to [\u00a7] 46-18-502(l)[,] MCA, Defendant could be sentenced to a term of not less than 5 years and not more [than] 100 years together with a fine of $ 50,000; and not less than 10 years and not more [than] 100 years together with a fine of $ 50,000 pursuant to [\u00a7] 46-18-502(2)[,] MCA. [Emphasis omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\u00b67 At the change of plea hearing, the following exchanges occurred during the colloquy between the District Court and Happel, who was attended by D\u2019Alton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve been provided with an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights and Plea Agreement, did you sign that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">MR. HAPPEL: Yes ma\u2019am.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">THE COURT: Did you have an opportunity to go through the document with Ms. D\u2019Alton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">MR. HAPPEL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">THE COURT: Do you understand that the State has filed a notice to pursue you as a persistent felony offender which would make the maximum possible sentence that you face on each of these felony charges 100 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">MR. HAPPEL: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">THE COURT: And do you understand that that agreement is not binding on the Court, and if the Court were to sentence you more severely, that would not be grounds to withdraw your guilty pleas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>MR. HAPPEL: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Happel then acknowledged his satisfaction with D\u2019Alton\u2019s advice and services, the court accepted his guilty pleas, and the matter was set for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b68 On April 25, 2009, Happel sent a six-page, handwritten, self-represented motion seeking withdrawal of his guilty pleas and appointment of new counsel to the county attorney. Happel\u2019s letter asserted that his pleas had been entered because of the ineffective assistance of his counsel, articulating that D\u2019Alton had failed to advise him of \u201cthe consequences of a (l)(c) plea-agreement\u201d as being nonbinding upon the court and had failed to advise him that he would be sentenced as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b69 Because Happel had not filed his motion, the District Court initiated the sentencing hearing as scheduled on May 11, unaware of it. At the beginning of the hearing, D\u2019Alton brought Happel\u2019s motion to the attention of the court. The court asked for a response from the prosecutor, who argued that Happel\u2019s allegations were \u201ccompletely contrary to the entire record as well as specifically his written acknowledgment and waiver of rights ....\u201d The court then asked D\u2019Alton for a response. D\u2019Alton replied, \u201cWell, Your Honor, I\u2019m not really sure what to say. This is not a Finley hearing as far as I can tell, so I don\u2019t think I can respond to Mr. Happel\u2019s allegations.\u201d The District Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">[T]here\u2019s six pages here of this motion that I\u2019ve just received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">So I guess what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to continue the sentencing, but I will review the motion, and then I will determine if we need a hearing, and if we do, when. Because I think I have the authority to determine if it meets the initial criteria for the motion. So we\u2019ll continue the hearing ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b610 At a hearing on May 22, 2009, the District Court stated its conclusion that there were \u201cno seemingly substantial\u201d complaints raised and denied Happel\u2019s motions. On June 22, 2009, the court sentenced Happel consistent with the terms of the plea agreement and granted Happel\u2019s request for placement in boot camp. Happel appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a request for appointment of new counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gallagher (Gallagher I), </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 10, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371; <em>State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, \u00b6 95, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749; <em>Halley v. State, </em>2008 MT 193, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 37, 186 P.3d 859; <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err when inquiring into Happel\u2019s complaint that defense counsel had rendered ineffective assistance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b613 Happel challenges the District Court\u2019s \u201cinitial inquiry\u201d into his request for appointment of new counsel, which, he argues, must \u201c[a]t a minimum\u201d provide opportunity for the defendant to explain his concerns and defense counsel to respond. The State argues the District Court conducted an adequate inquiry based upon its review of Happel\u2019s motion and the record, and correctly determined that Happel had failed to make a \u201cseemingly substantial complaint\u201d about his counsel which would have necessitated a formal hearing. Alternatively, the State argues that Happel did not have a basis to withdraw his guilty plea, thereby rendering harmless any shortcomings in the District Court\u2019s initial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b614 Criminal defendants have a fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24; <em>State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 50, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571. If a defendant asserts denial of effective assistance and requests appointment of new counsel, a district court must conduct an \u201cadequate initial inquiry\u201d to determine whether the defendant\u2019s claim is \u201cseemingly substantial.\u201d <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Racz, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. Holder, </em>2007 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33, 336 Mont. 91, 152 P.3d 722. We have explained that \u201cthe threshold issue to determine whether a complaint is substantial is not whether counsel was ineffective, but rather whether the district court made an adequate inquiry into the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 30, 318 Mont. 516, 82 P.3d 20 (citing <em>State v. Weaver, </em>276 Mont. 505, 511, 917 P.2d 437, 441 (1996)). Generally, a district court conducts an adequate inquiry when it analyzes \u201cthe [defendant\u2019s] complaints and made some sort of critical analysis at the time the motion was filed.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 143, 915 P.2d 208, 219 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher (Gallagher II), </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. We have explained that \u201can initial inquiry may be adequate where the court \u2018considered the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>City of Billings v. Smith, </em>281 Mont. 133, 136-37, 932 P.2d 1058, 1060 (1997)). In contrast, we have explained that if a district court fails to conduct \u201ceven a cursory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>inquiry,\u201d such an effort is inadequate and justifies remand of the case for further proceedings. <em>See e.g. Weaver, </em>276 Mont. at 511-12, 917 P.2d at 441-42; <em>City of Billings, </em>281 Mont. at 139-41, 932 P.2d at 1061-63; <em>State v. Enright, </em>233 Mont. 225, 229, 758 P.2d 779, 782 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds by Gallagher II, </em>\u00b6 21. If a district court\u2019s initial inquiry reveals a seemingly substantial complaint, the court must hold a hearing to address the validity of the complaints, and appoint separate counsel to represent the defendant. <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 32. If the claim is not seemingly substantial, a hearing is unnecessary. <em>Weaver, </em>276 Mont. at 512, 917 P.2d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b615 Happel\u2019s motion was six pages in length and claimed ineffectiveness of his counsel upon two specified grounds. First, he argued that his counsel had failed to explain the application of \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(c), MCA, under which the plea agreement was not binding upon the sentencing court and his pleas could not be withdrawn should the District Court reject the agreement. Secondly, Happel claimed counsel had not explained the application of the persistent felony offender statute and the possible sentence he faced, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">In furtherance appointed counsel has not explained to defendant what the penalty for \u201cpersistent felony offender designation\u201d actually encompasses. She failed to notify her client that he was pleading guilty to (2) two P.F.O.\u2019s and exactly what the penalty is therein, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.18.502 Subsections (1), and (2), as to what the Court can sentence defendant to if the Court does not accept the non-binding plea-agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b616 Upon receipt of Happel\u2019s motion, the District Court requested comments from counsel in open court and continued the sentencing hearing to undertake review, noting it had \u201cauthority to determine if it meets the initial criteria for the motion.\u201d The court stated it would \u201cdetermine if we need a hearing, and, if we do, when.\u201d The State filed a point brief arguing that the record contained \u201cconclusive\u201d proof contradicting Happel\u2019s two claims. At the next hearing, the District Court denied Happel\u2019s motion, stating \u201cthere are no seemingly substantial complaints made in the pro se petition that would trigger the need for a hearing. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s raised the threshold matters</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b617 \u201cFacts are stubborn things.\u201d Charles Francis Adams, <em>The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States </em>vol. I, 113 (Little, Brown and Co., 1856) (quoting John Adams, <em>Argument in Defense of the Soldiers in the Boston Massacre Trials </em>(Dec. 4, 1770)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The record here contains such stubborn things, directly and completely refuting the factual assertions upon which Happel\u2019s ineffectiveness claims were based. Happel claimed ignorance about a \u201c(l)(c)\u201d plea agreement, but the agreement explicitly stated that \u201c[t]here is a 1 (c) plea agreement in this case,\u201d and further explained what that language meant \u2014 that Happel \u201cunderstand^] that if the plea is rejected by the Court that [he] will not be entitled to withdraw [his] plea of Guilty as a matter of law.\u201d Happel initialed the page on which this explanation was provided. Then, the District Court confirmed Happel\u2019s understanding of this point during the plea colloquy, asking him \u201cdo you understand that that agreement is not binding on the Court, and if the Court were to sentence you more severely, that would not be grounds to withdraw your guilty pleas?\u201d Happel responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b618 As to Happel\u2019s claim that his counsel failed to explain the application of the persistent felony offender statute, the plea agreement explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">The State has filed Intent to Have Defendant Designated a Persistent Felony Offender, pursuant to [\u00a7] 46-18-502(l)[,] MCA, Defendant could be sentenced to a term of not less than 5 years and not more [than] 100 years together with a fine of $ 50,000; and not less than 10 years and not more [than] 100 years together with a fine of $ 50,000 pursuant to [\u00a7] 46-18-502(2)[,] MCA. [Emphasis omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The plea agreement further explained that the parties would <em>\u201cjointly </em>recommend\u201d a persistent felony offender sentence for each offense. (Emphasis added.) Then, the District Court confirmed Happel\u2019s understanding of this designation at the change of plea hearing (\u201cDo you understand that the State has filed a notice to pursue you as a persistent felony offender which would make the maximum possible sentence that you face on each of these felony charges 100 years?\u201d), to which Happel answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b619  Our cases indicate that, generally, \u201can initial inquiry may be adequate where the court \u2018considered the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallagher I, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>City of Billings, </em>281 Mont. at 136-37, 932 P.2d at 1060). Here, the court asked for defense counsel\u2019s response, but counsel declined. While obtaining defense counsel\u2019s explanations as part of an initial inquiry remains the preferable practice, we cannot conclude under the circumstances of this case that the District Court\u2019s inquiry was rendered inadequate. Here, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>directly refuted Happel\u2019s factual assertions, permitting the District Court to make a \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d determination without further input or inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\">1 The change of plea hearing was conducted by the Hon.
