We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Moree\u2019s motion for a mistrial ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u00b64 Moree and Heather Ward (Ward) had a daughter, CM. Ward had another daughter, OW, who was Ward\u2019s child from a different father. Moree and Ward lived together. Because of their jobs, one parent would often watch the children while the other parent was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u00b65 CM was two and one-half months old on November 7, 2005. On that day, Moree stayed with CM while Ward was at work. When Ward came home from work that evening, CM appeared lifeless, limp, blue, and unresponsive. Moree told Ward that CM was fine. Ward eventually took CM to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b66 An examination revealed that CM had suffered a brain injury, two skull fractures, massive retinal hemorrhages, ten rib fractures, and a broken arm. CM started suffering from seizures the day after she was admitted to the hospital. CM was eventually diagnosed as having suffered permanent, life-altering brain trauma. CM will never be able to walk, communicate effectively, or be self-sufficient. CM requires daily therapy. She also suffers from a type of vision impairment, which permits her only to see light and limited movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u00b67 Medical professionals testified that CM\u2019s injuries were serious and deliberate, and that her injuries were consistent with inflicted trauma. More specifically, medical professionals also testified that CM\u2019s injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome, and that those injuries constituted a classic example of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">\u00b68 The State charged Moree with aggravated assault and felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sexual assault on July 28, 2006. The felony sexual assault charge stemmed from the allegation that Moree had raped OW, CM\u2019s older half sister. The District Court eventually severed the charges. Moree proceeded to trial in December 2008 for aggravated assault of CM. The felony sexual assault charge was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b69 Ward testified on direct examination during the State\u2019s case-in-chief that she did not originally believe that Moree had caused CM\u2019s injuries. The State asked whether Ward\u2019s opinion had changed. She replied that it had. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">[State]: And what caused that change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">WARD: I think what-it was a series of events that brought me out of denial. Mainly my oldest daughter had said that he had sexually-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0x\">[State]: I\u2019ll\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">[State]: -stop you there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">The Court: Sustained. The jury will disregard the response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b610 Moree\u2019s counsel subsequently moved for a mistrial, which the District Court denied. Moree was eventually convicted, and the District Court sentenced him to twenty years in prison without the possibility of parole. Moree appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 24, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79. <em>\u201cA </em>district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial is entitled to deference on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">\u00b6 12 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Moree\u2019s motion fora mistrial </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"ApU\">\u00b613 Moree argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a mistrial because Ward\u2019s testimony that Moree had sexually assaulted her daughter was \u201cirrelevant and high [sic] prejudicial to Moree\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d Moree contends that although the District Court instructed the jury to disregard Ward\u2019s response, such an instruction could not cure the prejudicial impact of Ward\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">\u00b614  We find nothing in the record that indicates that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Moree\u2019s motion for a mistrial. As a preliminary matter, we observe that \u201cthe general rule is that where the trial judge withdraws or strikes improper testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>from the record with an accompanying cautionary instruction to the jury, any error committed by the introduction is presumed cured.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 25, 327 Mont. 238, 113 P.3d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b615 Here, the court gave the curative instruction to the jury that it was to disregard Ward\u2019s response. The burden then falls to Moree to rebut the presumption that any error was cured by the instruction. \u00b616 Moree opines that \u201c[b]y all accounts, Moree was a loving and proud father, and included [CM] in his daily activities.\u201d He maintains that \u201c[t]he State failed to present any evidence that [CM] was an irritable or peevish baby that would invoke anger in a caregiver.\u201d Moree urges us to find that the evidence implicating him \u201cwas less than overwhelming and circumstantial at best.\u201d Moree argues, therefore, that there is a reasonable possibility that a juror was swayed by \u201cthe irrelevant and inflammatory sexual assault allegation that led Ward to change her mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b617  Moree has produced no evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that any error was cured by the instruction. Overwhelming evidence of abuse was presented against Moree at trial. Moree was alone with CM when she experienced severe trauma. Ward noticed a substantial change in her daughter when she returned home from work. Doctors concluded that CM had suffered massive retinal hemorrhages, a brain injury, ten rib fractures, two skull fractures, and a broken arm-all as a result of the abuse that she had suffered. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the jury relied on this evidence of abuse when it convicted Moree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b618  We observe lastly that the District Court in this case was in the best position to observe whether Ward\u2019s comment had a prejudicial impact on the jury. <em>See e.g. Bircher v. BNSF Railway Co., </em>2010 MT 121, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 357, 233 P.3d 348. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Moree\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b619 The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Moree\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-10\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
