We affirm. Sartain raises two issues, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Sartain\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge a show-up identification, challenge a warrantless arrest, move to suppress defendant\u2019s statements following arrest, and object to certain remarks of the prosecutor made during trial and in closing argument constitute ineffective assistance of counsel reviewable on direct appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\u00b64 On March 25, 2008, in Bozeman, Timothy Hop returned from snow skiing and found a male intruder in his house. He chased the man out of his house and called 911. Police were dispatched. A responding officer observed a man matching Hop\u2019s description of the intruder jogging down a sidewalk in the area. Another resident of the area, Jason Sch\u00fctz, was watching the jogging man when the officer stopped and asked Sch\u00fctz what he was watching. He responded that the jogging man had just jumped the fence in his backyard, cut through a neighbor\u2019s yard, and then started running down the street. The officer arrested the jogging man, defendant Sartain, on suspicion of burglary. A short time later, the officer took Sartain back to the scene of the burglary, had him step out of the police vehicle and conducted a \u201cshow-up\u201d identification of Sartain first with Hop and then Kristi Helsper, another neighbor who had observed a man jogging down the street after hearing a loud noise. Both stated that Sartain matched the description of the person, but that they were not able to positively identify him. Later at trial, Hop testified that he was positive that Sartain was the intruder. Shortly after the show-up identification, Sartain was taken to the Law and Justice Center in Bozeman, where he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, signed a waiver, and was interviewed by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00b65 The next day, Sartain made an initial appearance injustice court, which set bail and conditionally appointed the State Public Defender as counsel. On April 1,2008, Sartain posted bond and was released. On April 14, 2008, Sartain was charged with burglary, a felony, by information filed in the District Court, and an appearance was scheduled for May 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b66 At the time of his arrest, Sartain was on parole out of the Montana State Prison (MSP) for a two-count burglary sentence from Flathead County. The day after he was released on bond for this charge, Sartain was taken into custody by his parole officer in Butte and detained at the Butte-Silver Bow County Detention Facility. He was subsequently transported to MSP pending parole revocation proceedings on his previous burglary conviction. Sartain remained incarcerated at MSP throughout the prosecution of this matter. He did not appear on May 5, 2008, because of his incarceration, thus the District Court rescheduled his appearance, and it was ultimately held on July 7, 2008. The District Court appointed the State Public Defender to represent Sartain and set an omnibus hearing for August 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b67 At the omnibus hearing, the State filed a notice of intent to seek increased punishment for Sartain as a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, and the discussion then moved to setting a trial date. The prosecutor believed the jury trial would only take one day, but defense counsel requested three days, saying that \u201cif I don\u2019t subpoena all these folks that are involved and have them in here and cross-examine them, my client\u2019s not going to be happy.\u201d Noting that it had available dates for a one-day trial in November 2008 but that the earliest date for a three-day trial was in March 2009, the District Court raised concerns about Sartain\u2019s speedy trial right. The District Court then identified available dates in September 2008, but defense counsel was not available from September 2 through September 25. The court was not available in October. After counsel engaged in further discussion, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, after discussing it with [defense counsel] it appears that it might benefit the Defendant to have an additional time to call witnesses and to have the full three days to try the case. If that is the case, then the State does not have any objection of it being set in March....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">[Defense counsel]: ... So the State\u2019s representing to the Court that they think they can make their case with one or two witnesses and I\u2019m saying that I would subpoena all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>involved, but that would take longer than a day. And so that being the case, I would request the three-day setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The District Court then set the trial for March 17,2009,357 days after the date of Sartain\u2019s arrest. Sartain was not present at the omnibus hearing and learned about the trial date in September 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b68 On January 8,2009, approximately four months after learning of the trial date setting, Sartain filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. At the hearing on the motion, the District Court reminded defense counsel about his request during the omnibus hearing for the March trial date, despite concern for Sartain\u2019s speedy trial right. Defense counsel answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">[T]he best answer I have for you, Your Honor, is that while I was in Court having a discussion with you and agreeing, my client apparently didn\u2019t agree. And so ... he wasn\u2019t happy with the outcome and so at his behest the Court has a speedy trial motion before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Sartain testified at the speedy trial hearing about detrimental health and safety conditions at MSP, that he had medical conditions which had intensified after incarceration on this charge, that he had spent approximately seven or eight years of his life in prison, that he lost a job after being arrested on this charge, and that he had to be strip searched prior to meeting with his attorney. During cross-examination, Sartain testified about the relationship between his previous conviction of burglary and his incarceration at MSP during the pendency of this charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">[Prosecutor]: [Y]ou were on parole for the burglary conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">[Sartain]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">[Prosecutor]: And the reason that you are at the Montana State Prison is because of that conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">[Sartain]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">[Prosecutor]: Your parole is on that conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">[Sartain]: My parole is on that conviction. [The parole proceeding] is pending an adjudication of this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-14\">[Prosecutor]: <em>But if you had not been on parole for burglary out </em>of. . . <em>Flathead County you would not be at the Montana State Prison right </em>now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-15\">[Sartain]: <em>That\u2019s true. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">The District Court issued an order denying the motion to dismiss on March 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">\u00b69 Prior to trial, defense counsel did not challenge the \u201cshow-up\u201d identification or Sartain\u2019s arrest, or move to suppress statements made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>by Sartain. During trial, defense counsel did not object to the in-court identification of Sartain, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to an officer\u2019s testimony as \u201cthe truth,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s reference to witnesses such as Sch\u00fctz and Helsper as eyewitnesses even though they did not see the burglary occur, and the prosecutor\u2019s comment in closing argument that defense counsel had done its job \u201cto muddy the waters.\u201d After a two-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Sartain was sentenced as a persistent felony offender to a forty year sentence, to run concurrently with his previous burglary sentence. Sartain appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b610 We review the disposition of a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds by reviewing the factual findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Houghton, </em>2010 MT 145, \u00b6 13, 357 Mont. 9, 234 P.3d 904 (citing <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815). Factual findings are clearly erroneous \u201cif they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119 (citing Ray <em>v. Nansel, </em>2002 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 135, 53 P.3d 870). Whether factual circumstances constitute a violation of the right to a speedy trial is a question of constitutional law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. Thus, we review de novo the court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b611 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed issues of fact and law, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978 (citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Sartain\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b613 The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution grant to criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 20 <em>(citing Klopfer v. North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 222-26, 87 S. Ct. 988, 993-95 (1967)). Drawing from the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the federal right in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192 (1972), we balance four factors to determine if a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated under the Montana Constitution: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the accused\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>responses to the delay, and (4) prejudice to the accused caused by the delay. <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2010 MT 6, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 31, 224 P.3d 1247 (citing <em>State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, \u00b6 11, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58); <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 35. Given the \u201cinherently case-specific nature of speedy trial claims,\u201d we weigh the four factors based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b614 Sartain does not contest the District Court\u2019s analysis of factors one and two, which the District Court weighed in his favor, but challenges the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions under factors three and four, which led the court to conclude that Sartain\u2019s speedy trial right had not been violated. Before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments under factors three and four, we briefly summarize the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding factors one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b615 Under factor one, the District Court found the length of the delay from the date of Sartain\u2019s arrest for burglary on March 25,2008, to the scheduled trial on March 17, 2009, was 357 days. The parties do not contest the court\u2019s findings and conclusions under this factor. We observe, as did the District Court, that the length of delay meets the required 200 day trigger for speedy trial analysis. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b616 Under factor two, reasons for the delay, the District Court attributed 332 days of delay to the State and 25 days to Sartain. Specifically, the District Court charged the State with 103 days of delay due to lack of diligence and 229 days due to inherent institutional delay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of the 25 days charged to Sartain, one was for the day Sartain was released on bail prior to being taken into custody by his parole officer. The remaining 24 days were charged to Sartain for the period that his defense counsel was unavailable for an earlier trial date between September 2 and September 25,2008. The parties do not raise other contentions with the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions under factor two, and thus we accept them for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b617 Turning to factor three, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, Sartain argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that he acquiesced to the March 17, 2009 trial setting was clearly erroneous in the absence of a written waiver of his speedy trial right or other evidence of his consent to the delay. The State counters that the court correctly found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that Sartain acquiesced in the delay and weighed this factor against Sartain.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b618 While an accused has \u201c \u2018no duty to bring himself to trial,\u2019 \u201d the accused\u2019s responses to the delay are \u201can \u2018important\u2019 consideration\u201d in determining if a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 76, 82 (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 534, 92 S. Ct. at 2190, 2194). We consider the totality of an accused\u2019s responses to the delay to ascertain if the defendant \u201cactually wanted a speedy trial\u201d and what weight to be given to the other three factors in our analysis. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 79. Such circumstances as the \u201ctimeliness, persistence, and sincerity of the objections, the reasons for the acquiescence, whether the accused was represented by counsel, [and] the accused\u2019s pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right)\u201d are considered. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 80 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b619 The District Court reviewed the discussions leading to the setting of the trial in March 2009, noting it had raised a concern about the Defendant\u2019s speedy trial right and had proposed earlier trial dates in September and November 2008. The court recalled that the March date was chosen \u201cin accordance with Defendant\u2019s need for more trial days\u201d and reiterated defense counsel\u2019s representations at the omnibus hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[Defense counsel]: [T]he State\u2019s representing to the Court that they think they can make their case with one or two witnesses and I\u2019m saying that I would subpoena all parties involved, but that would take longer than a day. And so that being the case, <em>I would request the three-day setting. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The District Court observed that when Defendant \u201cpersonally became aware of the trial date in September, 2008, [he] made no objection until he filed his Motion to Dismiss on January 8,2009, which was four months after the Court set the trial date.\u201d The court reasoned that this illustrated \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s lack of persistence and sincerity in objecting to the trial date.\u201d The court also observed the State\u2019s diligence in bringing the matter, noting \u201c[t]he State expressed its concerns about the speedy trial issue,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was only after Defendant\u2019s counsel desired additional time that the prosecutor did not object to the March trial date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u00b620 We conclude the District Court\u2019s findings under factor three were not clearly erroneous, and its conclusions were correct. At the August 11, 2008 omnibus hearing, the trial was scheduled in March 2009 at the request of Sartain\u2019s counsel, who rejected earlier trial dates proposed by the court. The prosecutor consented to the later setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>only after defense counsel stated a three-day setting was required. The delayed setting was thus a result of the defense\u2019s request. Then, when Sartain became aware of the scheduled trial date in September, he delayed in raising an objection until January 9, 2009, about four months later. By then, the delay had reached 289 days. While there was evidence in the record from Sartain\u2019s attorney that he and Sartain \u201capparently didn\u2019t agree\u201d on the delay, there was also substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings, and its conclusion about Sartain\u2019s lack of persistence in demanding a speedy trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b621 Under factor four, prejudice to the accused caused by the delay, we consider prejudice in the light of three interests of a defendant: (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) minimizing anxiety and concern of the accused, and (iii) limiting possibilities of the defense being impaired by the delay. Ariegwe, \u00b6 88 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193; <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 654, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2692 (1992)). An \u201cintensifying presumption of prejudice\u201d against the accused arises after the delay reaches 200 days and requires, as the delay lengthens, less proof from the defendant showing prejudice and more proof from the state showing a lack thereof. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b622 When considering whether incarceration was oppressive, \u201call of the circumstances of the incarceration\u201d are considered, including the duration of incarceration, complexity of the offense, misconduct of the accused, and the conditions of incarceration. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 90-93. The District Court considered Sartain\u2019s length of pretrial incarceration and his testimony regarding the conditions of the prison and the detrimental effects his incarceration had upon his job, relationships, and health. The court observed that Sartain had suffered from some of his ailments prior to his incarceration. It reasoned that Sartain\u2019s incarceration at MSP prior to trial \u201cstem[med]\u201d from the pending charge of burglary, but was not unrelated to Sartain\u2019s earlier conviction for which he was on parole, and noted Sartain\u2019s criminal history and the time periods he had previously spent in jail. The court concluded that Sartain\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not unduly oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b623 We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion. As the court observed, some of Sartain\u2019s ailments about which he testified existed prior to his incarceration. Importantly, Sartain\u2019s incarceration at MSP was due, in primary part, to his status as a parolee on his previous sentence at the time of his arrest in this case. While Sartain testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that his incarceration occurred only because of the charge in this case, and notes that his parole proceeding remained pending throughout this matter and largely dependent upon the outcome here, nonetheless his incarceration occurred because of his parole status. Sartain was released on bail in this proceeding, ending his incarceration. He was then taken back into custody by his parole officer and detained thereafter upon the alleged parole violation. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 92 (\u201cthe fact that the accused was incarcerated on a separate charge while awaiting trial on the instant charge informs the issue of oppressiveness\u201d); <em>State v. Bowsher, </em>2005 MT 279, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 218, 123 P.3d 230 (\u201cIncarceration on different charges negates any prejudice from incarceration while awaiting trial.\u201d). Considering \u201call of the circumstances of the incarceration,\u201d the court did not err in its finding that Sartain\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not unduly oppressive. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b624 Under the second interest, evidence of the accused\u2019s anxiety and concern beyond that \u201cinherent in being accused of a crime\u201d suggests prejudice against the defendant. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97. We consider whether \u201cthe delay in bringing the accused to trial has unduly prolonged the disruption of his or her life or aggravated the anxiety and concern\u201d of the accused. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97. The District Court considered Sartain\u2019s testimony about his anxiety, concern, and economic difficulties he suffered, and then evaluated this testimony in light of Sartain\u2019s actions in response to the delay to reject his claims. We conclude the District Court\u2019s findings that Sartain\u2019s anxiety and concern were not aggravated by the delay are not clearly erroneous. Sartain\u2019s actions in not promptly raising concerns about the trial delay and the lack of an evidentiary connection between Sartain\u2019s anxiety and the delay supports the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b625 Impairment of the defense is potentially the most serious interest protected by the speedy trial right. <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98). In the absence of affirmative proof of impairment, we also assess impairment by looking to the other speedy trial factors in the speedy trial analysis. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100. Sartain\u2019s evidence of impairment was that prison procedures complicated communication between Sartain and his attorney, and that Hop\u2019s memory had seemed to improve over time. The District Court observed that the delay in setting trial was intended to give Sartain a greater opportunity to call his witnesses, thus <em>benefiting </em>the defense, and found that his defense was not impaired. <em>See e.g. State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 71, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708 (\u201cthe record suggests that Morrisey\u2019s ability to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>his defense was benefited, not prejudiced, by the continuances in his trial\u201d). Considering the other speedy trial factors, factor three supports the court\u2019s conclusion. Sartain\u2019s lack of complaint to the delay for four months is consistent with the finding that Sartain\u2019s defense was not impaired. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100 (\u201cthe more imperiled the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense becomes, the more likely he or she is to complain about the delay\u201d). We conclude the court\u2019s findings on impairment of defense were not clearly erroneous given the scant evidence provided to the court and considering Sartain\u2019s own actions, and that the court correctly concluded that Sartain was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b626  Finally, a court weighs and balances the speedy trial factors \u201cbased on the facts and circumstances of the particular cas <em>e.\u201d Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105. The District Court concluded that the first and second factors weighed in Sartain\u2019s favor, while the third factor, given heavy weight by the court, and fourth factor weighed in favor of the State. The court concluded that Sartain\u2019s speedy trial right was not violated. We agree. Despite the length of delay and the attribution of delay to the State, largely as institutional delay, the weighing and balancing of the factors led the court to the proper conclusion that Sartain\u2019s speedy trial right was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge a show-up identification, challenge a warrantless arrest, move to suppress defendant\u2019s statements following arrest, and object to certain remarks of the prosecutor made during trial and in closing argument constitute ineffective assistance of counsel reviewable on direct appeal?</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b628 Sartain argues that four omissions of his counsel at trial are record-based, or in the alternative, have no plausible justification, and upon review justify a conclusion that Sartain received prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel, entitling him to a new trial. These omissions of counsel include: failure to challenge Hop and Helsper\u2019s show-up identification, to challenge Sartain\u2019s warrantless arrest, to move to suppress Sartain\u2019s statements following arrest, and to object to improper references and remarks made by the prosecutor during trial and in closing argument. The State responds that the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>silent as to the reasons for the attorney\u2019s omissions, and thus the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be addressed in a post-conviction proceeding rather than on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b629 Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee a defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), and ask if the defendant has shown that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and prejudiced his case. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340 <em>(citing Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, 973 P.2d 233).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b630  However, when ineffective assistance of counsel claims are raised on direct appeal, we first consider whether the claims are more appropriately addressed in a post-conviction relief proceeding. <em>See e.g. State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. Because our review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims is subject to the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s actions are \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d a record which is silent about the reasons for the attorney\u2019s actions or omissions seldom provides sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Langford, </em>248 Mont. 420, 432-33, 813 P.2d 936, 946 (1991)). Thus, if the record fails to answer the question \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not take the actions constituting the alleged ineffective assistance, <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20, the claims are better raised by a petition for post-conviction relief where the record can be more fully developed, unless \u201c \u2018no plausible justification\u2019 \u201d exists for defense counsel\u2019s actions or omissions, <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (quoting <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 50, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b631  Here, the record is silent about why defense counsel failed to challenge the show-up identification, warrantless arrest of Sartain, admission of Sartain\u2019s statements following his arrest, or the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper remarks during trial and in closing argument. We have noted that \u201comissions of trial counsel frequently are ill-suited for direct appeal\u201d because often \u201c \u2018the record does not reflect counsel\u2019s reasons for failing to object.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 230, \u00b6 10, 339 Mont. 160, 168 P.3d 645 (quoting <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 35). Further, there exists at least a plausible justification for the attorney\u2019s omissions, as a \u201cmultitude of outside factors\u201d may have led defense counsel to allow the admission and use of this evidence without objection, including believing the grounds for the objection were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>meritless or were capable of being effectively discredited on cross-examination. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 19. Unlike the situation <em>in Kougl, </em>where defense counsel failed to ask for a statutorily provided and favorable jury instruction, counsel\u2019s failures here have at least a plausible, though \u201cnot necessarily \u2018actual,\u2019 \u201d justification. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. We conclude that Sartain\u2019s ineffectiveness claims cannot be reviewed on direct appeal and dismiss them without prejudice to raising them in a post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WHEAT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> The State explains that the District Court slightly miscalculated the amount of institutional delay in its favor. Sartain does not contest the State\u2019s concession, and thus we use 229 days for the amount of institutional delay, rather than the 218 days used by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> Sartain raises two additional ineffective assistance of counsel claims in his statement of issues, but does not develop further argument on those issues, and therefore we do not address them.
