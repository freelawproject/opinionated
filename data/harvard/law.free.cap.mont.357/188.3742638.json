Seiffert (Seiffert) appeals from the sentence imposed by the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Carbon County, for his conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-22\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-23\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court erred by denying Seiffert\u2019s motion to dismiss for negligent or deliberate suppression of evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b64 This case arises out of Seiffert\u2019s arrest and conviction for DUI in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. On the evening of April 12,2008, Seiffert was involved in a one-vehicle accident on Highway 78 near Red Lodge, Montana. Highway Patrolman Eric Gilbert (Gilbert) responded to the crash and reported that during his investigation, he detected a strong odor of intoxicating substance on Seiffert\u2019s breath, Seiffert\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that his speech was slurred. Gilbert also reported that Seiffert had poor balance and was unsteady on his feet. After his arrest, Seiffert refused to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b65 Subsequently, on April 24, 2008, at the prosecutor\u2019s request, the investigating officer conducted a follow up investigation and located a closed circuit television (CCTV) recording at the Silver Strike Casino in Red Lodge, Montana. During the officer\u2019s investigation, the owner of the Silver Strike Casino informed him that the CCTV recordings are erased after four to six weeks. According to testimony in the record, the CCTV recording, which was actually a series of still photographs taken every several seconds, showed Seiffert at the Silver Strike Casino gambling and walking within the casino over the course of an hour immediately preceding the accident. Upon seeing the CCTV recording, the officer requested a \u201cstill\u201d image of Seiffert at the casino. Ultimately, the CCTV recording was erased. Testimony by the investigating officer and the Silver Strike Casino owner, however, indicates that there was no evidence on the CCTV recording that Seiffert was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b66 A week later, on May 2,2008, prior to his arraignment in Carbon County Justice Court, Seiffert\u2019s attorney filed a motion and demand for discovery which included a request for any audio or video recording within the \u201ccontrol\u201d of the State. On May 30, 2008, the prosecution responded that the State had \u201cproduced all of the information in its possession that relates to this case, and... will immediately provide the defendant with copies of whatever investigative information may be subsequently generated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b67 Over three months later, on July 27, 2008, the investigating officer filed a supplemental narrative report which disclosed the existence of the CCTV recording. This report was forwarded to Seiffert\u2019s defense counsel on August 1, 2008. Days later, Seiffert contacted the Silver Strike Casino owner himself and requested a copy of the CCTV recording. Seiffert was informed, however, that the CCTV recording had been erased and that it was no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b68 On September 4, 2008, in response to the investigating officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>supplemental narrative and the fact that the Silver Strike Casino had erased the CCTV recording, Seiffert filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the loss of the CCTV recording was a <em>Brady </em>violation because the CCTV recording was exculpatory evidence material to the issue of his guilt or innocence. After an evidentiary hearing, the Justice Court denied Seiffert\u2019s motion to dismiss. Seiffert then entered a nolo plea reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss for a <em>Brady </em>violation. On January 16, 2009, the Justice Court entered its judgment and order. Seiffert immediately filed his notice of appeal to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b69 On May 29, 2009, Seiffert filed his motion to dismiss in the District Court detailing the <em>Brady </em>violation and the asserted negligent or deliberate suppression of exculpatory evidence. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Seiffert\u2019s motion to dismiss reasoning that \u201c[e]ven if the disputed evidence was exculpatory, and even if the disputed evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial, the Defendant has failed to show that the State suppressed evidence or that the evidence was material for the purposes of suppression analysis.\u201d Seiffert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b610 This Court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss in criminal cases de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, \u00b6 13, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred by denying Seiffert\u2019s motion to dismiss for negligent or deliberate suppression of evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b612 On appeal, Seiffert argues that since the State knew the CCTV recording would be erased, the State\u2019s failure to timely inform him of its existence was a <em>Brady </em>violation. Without specifically going through each prong of the <em>Brady </em>test, Seiffert lays out what he terms \u201cfundamental principles\u201d of a <em>Brady </em>violation and asserts that in light of the ubiquitous use of CCTV surveillance today, an extension of these principles is warranted in order to protect the due process rights of criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\u00b613 The State counters that the District Court properly denied Seiffert\u2019s motion to dismiss because, pursuant to our <em>Brady </em>jurisprudence, the State did not possess or suppress the CCTV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>recording, Seiffert could have obtained the recording with reasonable diligence, and disclosure of the CCTV recording would not have changed the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b614 It is well established that the State\u2019s suppression of material evidence favorable to a defendant violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 318, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 497, 125 P.3d 1096 (citing Brady <em>v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)). In order to demonstrate a <em>Brady </em>violation the criminal defendant bears the burden of establishing that (1) the State possessed evidence favorable to the defense; (2) the defendant did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it with reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 12. Here, even assuming that the CCTV recording was favorable to Seiffert and that the State\u2019s knowledge that it would be destroyed amounts to \u201cconstructive possession\u201d as Seiffert asserts, under the second, third, and fourth prong of the <em>Brady </em>test Seiffert cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b615 First, if CCTV surveillance is as ubiquitous as Seiffert asserts, there is no reason why he could not have, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, gone to the Silver Strike Casino and requested to view the CCTV recording himself. Indeed, the owner of the Silver Strike Casino testified that had Seiffert timely requested to view the CCTV recording he would have been allowed to do so. As we have long held, the State is not required to take the initiative or even assist the defendant in obtaining evidence on his behalf. <em>State v. Belgarde, </em>1998 MT 152, \u00b6 16, 289 Mont. 287, 962 P.2d 571. While Seiffert maintains he was unaware that the CCTV recording existed, such an argument is not persuasive in light of his simultaneous assertion that CCTV surveillance is \u201cubiquitous\u201d and \u201cwell documented.\u201d In short, Seiffert could have \u201cobtained [the CCTV recording] with reasonable diligence.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b616  Second, Seiffert has failed to establish that the State suppressed the CCTV recording or that had it been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. We have explained that if the State deliberately or intentionally suppresses exculpatory evidence, a per se violation of due process occurs. <em>Belgarde, </em>\u00b6 16. Here, there is no evidence in the record that indicates the State deliberately suppressed the CCTV recording. Rather, the record indicates that at most, any alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>suppression of the recording was due to negligence on the part of the State. If the State\u2019s loss of exculpatory evidence is due to negligence, a criminal defendant must show that the evidence was material, of substantial use, and exculpatory in order to have the case dismissed. <em>State v. Herman, </em>2009 MT 101, \u00b6 31, 350 Mont. 109, 204 P.3d 1254. The criminal defendant must also show that comparable evidence could not be obtained by other reasonable means and that the exculpatory value was apparent before the evidence was lost. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 31. Seiffert has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b617 Here, comparable evidence was obtained and in fact presented to the District Court. The investigating officer who viewed the tape and the owner of the Silver Strike Casino both testified that Seiffert did not appear intoxicated on the CCTV recording. Unlike a situation where comparable testimonial evidence contradicts what a CCTV recording shows, the comparable evidence here supports Seiffert\u2019s position that he did not appear intoxicated. As we explained in both <em>Herman </em>and <em>Belgarde, </em>in the context of <em>a Brady </em>violation, testimony as to what was on a video recording is evidence that is \u201ccomparable\u201d to the actual video recording itself. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Belgarde, </em>\u00b6 23. Thus, not only was comparable evidence obtained but there is no indication that disclosure of the CCTV recording would have changed the outcome of the case because the District Court knew that the CCTV recording did not show an obviously intoxicated Seiffert. We conclude that Seiffert has failed to demonstrate a <em>Brady </em>violation and the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
