Therefore, the only issues currently before us are those brought on cross-appeal by Carol Bast\u00f3n (Bast\u00f3n). Bast\u00f3n appeals the monetary judgment entered against her by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. We reverse the portion of the District Court\u2019s order directing a lien be placed on Baston\u2019s property, vacate the monetary judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of Baston\u2019s issues on cross-appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it went beyond the pleadings and pretrial order in awarding, sua sponte, monetary damages that were neither requested nor at issue during trial; and</p>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">\u00b64 2. If the District Court did not err in awarding monetary damages, did the court err in awarding damages beyond the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b65 Because resolution of the first issue is dispositive, we decline to address the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">\u00b66 In July 1949, Bast\u00f3n and her husband Vernon acquired title to the following real property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">Lots 12 and 13, Block 21, Yellowstone Addition to the City of Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana, according to the official plat thereof on file and of record in the Office of the Clerk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Recorder of Yellowstone County, Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">They held title to this property located on St. John\u2019s Avenue (hereinafter referred to as the St. John\u2019s home) as joint owners with rights of survivorship. Vernon died in 1998 and title of the property passed to Bast\u00f3n. While Bast\u00f3n has resided in Wyoming since 1987, she has also retained title to the St. John\u2019s home since 1949. This home is the subject of the current controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b67 In June 1987, Bast\u00f3n permitted Jeffrey and Sharon-her son and daughter-in-law \u2014 to move into the St. John\u2019s home. Jeffrey and Sharon resided in the home from 1987 until 2006, during which time they made various alterations and repairs to the home. However, they paid Bast\u00f3n no rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b68 In 2006, after living in the home rent-free for twenty years, Jeffrey and Sharon filed suit against Bast\u00f3n in the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, to acquire title to the St. John\u2019s home under the alternative theories of adverse possession, gift, and estoppel. Neither the amended complaint nor the final pretrial order alleged that Bast\u00f3n owed Jeffrey and Sharon monetary damages for the alterations and repairs they made on the home during their tenure. During the trial, as evidence of their claim of adverse possession, Jeffrey and Sharon presented over 500 receipts for various alterations and repairs they claimed were made on the home during their twenty-year tenure. Bast\u00f3n countered at trial that some of the expenses were for work done on her Wyoming home. Nevertheless, at no point in the pleadings or during trial did Jeffrey and Sharon seek reimbursement from Bast\u00f3n for these expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b69 At the close of trial on August 24, 2007, the District Court concluded Jeffrey and Sharon had failed to demonstrate that they acquired any ownership interest in the home. Notwithstanding this finding, the District Court sua sponte awarded Jeffrey and Sharon $33,055.48 plus 10% interest per annum for the alterations and repairs made to the St. John\u2019s home. The District Court also issued an oral ruling that the judgment would be tied to the home and could not be executed upon until, and unless, the property was conveyed by Bast\u00f3n. This oral ruling was omitted from the court\u2019s subsequent September 4, 2007 written order. Neither Jeffrey and Sharon nor Bast\u00f3n filed a notice of entry of judgment, as required by M. R. Civ. P. 77(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b610 Two years later, despite the absence of notice of entry of judgment, the Clerk of District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County issued a writ of execution on the monetary judgment against Bast\u00f3n for $40,024.77, the sum of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>original judgment plus interest through October 8,2009. In November 2009, Haeker purportedly purchased Jeffrey and Sharon\u2019s monetary judgment in the St. John\u2019s home, although this acquisition is not formally reflected in the District Court record. In December 2009, Haeker tried to force a sheriffs sale of the St. John\u2019s home to take place on January 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b611 On December 28, 2009, Bast\u00f3n filed timely objections to the sheriffs sale, sought clarification of the District Court\u2019s September 4, 2007 order, and requested a hearing. The court held a hearing on January 5, 2010, and all parties were present. On January 11, 2010, the District Court entered an order vacating the sheriffs sale and amending its 2007 written order to clarify that the $33,055.88 plus 10% interest per annum monetary judgment on the St. John\u2019s home could not be executed upon unless, and until, Bast\u00f3n conveyed the property. On January 28, 2010, Bast\u00f3n filed and served a Notice of Entry of Final Order on all appearing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b612 On February 1,2010, Haeker appealed the District Court\u2019s order. Bast\u00f3n cross-appealed. On cross-appeal Bast\u00f3n argued the District Court erred by awarding monetary damages that were neither requested in the pleadings nor during trial. For his part, Haeker argued he should be able to execute upon the lien on the St. John\u2019s home without waiting for Bast\u00f3n to convey the property. Haeker later voluntarily withdrew his appeal; therefore, the only issue still before us is that raised by Baston\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b613 In reviewing a district court\u2019s equitable decision we \u201cshall review all questions of fact arising upon the evidence presented in the record ... as well as questions of law.\u201d Section 3-2-204(5), MCA. The standard we employ under this statute is to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law were correct. <em>Deschamps v. Treasure State Trailer Court, Ltd., </em>2010 MT 74, \u00b6 43, 356 Mont. 1, 230 P.3d 800. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>LeFeber v. Johnson, </em>2009 MT 188, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 75, 209 P.3d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b614 Although not raised as a discrete issue on appeal, Bast\u00f3n argues her cross-appeal is timely because notice of entry of judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>never filed in 2007. She argues the time for appeal did not begin to run until January 28, 2010, when she filed the Notice of Entry of Order of the January 11, 2010 order that incorporated the September 4, 2007 order. Given the anomalous procedural background of this case, we conclude that Baston\u2019s cross-appeal was timely under M. R. Civ. P. 77(d). <em>See In re Marriage of Bell, </em>2000 MT 88, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 219, 998 P.2d 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b615 For future reference, we note the District Court applied the incorrect standard of proof at trial by requiring Jeffrey and Sharon to establish their claims by a preponderance of the evidence. At trial, a party must prove each element of adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Meadow Lake Estates Homeowners Assn. v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 37, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81 (citing <em>Wareing v. Schreckendgust, </em>280 Mont. 196, 206, 930 P.2d 37, 43 (1996)). A party asserting an undivided interest in property by gift must establish that right by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Hillard v. Hillard, </em>255 Mont. 487, 492, 844 P.2d 54, 57 (1992). Lastly, a party asserting an estoppel claim must also prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6 42, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863. For proof to be clear and convincing, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Wareing, </em>280 Mont. at 206, 930 P.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b616 The District Court found Jeffrey and Sharon did not meet their burden by the lower standard of a preponderance of evidence under any of their alternative theories of adverse possession, gift, or estoppel. Therefore, the outcome would have been no different had the District Court applied the correct, higher standard of clear and convincing proof. Because the District Court\u2019s application of the incorrect standard of proof does not change the outcome and Baston\u2019s cross-appeal was timely, we proceed to address the merits of the dispositive issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err when it went beyond the pleadings and pretrial order in awarding, sua sponte, monetary damages that were neither requested nor at issue during trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b618 We have consistently held that \u201cdue process requires a reasonable notice as to give everyone interested their opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Country Estates Homeowners Assn. v. McMillian, </em>269 Mont. 131, 133, 887 P.2d 249, 251 (1994) (quoting <em>Shaw v. City of Kalispell, </em>135 Mont. 284, 293, 340 P.2d 523, 528 (1959)). Further, it is well-settled that an appellant generally \u201ccannot recover beyond the case stated by him in his complaint\u201d because \u201cfair notice to the other party remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>essential.\u201d <em>McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Systems, Inc., </em>229 Mont. 432, 437, 748 P.2d 910, 913 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b619 A final pretrial order \u201cshall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order. The order following a final pretrial conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 16(e). We have repeatedly held that contentions not addressed in the pretrial order will not be presented at trial because pretrial orders are meant to \u201cprevent surprise, simplify i the issues and permit counsel to prepare their case for trial on the basis of the pretrial order.\u201d <em>Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, </em>2007 MT 140, \u00b6 44, 337 Mont. 411, 162 P.3d 106 (citing <em>Zimmerman v. Robertson, </em>259 Mont. 105, 111, 854 P.2d, 338, 342 (1993)). Here, the pretrial order listed as the sole issue the ownership of the St. John\u2019s home; no prayer for damages was referenced by the parties or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b620 To Baston\u2019s surprise, the District Court awarded Jeffrey and Sharon a monetary judgment at the close of trial. Bast\u00f3n was never put on notice she would have to oppose a monetary judgment in the form of a lien against her home. Bast\u00f3n was given notice only that Jeffrey and Sharon claimed ownership of the St. John\u2019s home under the legal theories of adverse possession, gift, and estoppel. Moreover, the only evidence presented by both parties was to support their respective claims of ownership of the home. Jeffrey and Sharon never once pled for, demanded, or even implied that Bast\u00f3n should pay them for alterations done on the St. John\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b621  In sum, throughout the trial, neither party addressed the underlying theory of equity upon which the District Court ultimately rested its judgment. Thus, the District Court erred in sua sponte awarding monetary damages to Jeffrey and Sharon based on a new, un-litigated theory of equity. This award of damages cannot stand under our rules or our precedent. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b622  Finally, we note that when Haeker purchased the lien on the St. John\u2019s home, the lis pendens filed by Jeffrey and Sharon in 2007 put him on notice that the St. John\u2019s home was the subject matter of litigation. <em>Fox v. Clarys, </em>227 Mont. 194, 196-197, 738 P.2d 104, 105-106 (1987). He took the risk that this monetary judgment could be reversed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 738 P.2d at 105. We find his arguments in opposition to the cross-appeal irrelevant to the dispositive issue and unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons we reverse the District Court\u2019s order and vacate the $33,055.48 plus 10% interest per annum monetary judgment in favor of Jeffrey and Sharon. We remand to the District Court for an order awarding Bastpn her costs on appeal. We decline to award Bast\u00f3n her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
