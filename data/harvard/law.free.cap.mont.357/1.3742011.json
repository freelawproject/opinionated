We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b62 Chad raises the following four issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in determining Shannon\u2019s income?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court err by valuing the Tiptons\u2019 marital estate on March 31, 2008, instead of the date on which the dissolution became effective?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court err in determining the monthly amount and duration of the maintenance award to Chad?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by failing to enter a final child support order?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b67 Chad and Shannon married on July 2, 1994. Their marriage produced one child, born in 2003. In August of 2004, after living in various locations across the United States, Chad, Shannon, and their son moved to Butte. Chad had previously worked as a computer consultant, but he stayed at home with their son during the couple\u2019s residency in Butte. Shannon joined a Butte surgical practice and began work as a surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\u00b68 In October 2007, Chad filed for dissolution. The District Court conducted a bench trial on September 30 and October 1, 2009. Shannon testified that her annual income from her surgical practice, as reflected on her 2008 W-2, was $237,000, and the District Court adopted this number as Shannon\u2019s approximate annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">\u00b69 Shannon\u2019s 2008 federal income tax return indicated that her adjusted gross annual income was $343,471. The disparity between Shannon\u2019s W-2 statement and her adjusted gross income resulted from the inclusion of additional incomes of $50,241 and $55,264 on her tax return.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shannon explained at trial that she excluded the $50,241 from her income for purposes of the dissolution proceedings because it was not a distribution \u201cgiven to [her] in a check or as income,\u201d but instead was \u201cpass-through\u201d income from her medical business for which she paid the taxes. Shannon explained that attributing this income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>personally to her was more advantageous because \u201cit\u2019s better for [her] to pay taxes on it than for it to be a corporate tax.\u201d About the $55,264 income amount, Shannon explained it should not qualify as income for dissolution purposes because it appeared on her federal income tax return only because of a guaranteed salary and loan repayment program for which the tax consequences fell in 2008. According to Shannon, she received the salary and loan repayment benefits in 2004 and 2005 but is now paying the taxes owed on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b610 Further testimony was elicited that Shannon and her business partner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made a determination during 2008 to pay down business debt in the amount of $250,000 in order to secure a new line of credit for the purpose of recruiting a third partner for the business. Shannon acknowledged in her testimony that \u201cin theory\u201d she and her partner could have taken these funds as personal distributions from the business, in the amount of $125,000 each, but that this would have been detrimental to the \u201clong-term stability of [her] practice\u201d and would have precluded the recruitment of a new partner to improve the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b611 Based upon the work Chad began as a computer programmer and consultant for the Butte-Silver Bow local government after separating with Shannon, the District Court found his annual income was approximately $43,000. The court found the approximate value of the marital assets was $317,150. These assets included the financial interest in the medical practice and the building. The court valued the marital assets as of March 31, 2008, although the marriage itself was not dissolved until December 2, 2009. The District Court found the marital debts to be approximately $146,000. Chad appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b612 When reviewing a dissolution proceeding, we determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 479, 124 P.3d 1151. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 123, 107 P.3d 488). \u201cAbsent clearly erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>findings, we will affirm the district court unless we identify an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>2009 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 352 Mont. 198, 217 P.3d 67; <em>see also In re Marriage of Payer, </em>2005 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 459, 110 P.3d 460; <em>In re Marriage of Thorner, </em>2008 MT 270, \u00b6 21, 345 Mont. 194, 190 P.3d 1063. \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>\u00b6 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err in determining Shannon\u2019s income?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b614 The District Court found Shannon\u2019s income to be $237,000 as reported on her W-2 wage statement. Chad argues this finding was clearly erroneous because it excluded additional business profits and benefits, including the $50,241 and $55,264 amounts, as well as the $125,000 Shannon earned and was entitled to receive as a distribution, and that this error led to the District Court abusing its discretion in resolving the property, maintenance, and child support issues. Shannon responds that the District Court considered conflicting testimony and that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that her annual income was $237,000. In reply, Chad concedes that substantial evidence exists in the record to conclude that Shannon\u2019s annual income was $237,000, but argues that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, made a mistake, or caused a substantial injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b615 In a dissolution proceeding, a district court must determine the income of the parties for purposes of distributing property, awarding maintenance, and setting child support. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, provides that a district court must consider the \u201camount and sources of income\u201d in apportioning marital property. Any maintenance award must be based upon a consideration of the financial needs of the party requesting maintenance and \u201cthe ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought\u201d to provide maintenance. Section 40-4-203(2), MCA. Child support awards are based upon the Montana Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Support Guidelines, whose application is presumed to calculate an \u201cadequate and reasonable support award\u201d unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence. Section 40-4-204, MCA; <em>In re Marriage of Kotecki, </em>2000 MT 254, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 460, 10 P.3d 828. The Guidelines define income as \u201cactual income, imputed income, or any combination thereof which fairly reflects a parent\u2019s resources available for child support.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(1). The Guidelines further define \u201cactual income\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\">economic benefit from whatever source derived ... and includes but is not limited to income from salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, <em>earnings,profits, dividends, </em>severance pay, pensions, periodic distributions from retirement plans, draws or advances against earnings, interest, trust income, annuities, royalties, alimony or spousal maintenance, social security benefits, veteran\u2019s benefits, workers\u2019 compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, disability payments, earned income credit and all other government payments and benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(2)(a) (emphasis added). In determining a child support award \u201ca district court must be realistic and take the actual situation of the parties into account when calculating child support obligations.\u201d <em>Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>2002 MT 227, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 412, 56 P.3d 339 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Noel, </em>265 Mont. 249, 252, 875 P.2d 358, 359 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b616 Courts have shown particular concern about a party\u2019s ability to shelter his or her income within a business entity. <em>See e.g. In re Marriage of McDonald, </em>446 N.E.2d 559, 560-61 (Ill. App. 4th Dist. 1983) (requiring trial court to look beyond tax returns because \u201c[i]t is a matter of common knowledge that income may be sheltered from taxation\u201d); <em>Riepenhoff v. Riepenhoff, </em>580 N.E.2d 846, 848 (Ohio App. 4th Dist. 1990) (holding an individual may not \u201cuse a closely held corporation as a dodge to shelter his income to avoid paying a higher amount of support or alimony\u201d). We reached a similar conclusion on a child support issue in <em>In re Marriage of Gray, </em>explaining that \u201cit is disposable income of the parent, and not their income tax returns alone, which must be considered by the Court.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Gray, </em>242 Mont. 69, 73, 788 P.2d 909, 912 (1990); <em>see also Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 17. \u00b617 In our recent decision of <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 31, husband Bobby was a principal in a closely held family corporation, B&amp;J Properties, which used business income to pay down business debt instead of paying out income to Bobby and his father. The district court concluded that such debt payments did not constitute \u201cincome\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and did not count them for child support purposes, reasoning instead that any future decision by the corporation to pay out income could be addressed \u201cwith a corresponding increase in Bobby\u2019s child support obligation.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>\u00b6 33. However, this Court reversed, requiring the district court to consider the business income. <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>\u00b6 33. Otherwise, Bobby and his father would be provided \u201cwith substantial incentive to spend B&amp;J\u2019s income on anything other than dividends\u201d and presented \u201ca situation susceptible to substantial manipulation.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Williams, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>see also In re Marriage of Jacobson, 251 </em>Mont. 394, 398, 825 P.2d 561, 562 (1992) (recognizing that profits used to pay a partnership\u2019s debts still constitute an income producing asset).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b618 Here, the District Court found that Shannon\u2019s income did not include the $50,241 designated as \u201cpass-through\u201d income or the $55,264 from the loan forgiveness and salary guarantee program, amounts included on her 2008 income tax returns. Contrary to Chad\u2019s argument, the listing of this additional $105,505 on Shannon\u2019s income tax return does not itself require that it be deemed income by the District Court in a dissolution proceeding. <em>See e.g. In re Marriage of Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 75, 788 P.2d at 913 (tax returns useful but not dispositive). Shannon testified that she did not actually receive the $50,241 of \u201cpass-through\u201d income, but simply paid the taxes on it to gain a tax advantage. Similarly, Shannon received the benefit of the loan forgiveness and salary guarantee program during 2004 and 2005, and the $55,264 was the subsequent tax consequence which had to be recognized. Thus, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous regarding the exclusion of this $105,505 from Shannon\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b619  We reach a different result, however, regarding the business income which Shannon and her business partner used to pay down their business debt. Shannon acknowledged in her testimony that \u201cin theory\u201d the business could have distributed the $250,000 to the partners individually, providing her with an additional distribution of $125,000. However, they instead kept the income within the business and paid down debt in preparation for expanding the business by adding a new partner. Thus, income earned by Shannon was essentially sheltered within the business and not considered in determining the dissolution issues dependent upon an assessment of income. The District Court\u2019s finding which excluded the additional $125,000 of income at Shannon\u2019s disposal was clearly erroneous, which led to an abuse of discretion. <em>See e.g. In re Marriage of Lewis, </em>198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Mont. 51, 55, 643 P.2d 604, 606 (1982); <em>In re Marriage of Smith, </em>191 Mont. 200, 203, 622 P.2d 1022, 1024 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b620 We remand for a reconsideration of the dissolution issues in light of our determination regarding Shannon\u2019s income, including maintenance, child support, and the distribution of property. However, our determination does not mandate that Shannon\u2019s income be set at any specific figure on remand. The error in failing to consider the $125,000 income which was available to Shannon during one or more years does not necessarily require that her annual income be increased by that amount or require specific increases in maintenance or child support. We are likewise aware that our holding may not change the value of the marital estate if the District Court previously considered the reduction of business debt when valuing the medical practice. Our decision simply requires the District Court to reassess Shannon\u2019s income in light of this correction in her income availability and redetermine the dissolution issues based thereon. It may not be necessary for the District Court to conduct further factfinding or other hearings, and we leave that to the District Court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court err in valuing the Tiptons\u2019 marital estate on March 31, 2008, instead of the date on which the dissolution became effective?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b622 Chad argues that the District Court erred in valuing the marital estate on March 31, 2008, instead of December 2, 2009, the date of dissolution. Shannon responds that the District Court\u2019s variance is \u201cbased on the unique circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b623 Generally, the value of the marital estate is ascertained at the time of dissolution. <em>In re Marriage of Swanson, </em>220 Mont. 490, 495, 716 P.2d 219, 222 (1986) (citing <em>Vivian v. Vivian, </em>178 Mont. 341, 344, 583 P.2d 1072, 1074 (1978)). However, we have recognized that unique circumstances will permit deviation from the general rule. <em>In re Marriage of Hochhalter, </em>2001 MT 268, \u00b6 17, 307 Mont. 261, 37 P.3d 665 (citing cases). In <em>In re Marriage of Thorner, </em>\u00b6 37, the parties\u2019 relationship ended sometime between April and July 2004, \u201cwhen they began managing their finances separately and eventually lived separately.\u201d We approved of the district court\u2019s use of this time instead of the time of dissolution, concluding that the court had properly exercised its discretion in using the date of the parties\u2019 financial separation. <em>In re Marriage of Thorner, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b624  Here, the District Court found the date of March 31, 2008, significant because the parties were no longer living in the same household or commingling their assets by that time. We conclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining to value the estate as of March 31, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b625 Because we reverse and remand for the District Court to reconsider its distribution of property, maintenance, and child support, we need not address the remaining issues Chad raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b626 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-13\"> There is an additional $966 difference between Shannon\u2019s 2008 federal adjusted gross income and her 2008 W-2 wage statement which is not accounted for by the parties, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"> In their testimony and briefing, the parties refer to Shannon\u2019s medical business by various general terms, such as \u201ccorporation\u201d and \u201cpartnership.\u201d The particular nature of the business entity and its tax status are not issues resolved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Shannon filed a Motion to Strike Partial Transcript, arguing that Chad had only identified the transcript of the hearing conducted on September 30 and October 1,2009, as necessary to the appeal, and thus requesting this Court strike the transcript of the March 24, 2008 hearing which Chad has attached to his brief. Because the March 24, 2008 transcript is of no consequence to the disposition of this case, we deem Shannon\u2019s motion moot. <em>See e.g. State v.
