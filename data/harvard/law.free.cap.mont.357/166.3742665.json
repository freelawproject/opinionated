Tucker Johnson appeals from the order and judgment entered by the Sixth Judicial District Court, Sweet Grass County, concluding he tortiously interfered with a contract for the exchange of property between Valerie Emmerson and Wallace and Rana Rae Walker. Emmerson appeals from the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Walkers. Walkers cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of punitive damages they sought against Johnson. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b62 We state Johnson\u2019s and Emmerson\u2019s issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that Johnson\u2019s actions constituted tortious interference with a contract between Emmerson and Walkers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in determining Walkers\u2019 attorney fee award?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">\u00b65 Walkers raise the following issue on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00b66 <em>3. Did the District Court err by failing to award punitive damages to Walkers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b67 Wallace Walker is a physician who resides with his wife, Rana Rae, and children near Big Timber. The Walker family shares a passion for ranching and, in January of 2000, purchased a 739-acre property located roughly seventeen miles outside of Big Timber for $325,000. At the time, Wallace worked for the IHS Hospital serving Crow Agency and Havre.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b68 Wallace served in the military reserves and, in 2003, served a one-year deployment in Iraq. Upon his return, Wallace obtained employment with the Big Timber hospital, where he was required to be on call and to reach the hospital within fifteen minutes. Because Wallace was unable to do so from their ranch, Walkers listed the property for sale at $695,000 and began looking for another ranch property within a fifteen-minute drive to town.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b69 Emmerson was then attempting to sell her 480-acre ranch property, located within a fifteen-minute drive of Big Timber. Walkers inquired whether Emmerson was interested in a like-kind exchange of their respective properties, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031. Although not initially interested, Emmerson changed her mind after hearing from a friend about the attributes of Walkers\u2019 property, and the parties entered an exchange agreement on May 15, 2006, agreeing to convey their respective properties to each other. The agreement was made contingent upon Emmerson fencing her property and obtaining an access easement which would permit at least one homesite thereon, but Walkers could nevertheless, in their discretion, enforce the agreement should they \u201cdesire to proceed,\u201d even if Emmerson failed to satisfy the conditions. Walkers paid their realtor $10,000 and took their property off the market. Emmerson asked Walkers if she could begin using their property while they were waiting for the exchange to be completed, to which Walkers agreed. Emmerson began to do so, and she changed the utility service from Walkers\u2019 name to her own.</p>\n<p id=\"A3B\">\u00b610 In October of 2006, Johnson came to Montana to look for real estate to purchase. During a drive through the area, Johnson saw a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign on Susan Newhall\u2019s property, adjacent to Emmerson\u2019s property. Returning with a real estate agent to view Newhall\u2019s property, Johnson inquired about purchasing Emmerson\u2019s property. Johnson intended on buying numerous parcels, testifying at trial that he \u201ceven fantasized about making purchases that could lead all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>way up to the base of the Crazies.\u201d Johnson indicated to his real estate agent that he would make an offer both on Newhall\u2019s property and an offer of $800,000 on Emmerson\u2019s property, $105,000 more than the estimated value Emmerson would receive under the exchange agreement with Walkers. Johnson conditioned his purchase of Newhall\u2019s property upon his obtaining of Emmerson\u2019s property as well.</p>\n<p id=\"A6C\">\u00b611 On October 27,2006, Emmerson was informed of Johnson\u2019s offer. During her discussions with Newhall\u2019s realtor and Johnson, Emmerson disclosed her exchange agreement with Walkers. Emmerson called Walkers and advised them she had received a \u201cbetter offer\u201d and wanted out of their agreement. Walkers were upset and attempted to contact their attorney, Mark Josephson, who was out of town. Later, Newhall\u2019s realtor inquired of Josephson whether Walkers would be willing to forgo their exchange agreement with Emmerson. Emmerson\u2019s attorney, Jane Mersen, called Josephson indicating that Emmerson was interested in an \u201cefficiency breach\u201d of the exchange agreement and wanted to know how much in damages Walkers would take to terminate the agreement. In response to these inquiries, Josephson explained that Walkers were happy with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"A_A\">\u00b612 The District Court found that, on November 15, 2006, following multiple contacts between Josephson and Johnson\u2019s and Newhall\u2019s real estate agents, and noting Johnson had been kept fully informed, Johnson directly contacted Josephson and asked Josephson to represent him. Josephson declined and advised Johnson that the Emmerson-Walker agreement was binding and Walkers intended to close.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b613 Because of these contacts, Josephson sent a letter on November 27, 2006, to Mersen, Emmerson\u2019s attorney, conveying Walkers\u2019 intention to close on the agreement and seeking assurances the transaction would proceed as agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">If we do not hear from you by 5:00 p.m., Monday, December 4th, we will assume that Ms. Emmerson does indeed intend to continue pursuing the easement application and to honor her obligations under the exchange contract by completing the exchange with Walkers. If Ms. Emmerson\u2019s intentions are to not honor the exchange contract, then please notify us by 5:00 p.m., December 4th, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Neither Emmerson nor Emmerson\u2019s attorney offered any response by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the stated deadline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b614 In mid-December 2006, Johnson made a second round of offers on Newhall\u2019s and Emmerson\u2019s properties, again made contingent upon the closing of the other. In the new offer to Emmerson, Johnson increased the amount offered by $30,000, or $135,000 more than the anticipated value Emmerson would receive under the exchange agreement with Walkers. Johnson had his attorney, Karl Knuchel, write to Emmerson\u2019s attorney, Mersen, suggesting that the agreement between Emmerson and Walkers was voidable. When Mersen disagreed, Johnson suggested to Emmerson that she obtain opinions from other lawyers. Johnson provided Emmerson with a list of attorneys to consult, and after Emmerson spoke with a different attorney who opined that the exchange agreement with Walkers was valid, Johnson continued to encourage Emmerson to forgo closing on the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b615 On January 5, 2007, an offer to purchase Walkers\u2019 property for $695,000, their original, full asking price, was conveyed to Walkers through Sonny Todd Realty, which had received the offer from the same real estate agent representing Johnson. The offer was made by an entity named Open Range LLC and Johnson\u2019s involvement was not disclosed. This offer provided that Walkers\u2019 property was to be purchased with cash and that the buyer reserved the right to facilitate a 1031 exchange. Walkers responded by contacting Emmerson to inquire whether she would be willing to sell her property for cash. Emmerson seemed unsurprised by the inquiry and immediately rejected it. Walkers then refused the offer from Open Range LLC. It was not until this litigation commenced that Walkers learned Johnson was behind the offer and had created Open Range LLC to act as his buyer. On January 10,2007, Johnson entered an exchange agreement with Emmerson, promising that he \u201cwould acquire\u201d Walkers\u2019 property, exchange the property for Emmerson\u2019s property, and pay Emmerson $135,000 in boot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b616 After Johnson\u2019s attempt to secretly purchase Walkers\u2019 property failed, Emmerson signed a waiver of conflict of interest permitting Johnson\u2019s attorney, Knuchel, to represent her. On February 23, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Knuchel wrote to Josephson on Emmerson\u2019s behalf, advising that \u201cby this letter... Val Emmerson repudiates the \u2018Exchange Agreement\u2019 and considers it to be null and void.\u201d Johnson had Emmerson, represented now by Karl Knuchel, initiate a declaratory action against Walkers seeking to invalidate the Emmerson-Walker exchange agreement, which was filed on February 28, 2007. For her part, Emmerson testified that she did \u201cnot want the legal responsibility\u201d for the lawsuit and that she may not have filed the suit if she would have been obligated to pay her attorney fees. Johnson bore these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b617 Walkers, represented in the litigation by Leanne M. Schraudner, answered by asking that the court declare the exchange agreement valid and Emmerson be ordered to specifically perform. They also filed a third-party claim against Johnson, alleging tortious interference with a contract and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Johnson, represented in litigation by Mark J. Hartwig, counterclaimed against Walkers, alleging tortious interference with a contract and abuse of process, and sought sanctions under Rule 11 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. Johnson claimed $50,000 for emotional damages caused by this litigation delaying the building of his Montana vacation home and the travel costs for private jet transportation to Montana to respond to this suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">\u00b618 After a bench trial, the District Court entered an order in May 2009 holding the exchange agreement between Emmerson and Walkers was valid and enforceable, and commenting that Emmerson\u2019s case \u201cbarely survived [Walkers\u2019] motion for summary judgment.\u201d The District Court ordered Emmerson to specifically perform by closing on the agreement in no less than thirty days. The District Court concluded that Johnson had tortiously interfered with Walkers\u2019 contract and awarded them emotional distress damages against Johnson in the amount of $150,000. The District Court did not award punitive damages to Walkers. Subsequently, the District Court awarded attorney fees and costs to Walkers pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement with Emmerson. The District Court subtracted only $3,000 of the total fees as the portion solely associated with the Johnson litigation, and not subject to a fee award, noting that \u201cEmmerson\u2019s [own] expert, Kevin Brown, admitted that he could not segregate the Walkers\u2019 attorney fees between the Johnson and Emmerson claims.\u201d Walkers were therefore awarded attorney fees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>$35,505.95. Johnson\u2019s counterclaims were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b619 Johnson and Emmerson appeal, and Walkers cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2003 MT 357, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 23, 83 P.3d 256. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo for correctness. <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch v. Fields, </em>2004 MT 153, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 505, 92 P.3d 1185. We exercise plenary review over constitutional issues. <em>State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001. We generally review an award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Glaspey v. Workman, </em>234 Mont. 374, 377, 763 P.2d 666, 668 (1988); <em>Tacke v. Energy West, Inc., </em>2010 MT 39, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 243, 227 P.3d 601. However, when a contract \u201crequires an award of attorney\u2019s fees and the contract is conscionable, a district court lacks discretion to deny attorney\u2019s <em>fees.\u201d In re Szafryk, </em>2010 MT 90, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 141, 232 P.3d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b621 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that Johnson\u2019s actions constituted tortious interference with a contract between Emmerson and Walkers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b622 Johnson argues that his conduct does not amount to tortious interference with a contract because he, \u201cat most, simply induced Emmerson to seek a court remedy,\u201d and thus exercise her constitutional and statutory right to petition the court for a declaratory judgment. He explains he is raising \u201c[o]nly questions of law\u201d-that the District Court erred by failing to recognize the constitutional right to seek redress of grievances within its analysis concluding he committed tortious interference. Walkers respond that Johnson raises new issues on appeal and that Johnson has offered \u201ca whitewash of the facts\u201d because he \u201cdid much more than merely promote litigation.\u201d Therefore, Walkers contend Johnson\u2019s constitutional arguments are an improper misdirection of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\u00b623 Johnson\u2019s arguments do contain a challenge to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he committed tortious interference of contract, and we thus turn to an analysis of that tort. Strangers to a contract have a \u201cduty not to interfere\u201d with the performance of contracts between other parties. <em>Bolz v. Myers, </em>200 Mont. 286, 293, 651 P.2d 606, 609 (1982). In order to establish a claim of tortious interference with a contract, a claimant must prove the defendant\u2019s acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>1) were intentional and willful; 2) were calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff in his or her business; 3) were done with the unlawful purpose of causing damage or loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the actor; and 4) that actual damages and loss resulted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><em>Hardy v. Vision Serv. Plan, </em>2005 MT 232, \u00b6 18, 328 Mont. 385, 120 P.3d 402; <em>see also Bolz, </em>200 Mont. at 295, 651 P.2d at 611; <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 25, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913. We have explained that this test determines whether a party\u2019s actions were \u201cimproper,\u201d a term used by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 767 (1979), and that the following factors will be used to evaluate the propriety of the challenged actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(a) the nature of the actor\u2019s conduct,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(b) the actor\u2019s motive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(c) the interests of the other with which the actor\u2019s conduct interferes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">(f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor\u2019s conduct to the interference and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">(g) the relations between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 767.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Bolz, </em>200 Mont. at 294-95, 651 P.2d at 610-11; <em>Stokes v. State, </em>2007 MT 169, \u00b6 13, 338 Mont. 165, 162 P. 3d 865; <em>Farrington v. Buttrey Food and Drug Stores Co., </em>272 Mont. 140, 143, 900 P.2d 277, 279 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">\u00b624 After analyzing these standards and the evidence, the District Court concluded that Walkers had carried their burden of demonstrating that \u201cJohnson tortiously interfered with the Walker/Exchange agreement.\u201d We conclude that the District Court\u2019s conclusions were correctly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\u00b625  Prior to Johnson\u2019s arrival, Emmerson and Walkers had entered the exchange agreement and the process of closing that agreement was proceeding as planned. Emmerson was even using Walkers\u2019 property and had changed the utilities on that property into her owm name. No problems in the transaction were then apparent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Johnson then arrived and, when Walkers would not withdraw from the agreement voluntarily, he engaged in a calculated course to negate the agreement. He attempted to disrupt Walkers\u2019 relationship with their attorney, Josephson. He, in the words of the District Court\u2019s findings, \u201centiced\u201d Emmerson by making offers to her which exceeded the value she would receive from her agreement with Walkers by up to $ 135,000, encouraged Emmerson \u201cto forgo closing on the Walker Emmerson Exchange agreement,\u201d and promised Emmerson he \u201cwould acquire\u201d Walkers\u2019 property and exchange it for hers. He had his attorney send a letter to Emmerson\u2019s attorney that asserted the exchange agreement between Emmerson and Walkers was voidable. When Emmerson\u2019s attorney disagreed, Johnson directed Emmerson to other legal counsel, and when that advice was contrary, Johnson had his own attorney send a letter to Walkers on behalf of Emmerson repudiating their exchange agreement. Johnson attempted to \u201csecretly purchase\u201d Walkers\u2019 property in an effort to remove them from the exchange agreement by offering their full asking price under the veil of an LLC he had created. When these efforts failed, Johnson had his attorney seek a judgment on behalf of Emmerson declaring the exchange agreement void and underwrote the litigation costs and fees. As found by the District Court, Johnson \u201cdirected\u201d and \u201corchestrated\u201d the litigation between Emmerson and Walkers. Considered <em>in toto, </em>the factual findings of the District Court unmistakably demonstrate that Johnson\u2019s actions were improper and support the conclusion of law that the elements of tortious interference with a contract claim were established.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b626 Johnson\u2019s appellate posture focuses on Emmerson\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights to seek legal redress through the courts. He argues that the District Court\u2019s \u201cmechanical application\u201d of the tortious interference standards was insufficiently rigorous to protect his fundamental litigation rights. Johnson argues that, absent a conclusion that Johnson initiated the lawsuit against Walkers maliciously or as an abuse of process, his right to challenge the agreement was constitutionally protected and could not provide the foundation for an interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b627 However, Johnson\u2019s carefully crafted appellate arguments were not raised in the District Court. Johnson did not defend against Walkers\u2019 tortious interference claim by asserting that his actions were constitutionally or statutorily protected as legal redress rights. In his answer, he asserted a general denial and the affirmative defenses of \u201claches and collateral estoppel,\u201d \u201cunclean hands,\u201d and \u201cfailure to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>a claim for which relief can be granted.\u201d No reference is made to any constitutional or statutory redress issue in Johnson\u2019s pre-trial filings. In his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Johnson analyzes the elements of tortious interference and only generally states that \u201cJohnson had the right to undertake his actions and was justified in his actions.\u201d None of these \u201cgeneral assertions to the trial court without any argument,\u201d <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 5, 313 Mont. 218, 61 P.3d 749, were sufficient to bring these issues to the attention of the District Court or preserve them for appeal. <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, 78 P.3d 850 (\u201c[I]t is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d); <em>Thibodeau v. Bechtold, </em>2008 MT 412, \u00b6 29, 347 Mont. 277, 198 P.3d 785 (explaining that waiver promotes \u201cjudicial economy\u201d); <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463; <em>In re Estate of Kindsfather, </em>2005 MT 51, \u00b6 34, 326 Mont. 192, 108 P.3d 487; <em>Schaffer v. Champion Home Builders Co., </em>229 Mont. 533, 537, 747 P.2d 872, 874 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b628 Johnson requests, alternatively, that this Court address his issues by invoking the plain error doctrine. Invoking the plain error doctrine is discretionary and requires this Court be convinced that the failure to address the issue \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79; <em>see also State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. The doctrine is invoked \u201csparingly\u201d in criminal cases and \u201conly on rare occasion\u201d in civil cases. <em>State v. Price, </em>2007 MT 269, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 399, 171 P.3d 293; <em>Reno v. Erickstein, </em>209 Mont. 36, 42, 679 P.2d 1204, 1207-08 (1984); <em>see also In re K.J., </em>2010 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 15-20, 355 Mont. 257, 231 P.3d 75; <em>Paulson v. Flathead Conserv.

The parties tried Walkers\u2019 claim upon all the defenses which Johnson raised. He was represented by counsel during the entirety of the proceedings. He failed to raise legal redress issues at any time and waived them. Further, Johnson\u2019s actions in attempting to undermine the Emmerson-Walker agreement were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>much broader in scope than simply seeking to challenge the agreement in court. We thus decline to invoke the plain error doctrine and affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b630 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in determining Walkers\u2019 attorney fee award?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b631 In her appeal, Emmerson argues the District Court failed to sufficiently separate the fees incurred by Walkers in prosecuting their interference claim against Johnson from the fees they incurred in defending her declaratory challenge to their agreement. Although acknowledging that their agreement obligates her to pay Walkers\u2019 contract-related attorney fees, Emmerson argues that these fees were not sufficiently identified, and therefore the award of $35,505.95 is excessive. She requests a remand \u201cto conduct a more accurate, reasonable, and conscientious calculation of the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded.\u201d Walkers argue that most of the fees they incurred in the action were indivisible, and therefore the fee award is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b632 A court may award attorney fees only where a statute or a contract provides for their recovery. <em>Stavenjord v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2006 MT 257, \u00b6 21, 334 Mont. 117, 146 P.3d 724; <em>Northwestern Natl. Bank of Great Falls v. Weaver-Maxwell, Inc., </em>224 Mont. 33, 44, 729 P.2d 1258, 1264 (1986). \u201cIn a lawsuit involving multiple claims or multiple theories, an award of attorney fees must be based on the time spent by the prevailing party\u2019s attorney on the claim or theory under which attorney fees are allowable.\u201d <em>Northwestern Natl. Bank of Great Falls, </em>224 Mont. at 44, 729 P.2d at 1264-65 (citing <em>Kadillak v. Mont. Dept. of State Lands, </em>198 Mont. 70, 74, 643 P.2d 1178, 1181 (1982)). When calculating attorney fees in a case \u201cwhere it is impossible to segregate the attorney\u2019s time between claims entitling the party to attorney fees and other claims,\u201d an attorney may be entitled to the \u201centire fee.\u201d <em>Blue Ridge Homes, Inc. v. Thein, </em>2008 MT 264, \u00b6 79, 345 Mont. 125, 191 P.3d 374; <em>see also Donnes v. Orlando, </em>221 Mont. 356, 361-62, 720 P.2d 233, 237 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b633 The exchange agreement between Walkers and Emmerson provided: \u201cShould any party incur any costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in enforcing any of the provisions of this Agreement, then the other or unsuccessful party shall reimburse the prevailing party on demand.\u201d Thus, the agreement provided attorney fees for Walkers\u2019 defense of Emmerson\u2019s action but not for prosecution of the tort claim against Johnson. The District Court allocated $3,000 of Walkers\u2019 total fees as applying exclusively to the claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Johnson but concluded the remaining fees were inextricably intertwined with both the Emmerson and Johnson matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b634  At the attorney fee hearing, Leanne Schraudner testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">As attorney for this case, the issues were so intertwined. All of the witnesses were the same, all of it arose out of the same facts, and in essence Ms. Emmerson and Mr. Johnson worked in consort. So, the only costs that I could find that were ... solely attributable to Mr. Johnson [were] approximately 3,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Attorney Kevin Brown testified as an expert on behalf of Emmerson. Brown agreed that Walkers\u2019 claimed fees were reasonable and maintained that only a portion should be attributed to Emmerson, but, as found by the District Court, \u201cadmitted that he could not segregate the time between the Emmerson and Johnson claims.\u201d Emmerson cites <em>to Kadillak, </em>198 Mont. at 75-76, 643 P.2d at 1182, where an alternative fee calculation method was employed, but it does not follow that the District Court was required to utilize a different path here. Based upon Schraudner\u2019s testimony, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees totaling $35,505.95 against Emmerson pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b635 Walkers request that their appellate costs and attorney fees be awarded, which Emmerson does not dispute. Walkers are awarded appellate costs and fees based upon their contract with Emmerson. <em>See Boyne USA, Inc. v.

Did the District Court err by failing to award punitive damages to Walkers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u00b637 Walkers cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s failure to award them punitive damages against Johnson in addition to the compensatory damages awarded. Noting that the District Court ruled from the bench at the conclusion of the trial that \u201cmalice\u201d by Johnson had not been established, Walkers argue that the court \u201cappears to have misapprehended the law\u201d because several of the court\u2019s findings \u201cmirror\u201d the statutory definition of malice for purposes of punitive damages. Johnson responds that Walkers failed to prove malice by clear and convincing evidence because the court acknowledged that some of Johnson\u2019s actions were acceptable and that punitive damages rest within the trier of fact\u2019s discretion, which was appropriately exercised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u00b638 Section 27-1-220(1), MCA, provides that \u201ca judge or jury may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>award, in addition to compensatory damages, punitive damages for the sake of example and for the purpose of punishing a defendant.\u201d In turn, \u00a7 27-1-221(1), MCA, provides that punitive damages \u201cmay be awarded when the defendant has been found guilty of actual fraud or actual malice.\u201d Actual malice, upon which Walkers\u2019 claim was premised, requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">[T]he defendant has knowledge of facts or intentionally disregards facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff and: (a) deliberately proceeds to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff; or (b) deliberately proceeds to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Section 27-1-221(2), MCA. \u201cAll elements of the claim for punitive damages must be proved by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d meaning \u201cthere is no serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence.\u201d Section 27-1-221(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\u00b639 We have held that \u201c[a] district court judge, having heard the evidence and observed the witnesses, is in the best position to determine whether the requirements of proof of punitive damages have been met.\u201d <em>Dees v. Am. Natl. Fire Ins. Co., </em>260 Mont. 431, 446, 861 P.2d 141, 150 (1993). Here, the District Court determined that Walkers had \u201cobviously\u201d failed to prove \u201cactual malice\u201d by clear and convincing evidence. Walkers urge us to draw a different conclusion from several of the District Court\u2019s findings, but to do so would potentially conflict with other parts of the District Court\u2019s order. The District Court stated that determining whether Johnson was liable was \u201cmore difficult\u201d than it was for Emmerson. The court \u201crecognized Johnson\u2019s attempts to reach an accommodation by finding other suitable properties for Walkers and that fact reduced the Court\u2019s award of damages\u201d against Johnson. This conclusion would weigh against a finding necessary to establish \u201cactual malice\u201d-that Johnson had proceeded in disregard to facts creating a high probability of injury to Walkers. If Johnson was attempting to accommodate Walkers\u2019 desires by finding another suitable property for them, as the District Court concluded, then it is conceivable that Johnson did not intend to proceed in disregard to the probability of injury to Walkers. The District Court entered no findings regarding these elements of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\u00b640  Further, the statutes cited above make punitive damage awards discretionary, and it was within the purview of the District Court, as the trier of fact, to determine whether punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>were appropriate. <em>Dees, </em>260 Mont. at 446-47, 861 P.2d at 150 (denial of punitive damages will not be overturned \u201cabsent an abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>see also Beaver v. Mont. DNRC, </em>2003 MT 287, \u00b6 83, 318 Mont. 35, 78 P.3d 857.

I write separately on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b643 The trial court dismissed the Walkers\u2019 claim for punitive damages from the bench without briefing or argument on the ground that the Walkers failed to prove malice. Opinion, \u00b6 37. Walkers were, at the very minimum, entitled to brief and argue this contested issue. That aside, actual malice-for punitive damages purposes-is defined by \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA, and must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, \u00a7 27-1-221(5), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 38. Based on the facts of this case, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12-17, 25,1 conclude that the Walkers clearly and convincingly met their burden to prove malice under \u00a7 27-l-221(2)(a) and (b), MCA. Johnson engaged in tortious conduct which interfered with and attempted to cause Emmerson to breach her contract with the Walkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b644 We have affirmed the award of punitive damages (and damages for emotional distress) in a case involving the tortious interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 right to purchase a parcel of land. <em>Maloney v. Home and Investment Center, Inc., </em>2000 MT 34, \u00b6\u00b6 72, 77, 298 Mont. 213, 994 P.2d 1124. Accordingly, there is ample legal authority for the Walkers\u2019 claim for punitive damages here.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\u00b645 Factually, as set out in the Court\u2019s Opinion, Johnson, a wealthy, self-styled \u201cvery sophisticated investor,\u201d determined to purchase the property that Emmerson had lawfully contracted to exchange with the Walkers. Over a period of months, Johnson single-mindedly orchestrated a series of acts pointedly calculated to defeat the Emmerson/Walker contract-while keeping his nefarious activities from the Walkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u00b646 The District Court found that Johnson enticed Emmerson to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ignore her contract with the Walkers by making offers to Emmerson for more money than the Emmerson/Walker contract; by entering into an exchange agreement with Emmerson; by funding and directing Emmerson to file a complaint against the Walkers to invalidate the exchange agreement; by providing legal opinions to Emmerson\u2019s lawyer on how to invalidate the Emmerson/Walker agreement; by recommending lawyers to Emmerson so to pursue a complaint against the Walkers-after Emmerson\u2019s lawyer maintained that the agreement was valid; and, ultimately, by making his own lawyer available to Emmerson to file the instant suit and by paying the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of the litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson threatened the Walkers with meritless claims and counterclaims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> implied that the Walkers had violated his medical privacy, intimidated them, and deliberately used Montana\u2019s legal system to beat the Walkers down, to frustrate their contract with Emmerson, and to cause them expense and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b647 In all likelihood, Johnson and his trial counsel violated Montana\u2019s champerty statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 37-61-408 and -411, MCA, by encouraging, funding, and prosecuting this lawsuit in Emmerson\u2019s name against the Walkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b648 Accordingly, there is ample clear and convincing factual evidence in the record here that Johnson acted with malice as defined in \u00a7 27-1-221(2)(a) and (b), MCA. Indeed, Johnson and his counsel engaged in the same sort of \u201clegal thuggery\u201d that we condemned in <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 180, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. In that case, we affirmed awards of $100,000 in punitive damages against Morton and $9.9 million in punitive damages against Morton\u2019s counsel, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (GDC). <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 12. Like Morton and GDC in <em>Seltzer, </em>Johnson\u2019s impositions on the Walkers, both out of court and in, were little more than a rich-man\u2019s game to bully, brow-beat and buy what he wanted at any cost, and to misuse Montana\u2019s courts in doing so. For Johnson to now come before this Court and attempt to cloak his outrageous conduct in the mantel of the Article II, Section 16, right of access to the courts, Opinion \u00b6 26, is a disgrace to Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b649 Among other things in <em>Seltzer, </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The \u201cessence\u201d of our judicial system is not simply the resolution of disputes; rather, it is the resolution of <em>legitimate </em>disputes. Baseless lawsuits prosecuted in furtherance of ulterior motives have no place in our courts. Moreover, the sort of saber-rattling, chest-thumping approach typified by the comment of GDC\u2019s counsel, trivializes the devastating effects on the health, reputations, and fortunes of the real people who are maliciously and abusively sued. For the ordinary citizens who are the victims of such a lawsuit, it may be the most horrific experience of their lives. Indeed, those effects are not merely the collateral damage of some run-of-the-mill litigation battle between attorneys. Rather, the defendants in such cases are the innocent casualties of the war.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 179. Ironically, Dr. Walker avoided being a casualty of the war in Iraq, Opinion, \u00b6 8, only to become collateral damage in Johnson\u2019s legal wars in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b650 Johnson\u2019s conduct, and that of his trial attorney in this case, was reprehensible and repugnant to Montana\u2019s notions of fairness and justice. In my view, Johnson caught an undeserved windfall in the court\u2019s determination not to award substantial punitive damages against him. Were I the trial judge, Johnson would be leaving Montana for California on a bus with but the shirt on his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b651 I concur and dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> 1 note that Emmerson\u2019s lawyer on appeal, Karl Knuchel, was Johnson\u2019s lawyer in the trial court when Johnson was involved in his chicanery.
