We reverse and remand to the Department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the Department abuse its discretion in denying Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b64 Hohenlohes purchased the Sentinel Rock Ranch in Lewis and Clark County in 1999. Hohenlohes obtained Water Right Nos. 41QJ-17073 and 41QJ-17074 on Little Prickly Pear Creek as appurtenances to their purchase. These rights have priority dates of August 22,1892, and May 17, 1890, respectively. The rights comprise a combined flow rate of 32.5 cubic feet per second (cfs), according to the water right abstracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b65 Hohenlohes applied for and received a grant from the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) to convert approximately 150 acres of their land from flood to sprinkler irrigation. The conversion resulted in a significant water savings. A condition of the grant required Hohenlohes to leave the excess or \u201csalvage\u201d water instream pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-408, MCA. This stipulation required that Hohenlohes leave the salvaged water instream for at least thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b66 Hohenlohes filed an application under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402, -407, and -408, MCA, on December 13, 2004, for a temporary change of irrigation water rights to instream flow. Hohenlohes\u2019 application sought to change the existing 32.5 cfs flood irrigation right to a combined right comprising 3.5 cfs for sprinkler irrigation and designating the remaining 29 cfs as instream flow under \u00a7 85-2-408, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u00b67 Hohenlohes supported their change of use application with an affidavit of the former ranch owner, J.C. Kantorowicz (Kantorowicz affidavit), a letter from George Liknes, Regional Fisheries Manager for FWP, ditch capacity calculations prepared by the Department, and testimony of John Westenberg, a hydrologist and former Department employee. Hohenlohes claimed, based on the Kantorowicz affidavit, that the ditch headgate at the point of diversion would support 36 to 40 cfs. The Kantorowicz affidavit further stated that the ditch had been filled to capacity, subject to water availability, during Kantorowicz\u2019s tenure from 1948 to 1999. The Department calculated Hohenlohes\u2019 ditch capacity to be up to 34 cfs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">\u00b68 Hohenlohes also provided information on historic flow rates for Little Prickly Pear Creek from a U.S. Geological Survey gauging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>station located half a mile upstream from their point of diversion. These records provided data on water availability in cubic feet per second from 1961 through 2007. The flow rate in Little Prickly Pear Creek-averaged over the forty-six year period-ranged from a mean low of 40 cfs in January to a mean maximum flow rate of 278 cfs in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b69 The Department\u2019s engineer conducted a site inspection and determined, based on the soil type and topography of the ranch, that 1,863 acre feet (AF) of water would constitute a more reasonable volume to flood irrigate 193 acres of alfalfa. The Department further determined, based on the Montana Irrigation Guide, that 372 AF of water constituted the consumptive use for 193 acres of alfalfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b610 Hohenlohes installed five sprinkler pivots in 2004. The Department conducted a field investigation on August 22, 2005. The Department deemed Hohenlohes\u2019 application \u201ccorrect and complete\u201d on October 4, 2005, and issued its environmental assessment on October 18, 2005. The Department issued a public notice of the proposed change on November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b611 Josephine M. Lahti (Lahti), the lone downstream right holder on Little Prickly Pear Creek, filed the sole objection to the application on December 16, 2005. Lahti withdrew her objection on May 31, 2007, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Hohenlohes. The Department cancelled the scheduled contested case hearing on Lahti\u2019s objection on June 6, 2007, and remanded the matter to the Helena regional office to analyze whether Hohenlohes had complied with \u00a7 85-2-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b612 The Department issued a Statement of Opinion on January 28, 2008, recommending denial of Hohenlohes\u2019 application. Jan Langel (Langel), Helena Regional Manager for the Department, authored the Statement of Opinion. Langel cited as grounds for denial that Hohenlohes had failed to present sufficient evidence of historic consumptive use to show that downstream right holders would not be affected adversely by their proposed change of use. Hohenlohes requested a hearing on the Statement of Opinion on February 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b613 The Department granted Hohenlohes\u2019 request for a show cause hearing, but appointed Langel as hearings examiner. Hohenlohes immediately moved to disqualify Langel on grounds of bias, lack of independence, and denial of due process. The Department denied Hohenlohes\u2019 disqualification request. The Department reasoned that Langel possessed the greatest knowledge of Hohenlohes\u2019 application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and was therefore the most appropriate person to preside over the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b614 Hohenlohes also objected to the Department\u2019s decision to conduct the hearing under the informal contested case proceedings of \u00a7 2-4-604, MCA. Hohenlohes based their objection on a letter dated March 14, 2008, from the Department Water Rights Division Administrator to Hohenlohes that had characterized the denial of Hohenlohes\u2019 application as being subject to formal proceedings under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA). Langel noted this objection for the record, but did not institute formal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b615 Hohenlohes next moved the Department to issue the change permit under the reasoning of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, in <em>Bostwick Props., Inc. v. Mont. Dept. of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>Cause No. DV-07-917AX (Mont. 18th Jud. Dist. May 12, 2008). Bostwick had applied to the district court for a writ of mandate directing the Department to issue its change of use application after the Department had exceeded the 180 day statutory deadline imposed by \u00a7 85-2-310(1), MCA (2007), \u201cto grant, deny, or condition an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b616 The district court ordered the Department to appear at a hearing concerning the writ. The Department finally issued a statement of opinion recommending denial of Bostwick\u2019s application only after Bostwick had sought judicial relief. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. The Department also assigned as the hearing examiner the same official who had written the statement of opinion recommending denial of Bostwick\u2019s application. <em>Bostwick Props., Inc. v. Mont. Dept. of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>2009 MT 181, \u00b6 29, 351 Mont. 26, 208 P.3d 868 (Rice, J., concurring). The district court granted Bostwick\u2019s motion based on these procedural abuses. <em>Bostwick, </em>Cause No. DV-07-917AX, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"Atj\">\u00b617 The Department deemed Hohenlohes\u2019 application correct and complete on October 4, 2005. Langel did not issue the Department\u2019s Statement of Opinion until January 28, 2008-742 days after the objection deadline had passed and 237 days after Lahti had withdrawn her objection. Hohenlohes argued that the Department had no option under <em>Bostwick </em>other than \u201cthe ministerial action of granting the permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. This Court later reversed the district court in <em>Bostwick </em>on the basis that the granting of a change permit does not constitute a ministerial act subject to a writ of mandate. <em>Bostwick, </em>2009 MT 181, \u00b6 21. The Department denied Hohenlohes\u2019 motion to issue the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u00b618 The Department finally conducted the show cause hearing on June 24,2008. Hohenlohes presented the testimony of George Liknes, the Department Regional Fisheries Manager, and John Westenberg, Senior Water Rights Specialist and a former Department employee. Hohenlohes introduced into the administrative record a number of exhibits, including photographs, correspondence, affidavits, and maps. The Department issued its final order denying Hohenlohes\u2019 application on July 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b619 The Final Order adopted the reasoning of the Department\u2019s earlier Statement of Opinion. The Department found that Hohenlohes had provided sufficient information to support their claimed diverted flow rate, but had failed to prove historic consumptive use. The Department further determined that Hohenlohes had failed to meet their burden under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402 and -408, MCA, because the consumptive volume implicated return flow analysis and potential impacts to downstream users. The Department specifically found that Hohenlohes\u2019 application had failed to provide information on the frequency and timing of diversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b620 Hohenlohes petitioned for judicial review pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. The District Court granted Hohenlohes\u2019 petition on June 10, 2009. The District Court declared itself \u201cat a loss\u201d as to how \u201csuch a beneficial change\u201d could be denied. The court specifically determined the Department\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding historic use, adverse effect, and salvage water to be both clearly erroneous, as well as arbitrary and capricious under \u00a7 2-4-704(2), MCA, of MAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b621 The District Court based its determinations on evidence and testimony concerning the benefits that had accrued to the waterway and its fishery since Hohenlohes\u2019 conversion to sprinkler irrigation. The court relied heavily on the fact that Hohenlohes\u2019 asserted water right could dewater Little Prickly Pear Creek. The court concluded that \u201cno showing was made by DNRC that Hohenlohes\u2019 current use of the water is wasteful.\u201d The District Court also determined that neither \u00a7 85-2-402, MCA, nor \u00a7 85-2-408, MCA, required analysis of return flows. The court reached this determination based on the fact that \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, does not contain the term \u201creturn flows.\u201d The District Court concluded that \u201cso long as the increased stream flows do not adversely affect downstream users ... these types of change requests should be summarily granted.\u201d The Department appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b622 A district court reviews an agency\u2019s decision under \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. A court must confine its review of an agency\u2019s decision to the record. The reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence. Section 2-4-704(l)-(2), MCA. This Court employs the same standard when reviewing the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Denke v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 418, \u00b6 39, 347 Mont. 322, 198 P.3d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b623  This Court employs a three-part test to determine whether an agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous: 1) we review the record to see if substantial evidence supports the findings, 2) if substantial evidence supports the findings, we determine whether the agency misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and 3) if both of the above are satisfied, we still may decide a finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Owens v. Mont. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2007 MT 298, \u00b6 13, 340 Mont. 48, 172 P.3d 1227. Finally, we review for correctness an agency\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Owens, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b624 <em>Did the Department abuse its discretion in denying Hohenlohes' change of use application?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b625 Representatives from the agricultural, recreation, and conservation communities developed the instream flow provisions of the Montana Water Use Act. The legislature ratified the provisions in 1995. Sections 85-2-408, -439, MCA (1995). The provisions authorized \u201cthe temporary use of existing water rights for instream flow to benefit the fishery resource ... within the prior appropriation water rights system.\u201d Statement of Intent, Mont. H. 472, Sec. 1, Ch. 322, L. 1995 (Mar. 31, 1995). The provisions proved so successful that at the termination of the ten year sunset period provided for by the 1995 Act, the 2005 legislature approved amendments that made permanent the instream flow provisions and allowed for a maximum lease term of thirty years. Mont. H. 308, Sec. 6, Ch. 85, L. 2005 (Mar. 24, 2005). The amendments also merged a separate provision that had applied only to the Clark Fork River into the statewide provisions and adopted as \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, the language from a 1989 FWP leasing statute. <em>Id.-, see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA (2005), 85-2-436, MCA (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">A. The Department\u2019s Review of a Change of Use Application for Instream Flow Does Not Constitute Adjudication of an Applicant\u2019s Water Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u00b626 The Department claims on appeal that the District Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the Department as to two factual issues: 1) the determination of the historic volume of Hohenlohes\u2019 water rights, and 2) the analysis of return flows. The Department argues that the District Court impermissibly shifted the applicant\u2019s burden to the agency when it determined that Hohenlohes had no statutory obligation to analyze return flows to demonstrate historic consumptive use. The linchpin of the Department\u2019s argument appears to be that without a \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis, applicants will attempt to use a temporary instream flow conversion to parlay an inefficient flood irrigation right into a much larger consumptive use right. The Department reasons that if water historically diverted, but used only for conveyance purposes, is approved for instream use under \u00a7 85-2-408, MCA, that water may, at the expiration of the lease, be converted to a consumptive use. The extensive statutory safeguards that exist to prevent this type of bootstrapping undermine the Department\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b627 Section 85-2-407(6), MCA, provides that a temporary change automatically reverts to its \u201cpermanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of storage\u201d at the expiration of the lease or conversion period. This reversion applies to both the consumptive and non-consumptive components of the subject water right, encompassing both the proportional and actual quantities of water represented by them. The original appropriator may salvage the non-consumptive portion of a water right diverted for beneficial use, but lost to seepage. Section 85-2-419, MCA. The appropriator may use or sell salvage water for a beneficial use, including instream flow. <em>Id. </em>This historically non-consumptive portion of a water right, or salvage water, may be changed to instream flow (also a non-consumptive use). This salvage water automatically will revert to its original non-consumptive use, however, at the conclusion of the lease or conversion period. The statutory provisions specifically protect against any effort by an appropriator to bootstrap a non-consumptive use-such as carriage, seepage, or wastewater that has been salvaged-into a consumptive use or to enlarge the flow rate that may be used consumptively. A temporary change will remain in effect, moreover, if the water right to which it is attached is transferred as an appurtenance to real property \u201cunless otherwise authorized by the department.\u201d Section 85-2-407(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b628 Sections 85-2-407 and -408, MCA, proscribe any change of use that would affect adversely another water user and contain affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>provisions safeguarding the rights of other users. An instream flow change applicant may not, as a matter of law, expand a consumptive use right by means of a temporary change to instream flow. Section 85-2-407(6), MCA. An instream flow change applicant likewise may not convert the non-consumptive portion of a water right to a consumptive use. <em>Id. </em>More importantly, the Department\u2019s decision to approve a temporary change to instream flow in no way constitutes a quantification of the applicant\u2019s water right. The Department lacks authority to determine the quantity of a water right for purposes of adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b629 The Montana Water Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to determine quantities of water rights and issue decrees as part of the statewide adjudication process. Sections 3-7-501, 85-2-216, MCA. Montana law further provides that the adjudication process-and not a permit for a new appropriation or change of use issued by the Department-provides the sole forum in which a water right holder may quantify and ascertain his water right. <em>Id.; see also </em>\u00a7 85-2-101(5), MCA. We emphasize that under Montana law, Hohenlohes\u2019 proposed change to instream flow would revert at the end of the conversion period to its permanent purpose (flood irrigation), its place of use (the Sentinel Rock Ranch), and its former point of diversion (Little Prickly Pear Creek). Section 85-2-407(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b630 Hohenlohes raise their own claim that the Department lacks authority to \u201cquantify\u201d their water right. Hohenlohes argue that the Department\u2019s requirement of a volume metric in change applications constitutes an adjudication of their water rights that invades the province of the Water Court. Hohenlohes cite <em>McDonald v. State, </em>220 Mont. 519, 722 P.2d 598 (1986), for the proposition that \u201cvolume is an inappropriate metric of direct flow irrigation rights.\u201d Hohenlohes mischaracterize <em>McDonald. </em>This Court in <em>McDonald </em>actually rejected a constitutional challenge to the use of volume to quantify decrees. <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 535, 722 P.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b631 The Department\u2019s regulatory provisions comport with this holding by requiring applicants for a change of use to state both flow rate and volume. Admin. R. M. 36.12.1902(7). Hohenlohes\u2019 water rights, regardless of whether they are approved for change of use by the Department, remain subject to final adjudication and quantification by the Water Court. Section 85-2-101(5), MCA. The Department\u2019s use of volume in the processing of change applications does not constitute adjudication. The volume represents the amount of water available for a willing lessee or right holder to devote to instream flow use during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the lease or conversion period. As a result, we do not attempt in any manner to quantify Hohenlohes\u2019 water right. Our analysis focuses instead on the two central issues: 1) whether Hohenlohes have met their statutory burden of demonstrating that the proposed change of use for instream flow would have no adverse effect on the rights of other water users, and 2) the scope and application of the Department\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(8) and -408(7), MCA, to limit the amount, or otherwise condition the amount of an applicant\u2019s water right that may be protected as instream flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">B. The Applicant\u2019s Burden Under \u00a7\u00a785-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b632 The Water Use Act requires an applicant who seeks a change of use for instream flow to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that certain criteria have been met. Sections 85-2-402(2), -408(3), MCA. The criteria applicable to instream flow change applications include lack of adverse effect to other right holders, evidence that the proposed change constitutes a beneficial use, proof that any proposed water saving methods will salvage the amount of water asserted by the applicant, and evidence that the amount of water claimed is necessary to benefit the fishery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b633 The first criteria of lack of adverse effect provides the only point of contention and thus we will examine whether Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application would affect adversely other right holders. The Department must grant the change application if an applicant has demonstrated the statutory criteria by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 85-2-402(2), MCA. A preponderance requires that the applicant meet the relatively modest standard that the statutory criteria are \u201cmore probable than not\u201d to have been met. <em>Narum v. Liberty Northwest Ins. </em>Corp., 2009 MT 127, \u00b6 28, 350 Mont. 252, 206 P.3d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b634 The Department points specifically to <em>In re Royston, </em>249 Mont. 425, 428, 816 P.2d 1054, 1057 (1991), for the proposition that the applicant bears the burden to satisfy the statutory requirements for a change of use. This Court upheld the Department\u2019s determination in <em>Royston </em>that an applicant had failed to present substantial credible evidence to support its change of use application. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 1060. We rejected the applicant\u2019s claim that the burden of demonstrating lack of adverse effect rested with the objector to a change of use application rather than with the applicant. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 1057. This Court noted that the burden indeed had rested with the objector before the adoption of the Water Use Act in 1973. The adoption of the Water Use Act, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1985 amendments to \u00a7 85-2-402(2), MCA, had shifted that burden squarely to the applicant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b635 Neither party disputes that the burden to prove the statutory criteria rests with the applicant. <em>Royston, </em>therefore, provides no significant guidance. The parties disagree as to whether Hohenlohes met their burden. To resolve this question, we must clarify the scope of the applicant\u2019s burden under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402 and -408, MCA. Both \u00a7 85-2-402(2) and \u00a7 85-2-408(3), MCA, require that the applicant prove certain criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b636 Each provision itemizes the criteria that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 85-2-402(2), MCA, contains the requirements that all change of use applicants must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 85-2-402(2)(a)-(g), MCA. Section 85-2-408(3), MCA, imposes additional criteria that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence by instream flow applicants. Section 85-2-408(3)(a)-(b). Both sections impose a number of additional limitations on change of use applicants that are listed separately from the criteria that must be proven by a preponderance as part of the applicant\u2019s burden to demonstrate lack of adverse effect to other right holders. Sections 85-2-402, -408, MCA. For example, \u00a7 85-2-408(6), MCA, provides that a temporary change authorization for instream flow does not create a right of access across private property. This stipulation is unrelated to the criteria that an applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence under \u00a7 85-2-408(3), MCA. Likewise, \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, constitutes an entirely separate provision from the statutory criteria listed under \u00a7 85-2-408(3), MCA. Subsection (7) limits the amount of water that may be changed to instream flow and grants the Department the authority to further limit that amount. Section 85-2-408(7), MCA. Subsection (7) does not impose an additional requirement that must be proven by the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b637 The applicant\u2019s burden extends, therefore, to adduce proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the criteria listed at \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2)(a)-(g) and 85-2-408(3)(a)-(b), MCA, have been met. The showing required of the applicant under these provisions undoubtedly will contribute to the calculation of the \u201camount historically diverted\u201d and \u201camount historically consumed\u201d under \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA. The Department may then use these calculations to limit the amount of water an applicant may put to instream use under the authority granted to it by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA. Where the applicant successfully has proven the requirements listed under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>MCA, the Department may not refuse to grant a change of use solely on the grounds of the applicant\u2019s failure to \u201cprove\u201d the limitation articulated by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, because subsection (7) does not impose a burden on the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b638 The Department concluded that Hohenlohes had failed to establish a lack of adverse effect to other right holders. The Department pointed specifically to Hohenlohes\u2019 failure to analyze the historic volume of water consumed by the crop or how the diverted water not consumed by the crop had returned to the source. The Department relied on \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, to determine that Hohenlohes were entitled to change to instream use only that portion of their water right that historically had been consumed. The Department denied Hohenlohes\u2019 application in large part based on Hohenlohes\u2019 failure to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the volume of historic consumptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b639 Section 85-2-408(7), MCA, dictates that the amount of water historically diverted represents the maximum amount of water that may be protected instream to benefit the fishery. The provision further provides, however, that the maximum quantity of water that may be used to maintain or enhance streamflows below the existing point of diversion is the \u201camount historically consumed, or a smaller amount if specified by the department.\u201d Section 85-2-408(7), MCA. We recognize the potential contradictions posed by these provisions. Hohenlohes\u2019 application demonstrates both the difficulty of accurately determining the amount historically consumed, and the large discrepancy that may exist between historic diversion and consumption. This discrepancy may render impossible the satisfaction of both provisions of \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b640 We act under an affirmative duty to interpret statutes so as to give effect the underlying legislative intent. <em>Delaney &amp; Co. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 441, \u00b6 22, 354 Mont. 181, 222 P.3d 618. Statutory construction \u201cshould not lead to absurd results if a reasonable interpretation can avoid it.\u201d <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., </em>2008 MT 377, \u00b6 72, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219. To read \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, as allowing the Department to approve a change of use application for the amount historically diverted, the amount historically consumed, or a lesser amount, as determined by the Department, gives effect to all of the words of the statute and to legislative intent. This interpretation also comports with the Department\u2019s own past interpretations of the phrase \u201camount historically consumed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u00b641 The Department deviated from its own prior interpretation of \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, in denying Hohenlohes\u2019 application. <em>See e.g. Authorization Nos. 76F-30023056, Mannix Lease </em>(2007), and <em>76F-30011112, Hoxworth Lease </em>(2005). Moreover, the Department has conflated the subsection (7) consumptive use language with the showing of no adverse effect required by \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA. As a consequence, the Department reasoned that the determination of historic consumptive use comprised part of the applicant\u2019s burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proposed change would inflict no adverse effect on the water rights of other users.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b642 Within the parameters set by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, return flow and historic beneficial use present related issues in the context of a change of use application for instream flow. The question of adverse effect under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA, implicates return flows. A change in the amount of return flow, or to the hydrogeologic pattern of return flow, has the potential to affect adversely downstream water rights. There consequently exists an inextricable link between the \u201camount historically consumed\u201d and the water that re-enters the stream as return flow. The Department defines \u201creturn flow\u201d as that part of diverted flow that is applied to irrigated land and is not consumed, but returns underground to its original source or another source, \u201cand to which other water users are entitled to a continuation of, as part of their water right.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(56).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b643 An appropriator historically has been entitled to the greatest quantity of water he can put to use. <em>Sayre v. Johnson, </em>33 Mont. 15, 18, 81 P. 389, 390 (1905). The requirement that the use be both beneficial and reasonable, however, proscribes this tenet. <em>In re Adjudication of Existing Rights to the Use of All Water, </em>2002 MT 216, \u00b6 56, 311 Mont. 327, 55 P.3d 396; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 85-2-311(l)(d), MCA. This limitation springs from a fundamental tenet of western water law-that an appropriator has a right only to that amount of water historically put to beneficial use-developed in concert with the rationale that each subsequent appropriator \u201cis entitled to have the water flow in the same manner as when he located,\u201d and the appropriator may insist that prior appropriators do not affect adversely his rights. <em>Spokane Ranch &amp; Water Co. v. Beatty, </em>37 Mont. 342, 351, 96 P. 727, 731 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b644 This fundamental rule of Montana water law has dictated the Department\u2019s determinations in numerous prior change proceedings. <em>See e.g. In the Matter of Application for Change Authorization No. G(W)028708-411 by Hedrich /Straugh /Ringer, </em>Final Order (Dec. 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>1991); <em>In the Matter of Application for Change Authorization No. G(W)008323-g76L by Starkel /Koester, </em>Final Order (Apr. 1, 1992). The Department claims that historic consumptive use, as quantified in part by return flow analysis, represents a key element of proving historic beneficial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b645 We do not dispute this interrelationship between historic consumptive use, return flow, and the amount of water to which an appropriator is entitled as limited by his past beneficial use. The amount of return flow analysis required will vary, however, with the facts of a particular case and the potential for adverse impact to downstream users. The potential for adverse impact to downstream users appears negligible in the context of Hohenlohes\u2019 change application. The Department nonetheless cited Hohenlohes\u2019 failure to provide a \u201ccomplete\u201d analysis of return flows in support of its denial. Without such an analysis, the Department argued, it was unable to ascertain whether Hohenlohes had met the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402 and -408, MCA, or to determine whether Hohenlohes successfully had proven lack of adverse effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b646 The Department based its denial-and its determination that a \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis was required-on an overly narrow reading of \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA. The Department argued that the phrase \u201cthe amount historically consumed\u201d limits the amount of water that may be protected instream to the water that had been lost to plant consumption (evapotranspiration). The District Court disagreed. The court observed that in many cases large volumes of water may be diverted that are not lost to evapotranspiration, yet never return to the protected reach. The District Court determined that the Department\u2019s reading of \u201cthe amount historically consumed,\u201d in the context of Hohenlohes\u2019 application, conflicted with its prior applications of that provision and with the plain language of the statute. The Department\u2019s own definition of consumptive use makes clear that return flow represents only one variable-albeit an important variable-in the calculation of consumptive use. In addition to evapotranspiration, consumptive use includes direct evaporation from soils or water surfaces and any water incorporated into vegetation or that otherwise does not return to ground or surface water. Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b647 The Department does not contest the District Court\u2019s determination on the definition of \u201cthe amount historically consumed.\u201d The Department argues instead that in prior cases in which it accepted the full diverted volume as the volume to be protected instream, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>applicant had provided a \u201ccomplete return flow analysis.\u201d The Department raises the specter of a water right holder using the instream flow change provisions to bootstrap a larger amount of water for a consumptive purpose. We already have determined that the temporary change provisions of the Water Use Act provide adequate insurance against such an outcome. Section 85-2-407(6), MCA. This bootstrapping concern, therefore, can no more constitute the sole grounds for limiting the quantity of Hohenlohes\u2019 diverted water right that may be put instream to benefit the fishery than it can justify the outright denial of their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b648 As we have noted, prior change of use decisions by the Department have allowed for the full diverted volume to be protected as instream flow under similar circumstances. <em>Authorization Nos. 76F-30023056, Mannix Lease </em>(2007), and <em>76F-30011112, Hoxworth Lease </em>(2005). The Department approved these change of use applications for the entire diverted amount even in cases where the return flow historically had been lost to the protected reach, but returned downstream of it. These approvals reflected the policy and purpose of the Water Use Act, which aims to \u201cencourage the wise use of the state\u2019s water resources,\u201d and to seek \u201cthe stabilization of streamflows.\u201d Section 85-2-101(3), MCA. They further reflected a rule that the Department asserts here against Hohenlohes, that Montana water law does not discriminate among uses. Section 85-1-101(4), MCA. An applicant who wishes to change his point of diversion or to change to a more efficient form of irrigation and thereby irrigate a larger acreage is entitled-on making the required statutory showing-to make use of the historically diverted amount. Section 85-2-402(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b649 It is untenable that a change of use applicant who incurs the considerable expense of installing a more efficient irrigation system in order to leave water instream-a beneficial use equal to any other recognized by the Montana Constitution-thereby risks losing a significant portion of the water he would have been allowed to divert had he continued to irrigate in an inefficient manner. Such an outcome frustrates the purpose of the instream flow statute, and does little to \u201cencourage the wise use of the state\u2019s water resources.\u201d Section 85-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b650 Hohenlohes submitted information as to historic diverted use and ditch capacity. Hohenlohes claimed a historic diverted volume of 4,682.7 AF based on their alleged diversion rate of 32.5 cfs. Hohenlohes\u2019 change application sought a combined use of4,342.44 AF that included both irrigation and instream flow. Hohenlohes performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>a return flow analysis for the 200-foot section below their point of diversion on Little Prickly Pear Creek that they had defined as the \u201cprotected reach.\u201d Hohenlohes did not analyze how 4,342.44 AF of water historically had returned to the Missouri River.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b651 The regulatory framework provides applicants with a variety of methods to establish historic use. <em>See </em>Admin. R. M. 36.12.1902(9). Hohenlohes produced the available historic documentation. By doing so, Hohenlohes established the maximum quantity of water that \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, entitles them to convert to instream flow. The Department then should have focused its analysis on whether Hohenlohes\u2019 conversion of this maximum amount of water to instream flow would affect adversely other right holders. Sections 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b652 Hohenlohes point out that no practical difference exists for upstream water right holders-all are junior appropriators in this case-between their use of all 32.5 cfs for flood irrigation versus their use of 3.5 cfs for sprinkler irrigation and their leaving the remaining 29 cfs in the waterway. We agree. The effect of a call for an upstream junior would be the same regardless of whether Hohenlohes put the water back into Little Prickly Pear Creek or continued to divert it. Return flows from Hohenlohes\u2019 property would have no effect on upstream users on Little Prickly Pear Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b653 The sole downstream user on Little Prickly Pear Creek-Lahti-initially filed an objection to Hohenlohes\u2019 application. Lahti, as the sole downstream user, posed the most likely potential candidate to suffer adverse effect from Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application. Lahti withdrew her objection on May 31, 2007, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Hohenlohes, before the case proceeded to a contested case hearing. Lahti determined that Hohenlohes\u2019 proposed change to instream flow in fact had increased her water supply. The Department\u2019s own analysis supports Lahti\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b654 The Department contends that the topography of the acreage historically irrigated indicates that much of Hohenlohes\u2019 diverted water actually returns directly to the Missouri River above the confluence with Little Prickly Pear Creek, rather than to Little Prickly Pear Creek itself. This water under natural circumstances, of course, would remain in Little Prickly Pear Creek and augment the flow available to downstream users such as Lahti. Hohenlohes\u2019 decision to leave the water in Little Prickly Pear Creek to enhance instream flow would produce the same outcome-more water available in Little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Prickly Pear Creek than if Hohenlohes continued to divert the water. By the Department\u2019s own admission, Hohenlohes\u2019 return flow goes directly to the Missouri River to the detriment of downstream users on Little Prickly Pear Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b655 The Department argues that the mere absence of objections by other right holders does not necessarily equate with a determination that the applicant has met the statutory criteria to prove lack of adverse effect. The Department fails to explain how the requirement of a \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis applies where no downstream users depend on return flow to trigger analysis under Admin. R. M. 36.12.1903(2)(d). In this case, where Hohenlohes have applied for a change of use to instream flow on the lower reaches of a small tributary, and satisfactorily have established lack of adverse effect to other users, the Department abuses its discretion by requiring more than is necessary to meet the statutory criteria. The Department undoubtedly possesses the discretion to require a more or less comprehensive return flow analysis depending on circumstances. This discretion does not exist in a vacuum, however, and the degree of analysis required in a given situation will vary according to the underlying facts. The Department admits that \u201c[i]n some cases an amount need not even be calculated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b656 The Department\u2019s definition of a \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis in this case appears to be unlimited in scope. The Department\u2019s requirement, moreover, would extend to all potential users with points of diversion falling within the path of water that would-under natural stream conditions-never leave Little Prickly Pear Creek. The Department stresses the large amount of water claimed by Hohenlohes as justification for requiring an extensive return flow analysis, but appears to have lost sight of the fact that the return flow analysis serves to establish the statutory requirement of proving lack of adverse effect. The Department appears similarly distracted from the hydrologic significance of Hohenlohes\u2019 claimed diverted volume on Little Prickly Pear Creek. The Department instead fixates on the relatively negligible effect of Hohenlohes\u2019 proposed change of use on the flow of the Missouri River. Though the Department is entitled to-and indeed required to-consider both of these factors, it must not sacrifice the underlying statutory purpose to guard against a purely hypothetical bootstrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b657 Hohenlohes claim a flow rate of 32.5 cfs-enough, based on historical records, to have dewatered Little Prickly Pear Creek entirely. The Missouri River at the gauging station closest to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>confluence with Little Prickly Pear Creek, by contrast, had an annual flow rate in 2009 of 23,376 cfs. The potential impact of returning 29 cfs of water to the fishery from which it was diverted-Little Prickly Pear Creek-would be significant. The potential harm from a reduction in return flow to the Missouri River would be negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b658 Hohenlohes argue that the Department should consider their claimed diverted amount of4,342.44 AF as the amount of their historic consumptive use in the absence of an objecting downstream user. The Department\u2019s own past interpretation of the phrase \u201cthe amount historically consumed\u201d reflects the reality that under certain circumstances the diverted amount and consumed amount will, for all intents and purposes, be the same where no water historically had returned to the protected reach, and no downstream users are likely to be affected adversely.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b659 The Department based its own calculations of what volume would constitute reasonable historic use on the Montana Irrigation Guide, while Admin. R. M. 36.12.1902(14) gives applicants a variety of options for calculating historic consumptive use. These options range from quantification of actual historic consumption using historic measurements, to proxy estimations for historic use based on crop, soil type, and region.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b660 Proxy approaches such as the Montana Irrigation Guide-used here by the Department-and Natural Resources Conservation Services Irrigation Water Requirements, represent at best rough estimates of historic consumptive use. These estimates may prove useful for applications that seek to change from one consumptive use to another, or in cases where the potential for adverse effect on the rights of other users remains unclear. For instream flow applications on the lower portions of small tributaries where the applicant successfully has demonstrated no adverse effect to other users, however, such subjective estimates may serve to counteract the intent of the instream flow provisions by arbitrarily limiting the amount of water that may be protected to benefit fisheries. In fact, the Department\u2019s decision to limit the amount of water that a right holder may transfer from consumptive use to instream flow in such situations may have the anomalous result of forcing an appropriator to continue with inefficient irrigation methods in order to preserve the full extent of his water right.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b661 We agree as a general matter that the Department possesses the discretion to require return flow analysis to the extent necessary to determine lack of adverse effect. We are troubled, however, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Department\u2019s failure to use its discretion in a consistent manner so as to provide instream flow change applicants with sufficient guidance as to the factual circumstances that will correlate with a given level of analysis. No bright line rule governs the scope of this analysis. The analysis will vary from one application and accompanying set of facts to the next. This inherent variability does not mean that the Department may act with impunity according to its own whims and without regard for the facts of a case or the underlying purpose and intent of the statute that it is empowered to uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b662  Here the applicant successfully has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that no other users would be affected adversely by potential changes to instream flow. We agree with the District Court that the Department\u2019s denial of the application for want of a \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis-without further explication and where it has granted similar applications in the past-constitutes arbitrary conduct under \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA. Such conduct conflicts with the substantive mandates of the Water Use Act as a whole, and with the purpose and intent of the instream flow provisions in particular. Sections 85-1-101, 85-2-408, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b663 Moreover, the Department\u2019s conduct ignores how the instream flow statute has worked in practice. The majority of the leases and conversions that the Department processed during the initial ten-year period of the instream flow provisions have been on small tributaries. Mont. H. 308, Fish, Wildlife and Parks Comm. <em>Hearing on HB 308, </em>L. 2005, Reg. Sess. (Jan. 27, 2005) (Exhibit 10: <em>Private Water Leasing </em>- A <em>Montana Approach: A Report on the 10-Year History of a Unique Montana Program, </em>Trout Unlimited Report). The lower reaches of these small tributaries represent the preferred spawning habitat for most of the native fish species that inhabit the larger rivers of Montana. In addition, leases on the lower reaches of tributaries likely would prove more effective because they are less prone to diminution by a call from a downstream right holder. The instream flow statutes do not specify the size of water body to be targeted, but the practical reality of fish biology-and the legal reality of the prior appropriation system-dictate that the greatest benefit to the fishery will accrue from water being protected instream in the lower reaches of small tributaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b664 Hohenlohes have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that their proposed change of use to instream flow would not affect adversely the water rights of other users on Little Prickly Pear Creek. The Department has not identified any users on the Missouri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>River under Admin. R. M. 36.12.1903(2)(d) who potentially are \u201cdependant on return flow\u201d from Hohenlohes. The Department may not require Hohenlohes to establish that their proposed change of use would not affect adversely a hypothetical water right holder on the Missouri River-to do so imposes a heavier burden on the applicant than the statutory provisions warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b665  The Department\u2019s insistence that Hohenlohes submit an undefined \u201ccomplete\u201d return flow analysis overlooks this basic hydrologic fact, and thereby frustrates the purpose of the return flow statute. Hohenlohes submitted all of the available historic documentation as to historic use of the water rights they seek to change. Most importantly, Hohenlohes adequately demonstrated that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that their change of use will not affect adversely other users. Hohenlohes have satisfied the burden imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA, that their proposed change will not result in adverse effect to other right holders. The Department\u2019s denial of Hohenlohes\u2019 change application based on an alleged incomplete return flow analysis is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion under these circumstances. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">C. The Department\u2019s Exercise of its Discretion Under \u00a785-2-408(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b666 The administrative record establishes that Hohenlohes demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence under \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-402(2) and -408(3), MCA, that their proposal to return to Little Prickly Pear Creek 29 cfs of the 32.5 cfs of water that they formerly had diverted would have no adverse effect on other right holders. Our determination that the Department abused its discretion in its handling of Hohenlohes\u2019 change application does not conclude the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b667 Hohenlohes\u2019 showing of no adverse effect established the maximum amount of water that they may convert to instream flow under the first provision of Section 85-2-408(7), MCA-\u201cthe amount historically diverted.\u201d The Department still possesses discretion under appropriate circumstances to limit or reduce that portion suitable for instream flow from \u201cthe amount historically diverted\u201d to \u201cthe amount historically consumed, or a smaller amount.\u201d Section 85-2-408(7), MCA. Section 85-2-402(8), MCA, likewise allows the Department to approve an application for a change in appropriation right \u201csubject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations that it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b668 Hohenlohes seek a broad ruling that would eliminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Department\u2019s discretion. In this regard, Hohenlohes characterize consumptive use as a malleable concept that can be changed to accommodate unique factual situations. As a result, Hohenlohes argue that the Department should consider their full diverted amount of 4,342.44 AF as the amount of their historic consumptive use in the absence of an objecting downstream user.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b669 Consumptive use actually represents a legally defined term within the context of the Water Use Act. \u201cConsumptive use\u201d constitutes the volume of water used annually for a beneficial purpose, \u201csuch as water transpired by growing vegetation, evaporated from soils or water surfaces, or incorporated into products <em>that does not return to ground or surface water.\u201d </em>Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(15) (emphasis added). Hohenlohes\u2019 characterization of their historic use as both diversion and consumption conflicts with the regulatory provisions promulgated by the Department. The rule proposed by Hohenlohes improperly would constrain the Department under almost any circumstances from limiting the amount of water that an applicant may dedicate to instream use in future cases. Other change of use applications may present a greater potential for adverse effect to other right holders and we decline to adopt such a blanket rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b670 We recognize, however, that the Department\u2019s own past interpretation of the phrase \u201camount historically consumed,\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, reflects the reality that under some circumstances the diverted amount and consumed amount will be the same. These circumstances likely will arise in situations where no water historically had returned to the protected reach, and no downstream users likely would be affected adversely. The Department properly exercises the discretion bestowed by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, to limit that amount of water that an applicant may dedicate to instream flow when questions arise as to whether a proposed change would affect adversely other right holders. These questions generally will arise in change applications in which some portion of the historically diverted water returns directly to the protected reach and in which identifiable downstream users potentially will be affected adversely by the proposed change of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b671 The Department must evaluate, on a case by case basis, whether an instream flow application may be approved for the full historically diverted amount, the \u201camount historically consumed,\u201d or a smaller amount. The Department alleges in this case that past wasteful use by Kantorowicz, Hohenlohes\u2019 predecessor, accounts for the significant discrepancy between Hohenlohes\u2019 claimed diverted volume and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Department\u2019s calculated \u201creasonable\u201d volume. The Department\u2019s engineer opined that Kantorowicz had \u201cactually wasted water just because he could.\u201d The Department retains the discretion to take into account reasonable or wasteful use and to amend or modify a proposed change of use application according to those determinations. <em>See Bostwick, </em>2009 MT 181, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b672 In exercising this discretion, however, the Department must not lose sight of the ultimate purpose of the instream flow statute-to restore water to streams for the benefit of the fishery resource. The Department must balance this purpose with the realistic likelihood of adverse effect to <em>existing </em>right holders. The Department further must bear in mind the fact that Hohenlohes\u2019 water rights remain subject to ultimate adjudication by the Water Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b673 We deem it appropriate under the circumstances to reverse the District Court\u2019s order that directed the Department to grant summarily Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application for the full diverted amount. The District Court\u2019s order sweeps too broadly and casts aside entirely the Department\u2019s discretion granted by \u00a7 85-2-408(7), MCA, to limit under appropriate circumstances the amount of water that a change of use applicant may dedicate to instream flow. The Department should evaluate in the first instance Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application consistent with the principles set forth here.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b674 In evaluating Hohenlohes\u2019 application, the Department further must comply with all applicable statutory procedures. For example, the Department issued its final order denying Hohenlohes\u2019 application 742 days after the objection deadline had passed. Section 85-2-310(1), MCA (2007). This same type of dilatory response prompted the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, to grant the applicants a writ of mandate in <em>Bostwick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b675 We reversed the district court in <em>Bostwick </em>solely on the basis that the Department\u2019s decision on a change of use application represents a discretionary action not subject to a writ of mandate. <em>Bostwick, </em>2009 MT 181, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. The Department cites <em>Bostwick, </em>however, for the proposition that this Court may not overturn its discretionary act in refusing to grant Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application. The Department reads a level of administrative immunity into <em>Bostwick </em>that does not exist in statute or case law. Our decision in <em>Bostwick </em>determined only that mandamus did not represent an available form of relief for the Department\u2019s completed discretionary act. <em>Bostwick, </em>2009 MT 181, \u00b6 19. We declined to \u201cdelve into the precise hydrological and scientific reasons\u201d for the Department\u2019s denial because we did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>reach the merits of Bostwick\u2019s claim. <em>Bostwick, </em>2009 MT 181, n. 1. We in no way intended to condone the Department\u2019s procedural deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b676 The Department also refused to appoint a hearing examiner different from the Department employee who had evaluated Hohenlohes\u2019 application. The Department based its denial on the grounds that \u201cMr. Langel is the Department-appointed decision-maker with the most knowledge about the Application.\u201d We note that the legislature has seen fit to amend the hearing provisions at \u00a7 85-2-310, MCA, since Hohenlohes filed their complaint. Subsection (l)(b)(i) now provides specifically that the Department <em>shall </em>appoint a hearing examiner at the applicant\u2019s request \u201cwho did not participate in the preliminary decision.\u201d Section 85-2-310(l)(b)(i), MCA. Hohenlohes should receive the benefit of this subsequent legislative enactment on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b677 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order and remand to the Department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Department either may approve Hohenlohes\u2019 application as presented, or it must grant Hohenlohes a new hearing on the amount of water that Hohenlohes may dedicate to instream flow. A new hearing examiner must conduct any future hearings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b678 Justice Jim Rice recused himself after oral argument.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, NELSON and WHEAT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b486-9\">JUSTICE WHEAT</author>\n<p id=\"A51\">Concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">\u00b679 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I write separately to address four points.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">\u00b680 First, while I recognize that the Department is not required by law to share information and coordinate with the FWP, in this case, it would have been appropriate and beneficial for the Department to do so. This is especially true because the State generally and FWP specifically had as much to gain from the change in water use as Hohenlohes. Hohenlohes received a grant from the FWP to convert 150 acres of their land from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation. Opinion, \u00b6 5. This change resulted in significant water savings, all of which was used to increase instream flows and improve aquatic habitat. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">\u00b681 In my mind, when multiple state agencies are involved, the better course of action is for each agency to work with the other agencies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>are involved to reach a result in the most efficient manner, using the most complete dataset available. This approach is bolstered by well-established public policy in Montana. It is the public policy of the State \u201cto promote the conservation, development, and beneficial use of the state\u2019s water resources to secure maximum economic and social prosperity for its citizens.\u201d Section 85-1-101(2), MCA. The State \u201cshall coordinate the development and use of the water resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources.\u201d Section 85-1-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b682 With these mandates in mind, it would have benefitted all stakeholders-i.e. Hohenlohes, the Department, the FWP, and the general public-for the Department and the FWP to have communicated and shared information concerning Hohenlohes\u2019 change of use application. I hope that State agencies will find a way to coordinate their efforts in future cases like this so that all interested parties are involved in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b683 Second, I recognize that the law imposes on Hohenlohes an affirmative duty to prove the beneficial nature of their claimed historic use. Opinion, \u00b6 43 (citing <em>In Re Adjudication of Existing Rights to the Use of All Water, </em>\u00b6 56). Regardless of that duty, however, I observe that the Department went to great lengths to gather its own facts to evaluate Hohenlohes\u2019 application. The Department sent Jim Beck, a field engineer, to conduct an on-site investigation and generate calculations as to historic use. Opinion, \u00b6 9. The Department went so far as to expend its limited resources to gather information that would expand its understanding of the issues posed by Hohenlohes\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b684 Once the Department took that step, the Department should have shared that information with Hohenlohes and supplemented the record accordingly. In fact, in my opinion, the Department was obligated to supplement the record with the information it had developed. Instead, the Department denied Hohenlohes\u2019 application for failure to meet their burden to prove lack of adverse effect, the extent of historic use, and historic consumption \u2014 all while the Department itself had data that it could have contributed to the record. The Department\u2019s actions with respect to this issue disregard the public policy mandate that the State \u201cshall coordinate the development and use of the water resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources.\u201d Section 85-1-101(3), MCA. The Department\u2019s adversarial approach does not further the goal that all water resources of the State be put to optimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>beneficial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b685 Third, I recognize that under then-existing law, the Department was not required to appoint a new hearing examiner. Opinion, \u00b6 76. That being said, the Department\u2019s obstinate approach to this issue lacks common sense and courtesy. It gives the impression that the Department did anything it could to avoid giving Hohenlohes a fair shake. Once again, the Department\u2019s actions paint it as an adversary that is not interested in effecting full utilization, conservation, and protection of Montana\u2019s water resources. The Department\u2019s obstinance in this case was both unfortunate and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b686 Fourth, I agree with the Court\u2019s characterization of the Department\u2019s approach to Hohenlohes\u2019 application as \u201cdilatory.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 74. In addition, I observe that the Department\u2019s delay and adversarial attitude forced Hohenlohes to bear a heavy burden. Most applicants in Montana would not have been able to afford to see this process through to the bitter end. I recognize that the Department is underfunded-as nearly every State agency is during hard (and even good) economic times-but the Department\u2019s drawn-out process will prevent all but the most fortunate and persistent from pursuing and litigating change of use applications. I urge the Department to reconsider its approach so that all Montanans may pursue optimum beneficial use of water resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b687 I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-7\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
