We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court improperly deny interest to Bucher on Hughes\u2019s restitution obligation imposed as part of a criminal judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\u00b64 Patrick Harold Hughes (Hughes) recklessly drove a motorcycle down Main Street of Shelby, Montana, in June of 2001. Hughes struck Bucher, a pedestrian, who was walking across the street. Bucher suffered major injuries from the collision, including severing his left leg at the knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">\u00b65 The State of Montana (State) charged Hughes with negligent vehicular assault, driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving without a motorcycle license. Hughes eventually entered a guilty plea to the charge of negligent vehicular assault in 2003. The District Court committed Hughes to the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) for a term of six years, with all time suspended. The court further ordered Hughes to pay Bucher restitution in the amount of $2,718 for Bucher\u2019s medical expenses, and $34,415.70 for his lost wages. Hughes\u2019s restitution obligation totaled $37,133.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">\u00b66 The District Court\u2019s criminal judgment did not require Hughes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>to pay any set monthly payments towards Bucher\u2019s restitution. The judgment only required that Hughes had to pay the full amount of restitution at least ninety days before his release from probation. Hughes abided by the terms of his suspended sentence and sent Bucher regular payments for six years-typically $100 per month-for the restitution owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b67 The State moved to revoke Hughes\u2019s suspended sentence toward the end of his DOC commitment in 2009, however, based upon Hughes\u2019s failure to pay the restitution amount in full. The court held a hearing on June 29, 2009. Hughes\u2019s parole officer testified that Hughes had made reasonable efforts to make restitution payments. The parole officer testified that $100 per month represented the most that Hughes reasonably could pay toward restitution in light of his financial situation and other obligations that included child support. The District Court determined that Hughes had made a good-faith effort to pay the restitution owed to Bucher. The court denied the State\u2019s motion to revoke Hughes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b68 The District Court elected instead to convert the restitution amount to a civil judgment against Hughes. Bucher proposed a civil judgment in the amount of $37,133.70-identical to the original amount of restitution imposed by the court six years earlier as part of the criminal judgment. Bucher argued that the language of \u00a7 46-18-249, MCA, required the District Court to enter the \u201ctotal amount\u201d of the restitution in the civil judgment. Bucher argued further that he was entitled to over $20,000 in interest that had been accruing since the court first had imposed restitution in Hughes\u2019s criminal judgment. Hughes argued that he deserved credit for the $7,170 that he already had paid to Bucher. The court entered a civil judgment against Hughes in the amount of $29,463.70-the amount of unpaid restitution-pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-249, MCA. Bucher appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b69 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 403, \u00b6 6, 353 Mont. 467, 221 P.3d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court improperly deny interest to Bucher on Hughes\u2019s restitution obligation imposed as part of a criminal judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b611 Bucher argues that the District Court\u2019s civil judgment deprives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>him of \u201csubstantial interest which should have begun to accrue on the date of sentencing in June 2003.\u201d Bucher contends that \u00a7 46-18-249, MCA, \u201crequires\u201d the District Court to include the total <em>original </em>amount of the restitution order in the civil judgment-so that Bucher can be awarded interest on the full amount of restitution-even if Hughes already has made substantial payments toward his restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b612  Section 46-18-249, MCA, provides that the total amount <em>\u201cthat a court orders </em>to be paid to a victim may be treated as a civil judgment against the offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46-18-249(1), MCA, requires only that the amount that a district court chooses to order to be paid to a victim may be converted to a civil judgment. Nothing in the statute requires a court to impose the total original amount imposed in a restitution order after a defendant already has made payments for several years. Such a requirement would distort the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b613 Section 46-18-249(3), MCA, contains an offset provision. The statute requires that any restitution paid by the offender to the victim under a restitution order contained in a criminal sentence \u201cmust be set off against any pecuniary loss awarded to the victim in a separate civil action.\u201d To require the District Court to impose a civil judgment in the original amount of $37,133.70 would force Hughes to pay double what he had paid already to Bucher over a period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b614  As noted by the District Court, Bucher had the right to seek a civil judgment against Hughes at any time. A civil judgment would have provided for accrued interest under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-210, -211, MCA. Bucher did not choose to pursue a civil judgment against Hughes. Bucher instead accepted restitution payments as part of the criminal judgment for six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b615  More importantly, nothing in the sentencing and judgment provisions of Title 46, Chapter 18, requires a district court to impose interest on a restitution order contained in a criminal sentence. This Court upheld a district court\u2019s imposition of a 10% interest rate on a restitution obligation in <em>State v. Brewer, </em>1999 MT 269, \u00b6 32, 296 Mont. 453, 989 P.2d 407. The district court in <em>Brewer chose </em>to impose the interest on the restitution order at the time of sentencing. <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 5. The District Court here imposed no interest requirement on Hughes\u2019s restitution obligation in the criminal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b616  Nothing in \u00a7 46-18-249, MCA, requires the District Court to impose interest. The choice to impose interest rests with the discretion of the District Court. <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 32. Further, nothing prevented Bucher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>immediately from seeking to convert the restitution requirement to a civil judgment against Hughes that properly would have protected Bucher\u2019s monetary concern over interest. The District Court correctly interpreted its obligations and exercised its discretion under the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
