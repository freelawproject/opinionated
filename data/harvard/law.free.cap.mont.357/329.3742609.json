Heath was killed and Alicia was injured in the accident. Frank Freyer, Heath\u2019s father, was appointed personal representative of Heath\u2019s estate and conservator of Alicia\u2019s estate. Frank made a claim for benefits under Heath and Vail\u2019s State Farm policy. State Farm paid benefits in accordance with its interpretation of the policy. Frank and Vail both disputed State Farm\u2019s determination of policy benefits. State Farm sought declaratory judgment to determine coverage. The Eighteenth Judicial District Court ruled State Farm had accurately determined and paid benefits. Frank and Vail appeal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting State Farm\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment vis-a-vis the insurer\u2019s interpretation of the policy\u2019s Limits of Liability clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">\u00b63 Heath, Vail, and their then three-month-old daughter, Alicia, were traveling southbound on South 19th Avenue near Bozeman, Montana, on the evening of October 25, 2003. Vail was driving when their car collided with another vehicle driven by Michelle Manning. Vail lost control of her car, it rolled, and Heath was ejected, suffering serious injury. He subsequently died from his injuries. Alicia, who was confined by her car seat, also suffered injuries resulting in over $2,500 for medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">\u00b64 Frank sued Vail and Manning, seeking to recover damages on behalf of Heath\u2019s estate and Alicia. That case is pending before another district court judge. Manning\u2019s insurer paid Heath\u2019s estate $50,000 representing the \u201ceach accident\u201d policy limit in Manning\u2019s policy. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>addition, State Farm paid Heath\u2019s estate the \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limit of $50,000, and separately paid the medical expenses for Alicia. Frank, seeking additional damages, demanded that State Farm pay to Alicia wrongful death and survivorship benefits arising from her father\u2019s death, arguing that these additional benefits should be paid out of the policy\u2019s $50,000 \u201cEach Person\u201d limit for Alicia. Such payment would, when added to the $50,000 paid to Heath\u2019s estate, exhaust the $100,000 \u201cEach Accident\u201d policy limit. The insurer refused, and in October 2007 filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment arguing that it had fulfilled its contractual obligations as they pertained to Heath\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b65 In May 2008, State Farm filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that under the unambiguous terms of the insurance contract, it had fully satisfied its responsibilities to Heath\u2019s estate arising from his death and was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Both Frank and Vail subsequently filed motions for summary judgment as well. On July 9, 2008, the District Court held a hearing on the motions. On May 1,2009, the court issued its order determining that the policy \u201cdefinition of \u2018bodily injury to one person\u2019 \u201d is not ambiguous, contrary to Frank\u2019s argument. The court ruled that \u201c[a]ny claims asserted by Alicia related to the wrongful death or survivorship of her father are restricted by his \u2018Each Person\u2019 policy limit.\u201d It therefore granted State Farm\u2019s motion as to that issue. Frank and Vail appeal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo. <em>Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois, </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597. The interpretation of a contract presents a question of law which we review for correctness. <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6 23, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389. We examine insurance contracts as a whole, with no special deference to specific clauses. We accord the usual meaning to the terms and the words in an insurance contract, and we construe them using common sense. An insurance contract is ambiguous if it is \u201creasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u201d We determine whether an ambiguity exists from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence, but untrained in the law or the insurance business. We construe ambiguities in an insurance contract against the insurer and in favor of extending coverage. <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b67 The Limits of Liability insurance clause at the center of this case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">The amount of bodily injury liability coverage is shown on the declarations page under \u201cLimits of Liability-Coverage A-Bodily Injury, Each Person, Each Accident.\u201d Under \u201cEach Person\u201d is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person. \u201cBodily injury to one person\u201d includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury. Under \u201cEach Accident\u201d is the total amount of coverage, subject to the amount shown under \u201cEach Person\u201d, for all damages due to bodily injury to two or more persons in the same accident. [Emphasis in original removed.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201cphysical bodily injury to a person and sickness, disease or death which results from it. A person does not sustain bodily injury if they suffer emotional distress in the absence of physical bodily injury.\u201d The Freyer policy indicated that the \u201cEach Person\u201d limit is $50,000 and the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limit is $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b68 At issue in this case is the tension between our jurisprudence concerning \u201cderivative\u201d damages, and the language of this particular State Farm policy. Derivative damages are damages that \u201cderive\u201d from another person\u2019s injury or wrongful death. They are typically sought by the spouse or children of the injured or deceased person, and include, among other things, loss of consortium, loss of support, grief, sorrow, and mental anguish. <em>Mikelson v. Montana Rail Link, Inc. </em>2000 MT 111, \u00b6 110, 299 Mont. 348, 999 P.2d 985; <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 9, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381<em>; Allstate v. Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>2008 MT 240, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042. In <em>Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>we held, essentially, that under the policy provision there at issue, the claims of family members for derivative losses sustained as a result of another family member\u2019s bodily injury must be recovered under the \u201ceach person\u201d limit of the insured who sustained bodily injury. <em>Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b69 In the case before us, Alicia is seeking both direct damages as a result of her bodily injury and derivative damages arising from the loss of her father. Setting aside her claim for her own bodily injury which State Farm paid, the question presented is whether Alicia\u2019s claim for damages deriving from Heath\u2019s death should be satisfied out of her $50,000 \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limit rather than being subsumed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201cEach Person\u201d limit already paid to Heath\u2019s estate. The resolution of this question hinges not upon our \u201cderivative damages\u201d jurisprudence, but upon the language contained in the above clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b610 Frank focuses upon the following sentence contained in the insurance policy clause set forth above: \u201c \u2018Bodily injury to one person\u2019 includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by other persons <em>who do not sustain bodily injury. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Frank maintains that this sentence grants Alicia the right to claim both her direct and derivative damages up to the policy\u2019s \u201cEach Person\u201d and \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits because she-unlike one who might be seeking purely derivative damages-actually \u201csustain[ed] bodily injury.\u201d Therefore, she asserts she is entitled to claim \u201cEach Person\u201d benefits under the policy up to $50,000, to include damages associated with her bodily injury as well as damages occasioned by the loss of her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b611 State Farm counters that Heath\u2019s \u201cEach Person\u201d limit of $50,000 encompassed all independent and derivative claims arising out of Heath\u2019s death. In other words, the $50,000 State Farm paid to Heath\u2019s estate after his death covered Heath\u2019s bodily injuries <em>as well as </em>any possible claims by Heath\u2019s family members based on his wrongful death or survivorship. State Farm asserts that the District Court correctly interpreted its policy to mean that \u201c[w]hen someone else sustains bodily injury, that person is entitled to his or her own Each Person limit for his or her own bodily injury, but not for damages that are the consequence of another\u2019s bodily injury.\u201d The insurer further argues that because all potential derivative claims arising as a result of Heath\u2019s death were encompassed within the benefit paid to Heath\u2019s estate, Alicia may not \u201ctransfer\u201d her derivative claims resulting from her father\u2019s death to her own \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limit or the \u201cEach Accident\u201d policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b612 The policy provides a $50,000 \u201cEach Person\u201d limit and a $100,000 \u201cEach Accident\u201d limit. The \u201cEach Person\u201d policy explanation merely states the maximum amount the insurer will pay for one insured\u2019s bodily injury. In the case before us, two people suffered bodily injury-Heath and Alicia. The third sentence of the Limits of Liability clause at issue here applies, by its terms, to derivative claims of persons \u201cwho do not sustain bodily injury.\u201d It is thus inapplicable to Alicia.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b613  The Limits of Liability clause provides that \u201cUnder \u2018Each Accident\u2019 is the total amount of coverage, subject to the amount shown under \u2018Each Person\u2019 for all damages due to bodily injury of two or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>persons in the same accident.\u201d This sentence provides that where two or more persons are injured in the same accident, the maximum amount that will be paid is $100,000, and the phrase \u201csubject to the amount shown under Each Person\u201d provides that no one person can receive more than $50,000. We conclude that the complete and plain language of this Limits of Liability Clause must be interpreted to mean that because two people suffered bodily injury, the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limit of $100,000 is available and the \u201cEach Person\u201d limitation of $50,000 applies separately to Heath\u2019s claim and to Alicia\u2019s claim. Because Alicia suffered a bodily injury, her \u201cEach Person\u201d limit covers both her direct damages for her physical injury and her derivative damages for the loss of her father up to $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b614 To interpret the policy as urged by State Farm would require that we ignore the existence of the clause confining its limitation to those claimants \u201cwho do not sustain bodily injury,\u201d and would thus require us to omit from consideration what has been inserted into the policy. The interpretation we apply here gives effect to <em>all </em>of the provisions in the policy language and, from the viewpoint of the ordinary consumer and Frank, is a reasonable interpretation of the policy language chosen by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b615  Alternatively, if the insurance contract is ambiguous because it is \u201creasonably subject to two different interpretations,\u201d <em>Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703, the construction most favorable to the insured or other beneficiary must prevail, particularly if an ambiguous provision attempts to exclude the liability of the insurer. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 17, 298 Mont. 393, 995 P.2d 460. Under either a plain language or an ambiguous clause analysis, Alicia is entitled to the coverage she seeks. \u00b616 In closing, we emphasize that it is the particular language of the policy before us that drives our decision. It is not our intention here to alter our \u201cderivative claims\u201d jurisprudence as most recently set forth in <em>Wagner-Ellsworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b617 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment in favor of State Farm, and remand for issuance of a declaratory judgment consistent with the interpretation of the policy language set forth above.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b360-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AXY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u00b618 I believe the Court has erred by adopting a policy interpretation offered by Appellants which is nonsensical. Further, I believe this decision directly conflicts with our precedent regarding coverage for : derivative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b619 To illustrate, Alicia\u2019s <em>bodily </em>injury claim was paid by State Farm pursuant to her own \u201cEach Person\u201d limit, which is defined by the same language at issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">Under \u201cEach Person\u201d is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person. \u201cBodily injury to one person\u201d includes all injury and damages to other persons, including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">(Emphasis omitted.) Alicia\u2019s bodily injuries were paid under this provision because it includes and covers her bodily injuries. Obviously, the phrase \u201c[bjodily injury to one person\u201d <em>includes </em>bodily injuries, and, likewise, the \u201cEach Person\u201d limit applies \u201cfor all damages due to bodily injury to one person.\u201d There is no dispute about this. Nonetheless, when analyzing Alicia\u2019s <em>derivative </em>claim, the Court concludes that this identical language applies only to persons who have <em>not </em>sustained a bodily injury, and is thus inapplicable to Alicia. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 12. This interpretation requires, for derivative claims, that the phrase \u201c[bjodily injury to one person\u201d <em>excludes </em>persons who have suffered a bodily injury. I believe this is a nonsensical rendering of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">\u00b620 Pursuant to the above language, the \u201cEach Person\u201d coverage for Heath\u2019s bodily injuries \u201cis the amount of coverage for <em>all damages </em>due to bodily injury to one person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[A]fl damages\u201d due to Heath\u2019s bodily injuries necessarily includes Alicia\u2019s derivative damages. Thus, this provision is consistent with our clear precedent providing that derivative claims are made against the \u201cEach Person\u201d limits of the injured party, here Heath. <em>See e.g. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>2008 MT 240, \u00b6 24, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042; <em>Bain v. Gleason, </em>223 Mont. 442, 451, 726 P.2d 1153, 1158 (1986); <em>cf. Wages v. First Natl. Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2003 MT 309, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 10, 318 Mont. 232, 79 P.3d 1095; <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., </em>280 Mont. 443, 447-49, 930 P.2d 661, 664-65 (1997). I believe the Court\u2019s interpretation ignores this language, permitting Alicia to claim derivative damages through her own \u201cEach Person\u201d limit, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>our precedent. Opinion, \u00b6 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, I believe the Court\u2019s decision subjects our previously clear \u201cderivative claim jurisprudence\u201d to the vagaries of individual policy interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b621 Importantly, the correct result is also provided by statute. As we explained when applying \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA (2003), in <em>WagnerEllsworth, </em>\u201cthe statutory monetary coverage limit specified for a bodily injury to one person applies to others who have suffered losses arising from the bodily injury to that one person.\u201d <em>Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"AYO\">\u00b622 The Court reasons that my position ignores the phrase \u201cwho do not sustain bodily injury\u201d contained within the policy definition of \u201c[b]odily injury to one person.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. However, as the policy states, this definition <em>\u201cincludes all injury and damages to other persons, </em>including emotional distress, sustained by such other persons who do not sustain bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the phrase \u201cwho do not sustain bodily injury\u201d simply clarifies that \u201call injury and damages to other persons\u201d includes nonphysical, emotional injuries as well-not that it applies exclusively to those injuries. <em>See Vassiliu v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., </em>839 A.2d 863, 868 (N. J. 2004) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018includes\u2019 is usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Akca\">\u00b623 When the language in an insurance policy is clear, then it is this Court\u2019s duty to enforce the language as written. <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 36, 292 Mont. 244, 970 P.2d 1054; <em>Canal Ins. Co. v. Bunday, </em>249 Mont. 100, 106, 813 P.2d 974, 978 (1991); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 28-3-401, MCA. I believe the policy is clear and unambiguous, contrary to the Court\u2019s alternative conclusion in \u00b6 15. An ambiguity arises only when an insurance policy is <em>\u201creasonably </em>subject to two different interpretations.\u201d <em>Newbury v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 156, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021 (emphasis added). Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the phrase \u201c[b]odily injury to one person\u201d as excluding a derivative claimant who has sustained a bodily injury is not reasonable and, thus, does not establish an ambiguity. \u201c[W]e determine whether the term is ambiguous by viewing the policy from \u2018the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>business.\u201d\u2019 <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. v. Crumleys, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 34, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948 <em>(quoting Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, 961 P.2d 114). No consumer with average intelligence would conclude that the term \u201c[b]odily injury to one person\u201d fails to include a person with a bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b624 State Farm paid Heath\u2019s estate the \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limit of $50,000, thereby exhausting the available amount of damages \u201cdue to\u201d Heath\u2019s \u201cbodily injury.\u201d State Farm additionally paid the medical expenses Alicia sustained due to her own \u201cbodily injury\u201d under her \u201cEach Person\u201d policy limit. Alicia now seeks to recover wrongful death and survivorship damages, all of which are derivative of Heath\u2019s \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The policy at issue provides coverage for Alicia\u2019s derivative claim, but only up to the limits of Heath\u2019s \u201cEach Person\u201d limit, now exhausted. I would therefore affirm the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\"> The Court also references the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limit in \u00b6 13, but there is no need to analyze that limit here, as it is subordinated under the policy to the \u201cEach Person\u201d limit and, thus, subject to the proper interpretation of the \u201cEach Person\u201d limit. The Court may have been confused by the Appellants\u2019 change in theory in their appellate briefing. They begin by seeking coverage under the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limit (see Frank Freyer\u2019s opening brief, p. 10) and close by seeking coverage under Alicia\u2019s own \u201cEach Person\u201d limit (see Frank Freyer\u2019s reply brief, p. 17-18). The amount of coverage proceeds under either theory is the same for this policy, but the analysis is different.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
