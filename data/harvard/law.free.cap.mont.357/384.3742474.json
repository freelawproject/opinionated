We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b62 Weisweaver contends on appeal that the District Court failed to apply \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, at sentencing and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object. That statute provides guidelines for sentencing nonviolent offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b63 In May, 2009, Weisweaver and Sean Snow arranged to have Weisweaver\u2019s mother in California ship methamphetamine to Snow\u2019s address in Montana. Weisweaver and Snow planned to take the drugs to North Dakota and sell them in the oil fields. Weisweaver was on probation for felony convictions in California and came to Montana after absconding from supervision in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b64 Law enforcement officers in California discovered and tracked the package from Weisweaver\u2019s mother that was being shipped to Snow\u2019s address in Corvallis, Montana. It contained 29 grams of methamphetamine. Cooperating law enforcement officers in Montana made a controlled delivery of the package to Snow and then arrested him and executed a search warrant for the residence. While this was happening, Weisweaver contacted Snow by cell phone and text message wanting to pick up the package. Weisweaver was arrested when he arrived at Snow\u2019s residence to retrieve the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b65 Weisweaver was convicted of the two felonies after a jury trial. His attorney urged the District Court in filed arguments and at sentencing that Weisweaver was a non-violent offender and addict who should be sentenced in lieu of imprisonment to a treatment program under the alternative sentencing provisions of \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA. The State urged that Weisweaver be sentenced to prison as a persistent felony offender based upon the prior convictions in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">\u00b66 The District Court sentenced Weisweaver as a persistent felony offender to concurrent terms of five years for possession and fifteen years with five suspended for conspiracy with intent to distribute. At sentencing the District Court noted that Weisweaver had a prior drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>paraphernalia conviction in 2007 and two felony convictions arising from receiving stolen property in California in 2008. The District Court noted that while on probation for the 2008 offenses, Weisweaver was shot in an incident for which he gave differing accounts. Further, Weisweaver absconded from supervision in California and moved to Montana without permission. While on absconder probation status he conspired with Snow to obtain methamphetamine to sell to pay drug debts. The District Court concluded that there was no doubt that Weisweaver and Snow were \u201cheavily involved in the methamphetamine trade at a time when [Weisweaver] was absconding from felony probation\u201d and that therefore he was \u201cnot entitled to any consideration under the alternative sentencing authority of the statutes.\u201d The District Court determined that while Weisweaver is an addict and could potentially be treated, his condition required lengthy treatment in a secure setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b67 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims contain mixed questions of fact and law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b68 Weisweaver contends on appeal that his attorney should have objected to the sentence or moved for reconsideration asking the District Court to apply \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, and that his failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b69 This Court reviews ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the principles set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). The defendant must establish that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Baca v. State, </em>2008 MT 371, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 474, 197 P.3d 948. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. The defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were within a broad range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Baca, </em>\u00b6 17. The defendant must demonstrate prejudice by showing a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b610 Weisweaver acknowledges on appeal that his sentence was not illegal, but \u201crather, a legal sentence only subject to challenge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>objection.\u201d The State agrees that Weisweaver\u2019s challenge to his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the sentence is appropriate for review on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b611 District courts have discretion under \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA, to sentence persons convicted of felony drug offenses to alternative sentences that do not involve imprisonment. Weisweaver\u2019s attorney filed a sentencing memorandum with the District Court, arguing forcefully that the State\u2019s request for persistent felony offender status be rejected, and that Weisweaver be sentenced under \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA. The attorney argued for \u201ccurative rather than punitive sentencing to a defendant whose drug use amounts to an addiction.\u201d The attorney described the nature and extent of Weisweaver\u2019s addiction, the support he has from his family, the fact that he was a non-violent offender and that he had no significant criminal history arising from drugs. The attorney\u2019s argument concluded with a detailed sentencing request that did not include incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b612 Significantly, the sentencing memorandum cited and quoted at length from <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448, which also involved alternative sentencing. <em>Brendal, </em>\u00b6 23, specifically noted \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, and its relationship to alternative sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b613  Section 46-18-225, MCA, provides that a district court sentencing a nonviolent felony offender must \u201cfirst consider alternatives to imprisonment,\u201d examining the sentencing criteria of subsection (2). That subsection provides that the sentencing judge \u201cshall take into account\u201d a number of factors such as whether public safety requires imprisonment, whether the needs of the offender can be better served in the community, whether there are grounds tending to excuse or justify the offense, whether the defendant acted under strong provocation, whether the offender has made restitution to the victim, whether the offender has a prior criminal conviction, whether the criminal conduct is unlikely to recur, whether the offender\u2019s character and attitude make it unlikely he will commit another crime, whether the offender is likely to respond quickly to correctional treatment, and whether imprisonment will create excessive hardship for the offender or his family. The statute does not preclude sentencing a non-violent offender to prison. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 19, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b614 In prior cases this Court has remanded cases for resentencing where the district courts did not apply \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, when sentencing nonviolent offenders. <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 17, 906 P.2d at 666; <em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 59, 333 Mont. 220, 142 P.3d 809. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>This Court has also implored the district courts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\u201c[ejxplicit, rather than implicit consideration of the criteria makes for a much more meaningful appellate review. In future cases, we strongly encourage district courts, in imposing sentence upon nonviolent offenders, to specifically recognize and address the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 485, 918 P.2d 296, 300 (1996) (quoting <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668). We do so again. \u00b615 The point is not to require some mechanical nod toward \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, but rather to insure that in the appropriate case the district court gives real consideration to whether the particular defendant appearing for sentencing is a good candidate for a sentence other than imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b616 The record shows that the District Court gave adequate consideration to the relevant circumstances of Weisweaver\u2019s situation and to his susceptibility to alternative sentencing. The prosecutor and defense counsel presented their differing assessments of Weisweaver, the sentence each advocated, and the reasons. As noted above, Weisweaver\u2019s sentencing memorandum contained an express reference to \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b617 The District Court gave detailed reasons for the decision to impose incarceration and not an alternative sentence. Weisweaver was convicted of two felonies, including conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. He was eligible for designation and sentencing as a persistent felony offender, subjecting him to a mandatory minimum prison sentence. He was single with no children, unemployed, had no income or assets of consequence. He had a number of misdemeanor convictions and two felony convictions in 2008 in California relating to receiving stolen property. He absconded from probation supervision in California and came to Montana. He was \u201cup to his eyeballs, along with Mr. Snow, in the methamphetamine trade,\u201d intending to sell the drug in the oil fields in North Dakota. He had a long-standing methamphetamine addiction problem. Treatment would be lengthy and \u201cshould be done in a secure setting.\u201d Based upon these reasons, the District Court determined that Weisweaver was not entitled to alternative sentencing consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b618 Weisweaver argues on appeal that if the District Court had taken the criteria of \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, into account, he would have received a more lenient sentence. First, he contends, relying on materials not in the record and which we therefore decline to consider, that his addiction treatment needs could be better served outside of prison. Weisweaver admitted to being a long-term meth addict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>none of the statutory criteria leads to a different treatment conclusion than the one reached by the District Court. Second, he contends that if the criteria had been applied there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that public safety considerations did not warrant imprisonment. However, Weisweaver was a prior felon who had absconded from probation supervision in California. He intended to become a meth dealer by shipping drugs in from California and then taking them to another state to sell. There is every indication that considerations of public safety merited imprisonment. Last, he argues that application of the statutory criteria would have found that his \u201ccriminal conduct was the result of circumstances that are unlikely to recur here in Montana.\u201d To the contrary, Weisweaver\u2019s addiction and his willingness to undertake criminal action to further it all occurred in Montana. By absconding from California he had shown that he was unlikely to do well in a setting outside of prison and that re-offending was probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b619  We find no reason to conclude that any other or further consideration by the District Court of the criteria of \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, would have resulted in any different sentence. Those criteria are designed to prevent incarceration of offenders who do not have a significant criminal history, have a justification for their offense, are unlikely to reoffend, and are not a threat to public safety. Weisweaver does not fit this profile. Any failure of the District Court to expressly consider each of the criteria did not affect Weisweaver\u2019s substantial rights and forms no basis for reversing his sentence. <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 483, 918 P.2d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b620  Last, Weisweaver\u2019s attorney was not ineffective. He urged the District Court to not designate his client a persistent felony offender, and to sentence him under the alternative sentencing provisions. He brought \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, to the attention of the District Court in his sentencing memorandum. Weisweaver has failed to show that counsel\u2019s actions were outside of the broad range of reasonable professional assistance under the circumstances. Further, Weisweaver has failed to show that the absence of a motion to reconsider the sentence bore any chance of success and therefore his substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-7\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
