Harrington in his individual capacity and as representative of the Coalition for Consumer Choice Against 1-164 (Harrington) and Petitioner Montana Consumer Finance Association (MCFA) (Collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) invoke this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to challenge the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination and ballot statements for Initiative No. 164 (1-164). We review the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b62 <em>Do the Attorney General\u2019s ballot and fiscal statements comply with \u00a713-27-312, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b63 1-164 seeks to cap interest rates for certain loans at an annual interest rate of 36 percent. Petitioners challenge the ballot statements and Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination for 1-164 under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA. Section 13-27-316, MCA, constitutes the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for such challenges. 1-164 would affect interest rates on certain lenders. Section 1 proposes a finding that some lenders are charging Montanans more than 400% interest annually. Section 2 would repeal exemptions on interest rate limits and usury provisions for deferred deposit lenders, title lenders, and consumer loan licensees. Section 3 would provide for penalties for violation of the initiative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>under the Consumer Protection Act. Section 4 caps the finance charge on retail installment contracts at 36% annually. Section 5 caps the interest rates for pawnbrokers. Section 6 limits fees for deferred deposit loans to 36% annually and provides for allocation of attorneys fees. Section 7 caps the interest rate at 36% for title loans. Section 8 limits interest rates to 36% for \u201cconsumer loans,\u201d a statutory term that excludes deferred deposit, title, mortgage backed loans, and loans by \u201cregulated lenders.\u201d Section 9 provides that the statutory amendments would take effect on January 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b64 The Attorney General found that the proponents\u2019 proposed ballot statement did not specify the type of loans subject to the limits and contained \u201cpotentially argumentative and misleading detail about federal legislation concerning military personnel and their families.\u201d The Attorney General determined that the statements did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA, and redrafted the ballot statement. The Attorney General requested a fiscal note from the Budget Director. The fiscal note estimated a reduction in licensing and examination revenue of $189,900 per year, totaling $526,800 over the three year analysis period, and no impact to the General Fund. The Attorney General drafted the fiscal statement in accordance with the finding that there would be a fiscal impact if 1-164 were to become law. Section 13-27-312(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b65 The Attorney General\u2019s amended ballot statement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Statement of Purpose</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Under Montana law, deferred deposit (payday) lenders may charge fees equaling one-fourth of the loan, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 300 percent for a 31 day loan or 650 percent for a 14-day loan. Title lenders may charge interest equaling one-fourth of the loan, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 300 percent for a 30 day loan. 1-164 reduces the interest, fees, and charges that payday, title, and retail installment lenders may charge to an annual interest rate of 36 percent. It prohibits businesses from structuring other transactions to avoid the rate limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Fiscal Statement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">1-164 reduces the licenses and examination fee revenue paid to the State because certain lenders may not renew their licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">[] FOR reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges payday, title, and retail installment lenders may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>[] AGAINST reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges payday, title, and retail installment lenders may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">\u00b66 The Secretary of State certified 1-164 in accordance with \u00a7 13-27-308, MCA, on July 19, 2010. Petitioners filed suit under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA. Section 13-27-316(5), MCA, endows this Court with original jurisdiction to hear challenges to ballot statements and constitutes the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for such challenges. Both Harrington and MCFA challenged the ballot statements for failure to comply with the substantive requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. Harrington argued that the statements of purpose and implication failed to \u201cexpress a true and impartial explanation of the proposed measure in plain, easily understood language.\u201d Harrington also challenged the fiscal statement under \u00a7 5-4-205, MCA. MCFA claims that the ballot statement for I-164 does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, because it fails to specifically mention \u201cconsumer loan licensees\u201d in the statement of purpose. MCFA contends that, due to this omission, the statement does not constitute a \u201ctrue and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. MCFA argues that voters would be misled and thus precluded from casting an informed ballot. Harrington requested that this Court adopt an alternative ballot statement that Harrington provided. MCFA requested that this Court overturn the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination and, alternatively, that we strike the term \u201cconsumer loan licensee\u201d from the text of the initiative. Nearly two weeks after filing his initial petition, Harrington filed with this Court a motion for referral to district court for development of the factual record under \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">JURISDICTION AND VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b67 This Court possesses original jurisdiction to review ballot statements for initiative measures and the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA. Section 13-27-316, MCA, constitutes the sole remedy for such challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b68 <em>Do the Attorney General\u2019s ballot and fiscal statements comply with \u00a713-27-312, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b69 We must address as a threshold matter Harrington\u2019s motion for referral to the district court pursuant to \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA. Harrington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>did not raise issues of fact in his initial petition, and no issues of fact exist to preclude this Court from deciding Harrington\u2019s petition. More importantly, \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA, does not apply to Harrington\u2019s petition. Section 3-2-202(3)(b), MCA, requires that the parties to a proceeding under Subsection (3)(a) must \u201ccertify the absence of factual issues or stipulate to and file any factual record necessary\u201d to this Court\u2019s consideration of the challenge. That provision applies to the <em>petitioner\u2019s </em>ballot statements for initiated measures and the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statements for referred measures. Section 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA. Harrington\u2019s petition challenges the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statement for an initiated measure and therefore does not fall into either of the categories specified by \u00a7 3-2~202(a), MCA. Harrington\u2019s petition likewise does not come within the ambit of the statute as a challenge under \u00a7 13-12-316, MCA, to the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination. The legal sufficiency determination applies only to \u201cthe statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA. \u201cLegal Sufficiency\u201d does not encompass \u201cconsideration of the substantive legality of the issue if approved by the voters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Harrington\u2019s petition raises only substantive legal arguments concerning the legality of the ballot statements and underlying initiative. We therefore deny Harrington\u2019s motion for referral and proceed to analyze both petitioners\u2019 claims under \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-312 and - 316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b610  Ballot statements must \u201cexpress the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language and may not be arguments or so written as to create prejudice for or against the issue.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. We have refused to overturn the Attorney General\u2019s version of a ballot statement, provided that the statement meets the statutory requirements. <em>Citizens Right to Recall v. State, </em>2006 MT 192, \u00b6 10, 333 Mont. 153, 142 P.3d 764. This practice reflects the rule followed in other jurisdictions that courts \u201cdo not sit as some kind of literary editorial board.\u201d <em>Shulte v. Long, </em>687 N.W.2d 495, 498 (S.D. 2004). Courts thus will not \u201cinvalidate a summary simply because they believe a better one could be written.\u201d <em>Burgess v. Miller, </em>654 P.2d 273, 276, n. 7 (Alaska 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b611  The Attorney General\u2019s ballot statement meets the requirements of the statute so long as it employs \u201cordinary plain language, explains the general purpose of the issues submitted in language that is true and impartial, and [is] not argumentative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>likely to create prejudice either for or against the issue.\u201d <em>Stop Over Spending Mont. v. State, </em>2006 MT 178, \u00b6 12, 333 Mont. 42, 139 P.3d 788. We review the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statements solely for compliance with \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 13. The statute does not grant petitioners \u201cthe right to the ballot statements of their choosing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">\u00b612  The Attorney General determined that \u201cthe application of a 36% annual interest rate to consumer loans is more straightforward and, based on the public comments received, less salient than the core payday, title, and retail installment issues.\u201d The process of producing a 100 word purpose statement that constitutes a \u201ctrue and impartial explanation\u201d of the measure \u201cinvolves a degree of discretion entrusted to the Attorney General by the Legislature that we will not overturn absent noncompliance with the statute.\u201d <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 18. We acknowledge that the statutory 100 word limit on statements of purpose will inevitably lead to the omission of some provisions that Petitioners would like to include. <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 18. A complete description <em>of every </em>part of the measure cannot be included. <em>Stop Over Spending Mont., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b613  Petitioners argue that the Attorney General\u2019s statements of purpose and implication do not constitute a \u201ctrue and impartial explanation\u201d of what the measure would do because they identify specifically \u201cdeferred deposit lenders,\u201d \u201ctitle lenders,\u201d and \u201cretail installment lenders,\u201d but not \u201cconsumer loan licensees.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. MCFA requests that we remedy this fault by striking the term \u201cconsumer loan licensees\u201d from the body of the measure. Section 13-27-316, MCA, does not give this Court the authority to modify the text of a ballot initiative. The statute does provide, however, that \u201cif this court decides that the ballot statements do not meet the requirements of 13-27-312, it may ... certify to the secretary of state a statement that the court determines will meet the requirements of 13-27-312, MCA.\u201d Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA. We determine therefore that adding the term \u201cconsumer loan licensees\u201d to the statements of purpose and implication and making other minor additions and stylistic changes will be the most effective remedy for the omission of which MCFA complains. The amended ballot statement shall read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">Statement of Purpose</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">Under Montana law, deferred deposit (payday) lenders may charge fees equaling one-fourth of the loan, which, as an annual interest rate could range from 300 percent to 650 percent. Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>lenders may charge similar interest rates. 1-164 reduces the interest, fees, and charges that payday lenders, title lenders, retail installment lenders, and consumer loan licensees may charge to an annual interest rate of 36 percent. It prohibits businesses from structuring other transactions to avoid the rate limit. It also revises statutes applicable to pawn brokers and junk dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">Fiscal Statement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">1-164 reduces the licenses and examination fee revenue paid to the State because certain lenders may not renew their licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">[] FOR reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges payday, title, and retail installment lenders and consumer loan licensees may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">[] AGAINST reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges payday, title, and retail installment lenders and consumer loan licensees may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b614  Harrington next claims that the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA, and that the fiscal statement is argumentative and creates prejudice. The statute requires that the Attorney General shall prepare a fiscal statement if the fiscal note indicates a fiscal impact. Section 13-27-312(3), MCA. The statement must be used on the petition and ballot. <em>Id. </em>The statute does not stipulate what information must be included in the fiscal statement. The Attorney General acted within his discretion in formulating the fiscal statement at issue here. The Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement accurately provides that 1-164 will reduce the license and examination fee revenue paid to the state \u201cbecause certain lenders may not renew their licenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b615 Harrington claims also that the Attorney General failed to formulate the fiscal note and fiscal statement in accordance with the statutory provisions because the Budget Director failed to consult with the Department of Revenue. The Attorney General must order a fiscal note that estimates the effect on revenue if the proposed initiative will affect the State\u2019s revenue, expenditures, or fiscal liability. <em>Id. </em>The fiscal note must estimate, where possible, the dollar amount of the increase or decrease in revenue or expenditures, costs, and long term financial effects. Section 5-4-205, MCA. The fiscal note serves as an objective analysis of the financial impacts of the legislation and may not comment or express an opinion upon the merits of the proposed legislation. <em>Id. </em>The Attorney General must prepare a fiscal statement if the fiscal note indicates that a fiscal impact will occur as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the proposed legislation. The Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement must be included on the petition and on the ballot if the issue is placed on the ballot. Section 13-27-312(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\u00b616  The thrust of Harrington\u2019s argument appears to be that the Department of Revenue constitutes an agency \u201caffected by the ballot issue,\u201d and therefore should have been consulted by the Budget Director pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-312(3), MCA. The Budget Director consulted with the Division of Banking and Finance in the Department of Administration. The fiscal note complies with the requirements of \u00a7 5-4-205, MCA, and the statute requires nothing more. Harrington requests that we include language as to the exact amount of revenue estimated to be lost and the volume of such loans processed in the state each year. This information falls outside the statutory requirements under these circumstances. The fact that the Attorney General failed to include this information in the fiscal statement \u201cdoes not prevent a voter from casting \u2018an intelligent and informed ballot.\u2019\u201d <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b617  Petitioners\u2019 arguments as to prejudice are similarly unavailing. Ballot statements must \u201ceschew advocacy-argument-for or against the proposal\u2019s adoption.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Fairness and Acct. in Ins. Reform v. Greene, </em>886 P.2d 1338 (Ariz. 1994)). Petitioners fail to point to specific provisions in either the statement of implication or the fiscal statement that violate this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b618 Resolution of these matters has been unnecessarily complicated by the language of the revised statutes at issue. The intent of \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, is to provide - via an original proceeding in this Court - the \u201csole remedy\u201d for challenges to ballot statements or the Attorney General\u2019s opinion as to legal sufficiency. The statute\u2019s confused and internally contradictory language, however, threatens to frustrate the will of voters who have expressed their intent that a measure appear on the ballot. Section 13-27-316, MCA, applies to statements that have been approved by the Attorney General. Such statements, of necessity, have already been circulated for voter signatures. In particular, \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA, contemplates challenges to ballot statements \u201capproved by the attorney general.\u201d The statute then requires, however, that statements revised by this Court and certified to the secretary of state must be placed \u201con the petition for circulation <em>and </em>on the official ballot.\u201d Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA (emphasis added). Statements that have been approved by the Attorney General have of necessity already completed the circulation process. Compliance with all provisions of subsection (3)(c)(ii) is thus rendered impossible in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cases such as the present when a party brings a challenge under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, mere weeks before the statement would be placed on the ballot. Notwithstanding this and other internal inconsistencies, we have attempted to apply the statute in accordance with the obvious legislative intent and with due consideration for the expressed will of Montana\u2019s voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b619  We decline Petitioners\u2019 request to overrule the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination for 1-164, or to tamper with the text of the initiative itself. <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 29. The Attorney General acted within his considerable discretion in drafting the ballot statements and fiscal statement for 1-164. We determine, however, that MCFA\u2019s complaint as to the omission of the term \u201cconsumer loan licensees\u201d from the statement of purpose is valid. We therefore certify to the Secretary of State the ballot statement set forth at \u00b6 13, which we have determined will meet the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">DATED this 17th day of August, 2010.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b272-7\">JUSTICE MORRIS</author>\n<p id=\"Ayg6\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b620 Winston Churchill observed in a speech before the House of Commons in 1947 that \u201c[djemocracy is the worst form of government except for all of those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\u201d Direct democracy removes the filter of the voters\u2019 elected representatives and takes the audacious step of posing questions directly to the voters. Montana voters originally adopted the initiative process in 1906 as part of the incomplete effort to cast aside the \u201ccopper collar\u201d that bedeviled Montana politics for much of the 20th century.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b621 Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitutional Convention considered carefully the issue of whether to continue this experiment in direct democracy. The delegates opted to include in the Constitution an express right of the people to amend the Constitution or enact laws through the initiative process. Mont. Const., art. Ill, Sec. 4. This considered decision by the delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention followed more than 65 years of experience with the initiative system in place. The people\u2019s right to constitutional and statutory initiatives represents \u201ca unique and important retained power.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Montana Sch. Bd. v. Waltermire, </em>224 Mont. 296, 299, 729 P.2d 1297, 1299 (1986). Its inclusion in the Constitution \u201cemphasizes the degree of control the people desired to retain\u201d over changes to the Constitution or statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u00b622 The initiative process allows citizens to put before voters issues that their elected representatives either have chosen not to address, or more likely, have been unable to resolve. These issues range from the enlightened, such as Constitutional Amendment 3, commonly known as the coal severance tax trust fund; to the controversial, Constitutional Amendment 64, the term limits initiative, Initiative 143, restricting trophy hunting on game farms, Initiative 122, protection of water quality from metal mines, and Initiative 125, prohibiting corporate contributions to ballot issue campaigns; to the banal, Constitutional Amendment 25, a provision that added the public retirement system to the State\u2019s unified investment program. The initiative process relies on the wisdom of the voters to separate sound policy proposals from the fad of the month-type proposals. For better or worse, the right to amend the Constitution or enact laws by initiative has served the people of Montana for more than a century.</p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">\u00b623 The Dissent oozes with hostility toward this initiative process. The Dissent editorializes about the knowledge, or lack thereof, that \u201cmost voters\u201d possess with respect to a policy proposal. \u00b6 65, n.4. The Dissent fails to inform where it gains its insights into the minds of \u201cmost voters.\u201d I believe these questions best left to pollsters and political scientists.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">\u00b624 This same lack of confidence in the knowledge of the voters animates the Dissent\u2019s \u201cbait-and-switch fraud\u201d argument. The Dissent suggests that this Court\u2019s minor revisions to the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statement could lead to certain voters unwittingly signing a petition in support of an initiative that they otherwise would not support. This argument ignores the fact that the law requires all petitions for signatures to include a statement of purpose, statements of implication, fiscal impact statement, if required, <em>and </em>a complete copy of the proposed initiative. Sections 13-27-202 and -312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ATL\">\u00b625 The statement of purpose represents only a summary of the proposed initiative. Interested voters have the opportunity to read the entire petition, if they choose, before deciding whether to sign the petition. The legislature empowered the Court to amend the ballot statement to reflect more accurately the initiative\u2019s intent. The legislature did not authorize the Court to amend the language of the proposed initiative itself. The Court has not changed one jot of the language of the proposed initiative. This safeguard protects against any effort to \u201cmislead the voters\u2019-whether that effort be made by the Attorney General, the initiative proponents, or any other party that the Dissent assumes may seek to dupe the unwary citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00b626 The Dissent next suggests that the Court favors a party to this dispute. \u00b6 67, n.5. The Dissent implies that the Court has disregarded its constitutional oath of office by taking sides in a case. Mont. Const., art. Ill, Sec. 3. I take seriously my responsibility to decide cases without bias or partiality to any party. Canons of Jud. Ethics, Rule 2.2. I am sure that my colleagues do the same. In fact, this Court scrupulously has avoided taking sides in this dispute. The Court simply has sought to provide a remedy to this dispute in a manner that complies with the statutory scheme developed by the legislature. The legislative remedy allows this Court the ability to revise the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose to reflect more accurately the intent of the proposed initiative. Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b627 The Court has elected to pursue this remedy. In choosing an appropriate remedy, the Court must be guided by principle that \u201cinitiative and referendum provisions of the Constitution should be broadly construed to maintain the maximum power in the people.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Cooney, </em>265 Mont. 406, 411, 877 P.2d 486, 488 (1994); <em>Chouteau County v. Grossman, </em>172 Mont. 373, 378, 563 P.2d 1125, 1128 (1977). The maximum power in the people requires that the people be given the opportunity to vote on an initiative when the requisite number of voters have signed petitions to qualify a measure for the ballot and the proponents of the measure have complied with the statutory scheme put in place by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b628 The Dissent snickers over the Court\u2019s use of the term \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d to describe the system enacted by the 2007 Legislature to address the process by which an initiative may qualify for the ballot and by which a party may challenge that process. The snickering infers that the statutes enacted to address this process represent some sort of con game designed to trap unwary voters. The Dissent suggests that proponents of initiatives could avoid these traps for the unwary by getting their acts together early in the process. The Dissent proposes that initiative proponents could gather sufficient signatures months in advance of the deadline, obtain all of the necessary clearances from the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, defend the matter before this Court, and then, if the Court decided to revise slightly the ballot statement, collect the thousands of signatures all over again before the statutory deadline. This proposal would gut the people\u2019s constitutional right to initiative. The fact that Montana voters face only a handful of proposed constitutional and statutory initiatives at each election cycle reflects the difficulty of qualifying a proposed initiative for the ballot. The Dissent\u2019s proposal would eliminate even these handfuls of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>proposals from consideration by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b629 The Dissent finally blithely recommends that the people demand that their elected representatives regulate interest rates if \u201csuch a public hullabaloo\u201d actually exists over these interest rates. \u00b6 73. The people of Montana ensured that they would not be without power to address issues of policy-whether accompanied by a \u201cpublic hullabaloo\u201d or simply supported by a group of concerned people-when they adopted the initiative system. The delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention confirmed the wisdom of this approach. The people need not rely on their elected representatives to enact a law that would restrict interest rates charged by certain lenders. Article II, Section 3 of our Constitution enshrines that right. I would not undermine this power. I support the Court\u2019s remedy to revise the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statement for 1-164 to reflect more accurately the Initiative\u2019s intent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-5\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b275-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A_Zz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">I. Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u00b630 \u201c <em>\u2018[T]here are few evils which can be afflicted by strict adherence to the law so great as that which is done by an habitual disregard, by any department of the government, of a plain requirement of that instrument from which it derives its authority, and which ought, therefore, to be scrupulously observed and obeyed.\u2019 \u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">\u00b631 The <em>only </em>action that this Court is statutorily authorized to take in the present cases is clear. \u201cIf, upon review, the attorney general or the supreme court revises the petition form or ballot statements, any petitions signed prior to the revision are void.\u201d Section 13-27-316(4), MCA (emphasis added). Here, the Court has revised the ballot statements. Accordingly, \u201cany petitions signed prior to the revision are void.\u201d Section 13-27-316(4), MCA. And without valid petitions, the ballot issue may not appear on the ballot. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-27-307, -308, MCA; <em>see also e.g. </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(iii), MCA. That is the holding we are required to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b632 Regardless that this result may seem harsh to some, it is the result mandated under the initiative procedures adopted by the people through their elected representatives. This Court is required to scrupulously observe and obey those procedures. We are not at liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to rewrite them, nor is it our prerogative to disregard them. Ahd there is no \u201cobvious legislative intent\u201d justifying what the Court has done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b633 In this regard, it should be noted that the timetable laid out by the Legislature is not as \u201cimpossible\u201d as the Court majority would have us believe. That timetable proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">1. A proponent of a ballot issue first submits the proposed issue to the Secretary of State, together with draft ballot statements (the statement of purpose, fiscal statement, and statements of implication). Section 13-27-202(1), MCA. The Secretary of State forwards a copy of the proposed issue and statements to the Legislative Services Division and, thereafter, to the Attorney General. Section 13-27-202(1), (4), MCA. The Legislative Services Division is given 14 days to complete its review, \u00a7 13-27-202(2)(b), MCA, and the Attorney General is given 30 days to complete his review, \u00a7 13-27-312(8)(a), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">2. Once approved, the proponent may circulate petitions for the purpose of signature gathering starting one year before the deadline for filing the signed petitions with county election officials. Section 13-27-202(1), (5)(b), MCA. Signed petitions may be submitted to county election officials as early as nine months, but no later than four weeks, before the deadline for filing the petitions with the Secretary of State. Section 13-27-301(1), MCA. The deadline for filing the petitions with the Secretary of State is the third Friday of the fourth month prior to the election (here, July 16, 2010). Section 13-27-104, MCA. Thus, the proponent of a ballot issue for the November 2, 2010 ballot could theoretically start circulating petitions as of June 16, 2009, and submitting signed petitions to county election officials as of October 16,2009, but no later than June 16, 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">3. County election officials are required to verify names and signatures within four weeks after receiving the sheets or sections of a petition. Section 13-27-303(1), MCA. The petitions are then forwarded to the Secretary of State. Section 13-27-304, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">4. Once a sufficient number of signatures have been filed with the Secretary of State, he or she must \u201cimmediately\u201d certify to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Governor that the completed petition has been officially filed. Section 13-27-308, MCA. That occurred in the present case on July 19, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\">5. An opponent then has ten days in which to file a challenge to the ballot statements or the legal sufficiency of the petitions. Section 13-27-316(2), MCA. This Court must give the case \u201cprecedence\u201d and render a decision \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(i), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b634 If we determine that the petitions are not legally sufficient, then the proponent may start over using legally sufficient petitions. Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(iii), MCA. Of course, the proponent remains subject to the deadline on submitting the petitions. But it is not necessarily \u201cimpossible\u201d to comply with the foregoing timetable. To be sure, it may be \u201cimpossible\u201d to resubmit the ballot issue if the proponents did not commence the initiative process soon enough or if they delayed in submitting the signed petitions to the county election officials. Under those circumstances, there may not be sufficient time to recirculate new petitions if the signed ones are determined to be void. But that is the reality of election deadlines, and it is the risk of which the proponents are on notice when they start the process late. If time runs out, the fault can hardly be placed on the courts. More to the point, it is not justification for this Court to flout unambiguous statutory directives in a proactive effort to rescue the proponents from their own lack of diligence or inability to obtain signatures and submit petitions in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b635 Nevertheless, this Court has determined to save 1-164 from the doom to which it unquestionably is destined under the statutory scheme. To that end, the Court employs a \u201ccafeteria-style\u201d approach to statutory application, picking and choosing only that statutory language which serves to achieve its goal and rejecting or simply ignoring those provisions which get in the way. I cannot agree with this brand of decision-making. Absent our overruling the statutes based on constitutional authority, we are required to apply them as written. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. Doing so here, I would hold as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">1. If this Court has jurisdiction over the present ballot challenges, that jurisdiction is set forth in \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA, and the parties were required to make the certification or stipulation mandated by \u00a7 3-2-202(3)(b)(i), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">2. On the merits of MCFA\u2019s challenge, the ballot statements contained on the circulated and signed petitions are void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">3. This Court has no authority to place statements on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>November ballots that are <em>different </em>from the statements on the circulated petitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">I address these points in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"As\">A. Article VII, Section 2</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b636 Jurisdiction is the power and authority of a court to hear and decide the case or matter before it. <em>State v. Martz, </em>2008 MT 382, \u00b6 21, 347 Mont. 47, 196 P.3d 1239. This power and authority is conferred on courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution. <em>Martz, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b637 Because jurisdiction involves the fundamental power and authority of a court to determine and hear an issue, a court may address the question of its jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>See Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. In fact, courts have an \u201cindependent obligation\u201d to determine whether jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party, and a court which in fact lacks jurisdiction cannot acquire it by consent of the parties. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b638 Article VII, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution delineates the parameters of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. It states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">(1) The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction and may issue, hear, and determine writs appropriate thereto. It has original jurisdiction to issue, hear, and determine writs of habeas corpus and such other writs as may be provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">(2) It has general supervisory control over all other courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">(3) It may make rules governing appellate procedure, practice and procedure for all other courts, admission to the bar and the conduct of its members. Rules of procedure shall be subject to disapproval by the legislature in either of the two sessions following promulgation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">(4) Supreme court process shall extend to all parts of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADH\">\u00b639 Nowhere in Article VII, Section 2, is there authority for this Court to entertain an original proceeding concerning a ballot challenge. Our original jurisdiction is limited. We have original jurisdiction \u201cto issue, hear, and determine writs of habeas corpus and such other writs as may be provided by law.\u201d The present proceeding does not involve a writ. Hence, there being no constitutional source for this Court to exercise original jurisdiction over a non-writ proceeding, the statutes granting us such jurisdiction are, necessarily, null and void. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 52 (\u201cJurisdiction is conferred on the courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted <em>pursuant to the </em>Constitution.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>We must dismiss these cases sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">B. Section 3-2-202(3), MtCA</p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">i. The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b640 The Court nevertheless proceeds on the premise that it has jurisdiction.over this proceeding. The statutes governing this Court\u2019s jurisdiction are set out in Title 3, chapter 2, part 2, MCA (which is titled \u201cSupreme Court Jurisdiction\u201d). The jurisdictional provisions specific to review of ballot statements are contained in \u00a7 3-2-202(3), MCA, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">(a) The supreme court has original jurisdiction to review the petitioner\u2019s ballot statements for initiated measures and the attorney general\u2019s ballot statements for referred measures and the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in an action brought pursuant to 13-27-316.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">(b) (i) In an original proceeding under subsection (3)(a), the petitioner and the attorney general shall certify the absence of factual issues or shall stipulate to and file any factual record necessary to the supreme court\u2019s consideration of the petitioner\u2019s ballot statements or the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(ii) If the parties to an original proceeding under subsection (3)(a) fail to make the certification or stipulation required by subsection (3)(b)(i), the supreme court shall refer the proceeding to the district court in the county of residence of the lead petitioner for development of a factual record and an order that addresses the issues provided in 13-27-316(3)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b641 Beginning with subsection (3)(a), this Court \u201chas original jurisdiction to review [1] the petitioner\u2019s ballot statements for initiated measures and [2] the attorney general\u2019s ballot statements for referred measures and [3] the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in an action brought pursuant to 13-27-316.\u201d This case falls into the third category: a challenge to \u201cthe attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in an action brought pursuant to 13-27-316.\u201d MCFA\u2019s and Harrington\u2019s petitions state that they are brought under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, and the petitions specifically challenge the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination for 1-164.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b642 Next, there is no dispute that the parties have failed to make the certification or stipulation required by subsection (3)(b)(i)-i.e., they have not certified the absence of factual issues or stipulated to and filed any factual record. The Attorney General asserts that the development of a factual record in district court would be \u201cminimal,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and the Court opines that \u201cno issues of fact exist to preclude this Court from\u201d rendering a decision. But that is beside the point. The statute states that the petitioner and the Attorney General \u201cshall certify the absence of factual issues or shall stipulate to and file any factual record necessary to the supreme court\u2019s consideration of... the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination.\u201d Section 3-2-202(3)(b)(i), MCA. The statute does <em>not </em>say that the certification or stipulation need be filed only if the Attorney General believes the development of a factual record in district court would be more than \u201cminimal\u201d or if this Court happens to perceive some factual issues. Rather, it says that the certification or stipulation \u201cshall\u201d be filed. Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b643 Lastly, when the parties fail to abide by this requirement, as is the case here, this Court\u2019s only course of action is statutorily mandated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">If the parties to an original proceeding under subsection (3)(a) fail to make the certification or stipulation required by subsection (3)(b)(i), <em>the supreme court shall refer the proceeding to the district court in the county of residence of the lead petitioner for development of a factual record and an order that addresses the issues provided in 13-27-316(3).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Section 3-2-202(3)(b)(ii), MCA (emphasis added). Honoring this unambiguous statutory mandate, we are required to refer this proceeding to a district court for the purposes stated in \u00a7 3-2-303(3)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">ii. The Court\u2019s Workaround</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b644 As a practical matter, if this proceeding were referred to a district court, there would not be time to resolve MCFA\u2019s and Harrington\u2019s challenges before the Secretary of State\u2019s August 19,2010 deadline for certifying the candidates and ballot issues for the November 2 ballot. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-12-201(1), MCA. To get around this problem, the Court declares that \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA, does not apply to these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b645 The first obvious problem with this approach is that if \u00a7 3-2-202, MCA, does not apply to these cases, then we do not have jurisdiction. As noted, \u00a7 3-2-202(3), MCA, is the statute which purports to confer \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d on this Court to review ballot statements. No other provision does so. The Court asserts that \u00a7 13-27-316(5), MCA, \u201cendows\u201d this Court with \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d to hear challenges to ballot statements, but this is pure fantasy. Section 13-27-316(5), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">An original proceeding in the supreme court under this section is the exclusive remedy for a challenge to the petitioner\u2019s ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>statements, as approved by the attorney general, or the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination. A ballot issue may not be invalidated under this section after the secretary of state has certified the ballot under 13-12-201.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">It is self-evident that this is not an affirmative \u201cendowment\u201d of jurisdiction. Rather, it is a reference to the \u201coriginal proceeding\u201d which is established by the grant of \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7 3-2-202(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b646 The second problem with the Court\u2019s approach is that it involves a blatant remaking of Harrington\u2019s and MCFA\u2019s challenges. Again, this Court \u201chas original jurisdiction to review [1] the petitioner\u2019s ballot statements for initiated measures and [2] the attorney general\u2019s ballot statements for referred measures and [3] the attorney general\u2019s legal sufficiency determination in an action brought pursuant to 13-27-316.\u201d Section 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA. Focusing on the third category, the question becomes whether Harrington and MCFA challenge the Attorney General\u2019s \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d determination and whether their action is brought pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA. Section 13-27-316(2), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">If the opponents of a ballot issue believe that the petitioner ballot statements approved by the attorney general do not satisfy the requirements of 13-27-312 or believe that the attorney general was incorrect in determining that the petition was legally sufficient, they may, within 10 days of the date of certification to the governor that the completed petition has been officially filed, file an original proceeding in the supreme court challenging the adequacy of the statement or the attorney general\u2019s determination and requesting the court to alter the statement or overrule the attorney general\u2019s determination concerning the legal sufficiency of the petition. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b647 The Court concedes that Harrington and MCFA \u201cchallenge the ballot statements and Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination for 1-164 under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA.\u201d In this regard, \u201clegal sufficiency\u2019 is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">As used in this part, \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d means that the petition complies with <em>statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors. </em>Review of the petition for legal sufficiency does not include consideration of the substantive legality of the issue if approved by the voters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGe\">Section 13-27-312(7), MCA (emphasis added). One of the so-called \u201cstatutory... requirements governing submission of the proposed issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to the electors\u201d is set forth in subsection (4) of the same statute: \u201cThe ballot statements must express the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language and may not be arguments or written so as to create prejudice for or against the issue.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. The Attorney General is specifically instructed to ensure that this \u201cstatutory requirement\u201d is met. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-312(1), MCA (\u201c[T]he attorney general ... shall determine whether the ballot statements comply with the requirements of this section.\u201d). Here, Harrington and MCFA challenge the Attorney General\u2019s determination that I-164\u2019s statement of purpose, fiscal statement, and statements of implication are legally sufficient under \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA. Thus, Harrington and MCFA do, in fact, challenge the Attorney General\u2019s determination that the petition complies with the \u201crequirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b648 According to the Court, however, Harrington and MCFA raise an improper challenge to the \u201csubstantive legality\u201d of 1-164, rather than to the Attorney General\u2019s determination of legal sufficiency. This is an outright fabrication. Indeed, the Court cannot point to a single sentence in MCFA\u2019s petition or Harrington\u2019s petition challenging the \u201csubstantive legality\u201d of 1-164. They do not contend that 1-164, if approved by the voters, would constitute a taking of property without just compensation. They do not contend that 1-164, if approved by the voters, would violate the Equal Protection Clause. They do not contend that 1-164, if approved by the voters, would deprive lenders of property without due process of law. They do not contend that 1-164, if approved by the voters, would constitute unconstitutional special legislation. In short, neither MCFA nor Harrington lodges any challenge whatsoever to \u201cthe substantive legality of [1-164] if approved by the voters.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b649 Rather, their petitions clearly and unmistakably challenge the Attorney General\u2019s determination that the ballot statements comply with the statutory requirements governing submission of 1-164 to the electors. The first sentence of MCFA\u2019s Summary of Argument states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">MCFA contends that I-164\u2019s ballot statements do not meet the requirements of section 13-27-312, MCA. As a result, the statements do not meet the statutory requirements for submitting the proposed issue to the electors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">And the first sentence of MCFA\u2019s analysis beginning on page 6 of its petition states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">MCFA initiated this original proceeding pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>13-27-316, MCA, for the purpose of challenging the adequacy of I-164\u2019s ballot statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">MCFA then goes on, over four pages, to explain why, in its view, the ballot statements do not satisfy \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA. Finally, at the conclusion of its argument, MCFA asks this Court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">find that 1-164 ballot statements do not meet the requirements of section 13-27-312, MCA, and consequently do not meet the statutory requirements for submitting the proposed issue to the electors, and overrule any determination that the ballot issue is legally sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Harrington\u2019s petition is to the same effect. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">This is an action for judgment arising from the manner in which the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Montana, erroneously prepared and approved statements and made a legal sufficiency determination for a ballot initiative, 1-164 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ1\">Harrington further asserts that the statement of purpose, fiscal statement, and statements of implication approved by the Attorney General do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA-i.e., they do not \u201cexpress the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language,\u201d and they are \u201cwritten so as to create prejudice for... the issue.\u201d Harrington then goes on to propose alternate ballot statements, something he would not have to bother with if he were truly raising a challenge to the \u201csubstantive legality\u201d of the measure as the Court claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27~316(3)(b), MCA <em>(\u201cIf the proceeding requests modification of ballot statements, </em>an action brought under this section must state how the petitioner\u2019s ballot statements approved by the attorney general do not satisfy the requirements of 13-27-312 and must propose alternate ballot statements that satisfy the requirements of 13-27-312.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b650 Even the Court concedes elsewhere in its Order that MCFA and Harrington \u201cinvoke this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to challenge the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination and ballot statements for Initiative No. 164\u201d and that MCFA and Harrington \u201cchallenge the ballot statements and Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination for 1-164 under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA.\u201d Indeed, if their challenges were to the substantive legality of 1-164, and not to the Attorney General\u2019s determination under \u00a7 13-27-312(7), MCA, that \u201cthe petition complies with statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors,\u201d then there would be no need to rewrite the ballot statements, as the Court does. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u00b651 Accordingly, these cases fall squarely within the third category of \u00a7 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA. Yet, the parties have failed to make the certification or stipulation required by \u00a7 3-2-202(3)(b)(i), MCA. Consequently, this Court is required to refer this proceeding to a district court. The Court\u2019s refusal to do so only demonstrates that it is willing to ignore statutory mandates and to distort Petitioners\u2019 arguments in order to reach a desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">III. The Merits of MCFA\u2019s Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">\u00b652 I agree with the Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the statement of purpose and statements of implication adopted by the Attorney General do not \u201cexpress the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. I reach this conclusion for the reasons argued by MCFA, which I explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b653 Initially, however, I note the Attorney General\u2019s threshold argument that MCFA\u2019s petition is deficient because MCFA has not proposed alternate ballot statements. This argument is totally without merit. For one thing, alternate ballot statements are required only if the challenger \u201crequests modification of ballot statements\u201d in the action before this Court. Section 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA. And here, MCFA does not request modification of the ballot statements. Rather, MCFA seeks to invalidate the 1-164 petitions and 1-164 itself on the ground that the ballot statements contained on the petitions were deficient. Thus, MCFA was not required to propose alternate statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b654 Furthermore, if the language of the 1-164 petitions is in fact invalid, no proposed alternate language could save them now. The petitions have already been circulated and signed. Those who signed the petitions have already read the deficient statement of purpose and deficient statements of implication. It is too late to recirculate the petitions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-12-201(1), 13-27-104, MCA. The Attorney General fails to explain what possible purpose could be served at this point by proposing alternate language. And there is no statutory requirement that an opponent do so under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b655 Turning then to the merits of the issue, the fundamental problem with the language of the petitions is quite apparent; and it is perplexing, therefore, that the Attorney General did not recognize and remedy this problem, prior to the petitions\u2019 being circulated, in his review of the proposed language and his consultation with parties on both sides of the issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-312(1), (2), MCA. 1-164 changes the law with respect to <em>five </em>categories of lenders/businesses. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the initiative applies to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\">1. So-called \u201cretail installment lenders\u201d (the term used in I-164\u2019s statement of purpose). Such entities are regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 2, MCA (the Montana Retail Installment Sales Act). They include \u201ca person who sells goods or furnishes services to a retail buyer in a written retail installment contract or written retail installment transaction.\u201d Section 31-l-202(l)(p), MCA. Sections 3 and 4 of 1-164 amend \u00a7\u00a7 31-1-203 and -241, MCA, respectively, to limit the permissible finance charge retail installment lenders may charge to 36% per annum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">2. Pawnbrokers, who are regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 4, MCA. Section 5 of 1-164 amends \u00a7 31-1-401, MCA, to prohibit pawnbrokers from engaging in certain financial activities (such as cashing or advancing money for a postdated or deferred presentment check in exchange for a fee or finance charge), unless the pawnbroker is licensed as a consumer loan licensee, deferred deposit loan licensee, or title loan licensee. Thus, if 1-164 passed, pawnbrokers would be subject to the same 36% interest rate cap to which these other entities are subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">3. Deferred deposit (payday) lenders, who are regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 7, MCA (the Montana Deferred Deposit Loan Act). Sections 2 and 6 of 1-164 amend \u00a7\u00a7 31-1-112 and -722, MCA, respectively, to limit the permissible finance charge deferred deposit lenders may charge to 36% per annum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">4. Title lenders, who are regulated under Title 31, chapter 1, part 8, MCA (the Montana Title Loan Act). Sections 2 and 7 of I-164 amend \u00a7\u00a7 31-1-112 and -817, MCA, respectively, to limit the permissible finance charge title lenders may charge to 36% per annum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">5. Consumer loan licensees, who are regulated under Title 32, chapter 5, MCA (the Montana Consumer Loan Act). Such entities are licensed to offer or extend credit to an individual primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 32-5-102(2)(a), MCA. They do not include deferred deposit lenders, title lenders, and certain other regulated lenders such as banks and credit unions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 32-5-102(2)(b), -103(5), MCA. Sections 2 and 8 of 1-164 amend \u00a7\u00a7 31-1-112 and 32-5-301, MCA, respectively, to limit the permissible finance charge consumer loan licensees may charge to 36% per annum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b656 Two of these affected entities are not disclosed to voters in the statement of purpose and the statements of implication adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Attorney General and presented on the face of the petitions (one of which is included as an exhibit at the end of this Dissent). The Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose, fiscal note, and statements of implication inform voters that 1-164 does the following (with emphases added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">Under Montana law, <em>deferred deposit (payday) lenders </em>may charge fees equaling one-fourth of the loan, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 300 percent for a 31-day loan or 650 percent for a 14-day loan. <em>Title lenders </em>may charge interest equaling one-fourth of the loan, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 300 percent for a 30-day loan. 1-164 reduces the interest, fees, and charges that <em>payday, title, </em>and <em>retail installment lenders </em>may charge to an annual interest rate of 36 percent. It prohibits businesses from structuring other transactions to avoid the rate limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">1-164 reduces the license and examination fee revenue paid to the State because certain lenders may not renew their licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">[ ] FOR reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges payday, <em>title, </em>and <em>retail installment lenders </em>may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">[ ] AGAINST reducing the annual interest, fees, and charges <em>payday, title, </em>and <em>retail installment lenders </em>may charge on loans to 36 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Deferred deposit (payday) lenders, title lenders, and retail installment lenders are identified. But, as MCFA correctly points out, the statement of purpose and the statements of implication make no mention whatsoever of consumer loan licensees or pawnbrokers, even though these entities are covered and affected by the initiative. Voters are not told that 1-164 reduces the interest, fees, and charges that <em>consumer loan licensees </em>may charge to an annual interest rate of 36 percent. In this regard, it must be recalled that the statutory scheme clearly distinguishes consumer loans from deferred deposit loans, title loans, and retail installment transactions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 31-l-202(l)(m)-(o), 32-5-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b657 The Attorney General is required by law to review a proposed ballot issue for legal sufficiency-i.e., whether the petition \u201ccomplies with statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d Section 13-27-312(1), (7), MCA. Among other statutory requirements, perhaps the most basic is that the statement of purpose and the statements of implication \u201cmust express the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>in plain, easily understood language.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. Although the summary preceding an initiative need not contain a complete catalog or index of all provisions -within the initiative, the statement of purpose must \u201cprovide fair notice of the content of the proposed amendment so that the voter will not be misled as to its purpose, and can cast an intelligent and informed ballot.\u201d <em>Citizens Right to Recall v. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 192, \u00b6 16, 333 Mont. 153, 142 P.3d 764 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">\u00b658 Here, MCFA contends, and I agree, that the statement of purpose adopted by the Attorney General \u201cnot only fails to specifically mention Montana consumer loan licensees, but does not even provide a clue that this licensee is a subject of the initiative.\u201d The statement of purpose identifies \u201cpayday, title, and retail installment lenders\u201d only. It does not identify any other type of lender, and there is no language that could reasonably be understood to include consumer loan licensees and pawnbrokers within I-164\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b659 Consequently, the statement of purpose and the statements of implication on the face of the 1-164 petitions submitted to voters for signatures are deficient and invalid. They do not \u201cexpress the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language.\u201d Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. Nor do they provide fair notice of the content of the proposed initiative, so that the voter will not be misled as to its purpose and can make an intelligent decision of whether to sign the petition. <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 16. They are, in fact, misleading in their suggestion that 1-164 applies only to \u201cpayday, title, and retail installment lenders,\u201d when it actually applies to pawnbrokers and consumer loan licensees as well. <em>Cf. Sawyer Stores v. Mitchell, </em>103 Mont. 148, 163-64, 62 P.2d 342, 349-50 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b660 The Attorney General argues, first, that there is a \u201cscarce\u201d 100-word limit on a statement of purpose, <em>see </em>\u00a7 13-27-312(2)(a), as if to suggest that some of the parties who will be affected by a proposed ballot initiative may be omitted or ignored in order to satisfy this word limit. This contention is not even remotely persuasive. A statement of purpose is supposed to be a \u201ctrue\u201d explanation of the proposed ballot issue. Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. When the Attorney General provides a discrete list of three specific entities to which 1-164 specifically applies (\u201cpayday, title, and retail installment lenders\u201d), the logical inference is that these entities are the <em>only </em>entities covered by the initiative. A person of average intelligence and common sense is not going to assume that there may be some unknown quantity of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>entities which are covered by the initiative but which the Attorney General did not bother to mention. The notion that a statement of purpose is \u201ctrue\u201d when it purports to list the parties affected by the initiative, but actually omits two of those affected parties, is utterly implausible, and the Court properly rejects it.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b661 The Attorney General next argues that the statement of purpose \u201cindicate[s] that other \u2018businesses\u2019 are subject to the initiative as well\u201d because the term \u201cbusinesses\u201d is used in the last sentence of the statement of purpose, which states: \u201c[1-164] prohibits businesses from structuring other transactions to avoid the rate limit.\u201d This contention is truly bizarre for two reasons. First, it is not clear what the term \u201cbusinesses\u201d even means here. Is it a reference to the \u201cbusinesses\u201d mentioned in the preceding sentence (\u201cpayday, title, and retail installment lenders\u201d)? Or is it a reference to all \u201cbusinesses\u201d? If the latter, then the term \u201cbusinesses\u201d is misleading because 1-164 does not actually impose the 36 percent rate limit on all businesses. To the contrary, there are various businesses which, like consumer loan licensees, deferred deposit loan licensees, and title loan licensees, are considered \u201cregulated lenders,\u201d but which are not covered by 1-164. These include banks, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, trust companies, credit unions, credit associations, residential mortgage lender licensees, development corporations, bank holding companies, and mutual or stock insurance companies. Section 31-1-111(1), MCA. These \u201cbusinesses\u201d are exempt from all limitations on the rate of interest that they may charge and are also exempt from the operation and effect of all usury statutes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 31-1-112(1), MCA. While Ben Bernanke might have an idea of what the term \u201cbusinesses\u201d means in the last sentence of the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose, the average voter presented with an 1-164 petition certainly would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b662 Second, the Attorney General concedes that one of the reasons he rewrote the proponents\u2019 statement of purpose in the first place was because the statement \u201cdid not specify the type of loans subject to the limits.\u201d The proponents\u2019 statement of purpose read (with emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Initiative [164] limits the annual interest, fees and charges <em>certain lenders, including payday and car title lenders, </em>may charge on loans to 36 percent because some lenders charge annual rates of more than 400 percent. It extends to all Montanans the same interest rate limit provided to military personnel and their families. It imposes restrictions to prevent lenders from avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the rate limits. Loans in violation of the 36 percent annual rate violate the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Yet, the word \u201cbusinesses\u201d selected by the Attorney General likewise does not specify the type of loans subject to the limits. It is no more informative than the word \u201ccertain lenders\u201d selected by the proponents. In fact, it is <em>less </em>informative because \u201ccertain lenders\u201d is obviously narrower than \u201cbusinesses.\u201d The proponents\u2019 proposed statement of purpose at least had the virtue of letting voters know that there were other lenders <em>besides </em>\u201cpayday and car title lenders\u201d that were affected by 1-164. The Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose, on the other hand, refers to \u201cpayday, title, and retail installment lenders\u201d and in no way indicates that there are two other regulated lenders that are affected by the initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b663 Next, the Attorney General argues, in conclusory fashion, that voters would not understand, or might misconstrue, what \u201cconsumer loan licensees\u201d are. First of all, however, this is not a valid justification for omitting these entities from the statement of purpose. Consumer loan licensees are one of five specific entities targeted by the initiative, and they therefore should be mentioned in the statement of purpose along with the three targeted entities that are mentioned. Moreover, while the Attorney General criticizes Harrington for not presenting any evidence in support of his arguments, the Attorney General himself presents no evidence that voters would be confused by the term \u201cproviders of consumer loans\u201d or that voters understand this term any less than they understand the terms \u201cretail installment lenders,\u201d \u201cdeferred deposit (payday) lenders,\u201d and \u201ctitle lenders.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s argument, rather, is based entirely on sheer conjecture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, and even more to the point, to the extent that voters actually would be confused by the statement of purpose and the statements of implication as written, it is the Attorney General\u2019s statutory obligation to reject those statements outright, \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-202(4), -312(1), MCA, and to rewrite the language so that voters will not be confused, \u00a7 13-27-312(8)(b), MCA. Simply leaving voters in the dark is not a lawful option.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b664 It is ironic that in rejecting Harrington\u2019s assertion that the statement of purpose should name the types of regulated lenders that are <em>excluded </em>from I-164\u2019s application, the Attorney General suggests that what voters actually \u201ccare about\u201d are the entities that <em>are </em>affected by 1-164, not the ones that <em>are not </em>affected by the initiative. Yet, two affected entities (pawnbrokers and consumer loan licensees) are not even mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b665 As a final matter, although not explicitly cited by MCFA, it is important to acknowledge another facet of 1-164 that is not mentioned in the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose. Again, \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, read together with <em>Citizens Right to Recall, </em>\u00b6 16, requires that the statement of purpose and the statements of implication be written so as not to mislead voters as to the initiative\u2019s purpose. They must be written with the goal of \u201cfair notice\u201d-i.e., to truthfully inform, so that voters can make an intelligent decision. Unfortunately, as with 1-143, it appears that 1-164 is yet another \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d initiative to put out of business certain lawfully operating businesses which are licensed and regulated by the State. <em>See Kafka v. Montana Dept. of FWP, </em>2008 MT 460, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116, 348 Mont. 80, 201 P.3d 8 (Nelson, Rice, &amp; Swandal, JJ., dissenting). With 1-143, it was alternative livestock ranchers (game farmers). With 1-164, it is certain types of regulated lenders (payday and title lenders in particular). Through the simple expedient of statutorily reducing the price for which the businessperson can sell his or her product or service-here the interest rate such lenders may charge-the public can, without paying just compensation for the taking <em>(see Kafka, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54, 64, 83, 94 (Opinion of the Court)), simply render a business unprofitable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aj7m\">\u00b666 For the foregoing reasons, the language of the 1-164 petitions is invalid. Because we cannot go back and \u201cfix\u201d that language, <em>see </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA, as the petitions have already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>presented to and signed by registered voters, the legally correct course of action is to grant MCFA\u2019s requested remedy of declaring the petitions void and ordering that 1-164 may not appear on the ballot, <em>see </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">IV. The Court\u2019s New Ballot Statements</p>\n<p id=\"AYv\">\u00b667 As noted at the outset, this Court has no authority to place statements on the November ballots that are <em>different </em>from the statements on the circulated petitions. Granted, this Court has been given authority to rewrite the ballot statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA (\u201cIf the court decides that the ballot statements do not meet the requirements of 13-27-312, it may . . . certify to the secretary of state a statement that the court determines will meet the requirements of 13-27-312.\u201d). But \u201c[a] statement . . . certified by the court must be placed <em>on the petition for circulation </em>and on the official ballot.\u201d Section 13-27-316(3)(c)(ii), MCA (emphasis added). Moreover, \u201c[i]f... the supreme court revises the petition form or ballot statements, any petitions signed prior to the revision are void.\u201d Section 13-27-316(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b668 Even as a purely intuitive matter, it seems patently obvious that the statement of purpose, fiscal statement, and statements of implication contained on the petitions circulated to voters <em>must </em>be the <em>same </em>(at least in substance) as the statement of purpose, fiscal statement, and statements of implication on the ballot provided at the election. Circulating petitions that say one thing and then providing election ballots that say something else undermines the initiative process and misleads the voters. Indeed, it is bait-and-switch fraud and akin to obtaining illegal petition signatures. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-317, MCA (requiring the ballot issue to be decertified under such circumstances). This is why when this Court revises the petition form or ballot statements, \u201cany petitions signed prior to the revision are void.\u201d Section 13-27-316(4), MCA. And without valid petitions, the ballot issue may not appear on the ballot. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13-27-307, -308, MCA; <em>see also e.g. </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b669 That this Court would so blatantly disregard the law so that a ballot measure can appear on the ballot, notwithstanding the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the petitions upon which the measure is premised are void, should be of grave concern to the very people the Court purports to be protecting: the voters. In this connection, there is an undercurrent in the Attorney General\u2019s arguments and in the Court\u2019s decision in these cases that invalidating 1-164 would disenfranchise voters. This proposition is utterly unavailing. Those who signed the petitions were not properly advised of I-164\u2019s purpose and the implications of a vote for or against the initiative. At this point in time, no one has \u201cvoted\u201d on 1-164, and no one is being \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d-i.e., deprived of the right to vote. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>480 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999). Indeed, if this sort of argument had any merit, we could never declare an initiative invalid, for to do so would \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d voters. That, of course, is nonsense, since we do, on occasion, declare initiatives which violate the law or the constitution invalid, both before and after voters have voted. <em>See e.g. State ex rel. Montana Citizens v. Waltermire, </em>227 Mont. 85, 738 P.2d 1255 (1987); <em>Marshall v. State ex rel. Cooney, </em>1999 MT 33, 293 Mont. 274, 975 P.2d 325; <em>Montanans For Justice v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 277, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759; <em>Citizens Against CI-97 v. State, </em>2006 MT 278, 334 Mont. 265, 147 P.3d 174. The lesson from these cases, and others like them, is that no one has the right to vote on a ballot measure that is placed before them in violation of the law or the Constitution. Unfortunately, this is a lesson lost upon the Court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b670 The people of this State, through their elected representatives, adopted a system designed to ensure that ballot measures would not appear on the ballot unless certain prerequisites were satisfied. To be sure, the statutory \u201cscheme\u201d-which is, perhaps, an apt appellation-is far from perfect. In this regard, the Attorney General explains that the Legislature revised the initiative process in 2007 in order to avoid a repeat of the \u201celectoral confusion\u201d and \u201ccrisis of direct democracy\u2019 that surrounded three ballot issues in 2006. <em>See generally </em>Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 481; <em>Stop Over Spending Montana v. State, </em>2006 MT 178, 333 Mont. 42, 139 P.3d 788; <em>Montanans For Justice v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 277, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. Unfortunately, however, as the present challenges to 1-164 demonstrate, problems still remain-not the least of which is the fact that challenges to petitions are brought <em>after </em>the petitions have been circulated and signed, not to mention the fact that this Court has been granted \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d which the Montana Constitution does not authorize. Moreover, we are once again faced with a challenge to a ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>initiative on an extremely tight timeline, and the parties have failed to comply with the most basic requirements adopted by the Legislature: certify the absence of factual issues, or stipulate to and file any factual record necessary to our decision. To the extent these circumstances have created another \u201ccrisis,\u201d blame for it plainly lies with lawmakers and the patent failure of the parties to comply with the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\u00b671 The entire scheme should probably be scrapped, and the Legislature should simply start over from scratch with a clear statutory framework that (a) is practical and can be understood; (b) allows sufficient time for review by the designated state officials, revisions to the extent necessary, and review of the inevitable ballot challenges by this Court; and (c) guarantees transparency and truth in the initiative and ballot process. In the meantime, however, it is not this Court\u2019s prerogative to take on the role of pseudo-legislators and manipulate clear statutory mandates in order to achieve some presumed greater good. It is the Legislature\u2019s constitutional role to enact the statutes, and it is this Court\u2019s constitutional role to apply them in a forthright manner. The only \u201ccrisis of direct democracy\u201d in the present case is this Court\u2019s inability to simply follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b672 I am no more a fan of lending institutions that gouge consumers, especially those with lower incomes, than I am of people who charge for the \u201csport\u201d of shooting defenseless penned animals-indeed, the two compare favorably. However, both the blackletter law and our caselaw require that voters be truthfully informed; that the purposes driving a citizens\u2019 initiative, as well as the implications of the initiative, be transparent; and that voters not be misled into voting for the wolf of a facially well-intentioned initiative cloaked in the sheep\u2019s clothing of misleading statements of purpose and implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b673 As for the goals of I-164\u2019s proponents, since there is, apparently, such a public hullabaloo over the interest rates that payday lenders and title lenders charge, the public should simply demand that its representatives in the Legislature step up to the plate in the next session, do the job which that body has <em>always </em>had the power to do, and actually regulate the interest rates of payday, title, and other \u201cregulated\u201d lenders in the interests of consumers. The demise of 1-164 certainly would not prevent the Legislature from accomplishing this objective itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b674 Lastly, as to the Concurrence, while it is always easier to shoot the messenger, this Dissent\u2019s analysis stands unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b675 I would hold that this Court does not have jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>entertain Harrington\u2019s and MCFA\u2019s petitions challenging the 1-164 ballot statements. Furthermore, even if we did have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA, we would be required to refer this proceeding to a district court pursuant to \u00a7 3-2-202(3)(b)(ii), MCA. Alternatively, on the merits of MCFA\u2019s challenge, I conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination is incorrect and that 1-164 does not comply with statutory requirements. As a result, the petitions are void, and 1-164 may not appear on the ballot. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(c)(iii), MCA. Finally, the Court\u2019s decision to rewrite the statements for the November ballot, despite the fact that the underlying petitions are void, is without authority and legally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b676 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> <em>State ex rel. Montana Citizens v. </em>Waltermire, 227 Mont. 85, 93, 738 P.2d 1255, 1260 (1987) (quoting <em>State ex rel. Woods v. Tooker, </em>15 Mont. 8, 13, 37 P. 840, 842 (1894)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> Here, the 1-164 proponents first submitted the proposed ballot issue and draft ballot statements to the Secretary of State on February 23, 2010. The Legislative Services Division completed its review on March 5, the Attorney General completed his review on April 22, and the Secretary of State authorized the proponents to commence signature gathering on April 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> Not only that, the Attorney General\u2019s arguments are internally inconsistent. In one paragraph, the Attorney General states that he left consumer loan licensees out of the statement of purpose because \u201cthe application of a 36% annual interest rate to consumer loans is more straightforward.\u201d Yet, in the very next paragraph, the Attorney General asserts that \u201cconsumer lender\u201d is \u201ca technical term\u201d that voters might misconstrue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><em> </em>It is unlikely, also, that most voters appreciate that payday and title lenders exist, if at all, because most people with lower incomes-whose only \u201casset\u201d is their car or minimum-wage paycheck-have no legitimate source of reasonably priced, short-term credit when there are more bills than money at the end of the month or when presented with an unexpected financial emergency. They borrow at exorbitant rates of interest because there is no other alternative. I doubt, too, that most voters understand that other \u201cregulated lenders,\u201d including banks, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, trust companies, credit unions, credit associations, residential mortgage lender licensees, development corporations, bank holding compames, and mutual or stock insurance companies <em>(see </em>\u00a7 31-1-111(1), MCA)-some of the same folks that lapped up billions in taxpayer-funded bailouts and bonuses-are exempt from all limitations on the rate of interest that they may charge and are exempt from the operation and effect of all usury statutes <em>(see </em>\u00a7 31-1-112(1), MCA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> As an aside, I find it untenable that this Court possesses such authority. This Court is, or at least should be, in the business of judging conflicts and disputes over language. It should not be in the business of rewriting disputed language so that the favored party-here, the Attorney General-wins the dispute. That the statute even permits such a perverse result violates the most fundamental principles of fairness and impartiality that presumably govern all courts and judges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b294-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A5K\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b677 I believe the Court\u2019s determination that Harrington has raised only substantive legal issues, and not issues governing submission of the initiative to the voters, is untenable. I agree with Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent in this regard. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43. The Court\u2019s own summary of the arguments, provided in \u00b6 6 of the Opinion, demonstrates that the arguments made by the challengers are directed to the initiative\u2019s submission and challenge the Attorney General\u2019s \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d determination, as that term is defined in \u00a7 13-27-312(7), MCA. Thus, \u00a7 3-2-202(3), MCA, applies and governs. Under this unique but specific provision, because the parties have failed to make a certification or stipulation regarding factual issues, \u201cthe supreme court shall refer the proceeding to the district court... for development of a factual record.\u201d Section 3-2-202(3)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b678 The good reason for this legislative directive can be seen by today\u2019s decision. The Court, by its modification of the ballot language, is deciding what groups will be named on the ballot. This critical task, if undertaken at all, requires the careful selection of few words and should be based upon a solid factual foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b679 I would remand in accordance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>EXHIBIT: 1-164 Petition (3 pages)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b297-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
