Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189) (count l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found appellants guilty of child endangerment (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a)) (count 2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, with respect to count 2, the jury found that appellants committed the offense under circumstances specified in section 12022.95.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nanette, who suffered from type 1 diabetes, died from complications related to the disease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the People presented evidence that appellants acted with conscious disregard for Nanette\u2019s life by failing to obtain medical treatment for her in the days preceding her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Appellants contend that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts finding them guilty of second degree murder. Specifically, appellants contend that the record lacks sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that they knew that their failure to obtain medical treatment for Nanette endangered her life or that they failed to obtain such medical treatment in conscious disregard for Nanette\u2019s life, both of which the jury had to impliedly find in order to convict appellants of second degree murder. We affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND A. <em>The trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">1. <em>The prosecution\u2019s evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">a. <em>Nanette\u2019s prior medical treatment for diabetes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">In December 2001, Nanette was admitted to the emergency room after she displayed \u201can altered level of consciousness.\u201d She was diagnosed as suffering from diabetes mellitus, type 1, and diabetic ketoacidosis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complication related to diabetes that occurs when the body fails to produce adequate amounts of insulin. While the condition can be fatal, most cases of diabetic ketoacidosis are treatable and the patient recovers. Nanette\u2019s symptoms included Kussmaul breathing<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cfruity breath,\u201d a sign of acetone on the breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Medical records from Nanette\u2019s 2001 hospitalization indicated that appellants were provided with education related to the management of Nanette\u2019s diabetic condition at that time. This education would have included instruction as to how to recognize the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. The medical records state that appellants did \u201cnot grasp[] [the] seriousness of [Nanette\u2019s] . . . condition,\u201d and that they displayed \u201cignorance and [a] lack of comprehension of how close their daughter came to dying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>After her diagnosis, Nanette was primarily responsible for managing her own diabetic condition. She monitored her blood sugar and injected herself with insulin, as needed. Gregory, who had type 2 diabetes, sometimes assisted Nanette in the management of her diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In 2004, Nanette was taken to a medical office after she became lethargic and unresponsive. Yundell Montalbo, a physician\u2019s assistant, diagnosed Nanette as having low blood sugar. Montalbo believed that Nanette was going into a coma and that she required hospitalization. An ambulance was summoned. An emergency medical technician provided Nanette with glucose, and her blood-sugar level began to rise. Yvonne decided not to allow Nanette to be taken to the hospital in the ambulance, and Nanette was not hospitalized on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">b. <em>Nanette\u2019s illness in April 2006</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In April 2006, Nanette became ill and displayed the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Over a period of approximately a week prior to April 15, Nanette\u2019s physical condition deteriorated. She became immobile, began to breathe heavily, complained of pain to her lungs and ribs, and appeared to be semiconsciousness or unconscious for periods of time. In the days just prior to April 15, neighbors urged the appellants to obtain medical treatment for Nanette. Appellants did not obtain any medical treatment for Nanette prior to April 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">c. <em>Nanette\u2019s hospitalization and death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">On April 15, the Lathams\u2019 neighbor, Linda Conner, heard Yvonne screaming, \u201cI think Nanette died. I think Nanette is dead.\u201d Another neighbor, Jesse Wallis, called 911 after learning that Nanette had stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived at appellants\u2019 residence at approximately 12:39 p.m. Upon their arrival, paramedics determined that Nanette was in cardiac arrest, meaning that she was not breathing and her heart was not beating. Paramedics rushed Nanette to the hospital. Hospital personnel drew Nanette\u2019s blood approximately 10 minutes after her arrival. Nanette\u2019s blood-sugar level was 1297, which is roughly 15 times the normal level.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">On April 17, 2006, physical examinations showed that Nanette had no brain activity and that she met the criteria for brain death. Doctors pronounced her dead at 6:30 p.m. that evening. Nanette remained on a ventilator until the following day in order to afford appellants the opportunity to visit her. Appellants visited Nanette briefly on April 18. Minutes after appellants\u2019 visit, doctors removed Nanette from \u201corgan support,\u201d and all respiration and cardiac activity ceased. A forensic pathologist determined that Nanette died as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>d. <em>Expert testimony concerning diabetic ketoacidosis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. John Mace testified concerning diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. Dr. Mace explained that there are two types of diabetes\u2014type 1 and type 2. In persons suffering from type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas that lowers the body\u2019s blood sugar. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when the body is not getting enough insulin and begins to bum fat. When the body bums fat, it produces ketoacids. Individuals who are suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis will breathe \u201cfast and hard\u201d in an effort to rid their bodies of the acid. Dr. Mace described that breathing as follows, \u201cIt would be like you just ran a race, and so you would be breathing that hard.\u201d Unless a person suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis receives insulin, his or her body will become progressively acidotic, and his or her brain will cease to function properly. If untreated, a person suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis will become comatose, stop breathing, and die.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Dr. Mace also testified that a blood-sugar level of 1297 is \u201cvery high\u201d and that with a blood-sugar level this high, Nanette would have been \u201cacutely ill\u201d and would have gone into cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">2. <em>The defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">a. <em>Gregory\u2019s defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Endocrinologist Dr. Steven Schessler testified concerning diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. Dr. Schessler explained the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and stated that a person who suffers from type 2 diabetes and who has not had specialized training regarding type 1 diabetes might incorrectly treat a type 1 diabetic. Dr. Schessler also explained that some diabetics can have normal blood-sugar levels, yet be acidotic. Dr. Schessler also agreed with defense counsel that it would be \u201cpossible\u201d for a person\u2019s blood-sugar level to rise from 300 to 1200 in 12 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Appellants\u2019 daughter, Heidi, testified that Nanette was sick for \u201cabout three days\u201d prior to April 15. During those three days, Heidi saw Nanette only twice. Nanette appeared sick and told Heidi that she had a stomach ache. On the second day that Nanette was sick, Nanette asked Heidi for some water. Heidi saw Gregory attempt to give Nanette pizza and a yogurt drink, but Nanette pushed them away. Heidi also saw Gregory check Nanette\u2019s blood-sugar level.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The paramedics took Nanette to San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital. Heidi and Yvonne went there to see her. After Nanette was transferred to Loma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Linda Hospital, Heidi went with Gregory and Yvonne to see Nanette. According to Heidi, at the hospital, Gregory was yelling and \u201cin a rage\u201d because \u201cthey wanted him to pull the plug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Heidi stated that approximately two months prior to Nanette\u2019s death, Yvonne was attacked by a man who kicked her in the head with steel-toed boots and stabbed her with keys. After the attack, Heidi could see that Yvonne had bruises on her head and chest and cuts on her arms, shoulders, and face. Yvonne was taken by ambulance to the hospital. After this incident, Yvonne appeared \u201csad\u201d to Heidi. Yvonne told Heidi that she was \u201cmessed up\u201d from the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">b. <em>Yvonne\u2019s defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Appellants\u2019 son, Gregory Latham, Jr. (Gregory Jr.), testified that sometime prior to February 2006, he witnessed a man attack Yvonne.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gregory Jr. saw the man \u201cstomping\u201d on Yvonne\u2019s head. Yvonne had \u201clumps all over her head\u201d as a result of the attack. Gregory Jr. also was \u201cpretty sure [Yvonne] was bleeding\u201d as a result of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On the morning that paramedics took Nanette to the hospital, Gregory Jr. heard Yvonne screaming as if she were \u201cfrantic about something.\u201d Yvonne told Gregory Jr. that Nanette had stopped breathing. Gregory Jr. performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Nanette. Yvonne was crying and appeared \u201creally stressed out\u201d and \u201c[r]eally worried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">3. <em>The verdicts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The jury found Gregory and Yvonne guilty of second degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189) (count 1) and child endangerment (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a)) (count 2). The jury also found that appellants committed count 2 under circumstances specified in section 12022.95. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">B. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The trial court sentenced Gregory to an aggregate term of 17 years to life in prison. On count 1, the court sentenced Gregory to 15 years to life. On count 2, the court sentenced Gregory to 10 years in prison, consisting of the upper term of six years on the underlying count (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a)) and four years for the section 12022.95 enhancement. The court stated that the term on count 2 was to be served concurrently with the term imposed on count 1, and stayed execution of the sentence on count 2 pursuant to section 654. On count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>3, the court sentenced Gregory to two years in prison, to be served consecutively to the term imposed on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The trial court sentenced Yvonne to an aggregate term of 15 years to life in prison. On count 1, the court sentenced Yvonne to 15 years to life. On count 2, the court sentenced Yvonne to eight years in prison, consisting of the middle term of four years on the underlying count (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a)) and four years for the section 12022.95 enhancement. The court stated that the term on count 2 was to be served concurrently with the term imposed on count 1, and the court stayed execution of the sentence on count 2 pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A. <em>There is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdicts finding appellants guilty of second degree murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Appellants contend that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdicts finding them guilty of second degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">1. <em>Governing law and standard of review </em>a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u201cA state court conviction that is not supported by sufficient evidence violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is invalid for that reason.\u201d <em>(People v. Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 269 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897], citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 313-324 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].) In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Jackson v. Virginia, supra, </em>at p. 319.) \u201c[T]he court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) \u201cThe standard of review is the same in cases in which the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>b. <em>The elements of second degree murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Section 187 provides in relevant part, \u201c(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought.\u201d Section 188 defines malice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cSuch malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cWhen it is shown that the killing resulted from the intentional doing of an act with express or implied malice as defined above, no other mental state need be shown to establish the mental state of malice aforethought. Neither an awareness of the obligation to act within the general body of laws regulating society nor acting despite such awareness is included within the definition of malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1181 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425] <em>(Chun), </em>the Supreme Court observed, \u201c[T]he statutory definition [of implied malice] permits, even requires, judicial interpretation.\u201d The <em>Chun </em>court summarized its interpretation of that term as follows: \u201cWe have interpreted implied malice as having \u2018both a physical and a mental component. The physical component is satisfied by the performance of \u201can act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life.\u201d [Citation.] The mental component is the requirement that the defendant \u201cknows that his conduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\"><em>A </em>parent owes his or her child a duty to obtain needed medical attention. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burden </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 603, 614 [140 Cal.Rptr. 282] <em>(Burden); </em>accord, \u00a7 270.)  The \u201comission of a duty is in law the equivalent of an act . . .\u201d <em>(Burden, supra, </em>at p. 616), and thus, a defendant\u2019s failure to-perform an act that he or she has a legal duty to perform is identical to the defendant\u2019s affirmative performance of an act <em>(id. </em>at p. 618 [\u201ccommon law does not distinguish between homicide by act and homicide by omission\u201d]; see CALCRIM No. 520 [\u201cIf you conclude that the defendant owed a duty to &lt;insert name of decedent&gt;, and the defendant failed to perform that duty, (his/her) failure to act is the same as doing a negligent or injurious act.\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">2. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Appellants contend that the record lacks sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that they knew that their failure to obtain medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>treatment for Nanette endangered her life or that they failed to obtain such medical treatment in conscious disregard for Nanette\u2019s life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">a. <em>There is sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found that appellants harbored the requisite mental state to be found guilty of implied malice murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">There are four categories of evidence in the record that support the jury\u2019s implied finding that appellants acted with implied malice. Below, we discuss each of these categories and explain how the cumulative weight of the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">i. <em>Nanette\u2019s medical condition in the days prior to her death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Conner testified that approximately five days before paramedics rushed Nanette to the hospital, Conner saw Nanette lying on the couch, \u201ccompletely out of it.\u201d Conner shook Nanette, but was unable to awaken her. Approximately three days before Nanette suffered cardiac arrest and was transported to the hospital, Wallis saw Nanette lying on the bed, moaning, in a drowsy, semiconscious state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The next day, Wallis observed Nanette lying on the bed in the same condition. On the day before Nanette suffered cardiac arrest, Wallis testified that Nanette appeared \u201cout of it.\u201d Wallis stated that Nanette was unable to sit up on her own and that she was \u201creally weak.\u201d Wallis watched Gregory attempt to pour some yogurt into Nanette\u2019s mouth while propping her up with his arms. According to Wallis, the yogurt was \u201crunning down [Nanette\u2019s] chin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Appellants\u2019 daughter, Carra,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> testified that Nanette became sick a week before she was taken to the hospital.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During that week, Nanette looked weak, \u201cgot real skinny,\u201d could not \u201creally\u201d walk, and did not want to drink or eat. In addition, during an interview that a police investigator conducted with Carra on April 25, 2006, 10 days after Nanette was hospitalized, Carra stated that Nanette had told her and appellants\u2019 other daughter, Carol, that Nanette\u2019s ribs \u201churt bad,\u201d and that \u201cher lungs hurted [sic].\u201d Carra also told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>investigator, \u201cCarol said [Nanette\u2019s] lungs are probably shutting down or something.\u201d In addition, Carra told the investigator that Carol told Yvonne that Nanette had said her ribs and lungs hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Carol testified that Nanette got sick \u201cabout a week\u201d before she was taken to the hospital.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to Carol, as the week progressed, Nanette \u201cwasn\u2019t responding to anybody\u2019s answer <em>[sic].\u201d </em>Carol explained, \u201c[S]he would barely, like, say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d Carol said that Nanette was \u201cbarely\u201d able to stand up and walk. Carol also noted that Nanette was unable to use the restroom, and that Yvonne had put a diaper on Nanette. Moreover, according to Carol, Nanette was \u201cbreathing hard\u201d in the \u201ccouple of days\u201d prior to being hospitalized. Carol had heard Nanette breathe in a similar fashion at the time Nanette was initially diagnosed with diabetes. Carol also testified that Nanette said that her ribs hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Nathan Buddruis, one of the paramedics who took Nanette to the hospital, testified that when he saw Nanette being removed from appellants\u2019 residence, \u201cshe appeared to ... be possibly a very old woman that could have been maybe 70 years old, just by judging by the look of her skin, and her eyes and her face and the fact that she was in a diaper.\u201d Paramedics determined that Nanette was in cardiac arrest, and emergency room personnel discovered that Nanette was unresponsive to any stimuli and that her blood-sugar level was extremely high.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In addition to evidence pertaining to Nanette\u2019s medical condition in the days preceding her death, the record also contains expert testimony concerning the symptoms that a patient suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis would ordinarily display in the 24 hours prior to cardiac arrest and death. Dr. Mace testified that such a patient would engage in extremely heavy breathing for a period of approximately 24 hours prior to suffering cardiac arrest. The prosecutor asked Dr. Mace, \u201cThe heavy breathing that you have described, is that something most people would recognize as a problem?\u201d Dr. Mace responded in the affirmative. Dr. Mace provided a demonstration of this type of breathing while on the witness stand, which the court described as follows: \u201c[T]he witness is taking extremely deep breaths, utilizing the shoulders and chest extensively.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, Dr. Mace testified that a patient who ultimately suffered cardiac arrest caused by diabetic ketoacidosis would have become \u201cprogressively less aware and gradually slip[ped] into coma\u201d during the 24-hour period prior to suffering cardiac arrest and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ii. <em>Appellants had received training on recognizing the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">At the time of Nanette\u2019s 2001 hospitalization, appellants received training in the management of diabetes. This training included instruction concerning how to recognize the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, including \u201cKussmaul breathing,\u201d \u201cacetone on the breath,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u201cmental stupor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">iii. <em>Neighbors told appellants that Nanette should receive medical attention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On at least three separate occasions during the four days before Nanette suffered cardiac arrest, Conner told Gregory that \u201c[she] wished they . . . would call the paramedics.\u201d Conner told Yvonne \u201cthe same thing.\u201d Conner was worried that Nanette might be in \u201ca coma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Two days prior to Nanette\u2019s hospitalization, neighbor Anthony Costa visited Nanette and appellants. After hearing Nanette make a moaning sound as if she were in pain, Costa offered to drive the family to a doctor\u2019s office or to the hospital. Gregory responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. She is all right. She will be all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">On the day before Nanette suffered cardiac arrest, Wallis told both appellants that Nanette \u201cdidn\u2019t look real good at all, that she should be taken to a hospital.\u201d Wallis said that appellants \u201ckind of just looked at [him],\u201d and that he \u201ctold them that if they didn\u2019t take her to the hospital, [he] was going to call an ambulance first thing in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">iv. <em>Appellants \u2019 emotional state and conduct near the time of Nanette\u2019s death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Neighbor Cassandra Wallis (Cassandra) testified that after 911 had been called, but prior to the arrival of emergency personnel at the scene, Cassandra ran into appellants\u2019 residence. Cassandra saw Gregory sitting on a bench approximately five to six feet away from Nanette, drinking a beer. The prosecutor asked Cassandra, \u201cDid it appear to you that he was paying attention to Nanette?\u201d Cassandra responded, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Sergeant Thomas Brewster of the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department interviewed Gregory at approximately noon on April 18, three days after Nanette was hospitalized. Gregory told Sergeant Brewster that he had purchased two or three six-packs of beer that morning, and that he had not yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>visited Nanette at Loma Linda Hospital. Gregory told Sergeant Brewster that he would try to find a friend to take him to the hospital the following day. Sergeant Brewster asked Gregory whether he would be interested in visiting Nanette if Sergeant Brewster were able to arrange the necessary transportation. According to Sergeant Brewster, Gregory responded that, \u201c[h]e was tired, and he needed to get something to eat, and he would have Tony [(the friend)] take him later or the next day.\u201d At the end of the interview, Sergeant Brewster explained to Gregory that Nanette was \u201cbrain dead,\u201d and that the hospital \u201cwas keeping her alive on a ventilator as a courtesy so that he would have the opportunity to say his good-byes.\u201d Sergeant Brewster stated that Gregory appeared to show \u201cindifference\u201d upon learning of Nanette\u2019s condition. Sergeant Brewster then told Gregory that the hospital \u201cwould prefer that he go see her sooner rather than later.\u201d According to Sergeant Brewster, Gregory responded by reiterating that \u201c[h]e was tired, and he needed to get something to eat, and he would try and have Tony take him later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Several neighbors testified that on April 15, after paramedics were called, Yvonne went into neighbor Linda Conner\u2019s residence and locked herself in the bathroom. Cassandra was attempting to get Yvonne to come out of the bathroom. Neighbor Vickie Hamilton heard Cassandra say, \u201c \u2018That\u2019s no reason not to call 9-1-1 and to lock yourself in the bathroom.\u2019 \u201d Yvonne remained in Conner\u2019s residence until the ambulance left with Nanette. A few days later, Yvonne told Cassandra that she had not called 911 earlier because she was embarrassed about the smell and mess inside her residence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Dr. Debra Craig, an ethicist who was involved in making the determination concerning when to remove Nanette from life support, testified that she observed appellants during their final visit with Nanette in the intensive care unit on April 18. Dr. Craig testified that Yvonne did \u201cvery little more than glance toward the bed\u201d and estimated that appellants spent \u201cless than three minutes\u201d in the ward during this final visit. Sergeant Gary Leclair of the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department interviewed Yvonne on April 18 and testified, \u201cShe gave me an opinion [sic] that she wasn\u2019t interested or didn\u2019t care what was going on with her daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">v. <em>The cumulative impact of the evidence discussed above is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s implied finding that appellants acted with implied malice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Viewing the cumulative impact of the evidence discussed above in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>found that appellants were aware that their failure to obtain medical treatment for Nanette endangered her life, and that they failed to obtain medical treatment for her in conscious disregard of that risk. Most importantly, evidence that Nanette displayed clearly visible signs of an extremely serious medical condition supports the inference that appellants were aware of the life-threatening nature of her condition. (See <em>Burden, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 620 [visible evidence of malnutrition \u201csufficient to show that defendant must have appreciated that his baby was in a state of terminal starvation\u201d]; accord, <em>People v. Moore </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 937, 941 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 540] [concluding record contained evidence that defendant acted with implied malice and observing, \u201cIt takes no leap of logic for the jury to conclude that because anyone would be aware of the risk, [defendant] was aware of the risk.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Evidence that appellants had previously received training in recognizing the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis bolsters this inference. (See <em>People v. Brogna </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 700, 709 [248 Cal.Rptr. 761] [\u201cevidence that a defendant has suffered a prior conviction and participated, as a condition of probation, in some form of alcohol education program which emphasized the dangers of driving while intoxicated is relevant to prove the accused\u2019s awareness of the life threatening risks caused by his conduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Evidence that several different people told appellants that Nanette needed medical attention in the days prior to her death also supports the inference that appellants were aware of, and consciously disregarded, the risk to Nanette\u2019s life of failing to obtain medical treatment. (See <em>People v. Autry </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 351, 359 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 135] [evidence that passengers warned defendant driver that he was driving dangerously supported inference that defendant acted with implied malice].) Finally, although far from overwhelming, there was some evidence from which the jury could have inferred that appellants were unconcerned with Nanette\u2019s fate, even <em>after </em>she had suffered cardiac arrest. This evidence also supports the jury\u2019s verdict. (See, e.g., <em>Burden, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 620 [\u201cA defendant\u2019s lack of concern as to whether the victim lived or died, expressed or implied, has been found to be substantial evidence of an \u2018abandoned and malignant heart\u2019 by the appellate courts of this state.\u201d]; <em>People v. Ogg </em>(1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 38, 51 [323 P.2d 117] [\u201cDefendant\u2019s failure to seek the assistance of his friends or to obtain medical aid even though he knew that his wife was seriously injured indicates a heartless attitude and callous indifference toward her.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>b. <em>Appellants\u2019 contentions that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions are not persuasive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellants contend that <em>People </em>v. <em>Caffero </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 678 [255 Cal.Rptr. 22] (Caffero) supports their claim that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support their convictions. In <em>Caffero, </em>the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of murder charges against two parents arising from the death of their two-week-old infant. Evidence suggested that the infant died from a bacterial infection that entered the infant\u2019s system through perianal sores. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) The sores were likely caused as a result of the infant\u2019s skin remaining in \u201cprolonged contact with fecal matter.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although the <em>Caffero </em>court noted that there was evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the infant\u2019s death was caused by the parents\u2019 \u201cgrossly inadequate care,\u201d the court determined that there was \u201cno evidence defendants were actually aware their conduct endangered [the infant\u2019s] life.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Caffero </em>court thus concluded, \u201c[T]he evidence will not support the inference defendants acted with conscious or wanton disregard for human life and thus with malice aforethought.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Appellants contend that the present case \u201cis analogous to <em>Caffero.\u201d </em>We are not persuaded. When the parents in <em>Caffero </em>initially took the infant to the emergency room, a triage nurse deemed the infant\u2019s condition \u201c \u2018non-urgent\u2019 \u201d after observing that the infant had a temperature of 98.9 and \u201cgood facial color.\u201d <em>(Caffero, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 681.) In this case, when paramedics arrived at appellants\u2019 residence, Nanette was in full cardiac arrest\u2014an obviously life-threatening situation. In addition, in <em>Caffero, </em>medical evidence indicated that the infant\u2019s \u201ccondition became extremely grave a short time after she was brought to the hospital,\u201d but that there was \u201cno evidence [that suggested] defendants knew [perianal sores] were life-threatening.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) In this case, in contrast, there was evidence that Nanette\u2019s condition worsened over several days, that appellants were aware of her worsening condition, and that appellants knew that Nanette\u2019s condition was life threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Further, in <em>Caffero, </em>two days before taking the infant to the emergency room, the infant\u2019s mother called the emergency room and described the infant\u2019s symptoms to hospital personnel. <em>(Caffero, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 685.) \u201c[T]he advice she received [in response] conveyed no sense of urgency about the need for immediate medical attention.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The following day, the infant\u2019s grandmother examined the infant, and told the infant\u2019s mother that she thought the infant had \u201c \u2018colic and diaper rash.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, in <em>Caffero, </em>there was no evidence that the defendants had been warned of the need to seek immediate medical attention for their child. In this case, in contrast, numerous individuals urged appellants to take Nanette to the hospital in the days just prior to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>In addition, in this case, in contrast to <em>Caffero, </em>there was evidence that appellants had received prior training concerning the medical condition that caused their child\u2019s death. Finally, in this case, unlike in <em>Caffero, </em>there was evidence from which the jury could have found that appellants were unconcerned with their child\u2019s fate after they learned the seriousness of her health condition. In sum, the facts in <em>Caffero </em>are clearly distinguishable from those in the present case. <em>Caffero </em>thus does not support appellants\u2019 contention that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Appellants also note that there is evidence that they, and in particular Gregory, took steps to attempt to treat Nanette\u2019s physical condition, including providing her with fluids, insulin, and food and monitoring her blood sugar, and that they believed that her condition was improving. Appellants also observe that the records of Nanette\u2019s 2001 hospitalization suggest that appellants did not fully grasp the seriousness of Nanette\u2019s disease. The record also contains evidence from which the jury might have found that appellants loved Nanette and did not want her to die. Further, Yvonne notes that the record contains evidence that she delegated to Gregory the predominant responsibility to care for Nanette and that, during the relevant time period, Yvonne was \u201csuffering psychologically\u201d as the result of an assault that occurred a few months prior to Nanette\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We acknowledge that a reasonable jury <em>might </em>very well have determined that the People failed to establish that either appellant acted with implied malice. However, in considering appellants\u2019 sufficiency claims, \u201c[w]e do not reweigh or reinterpret the evidence . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 463, 469 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 871].) The existence of a mere conflict in the evidence provides no basis for reversal. (E.g., <em>People v. Galvez </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1259 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 554] [\u201cAll conflicts in the evidence are resolved in favor of the judgment.\u201d].) Thus, although we might have reached a different conclusion had we sat as members of the jury, in this appeal the only issue that is properly before us is whether <em>any </em>reasonable jury could have found that appellants acted with implied malice. While the evidence is, in our view, far from overwhelming, and we believe that appellants\u2019 sufficiency claims present close and difficult issues, we conclude that the evidence described above provides a sufficient basis from which a reasonable jury could have found that appellants acted with implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">c. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">After reviewing the entire record in the light most favorable to the People, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied findings that appellants were aware that their failure to obtain medical treatment for Nanette endangered her life, and that appellants failed to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>such medical treatment in conscious disregard of that risk. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts finding appellants guilty of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">B\u201e C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Huffman, Acting P.
