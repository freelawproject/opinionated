Code, \u00a7 300, subds. (b) &amp; (g)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that A.M. had been sexually molested by James (\u00a7 300, subd. (d)). A dependency petition was also filed alleging that James and Mother neglected A.R.\u2019s medical needs and that A.R. was at risk of sexual abuse by James. (\u00a7 300, subds. (b) &amp; (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The Bureau\u2019s August 9, 2010 detention/jurisdictional report regarding A.M. stated that Mother had not provided proper treatment for A.M.\u2019s life-threatening Crohn\u2019s disease. The report also stated that A.M. told Melissa C., A.M.\u2019s foster mother, that James had continuously sexually abused her from age 11 to age 14. According to A.M., \u201c[James] did everything to me.\u201d The molestation stopped when A.M. began menstruating. After interviewing A.M. twice, the police said her statements were consistent and detailed and she appeared to be truthful about the molestation. James was arrested on July 21 for molesting A.M. The August 11 detention/jurisdictional report regarding A.R. stated that in September 2006, at 20 months of age, he was diagnosed as overweight and Parents failed to follow through with a diet plan or additional medical visits until June 2010, when he .was described as extremely obese and had high blood pressure. A.R. also had documented speech problems for which Mother failed to begin treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">A.R. was ordered detained solely from James. A.M. was ordered detained from Mother and ordered to have no contact with James. Parents elected to be represented by the same attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">An August 25, 2010 memo from a Bureau social worker noted A.M. reported that A.R. frequently masturbated to the point of causing rawness and abrasions. A.R. told the social worker that he missed A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">In September 2010, Parents moved for an order prohibiting visitation between the Minors. The Bureau filed a response thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">In October 2010, the Bureau filed an amended section 300 petition regarding A.M. alleging that Mother failed to provide medical care resulting in A.M.\u2019s hospitalizations and a life-threatening emergency and failed to protect A.M. from James\u2019s molestation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Bureau also filed a second amended section 300 petition regarding A.R. alleging that Parents neglected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>his medical needs, and he was at risk of sexual abuse by James as a result of James\u2019s sexual abuse of A.M. It also noted Parents failed to acknowledge and seek treatment for A.R.\u2019s behavior of masturbating to the point of hurting his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">On December 10, 2010, the court ordered supervised monthly visitation between the Minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\n<em>December 2010 Jurisdictional Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The Bureau\u2019s December 2010 jurisdictional report regarding the Minors included various proposed witness statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A.M. would testify she obtained permission to live with a family friend whose home environment was less stressful than living with Mother and A.R. A.M. would also testify that during the relevant period James committed vaginal and anal penetration and oral copulation, and asked her to orally copulate him. A.M.\u2019s friend since third grade, Teresa B.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would testify that during an eighth grade art class, A.M. was upset and crying. When asked by Teresa whether James had \u201cdone anything to\u201d or had raped A.M., A.M. nodded affirmatively. Teresa would also testify that she wrote in her journal about A.M.\u2019s being raped and abused by James and that the journal was with the Martinez Police Department. Mother would testify that A.M. never disclosed to her that she was being molested by James. As to the allegations regarding A.R., A.M. would testify that A.R. masturbated until his penis was raw and bruised and he had complained to her that his penis hurt. A.R. would testify that he told his attorney that he touched his penis sometimes and it hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\"><em>Police </em>Reports<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">An August 4, 2010 police report stated that A.M. reported that, shortly after the abuse stopped, she told Teresa she had been raped by James; A.M. had not told anyone else. An August 17 supplemental report stated that A.M. again said she told only Teresa about the incidents with James. An August 19 supplemental report stated that Martinez Police Investigator Fred Perrera attempted to contact Teresa, but she did not return his calls. Melissa told Perrera she had been in contact with Teresa, who said she would call Perrera, but Teresa did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>\n<em>Jurisdictional Hearing</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>7</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">Melissa</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">At the jurisdictional hearing, Melissa testified that she and Mother had been friends since elementary school. A.M. had been living with Melissa since May 2010. According to Melissa, the Minors are \u201cvery close.\u201d A.M. was A.R.\u2019s primary caretaker on a daily basis for the first three years of his life and he preferred A.M. over Mother when he got hurt. A.M. complained to Melissa about missing out on time with friends because she had to take care of A.R. A.M. told Melissa she had stopped taking the medicine prescribed for her Crohn\u2019s disease because she hated her life and wanted to die. A.M. also told Melissa she and Mother fought a lot and she was afraid of Mother. A.M. first lived with Melissa for a few months after a month long hospitalization. In May 2010, after living with Mother for five or six months, A.M. got sick again and resumed living with Melissa. When A.M. turned 17 years old, she and Melissa had a conversation about lying and telling the truth. Thereafter, A.M. told Melissa that James had raped her between the ages of 11 and 14. Melissa said that, the year before, A.M. had told this to Melissa\u2019s daughter, who was 13 years old at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. After A.M. told Melissa, Melissa told her boyfriend to call the police. A.M. then described the details of James\u2019s molestation to Melissa. A.M. told Melissa she had told Teresa about the molestation during junior high school, while the molestation was occurring. Melissa said she called Teresa\u2019s mother that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">A.M. testified she began taking primary care of A.R. when he was three months old and Mother went back to work. She described her relationship with him as \u201cvery strong\u201d and said she was \u201cpractically his mom.\u201d After A.M. got sick and was hospitalized, \u201cCPS\u201d (child protective services) told Mother A.M. had to go to school and could not stay home to watch A.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">A.M. described in detail James\u2019s molestation of her beginning at age 10 or 11. She said that at a certain point Mother told her Mother and James were fighting and were no longer having sexual relations. A.M. said she eventually told her best friend, Teresa, that James had raped her. She said she may have told Teresa that it only occurred one time, but she could not remember. She also admitted that she falsely told Teresa that during the rape she was screaming \u201cno.\u201d She testified she knew it was wrong, but allowed it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>initiated sex with James 30 to 40 percent of the time. A.M. said Teresa complied with her request not to tell anyone. A.M. said when she was about 13 years old she started telling James she wanted the sex with him to stop and she stopped initiating it. When she began menstruating at age 14, James stopped having sex with her. A.M. said that, when she was 15 or 16 years old, she told her friend \u201cMaurice\u201d about the sex with James. Thereafter, Melissa read about it in one of A.M.\u2019s diaries. When Melissa asked if A.M. had been molested by James, A.M. answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">On cross-examination by the Minors\u2019 counsel as to whether she ever observed A.R. masturbating, A.M. said she saw him touching his penis, but was not sure whether he was masturbating. She had seen A.R.\u2019s penis when it was \u201cred\u201d but not \u201cwhere it got bad, because [she] heard [Mother] and [James] talking about how it got really bad and it was bleeding and how they had to put Vaseline on it, and they had to be careful when they washed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">On cross-examination by Parents\u2019 counsel, A.M. said she was a virgin when James first molested her. She said that, in April 2007, when she talked to her high school counselor about being physically abused by Mother, she did not tell the counselor about the molestation because James would go to jail and Mother would be angry at her. A.M. said she falsely told the Bureau social worker she had had sex in the sixth or seventh grade with someone a year or two older than she. In fact, she was having sex with James at that time. A.M. said that, because she did not want to think about the past, she falsely told her pediatrician in January 2010 that she had not yet been sexually active, but had a boyfriend and wanted to \u201cprepare.\u201d She also said that while hospitalized in June 2009, she requested to talk with a hospital social worker about the child protective services process because she did not want to live with Mother and wanted to get \u201caway from her.\u201d During the meeting, A.M. did not tell the social worker she had been molested by James because she did not want to have to go to court, did not want James to \u201cget in trouble,\u201d and did not want Mother to \u201chate [her] forever.\u201d A.M. also testified that, when she was admitted to the hospital in March 2010, she answered \u201cno\u201d to the question whether she had ever felt afraid of a family member or had been physically hurt or felt threatened in a relationship. The parties stipulated that when A.M.\u2019s doctors inquired whether she had suffered sexual abuse, she did not report being molested by James.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Gentry</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Bureau social worker Roslyn Gentry testified she had been involved with this case since October 2010. She said that sibling visitation between the Minors had not occurred because Mother had not responded to her calls to set up the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Mother testified that, when she worked nights, A.M. cared for A.R. after school for about three hours until James came home. After being hospitalized in 2009 and telling the social worker that caring for A.R. was stressful, A.M. never again took care of A.R. Mother said that after James was arrested, social workers informed Mother that A.M. wanted to visit A.R. Mother did not think visitation was a good idea because she was concerned about what A.M. would say about James and who would supervise the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Mother said she was unaware of anything inappropriate regarding the relationship between A.M. and James and had no indication from either of them that James was molesting A.M. A.M. never indicated to Mother she was uncomfortable with James and told Mother she was a virgin. Mother said she never saw A.R.\u2019s penis red and raw from masturbation and never saw any injury to his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">On cross-examination, Mother testified that the Minors had a strong relationship during the first few years of A.R.\u2019s life. She denied refusing visits between the Minors and said A.M. had two visits with A.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">James</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">James testified he lived with Mother from early 2003 until his 2010 arrest. He denied all of A.M.\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse. He said A.M.\u2019s testimony that she started taking care of A.R. when he was three months old was not true. He said A.M. babysat A.R. four to six hours a week for about a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">During closing arguments, the Bureau\u2019s counsel, Marke Estis, argued that A.M.\u2019s testimony regarding the sexual abuse was \u201cvery believable\u201d and she had no motivation to lie. In particular, Estis noted that the Bureau\u2019s December 2010 jurisdictional report stated that, in the eighth grade, A.M. had told her schoolmate, Teresa, about James\u2019s molestation. Estis argued that Teresa\u2019s statement was not objected to and, therefore, the court should accept it as though Teresa had testified at the hearing. Estis argued that Teresa\u2019s statement corroborated Melissa\u2019s testimony that A.M. told Melissa she had told Teresa about the molestation while it was occurring. The Minors\u2019 counsel also argued that A.M.\u2019s allegations were credible and the amended petitions should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>In arguing that the petitions should be dismissed, Parents\u2019 counsel asserted that A.M. was manipulative, and her testimony was inconsistent and not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Jurisdictional Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">At the commencement of its oral statements following the jurisdictional hearing, the court stated that it had read \u201cliterally every single page of every single exhibit.\u201d It found that A.M. lies and manipulates people to get her way, and there were numerous lies and inconsistencies in her testimony. It noted that Teresa, Maurice, and Melissa\u2019s daughter were not called to testify at the hearing, and A.M.\u2019s diary, allegedly containing information about the molestation, was not produced. The court found that A.M. was not credible, trustworthy, or reliable, and it did not sustain the sexual abuse (\u00a7 300, subd. (d)) or failure to support (\u00a7 300, subd. (g)) allegations in A.M.\u2019s petition. The court sustained only the allegation in A.M.\u2019s petition, under section 300, subdivision (b), that Mother failed to provide and ensure medical care resulting in A.M.\u2019s hospitalizations and a life-threatening medical emergency. It found not true all of the allegations in A.R.\u2019s petition and ordered it dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">\n<em>February 2011 Dispositional Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">The Bureau\u2019s February 2011 dispositional report recommended that A.M. be adjudged a ward of the juvenile court and reunification services be offered to Mother. The report stated that A.M. was still residing with a nonrelated extended family member and A.R. was residing with Mother and James. It also stated that A.M. had had very little contact with A.R. In February 2011, A.M. had three social worker supervised visits with A.R., which went well. A.M. did not speak negatively about Mother during the visits. However, thereafter, Parents decided they did not want to continue the visits; calls to Mother and her attorney were not returned and visits did not resume. The social worker concluded that it would be in the Minors\u2019 interests to maintain their relationship, which the social worker described as \u201csignificant.\u201d The report requested that Parents make A.R. available for visitation with A.M. and commit to a consistent visitation schedule. However, the Bureau\u2019s recommended order did not include visitation between the Minors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>\n<em>March 2011 Dispositional Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">At the March 21, 2011 dispositional hearing, Mother\u2019s counsel argued that Parents requested there should be no visitation between the Minors until A.M. had undergone a certain number of therapeutic appointments. The court refused the request. Mother\u2019s counsel informed the court that Parents had \u201csplit up\u201d and James and A.R. had relocated to Texas. Mother said she agreed to A.R.\u2019s relocation. A.M.\u2019s counsel stated that A.M.\u2019s primary concern was that she be able to see A.R. The court ordered A.M. to have twice monthly supervised visitation with A.R., to be paid for by Parents, but acknowledged such visits are unlikely unless James and A.R. return from Texas. The court ordered Mother to advise the Bureau if A.R. is in town. The court\u2019s written dispositional order specified that A.M. is to have supervised visitation with Mother, A.R., and Robert M. As to A.R., it specified twice monthly one-hour visits. Responsibility for payment of supervision during visits is not mentioned in the written dispositional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">I. <em>The Minors\u2019 </em>Appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">II. <em>James\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">James contends the court lacked authority to order visitation between the Minors and, therefore, the visitation order is voidable. He argues that since A.R.\u2019s dependency petition was dismissed without a finding of jurisdiction, the court had no authority over A.R. James also argues that since he is not the father of A.M., he was not subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">A., B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">C. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">James contends the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in ordering supervised visitation between the Minors and in ordering James to facilitate and pay for those supervised visits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> James argues that because he is not A.M.\u2019s parent and because the court dismissed A.R.\u2019s dependency petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>without adjudging A.R. a dependent child of the court, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and in personam jurisdiction over James and A.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">\u201c \u2018A judgment is void if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction \u201crelates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it.\u201d [Citation.] Lack of jurisdiction in this \u201cfundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.\u201d [Citation.] [\u00b6] In a broader sense, lack of jurisdiction also exists when a court grants \u201crelief which [it] has no power to grant.\u201d [Citations.] Where, for instance, the court has no power to act \u201cexcept in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites,\u201d the court acts without jurisdiction in this broader sense. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] \u2018The consequences of an act beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the fundamental sense differ from the consequences of an act in excess of jurisdiction. An act beyond a court\u2019s jurisdiction in the fundamental sense is void; it may be set aside at any time and no valid rights can accrue thereunder. In contrast, an act in excess of jurisdiction is valid until set aside, and parties may be precluded from setting it aside by such things as waiver, estoppel, or the passage of time. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Andres G. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 476, 482 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 285] <em>(Andres </em>G.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">\u201cIn dependency proceedings, \u2018 \u201c[a] superior court convened as and exercising the special powers of a juvenile court is vested with jurisdiction to make only those limited determinations authorized by the legislative grant of those special powers.\u201d [Citations.] In the absence of such specific statutory authorization, a juvenile court is vested with authority to make only those determinations which are \u201cincidentally necessary to the performance of those functions demanded of it by the Legislature pursuant to the Juvenile Court Law.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Silvia R. </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 337, 345-346 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">The filing of A.R.\u2019s dependency petition vested the juvenile court with subject matter jurisdiction, i.e., the inherent authority to deal with the case or the matter before it. <em>(Andres G., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 482.) When the court dismissed A.R.\u2019s petition following the jurisdictional hearing, A.R. was no longer in need of the juvenile court\u2019s protection and its jurisdiction over him terminated. (See <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 789, 794 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 578] [exercise of juvenile court jurisdiction must be based on existing and reasonably foreseeable future harm to minor\u2019s welfare].)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>Thereafter, the subject visitation order was made by the court following the dispositional hearing in A.M.\u2019s case. At that hearing, the court had jurisdiction over A.M., not A.R. And, since James is not A.M.\u2019s father, the court had no jurisdiction over him at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Moreover, there is no statutory provision requiring sibling visitation in these circumstances. Section 361.2, subdivision (i) provides: \u201cWhere the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to Section 361, the court shall consider whether there are any <em>siblings under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, </em>the nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings, the appropriateness of developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to Section 16002, and the impact of the sibling relationships on the child\u2019s placement and planning for legal permanence.\u201d (Italics added.) Because A.R. was not under the court\u2019s jurisdiction at the time of A.M.\u2019s dispositional hearing, this section is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">In support of the court\u2019s visitation order, the Bureau relies on section 388, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which permits a person who desires a sibling relationship with a child, who is either a dependent of the juvenile court or the subject of a dependency petition, to petition the court to assert that relationship and seek, inter alia, visitation with the dependent child.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Although no such section 388 petition by or on behalf of A.R. was filed in this case, the Bureau asserts, with no citation to the record, \u201c[tjhis is in effect what happened at [A.M.\u2019s dispositional] hearing.\u201d At A.M.\u2019s dispositional hearing, her counsel stated that being able to visit A.R. was of \u201cprimary concern\u201d to A.M. However, nothing in the record reflects any request, formal or informal, from A.R. Further, section 388, subdivision (b) expressly requires the filing of a verified petition on behalf of a person seeking sibling visitation with a dependent of the juvenile court. Since no such petition was filed here, that section is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Since there is no statutory authority providing for A.M.\u2019s visitation with A.R., the court acted in excess of its dependency jurisdiction in ordering such visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The jurisdictional orders as to A.M. and A.R. are affirmed.
