Before Judge Cann. Chatham superior court. July 2, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">W. E. Norton brought an action'against John Bourke <em>&amp; </em>Son, a partnership composed of John Bourke and James A. Bourke, and against James A. Bourke individually, to recover $150 for medical and surgical services, claimed to have been rendered by the plaintiff for John Bafferty, an employee of the defendants. The petition alleged, that the services were rendered \u201cat the special instance and request of said defendants, as a firm, and of the said James A. Bourke, individually, for which services the said defendants, and the said James A. Bourke individually, then and there undertook and became liable to pay. The said services so rendered were necessary, and the charges therefor are reasonable.\u201d On the trial the plaintiff testified: \u201cI am a physician and surgeon. I am licensed to practice under the laws of Georgia. . . I had occasion to visit the foundry place of John Bourke &amp; Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-7\">. . Mr. Jim Bourke telephoned me . . to go down and see a man. He asked if that was Dr. Norton. I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 - He said, \u2018This is Jim Bourke of John Bourke &amp; Sons; come down, I have another man hurt.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right, I will come down right away.\u2019 I say it was Mr. Jim Bourke who telephoned to me, because he had telephoned to me about a week before; I recognized his voice immediately. . . T went down to the wharf and met Mr. Bourke, and he said to me, Captain Bafferty is injured on this boat, and I will show you where he is.\u2019 I went with him and found Captain Bafferty was in his bunk and unconscious; I ordered the ambulance . . and had him sent home; afterwards I had him removed to the hospital and treated him for his injuries. . . Mr. Jim Bourke told me to do the best I could for the injured man, and I told him that I would. It was his boat, I presume, the man was injured on \u2014 he took me down there. . . I never was Mr. Bourke\u2019s regular physician. I have done work for the firm. . . I had rendered professional services before at the instance of Mr. Jim Bourke. My services had been engaged by Mr. Bourke before over the telephone. Mr. Jim Bourke did the telephoning then. At that time I went down to Mr. Bourke\u2019s machine shops. . . Mr. Bourke asked me where I was going to send Mr. Bafferty. I said I was going to send him homo for the present and watch his condition.\u201d The witness further testified as to the nature of Baf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ferty\u2019s injuries, the medical and surgical services rendered, and the reasonableness of the charge made therefor. John Rafferty, a witness for the plaintiff, testified: \u201cI was employed on the tugboat Maude. . . I was master and pilot of the boat. I was working for John Rourke <em>&amp; </em>Son. Mr. James Rourke employed me. . . I sustained an injury. . . I had my skull fractured. I fell and had my skull broke. I don\u2019t know what caused me to fall. When. I fell I was about eight miles from here, on the boat. I was sick, and asked a man to relieve me at the wheel, and before he came I fell. . . After I fell I remember nothing. . . When I came to I was at the hospital. I was unconscious about a week, I guess. I didn\u2019t employ a physician to attend me. When I came to, Dr. Norton was attending me. . . Dr. Norton used to come to my house on some occasions for my stepson' \u2014 -he never was there for-me. . . I had never employed Dr. Norton for myself. I went myself to the marine doctor when anything happened to me. I would be treated free by the Marine Hospital service. . . I didn\u2019t pay Dr. Norton anything. He has never presented a bill to me. . . I didn\u2019t employ him or authorize his employment. To have free treatment from the Marine Hospital service, I would have had to go to the Marine Hospital. They would not treat me free if I wore home.\u201d \u2019 James G. Rafferty testified for the plaintiff: \u201cCaptain Rafferty is my father. . . My father was towing mud on the mud scow [at the time he was injured] . . . I got a message to go down to John Rourke &amp; Sons\u2019 place, which I did. I met, when I got down there, Mr. Jim Rourke. He asked me who was the family physician, and I said Dr. Norton; he said, \u2018You better telephone for him.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and I started to do it, and he said to me, \u2018No, never mind, I will telephone for him myself.\u2019 He went off and I went .aboard the boat. I found my father lying in the lower bunk. He was seriously hurt. Dr. Norton came there. We put my father in an ambulance and I went home with him in the ambulance. . . If I had gone to the telephone when I started, I would have bad to walk a couple of hundred feet, I guess. I am a cripple; I walk with a crutch. . . He (my father) had worked for him [Mr. Rourke] two or three or four months. My father didn\u2019t work for him after he got well.\u201d James A. Rourke testified for the defendants: \u201cI am a member of two firms. The machine and foundry business has three mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>bers in the firm; the firm name is Eourke &amp; Sons; the members of the firm are my father, my brother John, and myself. The firm of John Eourke &amp; Son is composed of my father and myself. This-firm owns the tugboat Maude and all floating property \u2014 lighters, tugboats, and so forth. This is the firm that owned the tugboat Maude at the time of the injury to Captain Ba\u00edferty. I got down there on the morning this accident happened, shortly after seven. Some time after I got down there I saw the engineer of the boat, and then it was I heard of the accident to Captain Ba\u00edferty. I sent a boy after his son. I went to see the old man; he was lying in the bunk. . . When I saw him the boat was lying at the wharf. . . When he [James Ba\u00edferty] came down, I told him the old man was hurt and asked him what he wanted done; . . he said, \u2018Better get the family physician.5 I asked who it was; \u2018Dr. Norton,5 he said. . . . Young James Ba\u00edferty is incorrect in his statement that I told him to go and telephone for a doctor and finally said no, that I would do it for him. I didn\u2019t offer to do that telephoning. I didn\u2019t do the telephoning at all. I didn\u2019t go to the telephone. . . Harry Singleton, a white man, who was engineer of the boat, was standing there at the time of this conversation; he went to have the doctor telephoned for. . . Dr. Norton is not my family physician. He does not do the work for Eourke &amp; Son. . . Dr. Owens is my father\u2019s physician. I knew that Captain Ba\u00edferty was a licensed captain. All steamboat people get their treatment free. All we had to do would be to send him to the Marine Hospital; . . you have to sign a printed slip to get a steamboat man in there, that is all. . . I had previously employed Dr. Norton to render services down there. That employment was over the telephone. I expect I did the telephoning' at that time. . . I don\u2019t think I said [to Dr. Norton] . . \u2018Do the very best you can for this man.\u2019 I would not be positive about it.\u201d Thomas J. Beytaugh, a witness for the defendants, testified, that he was bookkeeper for John Eourke &amp; Son at the time Captain Ba\u00edferty was injured, and that he telephoned from the office of John Eourke &amp; Son to Dr. Norton to come down there. He did not remember who requested him to telephone, but he had not seen James A. Eourke that morning before telephoning. The testimony of Henry Singleton, a witness for the defendants, was to the effect, that he was the 'engineer of the steam tug Maude when John Ba\u00edferty met with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>accident, and brought the boat to the wharf with him, and immediately sent for his son, James Rafferty, who, immediately upon his arrival, requested the witness to send for Dr. W. E. Norton, \u25a0who was the family physician; and that the witness went to the \u00aboffice of John Rourke &amp; Son and requested the bookkeeper to telephone to Dr. Norton to attend Captain Rafferty. James Rafferty \u25a0 denied that he requested Singleton to send for Dr. Norton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">A nonsuit was granted as to the partnership, as the bill of exceptions states, \u201cafter all testimony had been introduced by both plaintiff and defendants.\u201d A verdict was rendered in favor of defendant James A. Rourke. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, the motion was overruled, and he excepted, complaining of the .nonsuit and the refusal of a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-7\"><em>Twiggs, Oliver, Gazan &amp; Oliver, </em>for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A93B\">cited 103 Cal. 79 ; 92 Ala. 258 ; 95 Am.

When one summons a ;physician to care for another, rendered by sudden illness unable to act for himself, and to whom he stands in no relationship which -creates an obligation to furnish necessary medical care, and no express undertaking is entered into, then, from the mere summoning -of the physician and requesting him to care for the person who is ill, the law does not presume an implied promise by the one so acting to pay for the services of the physician summoned. Meisenbach <em>v. </em>Southern Cooperage Co., 45 Mo. App. 232 ; Jesserich <em>v. </em>Walruff, 51 Mo. App. 270 ; Smith <em>v. </em>Watson, 14 Vt. 332 ; Starrett <em>v. </em>Miley, 79 Ill. App. 658. In the last case cited, a woman who was, so far as appears from the report of the facts, a stranger to Starrett, ran into his house, wounded and bleeding, and fell there unconscious. He at once called in Miley, a physician, and directed him to the injured woman and told him to care for her. Starrett also had her carried to a room in his house. No express promise was made by him to pay^ the physician for the services rendered the woman. It was held that Starrett was not liable for the physician\u2019s services. In Boyd <em>v. </em>Sappington, 4 Watts (Pa.), 247, it was held that a request by a father to a physician to attend his son, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of full age, .and sick at the father\u2019s house, raised no implied promise on the part of the father to pay for the services rendered. In Crane <em>v. </em>Baudouine, <em>55 </em>N. Y. 256, the plaintiff attended as a. physician upon the daughter of defendant, sick at the latter\u2019s house. The daughter was of age, married and living with her husband,, but temporarily at her father\u2019s house, to be under the care of her mother. Defendant was present at the calls, gave plaintiff a history of the ease, and received directions for her treatment. He' told others of the visits and of his opinion of the case, assented to calling a consulting physician, and had previously employed other physicians to attend his daughter. Defendant testified that he did not employ or send for plaintiff. It was held that the defendant was not liable for the plaintiff\u2019s services. In Holmes <em>v. </em>McKim, 109 Iowa, 245, it was held: \u201cOne is not under any implied obligation to pay for the services of a physician called to attend a minor living with his family and supported by him, but: not otherwise related to him, though he acquiesced in the attendance and had on a former occasion paid the same doctor for attending the same minor, the physician knowing, however, the true relations of defendant and said child.\u201d . The doctrine is well stated in 22 American &amp; English Encyclopsedia of Law, 790. In Meisenbach <em>v. </em>Southern Cooperage Co., supra, Judge Seymour D. Thompson, delivering the opinion, said: \u201cThe reason and policy of this-rule are obvious. . . When a person is dangerously wounded and perhaps unable to speak for Himself, or suffering so much that-he does not know how to do it, . . any person will run to the nearest surgeon in performance of an ordinary office of humanity. If it were the law\u2019that the person so going for the surgeon thereby undertakes to become personally responsible for the surgeon\u2019s bill,, and especially for the surgeon\u2019s. bill through the long subsequent course of treatment, many would hesitate to perform this office, and in the meantime the sufferer might die for want of necessary immediate attention. Nor is there a common and fair understanding that the person making the request, or ordering it to be made, in behalf of the sufferer, under the circumstances assumes responsibility for the surgeon\u2019s bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The general rule is well settled that a master is not, in the absence of some stipulation, under any legal obligation to furnish medical attendance for a servant who falls sick while engaged in; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>his duties. 26 Cyc. 1049 ; 20 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L. 52 ; and see the valuable monographic note to the case of The Kenilworth, in 4 Lawyers\u2019 Reports Annotated (N. S.), 52, wherein many cases in point are collated. In <em>Sweetwater Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Glover </em>29 <em>Ga. </em>399, decided in the days of slavery, it was said: \u201cWhen \u2022one white man employs another to work for him, it is not \u25a0an implication or incident that the employer shall pay the employee\u2019s physician\u2019s bills; it would require an express contract to create that obligation.\u201d There are cases holding that there are exceptions to this general rule, but it is needless to cite them, as it is not contended that the case at bar falls within any of the exceptions. In view of the authorities noted, the evidence in the present case, \u2022considered in its most favorable light for the plaintiff in error, did not authorize a recovery against either the defendant firm or the individual member thereof against whom the action was brought. While it would have been better practice to have directed a verdict \u25a0at the conclusion of the evidence submitted by the parties, rather than to have granted a nonsuit as to the defendant firm, this is a matter of which plaintiff in error can not complain. As the ver\u2022dict was demanded by the evidence, it is not necessary to pass upon \u2022the exceptions to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj_\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AUh\">\n<em>All the Justices concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
