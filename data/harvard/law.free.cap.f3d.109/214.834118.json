McDowell pleaded guilty to maldng, uttering, and possessing counterfeit securities in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). McDowell appeals the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwards from the sentencing guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">The defendant was employed as a bookkeeper by David M. Munson, Incorporated (DMMI) from February 1994 to October 1995. In the course of performing this job, it fell upon her to pay the bills of the company using DMMI checks. Between May 13,1994 and October 15, 1995, McDowell altered over $290,000 of DMMI checks and deposited the funds into her accounts at Bank United Texas in DaEas. The entirety of these funds was spent on personal expenses. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>McDowell, the money enabled her to purchase clothes for her children, go on vacations, renovate her home, and repair her automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In the presentencing report, the probation officer recommended a base offense level of six under \u00a7 2Fl.l(a) of the sentencing guidelines, an eight level increase under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(I) because the amount embezzled exceeded $200,000 but was less than $350,000, a two level increase under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2) because the offense involved more than minimal planning, a two level increase under \u00a7 3B1.3 for McDowell\u2019s role in the offense, no adjustment for obstruction of justice, and a three level decrease under \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a)and (b)(1) for acceptance of responsibility. Based on these recommendations, the probation officer calculated a total offense level of 15 and a level I criminal history category. These figures yield an imprisonment range of 18 to 24 months. McDowell had no objection to the presentencing report.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u2022 During a sentencing hearing on July 8, 1996, McDowell informed the court that she had been caught embezzling from a previous employer only two months before she began working for DMMI. McDowell stated that the total amount embezzled was $10,000 and acknowledged that her prior conduct was exactly the same as that of the instant offense. No criminal prosecution resulted because the defendant\u2019s mother made restitution to the employer. The court informed the defendant that it was considering an upward departure because of McDowell\u2019s pri- or conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">At the third sentencing hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on July 29, 1996, the court asked McDowell to provide reasons why it should not depart upwards. Counsel for the defendant argued in favor of leniency, but did not directly address the issue of an upward departure. The district court adopted the recommendations of the presentencing report, yielding an offense level of 15 and a level I criminal history category. The court then departed upwards from the guidelines by increasing McDowell\u2019s offense level to 19 and sentencing her to 37 months imprisonment. McDowell did not object to the district court\u2019s method of calculating the upward departure, to the extent of the upward departure, or to the reasons given for the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Although failure to preserve an alleged error through contemporaneous objection generally precludes our consideration of that issue on appeal, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) allows us to consider plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights. Under this rule, a court may correct forfeited errors only when the appellant shows that: (1) there is an error, (2) the error is clear or obvious, and (3) the error affects the substantial rights of the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If these factors are established, the decision to correct the forfeited error is within the court\u2019s sound discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We may decline to exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">\n<em>Departure Under Which Section ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">The government urges that the district court\u2019s upward departure was appropriate and warranted under \u00a7 5K2.0 of the sentencing guidelines. McDowell, on the other hand, maintains that the departure from the guidelines was erroneous under the requirements imposed by this court for departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 of the guidelines. McDowell\u2019s brief makes absolutely no mention of \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">The roots of this controversy lie in the oral comments of the district judge at sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>As the government acknowledges, the district court mentioned \u00a7 4A1.3 in discussing the reasons for its departure. The court did not state, however, that the departure was being made under that section. On the contrary, the court\u2019s written judgment clearly states that the court departed from the guidelines under \u00a7 5K2.0 alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We are mindful of the long line of cases holding that in the event of a conflict between an oral pronouncement of judgment and a written judgment the oral pronouncement controls.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are similarly cognizant of the rule that an ambiguity between written and oral pronouncements is to be resolved by examining both statements to arrive at the court\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the present case, however, we find neither a conflict nor an ambiguity. Rather, we observe a definite statement in the written judgement that the departure was made under \u00a7 5K2.0. The record reflects merely an offhand reference during the sentencing hearing to the comments accompanying \u00a7 4A1.1 regarding justifications for departures under \u00a7 4A1.3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the court departed upwards under \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Justifications for the Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We turn now to determine whether the reasons given for the departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 amounted to clear error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The purpose of \u00a7 5K2.0 is to allow a district court to deviate from the sentencing guidelines where \u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court recently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">... [T]he Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a \u201cheartland,\u201d a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical ease, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">The statements of the district court at sentencing indicate that the court identified two factors that placed McDowell\u2019s case outside the \u201cheartland\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court first addressed the high probability of recidivism based on McDowell\u2019s prior extortionist conduct: \u201cI believe that this conduct, which is not taken into consideration by the guidelines adequately ... indicates a greater likelihood of recidivism on your part, inasmuch as it is precisely the same conduct.\u201d The problem of prior uncharged conduct is squarely addressed by \u00a7 4A1.3 of the guidelines.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That section allows for departure from the guidelines where \u201creliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... Such information may include ... prior similar adult criminal conduct not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>resulting in a criminal conviction\u201d. Although this section applies \u201clinguistically\u201d to McDowell\u2019s case, the district court found aspects of this case atypical. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">[Y]ou have uncharged conduct here that is not taken into consideration in any way. And the thing that strikes me is it is for exactly the same thing, exactly the same offense. You embezzled from an employer you were keeping books for. You were caught on the first one to give any person of a normal conscience a chance to be remorseful, certainly that would make an impression, I think, on most individuals that are caught, their family gets involved and they bail them out of trouble. They dodge the bullet, if you will, not having to go to jail and then it makes such an impression that two months later you\u2019re back out doing it again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The court, in essence, made a finding that particular aspects of this prior conduct \u2014 its proximity to the charged offense and its similarity to the conduct underlying the charged offense \u2014 took it out of the \u201cheartland\u201d of cases considered by the Sentencing Commission in drafting \u00a7 4A3.1. As such, the court concluded that departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 was appropriate. This decision regarding the typicality of cases is better left to the district court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As <em>Koon </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">... [T]he district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by it\u2019s vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing____ District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more guidelines cases that appellate courts do.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the likelihood of recidivism, in the light of McDowell\u2019s prior conduct, warranted an upward departure from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Nonetheless, we find troubling the district court\u2019s second primary reason for the departure. At the third sentencing hearing, the court pressed McDowell to state specifically what had become of the nearly $300,000 in embezzled funds. The defendant explained that she had nothing to show for it\u2014 that the money \u201cwas just spent\u201d. The court clearly was suspicious of this response.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge went on to explain his dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range, absent departure, when viewed in the light of the large amount embezzled. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">... Here\u2019s what just shocks my conscience. The offense level in this matter by the guidelines is 15 and the criminal history category is I, as I recall____ That provides for 18 to 24 months. If I gave you 24 months \u2014 you stole $292,000 that I want to doubt real serious you\u2019re going to have the wherewithal to pay back. So in essence what you will accomplish, if I give you two years, is ... you\u2019re in essence basically earning $145,000 a year____ So what Im saying is that giving you two years, I really question how much punishment that is, inasmuch as you have had the benefit, the use and enjoyment, as well as your family, of $292,000 of Mr. Munson and his family\u2019s money. So I\u2019m going to sentence you at an offense level of 19, departing upward four levels because of the similar uncharged offense ... and I\u2019m going to sentence you to 37 months. So now you\u2019re making 70 or 80 thousand a year while you sit in jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>This reasoning cannot be upheld. Section 5K2.0 was intended to allow departure based on a character or circumstance that places a case outside the \u201cheartland\u201d of cases considered by the Sentencing Commission. However, as stated in the commentary to section 5K2.0, \u201cIn the absence of [such a character or circumstance], a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. For example, <em>dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or preference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline </em>range.\"<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We cannot describe the above reasoning of the district court as anything but dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range. Consequently, the court\u2019s reasoning is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Despite the court\u2019s error in departing based on its own dissatisfaction with the available sentence, remand is not required to correct this error. Remand is required <em>unless </em>we find that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent reliance on the improper factor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here, the district court had the authority to make the departure based only upon the likelihood of recidivism. Indeed, the court\u2019s written judgment reflects this very conclusion. As such, although the court erred, we find the error to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>Extent of the Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The appellant next asserts that the extent of the departure constituted plain error. An upward departure should be affirmed if the district court provides acceptable reasons for the departure and the extent of the departure was reasonable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This circuit does not, however, require a district court to state with particularity the reasons for the extent of a departure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Viewing the record as a whole, we cannot say that the departure in this ease was unreasonable. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s upward departure from the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. A second hearing was held on July 22, 1996. At that hearing, counsel for the defendant informed the court that McDowell was under the influence of drugs (phenobarbital) and was not competent to proceed. The court remanded the defendant to the custody of the U.S. Marshals and set sentencing for July 29, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. <em>United States v.
