In Nos. 22, 23 and 24, respectively, motions to quash the indictments were overruled, but the court in each case sustained a demurrer to the second count of the indictment, which charged unlawful possession of an alcoholic beverage for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">No appeal was entered from the judgment entered in each case, and the appellant asks this court on the authority of the case of <em>Kaefer v. State, </em>143 Md. 151, 122 A. 30, where the appeal was taken from the verdict rather than from the judgment, to treat the appeal as if it had been taken from the judgment. But the record discloses no ruling during the trial of the case that is the subject of appeal. In the case of <em>Kaefer v. State, </em>the questions presented on appeal were the propriety of the lower court\u2019s ruling on a demurrer to the indictment and several exceptions to rulings of the trial court on the admissibility of evidence. Here the only point urged is the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling in quashing the search warrants in the respective cases. While we are inclined to the view that the search warrants and applications therefor were fundamentally sound, that the errors present were slight and inconsequential and not of sufficient importance to vitiate the warrants, we are not at liberty to pass upon the point. The motion to quash the search warrant was preliminary to the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>and even if the appeal in each case was considered as from the judgment, there would still be no ruling of the circuit court appearing from the record of the trial which this court could consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Under the circumstances, our conclusion is that the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal filed in each case should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed in Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 21f, with costs to the appellees, respectively.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
