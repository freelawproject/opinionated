It was admitted in the course of the argument in the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>peals by counsel for the appellant that at the hearing before the Orphans\u2019 Court both sides waived the court stenographer\u2019s services. The Charter and Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, 1938, in Section 497, provides: \u201cThe Judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the City of Baltimore are authorized and directed to appoint a Stenographer for that Court, who shall be a sworn officer of the Court, but shall be required to attend the sessions of such Court only when specially summoned by the presiding judge therefor. * * * In any proceding in said Court in which either party shall give notice that in the event of a decision of said court, adverse to the claim of such party, an appeal will be taken to the Court of Appeals, the presiding judge of the Court shall require the attendance of the Stenographer, whose duty it shall be in such proceedings to take full stenographic notes of all oral proofs and judicial opinions orally delivered; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">It is quite clear from the aforegoing section that counsel may waive the attendance of the court stenographer, and there is no doubt that it was done in this case when it was heard by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">There being nothing before this court which could form the basis for a decision of the issue raised, motion for dismissal of the appeal will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed in both cases, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
