The complainant alone accepted the executorship. Afterwards, being sick and wishing to be discharged from the trust under the will, he applied to his co-executors, and to the legatees and <em>cestui que </em>trust under the will, to consent to his discharge from the trust, and that the person principally interested in the property should be appointed trustee in his stead. They all consented except Steinbrenner, who refused because he did not intend to accept the trust, and would not therefore interfere. Amoux then filed his bill in this court to be discharged, and Steinbrenner put in an answer, in which he declined having any thing to do with the trust, &amp;c. It afterwards turned out that the estate was insolvent; and all the trust property was sold under executions issued in the lifetime of the testator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-9\">\n<em>I.
