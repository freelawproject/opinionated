If there are several parts of the answer or other proceeding in the cause, which are deemed scandalous or impertinent, each should form the subject of a *separate exception; with such references to the scandalous or impertinent matter, or the pages in which it is contained, as to enable the adverse party and the officers of the court to ascertain precisely what is considered objectionable. The exception in this case is defective in all these particulars, and ought not to have been allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
