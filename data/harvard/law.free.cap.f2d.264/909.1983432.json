It is used to remove grease, carbon deposits, engine \u201cvarnish\u201d and paint from metal parts, especially used engine parts. It is sold direct to users in steel drums containing from 5 to 55 gallons.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-16\">Registration has been opposed by the registrant of the words \u201cWhite King\u201d, displayed above an illustration of a playing card king in a circle, for soaps;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an illustration of a playing card King of Spades for washing machine soap;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an illustration of a playing card King of Clubs for soap; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cWhite King Cocoa Almond\u201d, with an illustration of a playing card king in a circle, for soap.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record also shows that opposer has advertised and sold its soaps, and other detergents, household cleansers and water softeners under the trademarks \u201cWhite King\u201d and illustrations of playing card kings throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-17\">The exhibits and testimony of the op-poser make it clear that its \u201cWhite King\u201d and king design trademarks are all used on consumer products for household use in dishwashing, laundering and other common uses of household soap, detergent and water-softening products. They are sold through the usual channels of distribution and with the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>consumer advertising suitable to such products.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">\u201cKarbon King\u201d is a dangerous product to use, blisters the skin, requires a special tank in which the parts to be cleaned can be dipped and is not even available for purchase by the do-it-yourself crowd. Technical salesmen solicit the orders from users after making demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">We believe the Commissioner\u2019s opinion accurately summarized the situation in saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-7\">\u201cIt is apparent from the foregoing that the marks are not the same, the products are not the same, the trade channels are not the same, and the average purchasers are not the same. Under such circumstances, there * * * is no likelihood of confusion * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Appellant argues that the \u201cbroad terms\u201d in which applicant has chosen to describe its goods are broad enough to embrace opposer\u2019s goods so that the \u201cproducts of the parties overlap in terms.\u201d We do not agree. When the instant description of goods is read in the light of the record it is clear that the goods are solvents in the technical chemical sense. Soaps are not solvents or even \u201ccleansing solvents\u201d in this sense and we see no overlap. The case of Intercontinental Mfg. Co. v. Continental Motors Corp., 230 F.2d 621, 43 CCPA 841, is not pertinent. It was there found that a listing of \u201ctractor parts\u201d was inclusive of internal combustion engines which commonly form parts of tractors. That is no precedent for a holding that cleansing, degreasing and engine sludge solvents includes soap or household detergents or water-softeners. Neither does \u201ccarbon removers\u201d in the context of this case, and when explained, include soap merely because one can wash off soot, a form of carbon, with soap.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">We conclude that though opposer\u2019s \u201cWhite King\u201d and playing card king designs may be very well known and even <em>known </em>to those who might buy \u201cKarbon King\u201d for industrial engine parts cleaning, \u201cKarbon King\u201d does not so resemble \u201cWhite King,\u201d \u201cas to be likely, <em>when applied to the goods of the applicant, </em>to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d Arguments predicated on the possibility that marketing practices might be changed at any time are not persuasive where they are dictated by the nature of the goods and hence cannot be changed arbitrarily. The opposition was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-11\">.
