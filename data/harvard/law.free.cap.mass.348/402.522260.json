The parties filed a \u201cStipulation as to Certain Facts,\u201d and the trial judge made a \u201cReport of Findings, Rulings and Order.\u201d The petitioners appeal from a final decree dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">The material facts do not appear to be in dispute. In 1962 John B. Clapp, Theodore M. Prudden and David F. Whelan were members of the board of assessors (board) of the town. There was a disagreement among the members concerning the refusal of a majority of the board (Clapp and Prudden) to reemploy one Herbert Adams, a professional appraiser, at the end of his term of employment. On or about January 30, 1962, Whelan (a petitioner in this case) wrote a letter, signed by him as a member of the board, to the Hingham Journal, a newspaper in the town, and sent a copy of this letter to another newspaper, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Quincy Patriot Ledger. This letter was \u201ccomplimentary\u201d to Adams and \u201ccritical\u201d of Clapp and Prudden. On February 1, 1962, the Hingham Journal published the letter and on the same date the Quincy Patriot Ledger published the letter \u201cin the form of a news story.\u201d In March, 1962, Whelan sent another letter to the Hingham Journal (which was also published in that newspaper) stating that the \u201cother members\u201d of the board had shown \u201ca complete lack of sound judgment\u201d in connection with the appraisal of a \u201cso-called shipyard\u201d in the town. After these letters had been published Clapp and Prudden \u201creceived inquiries from certain citizens of the Town inquiring as to their position on these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Thereafter Clapp and Prudden wrote a letter (signed by them as chairman and clerk, respectively) to each of the aforementioned newspapers stating their views \u201cas to the operation of the [assessors\u2019 office and . . . critical of Whelan.\u201d This letter was published on or about March 22, 1962. On May 18, 1962, Adams brought an action of tort for libel against Clapp and Prudden, alleging that parts of the Clapp and Prudden letter referring to him were defamatory. At the commencement of the tort action Clapp and Prudden requested the board of selectmen to furnish them with legal counsel. The selectmen refused their request, and Clapp and Prudden individually retained their own counsel. The tort action terminated favorably to Clapp and Prudden. (See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>346 Mass. 245.) On September 30, 1963, the town voted to reimburse Clapp and Prudden for the legal expenses incurred by each of them in defending the action for libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In the instant case the trial judge ruled that the \u201ccosts and expenses incurred\u201d by Clapp and Prudden were \u201cin connection with their official action as members of the Board of Assessors,\u201d and that the \u201ccontemplated expenditure by the Town ... is permitted by the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">It is well established that \u201ctowns and cities have power to raise money to indemnify their officers and agents against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>liabilities incurred or damages sustained in the <em>bona fide </em>discharge of their duties. . . . But the subject must be one concerning which they have a duty to perform, an interest to protect, or a right to defend.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>McAlvin, </em>109 Mass. 311, 312. See <em>Hixon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>190 Mass. 347; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>198 Mass. 221. We are convinced that the subject matters involved in the case at bar were of \u201clegitimate public interest.\u201d The acts of Clapp and Prudden \u201cas public officeholders . . , [were] publicly challenged [and they] were entitled to express their views on these matters which were within their special knowledge and responsibility.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Clapp, supra, </em>248-249.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u201cThe responsibility of public officers is to their constituents and the latter are entitled to know the reasons for official acts in order to judge whether the officers in question continue to deserve public confidence and support. The interest of the town in the matter clearly appears.\u201d <em>Mait-land </em>v. <em>Thompson, 129 </em>Conn. 186, 192. See, generally, 25 Col. L. Eev. 241-242. To hold that the contemplated expenditure is not permitted would, in effect, impose a rule of silence on public officials in situations like the one before us; a result which, in our view, is contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
