L. c. 170, \u00a7 49 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 246),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into a Federal savings and loan association. The Massachusetts Co-opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tive Bank League (the league) was \u201cadmitted ... as a party to the proceeding\u201d before the board. The board, in a majority decision, approved the application. The league then filed in the county court a petition for review of the board\u2019s decision. Home was permitted to intervene. A single. justice, without decision, reserved the case for the full court upon the pleadings and transcript and exhibits before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">1. This review of the board\u2019s decision takes place under G. L. c. 170, \u00a7 49 (see fn. 1), in accordance with standards of review set out in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8). See <em>Chicopee Co-op. Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Bank </em>Incorporation, 347 Mass. 744, 745. The league contends (a) that the board committed error of law by applying incorrectly the standard (see \u00a7 49, fn. 1) of \u201cpublic convenience and advantage,\u201d and (b) that the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">2. The <em>Chicopee Co-op. Bank </em>decision does not directly govern the present case. That decision (see 347 Mass, at p. 754), upon somewhat unusual facts, was that \u201cthe board\u2019s approval of the [Chicopee Falls Co-operative Bank\u2019s] application to convert . . . [was] in fact an approval\u201d of that bank\u2019s merger, at once after conversion, with another Federal savings and loan association.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held (at p. 754) that this virtual approval of a merger was \u201cin excess of the board\u2019s authority,\u201d noting, however, that \u201c [t]he board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>power to approve a true conversion is not curtailed by . . . [the <em>Chicopee Co-op. </em>Bank] decision.\u201d The present case involves no problems of merger in the guise of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In the course of the <em>Chicopee Co-op. Bank </em>case, the court discussed (at pp. 752-753) the standard of approval set out in \u00a7 49, viz. that \u201cpublic convenience and advantage will be promoted.\u201d We said that consideration must be given (a) \u201cto the convenience and advantage of a particular bank and its shareholders,\u201d (b) to the people in the \u201ccommunity who do business with it,\u201d and (c) to the effect of the proposed conversion \u201cupon the banking system as a whole and upon the public . . ..\u201d The burden is upon the applicant to show that the standard has been satisfied and that the conversion will promote the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">3. The board in its decision found that Home \u201cis the only state-chartered co-operative bank in Worcester,\u201d which is \u201calso served by one federal . . . association, five mutual savings banks, and five commercial banks.\u201d Home\u2019s 1962 assets (roughly $7,000,000)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201camounted to less than one per cent of the total deposits of $734,000,000 in the seven savings institutions\u201d just mentioned. The board referred to various disadvantages encountered by the bank because of limitations upon it by its \u201cco-operative charter\u201d (see Gr. L. c. 170) which prevented it from providing facilities and services sought by the public and available in other banking systems. Mentioned by the board was Home\u2019s inability (a) to offer attractive savings plans; (b) to take \u201cdeposits in substantial amounts\u201d which other types of banks could take; (c) to \u201ckeep pace with . . . demands . . . for mortgage loans\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because \u201cas a co-operative bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>it is basically restricted to single family homes whereas the . . . trend in . . . Worcester has been toward multiple family dwellings\u201d and because Home\u2019s \u201cborrowing capacity as a co-operative bank is not sufficiently great or elastic\u201d; and (d) to make certain \u201cspecial type loans, such as educational loans. \u2019 \u2019 Reference was made to further limitations upon Home\u2019s ability to compete for. business with other banking institutions. The board stated that, \u201cwhile there is no present prospect that the [b]ank is in [financial] danger, unless it can overcome . . . the disabilities of its charter, its future prospects for normal growth and continued service to the public are .not encouraging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The board expressed the view (1) that under \u201ca federal charter\u201d Home would be able to give improved and more varied banking services, offer \u201cmore convenient savings plans,\u201d and \u201cpursue more advantageous dividend policies,\u201d and (2) that it would \u201chave greater flexibility in mortgage lending policies . . . [and] strengthen itself through an increased borrowing capacity. \u2019 \u2019 The board also said that it did \u201cnot consider that the departure of one nine million-dollar bank\u201d could \u201cin and of itself either weaken the co-operative banking system ... or have such an adverse effect\u201d as to justify disapproval of the application. It concluded \u201cthat public convenience and advantage will be promoted by\u201d the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The board\u2019s conclusions are based on subsidiary findings, which in turn are supported by substantial evidence. Home\u2019s president testified at length concerning Home\u2019s financial affairs, the competitive situation among the savings institutions in Worcester, and the difficulties which Home encountered in competing with other types of institutions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for deposits and loans, in the light of building practices and the present savings and loan needs of the Worcester community.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The hoard was warranted in concluding that the conversion would be of advantage to Home and to its customers and to potential borrowers among the general public. The evidence revealed a demand in Worcester for broader services than Home was able to offer. The board could reasonably conclude from the evidence, reflected adequately in its findings, that Home\u2019s assets would be employed to greater public advantage, in the circumstances currently prevailing in the Worcester community, if Home should become a Federal savings and loan institution with more flexible powers. It was open to the board to take the view that, although Home was not in danger of financial collapse, the conversion would tend to accelerate its growth and make it stronger, to the general advantage of the banking structure as a whole. There was no evidence of any likely injury to the banking structure (either of all Massachusetts banks or of all cooperative banks in the State) if the application should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">4. The league argues that Home\u2019s application for conversion is based (a) upon its desire \u201cto compete in the area of \u2018big banking\u2019 \u201d and (b) upon the limitations imposed on Home, a part of the cooperative banking system established by Gr. L. c. 170. The league then argues that Home cannot be heard to contend that it should be allowed to convert to a different type of savings institution merely \u201cbecause legislatively imposed charter provisions do what they are intended to do: preserve the distinctive character of cooperative banking institutions, thereby necessarily fixing the outer limits of . . . the co-operatives\u2019 competitive activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">There is no doubt that the Legislature has provided that cooperatives, while they remain cooperative banks, shall comply with G-. L. c. 170 and follow the methods of operation prescribed for such banks. See <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Sissenwine, </em>259 Mass. 79, 81-82; <em>Lowell Co-op. Bank </em>v. <em>Co-operative Cent. Bank, </em>287 Mass. 338, 346. See also <em>Warsofsky </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>326 Mass. 290, 294. Section 49, however, is a clear statement that the Legislature is willing that this coop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>erative bank, by conversion to a regulated Federal savings and loan association, free itself from the restrictions of c. 170, if the public convenience will thereby be promoted. The power to approve conversions has been entrusted to the board (subject to judicial review as provided in \u00a7 49 and in c. 30A,. \u00a7 14). Home has merely asked the board to allow it to do what the Legislature has said in \u00a7 49 that it may do. Home is not improperly complaining about its charter, for so far as that charter incorporates c. 170, it includes \u00a7 49.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No error of law has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">5. A decree is to be entered affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-13\"> Section 49, as amended, reads, so far as pertinent, \u201cAny such corporation may convert itself into a federal savings and loan association . . . subject to the following conditions: \u2014 (1) Such corporation shall give notice to the board of bank incorporation of its intention to so convert and shall apply to said board for its approval of such conversion, and <em>if Vie board determines that public convenience and advantage will be promoted by such conversion, </em>the board shall grant such approval which shall be deemed revoked if such corporation does not consummate such conversion within one year after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>date \u00aef such approval. . . . [Then after provisions for notice by publication of a public hearing, the section proceeds] If said board refuses to approve such conversion, no further proceedings shall be had, but the application may be renewed after one year from the date of the refusal .... However, upon the grant of or refusal to grant such approval by the board, <em>the supreme judicial court, upon application of a person aggrieved thereby, shall have jurisdiction to review and to confirm or modify the action of the board </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Statute 1964, e. 386, approved May 13, 1964 (with an emergency preamble), reads, \u201cThe privilege of conversion . . . [see G. L. e. 170, \u00a7 49] shall not be exercised by any co-operative bank during the period of two years immediately following the effective date of this act, except one which prior to . . . [January 1, 1964] filed with the board of bank incorporation an application for approval of its conversion into a federal savings and loan association.\u201d This last provision exempts Home from the 1964 statute, because Home\u2019s application was filed in 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> This other association had its headquarters in Berkshire County and already had one branch in Hampden County (see 347 Mass, at pp. 746-747), so the problem of bank branches in more than one county was indirectly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> There was evidence that there were 168 cooperative hanks and that the savings deposits of all cooperative banks in Massachusetts (as of September 12, 1963) came to a total of $1,414,000,000. Home\u2019s total of monthly savings and profits, paid up certificates, regular savings accounts, and Christmas Club accounts was a little less than $7,000,000 as of January 31, 1963. The board might reasonably have concluded that Home\u2019s withdrawal from the cooperative bank system could not have significant effect on that system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\"> The board found that Home\u2019s inability \u201cto keep pace with the [public] demands\u201d was not the fault of its management which had kept bank expenses \u201cequal to or below the statewide average\u201d and had accomplished \u201ca steady but unspectacular growth. \u2019 \u2019 The board observed that the officers and directors were \u201csubstantial citizens . . . active in civic affairs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> No Worcester bank opposed the proposed conversion. Letters, in evidence from many of the banks in the community, expressed no disapproval of the conversion. The league offered \u201cno affirmative testimony\u201d but did seek postponement of the hearing and presented argument. Because the league was allowed to intervene as a party, it had full opportunity to bring to the board\u2019s attention any relevant facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\"> In view of the provisions of \u00a7 49, we have no occasion to consider questions such as those discussed (a) in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>251 Mass. 569, 612-613, or (b) in <em>Hopkins Fed.
