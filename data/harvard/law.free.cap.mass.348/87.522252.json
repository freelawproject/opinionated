G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1947, c. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>We herewith summarize the relevant facts found by the single member. On June 22, 1962, the claimant, who \u201cwanted a job for the summer,\u201d filed an \u201cApplication for Employment\u201d form with the employer (a manufacturing concern) in which the claimant stated that he had lived in the State for sixteen years. He also filed a \u201cReport of Physical Examination\u201d in which he had asserted his age to be sixteen years and nine months, although he was actually less than sixteen years of age. In a subsequent interview with one Frederick K. Whiting, vice-president and treasurer of the employer, in response to a question as to whether he was \u201csixteen, going on seventeen, he replied in the affirmative.\u201d No birth or employment certificates were ever obtained from the claimant or any other source. The claimant began his employment on June 25, 1962, and was \u201cassigned jobs on various machines between June 25 and July 11, 1962. \u2019 \u2019 On July 11, 1962, the claimant was assigned to work on a \u201chydraulic machine\u201d with \u201celectric controls\u201d and while operating it he injured his left hand. A claim for compensation was filed alleging, inter alia, that the employer unlawfully permitted the claimant to operate the machine while he was under sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The single member concluded that the employer \u201chad acquired sufficient information to apprise him of the minority of the . . . [claimant] at the time of his being hired, \u2019 \u2019 and that \u201cthe employment of [the] claimant . . . was in violation of provisions of Chapter 149 and constitutes serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the employer . . ..\u201d Double compensation under Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28 (as amended through St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9), was awarded to the claimant. It was agreed that the claimant \u201cwas injured in the course of his employment . . . and that as a result of the injury he is still disabled. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">1. The employer contends that the claimant \u201cis barred from recovery under the act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because he was not an \u2018em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ployee,\u2019 \u201d since \u201chis contract of employment was void.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 60 (as amended through St. 1947, c. 109, \u00a7 1), provides in part that \u201cNo person shall employ a child under sixteen years of age, or permit him to work in, about or in connection with any factory, workshop, manufacturing or mechanical establishment at any time. \u2019 \u2019 Similarly, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 61, relied on by the employer, provides that \u201cNo person shall employ a minor under sixteen or permit him to work in operating or assisting in operating any of the following machines: . . . (17) power punches or shears, . . . (21) upon or in connection with any dangerous electrical machinery or appliances, ... or in proximity to any . . . machinery or gearing while such machinery or gearing is in motion. \u2019 \u2019 According to the employer, it is the illegality of the employment under these provisions which denies any recovery to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">However, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28 (as amended through St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9), \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence, the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled. . . . <em>The employment of any minor, known to be such, in violation of any provision of sections sixty to seventy-four, inclusive, or of section one hundred and four of chapter one hundred and forty-nine shall constitute serious and wilful misconduct under this section\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). It seems obvious that violation of the very statutory provisions upon which the employer relies, in contending that the claimant cannot recover, operates by virtue of this section to qualify him for double recovery. The necessary implication of this section is that a minor employed as a consequence of the employer\u2019s unlawful conduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is an \u201cemployee\u201d with all the rights incident to that status under the act. Cf. <em>Pierce\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Case, </em>267 Mass. 208, 211-212; <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 148. See generally Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 47.52 (a)-47.52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">2. The employer also contends that the claimant is barred from receiving compensation because of his \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d in misrepresenting his age. The employer relies on G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27, which provides that \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of his serious and wilful misconduct, he shall not receive compensation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201cIn order to bar the employee his conduct must be both serious and wilful. The word serious refers to the conduct itself and not to its consequences. Wilful implies intent or such recklessness as is the equivalent of intent. This subject was . . . discussed and the cases collected in <em>Seaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432. In that case we directed attention to the definition of \u2018reckless disregard of safety\u2019 in \u00a7 500 of the Restatement: Torts as involving not only the intentional doing of the act charged, but also an easily perceptible danger of substantial bodily harm or death and a great chance that such harm will result.\u201d <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102,110. See <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 40. The act of the minor claimant in misrepresenting his age because he \u201cwanted a job for the summer\u201d does not rise to the level of \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d as that standard is defined in <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, supra. </em>There is not implicit in that act of misrepresentation \u201can easily perceptible danger of substantial bodily harm or death and a great chance that such harm will result.\u201d It is not like assaulting a fellow employee with a fork and thereby suffering a stab wound in return, <em>Houston\u2019s Case, </em>344 Mass. 754, or like a roofer\u2019s deliberate failure to work with a staging. <em>Silver\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 222. See generally Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">3. The employer would also deny the claimant recovery on grounds of public policy. In this connection, it is arguable that a possible hazard arising from a minor\u2019s misrepresentation of his age when applying for work is that he may be assigned to tasks which are too dangerous for him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>It may be conjectured that the employer would not have assigned the claimant to work on the machine had the employer known the claimant\u2019s true age and therefore would not have violated GK L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61. But this hardly furnishes a basis for avoiding the effect of Gr. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, quoted above. \u201c [T]he plain intent of \u00a7 28 . . . is to make the employer liable if he hires one, for the performance of the prohibited occupations, who he knows is a minor, even if he does not know that he is under the age at which he could lawfully be employed for the performance of such work. This accords with other provisions of the child labor law, imposing duties upon employers hiring minors to procure permits and educational certificates. Gr. L. . . . c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 86, 95. Restrictions upon the freedom of contract imposed in the interests of society in general and for the benefit of minors in particular must be observed by those seeking to avail themselves of the services of those under age.\u201d <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 150. <em>Juozapaitis\u2019s Case, </em>335 Mass. 137,140.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In the case at bar the employer knew the claimant was a minor and could have avoided the effect of \u00a7 28 by demanding and obtaining the employment permits required by Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 86 and 95,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before engaging the claimant to work in the manufacturing establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We are of opinion that the clear intent of the statutory provisions is to protect minors from employment in hazardous jobs and that the claimant is not barred from recovery despite the fact that he misrepresented his age to his employer. <em>Villapando </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn. 70 </em>Ariz. 55, 56-57. <em>Halfacre </em>v. <em>Paragon Bridge &amp; Steel Co. </em>368 Mich. 366, 375, 381. <em>Sackolwitz </em>v. <em>Charles Hamburg &amp; Co.
