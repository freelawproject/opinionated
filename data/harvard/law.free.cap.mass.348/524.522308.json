(corporation), and to purchase certain real estate. It also seeks, inter alia, an order directing the Licensing Board for the City of Boston (board)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to approve \u201cwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>out . . . reservations\u201d a petition for transfer of stock. The defendants filed a plea in bar and demurred to the bill. The board also demurred. The plaintiffs and the corporation appeal from interlocutory decrees sustaining the demurrers and the plea in bar,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The material allegations in the bill are as follows: Since 1934 the corporation has held a license for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages \u201cnot to be consumed on the premises.\u201d The capital stock of the corporation was owned by one Joseph Silverman until his death in 1951. The Probate Court thereafter appointed the plaintiffs to serve as executors and trustees under Silverman\u2019s will. \u201cFor many years,\u201d the applications for annual license renewals filed by the corporation disclosed that the capital stock was owned by the plaintiffs as executors and trustees. On January 25, 1962, the corporation petitioned the board, requesting a transfer of its license to a building owned by the plaintiffs near the original location of the liquor store operated by the corporation. The board held a public hearing on the petition and \u201cdenied . . . [the] application for transfer without assigning any reasons. \u2019 \u2019 The corporation thereupon appealed to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which remanded the matter to the board on July 10, 1962, recommending that the transfer be granted. On September 24, 1962, the board approved the transfer of th\u00e9 license \u201cwith a reservation as to whether an executor or trustee may own stock in a corporate licensee.\u201d On November 28, 1962, the corporation applied to the board for a reneAval of its license for the year 1963. After a hearing on the matter, the corporation was notified, on De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>cember 31, 1962, that the board \u201cvoted to renew the license <em>... in order to prevent undue hardship pending any future legal determination of questions of law raised at the hearing\u201d </em>(emphasis in original), and that the board \u201creserves its rights to pursue the legal status of this license, notwithstanding the above action taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">On February 21, 1963, the plaintiffs, as executors and trustees, \u201centered into written agreements\u201d with one of the defendants for purchase by him of the stock in the corporation and of the real estate to which the corporation\u2019s liquor license had been previously transferred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agreements provided, inter alia, that \u201cAfter final and legal effective approval of all the applicable licensing authorities has been obtained to the change of officers, directors, and stockholders . . . then the parties agree to have all their respective papers ready to pass papers and will make the respective payments and transfers . . . provided further that no appeals or other legal proceedings shall then be pending in connection with this agreement or said agreement pertaining to the real estate. In the event that all such approvals of the [licensing [a]uthorities . . . cannot be obtained on or before . . . [April 12, 1963]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as hereinbefore set forth, through no fault of the parties, then the deposit shall be returned, this agreement shall become null and void, and the parties placed in status quo without further obligation to each other. . . . The consummation of this purchase and sale agreement [as to the real estate] is contingent upon the consummation of . . . [the] purchase and sale \u25a0agreement . . . pertaining to the sale of the shares of stock .... In the event said agreement shall not be consummated for any reason, then this agreement shall become automatically null and void . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Appropriate petitions were filed with the board requesting permission to transfer the stock to the defendants. On April 8, 1963, the board notified the corporation of its de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>cisi\u00f3n \u201cto approve the transfer of stock\u201d \u201csubject to the conditions under which the license of . . . [the] corporation was renewed.\u201d In this connection, the board cited \u201cthe conditions that it reserve its rights to pursue to an ultimate determination certain legal questions raised surrounding this particular license.\u201d The board stated that it \u201cdoes not waive these conditions or any effect an adverse determination may have upon the license.\u201d The defendants thereupon refused to consummate the purchase on the ground that the \u201creservations\u201d stated by the board \u201cimposed a cloud on the title\u201d of the plaintiffs. Counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants subsequently \u201cendeavored unsuccessfully\u201d to convince one of the members of the board \u201cof the impropriety\u201d of the reservations. \u201cA serious controversy and dispute exists\u201d between the plaintiffs and the defendants regarding the consummation of the \u201cpurchase and sale agreements, \u201d and between the plaintiffs and the board \u201cas to the propriety and legality of their conduct in this matter and specifically whether an executor or trustee may lawfully hold title to the capital stock issued by a corporation which is licensed under General Laws Chapter 138 Section 15, as amended. \u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In the prayers of their bill, the plaintiffs seek: \u201c2. ... an order and decree . . . directing the . . . [defendants] to perform and carry out forthwith all the Buyer\u2019s obligations and agreements contained in said, purchase and sale agreements dated February 21,1963, as amended. 3. ... an order and decree . . . that the ninth paragraph of Section 23, as amended, of Chapter 138 of the General Laws does not prohibit an executor or trustee from owning stock issued by a corporation which is a licensee under Section 15, as amended, of said Chapter 138. 4. ... an order and decree . . . directing the . . . [board] to approve the petition for transfer of stock without the reservations</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I. The defendants demurred to the bill on several grounds. \u201cIf any ground is good, the demurrer should be sustained.\u201d <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>347 Mass. 21, 22. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>only ground which is argued in the defendants\u2019 brief is that the bill shows \u201cthat the . . . [plaintiffs] were unable to deliver to . . . [the defendants] final and legal effective approval of all of the applicable licensing authorities by the date on which the sale of the . . . capital stock was to be consummated, through no fault of . . . [the defendants].\u201d In this regard, the defendants contend, inter alia, that the board\u2019s approval of the transfer of stock was not \u201cfinal.\u201d On the other hand, the plaintiffs argue that the board <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>discharged . . . [its] authority in the matter by . . . [approving] the transfer of the stock and the change of officers and directors,\u201d and that the board\u2019s reservations \u201chad no legal effect whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The agreements of the parties require \u201cfinal and legal effective approval of all the applicable licensing authorities . . . to the change of officers, directors, and stockholders\u201d before April 12, 1963. By the express terms of the agreements such approval is a condition precedent to performance by the defendants. Absent the occurrence of that approval before April 12,1963, the agreements \u201c shall become null and void.\u201d With these provisions in mind, we note that the board\u2019s approval of the transfer of the license included \u201ca reservation as to whether an executor or trustee may own stock in a corporate licensee.\u201d In addition, although the corporation\u2019s license was renewed, the board emphasized the reservation of \u201cits rights to pursue the legal status of . . . [the] license, notwithstanding\u201d the renewal. Similarly, the board approved the transfer of stock, but \u201csubject to the conditions under which the license . . . was renewed.\u201d It again reserved \u201cits rights to pursue to an ultimate determination certain legal questions , . . surrounding . . . [the] license,\u201d and negated any intention to waive \u201cthese conditions or any effect an adverse determination may have upon the license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We do not here consider the propriety or, legality of the board\u2019s actions in approving renewals and transfers with \u201cconditions\u201d and reservations. However, these approvals seem tentative. It is apparent that the board considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>doubtful the legal status of the license and its transfer, as well as of the transfer of stock. This doubt is emphasized by the allegation in the bill <em>that \u201c </em>a serious controversy and dispute exists\u201d between the plaintiffs and the board \u201cas to . . . whether an executor or trustee may lawfully hold title to the capital stock issued by a corporation\u201d which is issued a liquor license. We think that, for purposes of the written agreements, the board made no \u201cfinal and legal [sic] effective approval\u201d as to \u201cthe change of officers, directors, and stockholders. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that since the condition precedent to performance by the defendants under the agreements has not occurred, the plaintiffs cannot compel specific performance. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>187 Mass. 272, 279. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Chauncey, </em>214 Mass. 271, 274. <em>Warren </em>v. Stoneman, 276 Mass. 259, 262. <em>Be statement: </em>Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 374, 395. See <em>Muchnick </em>v. <em>Bay State Harness Horse Racing &amp; Breeding Assn. Inc. </em>341 Mass. 578, 582-583. On this basis, the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the bill was rightly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">II. The plaintiffs and the corporation in their bill seek \u201can order and decree . . . directing the . . . [board] to approve the petition for transfer of stock without . . . reservations . . .. \u201d Assuming, without deciding, that the question was properly before the court below, we are of opinion that, since the agreement to transfer the stock cannot be enforced, and since the defendants have refused to consummate the agreement, the occasion for determining the question has passed and there is now no actual controversy in the matter. \u201cThe possibility that the same issue might arise in the future and that it might be advantageous for the parties to have their rights determined in advance is not enough to call for the rendition of a judgment, which the future might show- was of little practical value and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>merely settled a matter that had become no more than a theoretical dispute. The . . . [question] raised by the bill . . . [has] become moot.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>312 Mass. 523, 526. <em>Monteiro </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Fal-mouth, </em>328 Mass. 391, 392-393.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The plaintiffs and the corporation purport also to seek a declaration upon a question of law, viz., whether Gr. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, par. 9, as amended, prohibits \u201can executor or trustee from owning stock\u201d of a corporate licensee under c. 138, \u00a7 15. It is probable that a declaratory decree on the narrow question just mentioned would not terminate all controversy between the plaintiffs and the corporation, on the one hand, and the board, on the other, so it may be that the board\u2019s demurrer might be sustained on that ground. Whether this is so, we need not decide. Nor need we decide whether declaratory relief is available against the board in this type of situation. The bill in equity basically sought specific performance and the great bulk of the allegations relate to obtaining that relief which has been denied. It does not, in any event, sufficiently allege the facts relating to the board\u2019s proceedings, and the nature of the evidence before the board, to present appropriately whatever controversies may still exist in which the board is concerned. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>312 Mass. 523, 526 (\u201cParties are not entitled to decisions upon abstract propositions of law unrelated to some live controversy\u201d). See also <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>346 Mass. 709, 715; <em>Selectmen of Truro </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd. </em>346 Mass. 754, 759-760.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory and final decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\"> Benjamin Goldberg, Sara R.

Tobin, deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> The defendants\u2019 plea in bar, filed on July 12, 1963, states that \u201cthere are pending before the Probate Court . . . petitions for the return of the deposits and cancellation of the agreements,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cthat the respective rights of the . . . [plaintiffs and defendants] will be determined \u2019 \u2019 therein. That plea was sustained by interlocutory decree on December 2, 1963. After having appealed therefrom, the plaintiffs filed a suggestion to the effect that the defendants\u2019 petitions in the Probate Court had been dismissed without prejudice. Because of the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to consider the appeal from the decree on the plea in bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> The other two defendants subsequently became eo-purehasers under the written agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> Date as amended by parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\"> General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 23, as amended by St. 1955, c. 652, provides, in part: \u201cNo stock in a corporation holding a license to sell alcoholic beverages shall be transferred, pledged or issued without first obtaining the permission of the local licensing authority. . . .
