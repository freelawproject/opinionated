L. c. 7, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1963,.c. 352. The respondent appealed from the order of the trial judge that a writ of mandamus issue. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">We note at the outset that \u201c[i]t is an elementary principle that mandamus will not lie where there is available another and effective remedy.\u201d <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>337 Mass. 758, 761. <em>Pioneer Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 195, 200. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. of Cambridge, </em>345 Mass. 257, 260. The petitioner\u2019s underlying claim is governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Mass. 482; <em>Wier </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Mass. 309. Cf. <em>Thomas Bros. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 384. The requirement of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 13, and c. 29, \u00a7 18, as amended, that certain demands against the Commonwealth for the payment of money shall be certified by the Comptroller before being paid, \u201cdoes not have the effect of enabling a party to try out the merits of an action at law in a petition for a writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. 336, 340. Even if the respondent\u2019s duty in this connection is \u201cpurely ministerial,\u201d his refusal to perform it \u201cdoes not affect the legal liability of the . . . [Commonwealth] on a claim [which might be] otherwise fully established.\u201d <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, supra. Seney </em>v. <em>Board, of Health of Northampton, </em>314 Mass. 272, 275. Cf. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 183, 185. We conclude that the merits of this case cannot properly be determined in this form of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Nevertheless, we think it appropriate to make the following observations:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner\u2019s right to receive a \u201cvacation allowance\u201d depends on whether, prior to May 29, 1963, he was included within the definition of \u201cofficers of the Commonwealth\u201d as used in Rule G-5 of the \u201cRules and Regulations Governing Vacation Leave,\u201d authorized by G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 28, as amended. That rule excludes \u201cofficers of the Commonwealth\u201d from the \u201cRules and Regulations Governing Vacation Leave,\u201d thus excluding them from a right to receive \u201cvacation allowance\u201d pursuant to Rule LV-8. According to Rule G-6, \u201c [T]he words <em>\u2018 </em>[officers of the Commonwealth\u2019 . . . shall mean a person who is in charge of or, in fact, the head of a department, division, commission or committee established by statute or who is in fact the appointing authority of such state agency, whose appointment must have Governor and Council approval, and is for a term, certain in duration, or the person approved by the Governor and Council to replace such head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>of department, in his absence.\u201d We do not here state whether, in onr view, the petitioner was within this definition, since we would prefer clearer evidence than is now before us on this record from which to make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We do observe, however, that the powers of the Comptroller are plainly set forth in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 13 (as amended), which provides that \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The comptroller shall examine all accounts and demands against the commonwealth . . . [with exceptions here immaterial]. He may require affidavits .... The comptroller shall make a certificate specifying the amount due and allowed on each account or demand so examined, the name of the person to whom such amount is payable, and the account to which it is chargeable; and <em>if it appears to him that there are improper charges in said accounts or demands he shall report the same to the governor and, council, with a separate certificate therefor. </em>He shall keep copies of all such certificates and transmit the originals to the governor, who, with the advice and consent of the council, may issue his warrant to the state treasurer for the amount therein specified as due\u201d (emphasis supplied). Regarding this section in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 183, 186, we said: \u201cIt is clear that the Comptroller himself has no authority to direct the withholding of payments. If he thinks that some charge is improper, it is then his function to report it to the Governor and Council.\u201d The statute is thus free from ambiguity, and our examination of the record reveals no defensible reason for the respondent\u2019s failure to comply with its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\"> See <em>Sisters of the Holy Cross of Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>347 Mass. 486, 492.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
