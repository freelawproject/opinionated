The trial judge heard the case upon a statement of agreed facts, and ordered judgment for Vappi for $4,084.36. Aetna appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In 1957 and 1958, coverage B of liability policies issued by Aetna to Vappi required Aetna to pay all sums which Vappi \u201cshall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to . . . property . . . caused by accident.\u201d Aetna also undertook to defend \u201cany suit against . . . [Vappi] alleging such injury . . . even if such suit is groundless\u201d and to \u201cpay all expenses incurred by . . . [Aetna and] all costs taxed against . . . [Vappi].\u201d Among exclusions from this coverage was liability for \u201cinjury to . . . any property arising out of . . . structural injury to any . . . structure due (a) to grading of land, excavation . . . filling . . . pile driving . . . caisson work, or (b) to moving, shoring . . . raising or demolition of any . . . structure or removal or rebuilding of any structural support thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the policy periods Vappi was building a women\u2019s residence for Boston University. On June 19, 1958, one Iovine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whose property abutted upon the construction site, brought a bill in equity against Vappi and the university, alleging that Vappi had wrongfully closed and excavated a sixteen foot passageway, which she was entitled to use for access to her land. The bill alleged that Vappi\u2019s acts \u201cresulted in . . . damage to . . . [Iovine\u2019s] land, building, and business\u201d and prayed for an injunction and assessment of damages for the injury to Iovine\u2019s \u201cland and building.\u201d Vappi did not then notify Aetna of the equity suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>On February 9, 1961, the bill in equity was dismissed when reached for trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 on the basis that . . . [lovine and the corporate plaintiff, see fn. 2] were no longer seeking relief under the original bill of complaint, but sought damages for alleged specific acts by Vappi.\u201d On the next day two actions at law against Vappi and the university were commenced. An action by Marjorie lovine, Inc. (fn. 2) sought to recover loss of business profits caused by the boarding up and excavation of the passageway. An action by lovine sought to recover for (a) withdrawal of water and soil from under her buildings and land causing them to settle, (b) some diversion of surface water onto her premises, and (c) damage to her land, buildings, and their foundations because of vibration from Vappi\u2019s use of trucks and heavy equipment close to her land.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Vappi in its answers in these actions asserted, among other matters, the defence of the statute of limitations. About this time Vappi notified Aetna of these actions and demanded that it defend them. At least as early as March 9, 1961, Aetna or its attorneys learned of the equity suit. Aetna agreed, after some correspondence, to defend certain counts, reserving the right to contend that the policies afforded no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Counsel for lovine and her corporation then asserted \u201cthat he understood . . . when he consented to the dismissal of\u201d the equity suit that \u201cthe defense of the [sjtatute of [1]imitations would not be raised.\u201d Vappi\u2019s counsel, without Aetna\u2019s assent, consented to a motion vacating the final decree. On April 25, 1961, Vappi (1) notified Aetna that the final decree had been vacated and that lovine was seeking to amend the equity proceeding into an action at law, and (2) demanded that Aetna \u201chandle . . . [the] motion to amend.\u201d Aetna declined to do this. The motion was allowed and later the equity suit was consolidated with a new action at law by lovine against Vappi. Aetna thereafter took no part in the defence of proceedings brought by lovine and her corporation. The defence was conducted by Vappi\u2019s own counsel. There was a verdict for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ants in the combined cases. Vappi\u2019s present action is to recover the reasonable fees paid to its counsel and for certain engineering services in connection with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">1. Aetna, in its brief, argues principally that the allegations by Iovine and her corporation did not state any claim based on \u201caccident\u201d which, in view of the form of coverage B and the excavation exclusion, Aetna was bound to defend. Beyond the bare statement that Aetna did not waive \u201cits rights arising from Vappi\u2019s delay . . . in notifying Aetna\u201d of the equity suit and \u201cfrom Vappi\u2019s revivifying of . . . [the] equity suit after . . . final decree,\u201d Aetna makes no argument based upon the procedure followed by Vappi and its counsel. Under our rules, the absence of adequate supporting argument makes it unnecessary for us to consider any possible contentions by Aetna based upon the delay in giving notice or upon such procedure. See Rule 13 of the Rules for the Regulation of Practice before the Full Court (1952), 328 Mass. 698, as amended on November 5, 1962, 345 Mass. 787.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">2. Aetna\u2019s obligation to defend is determined by the scope of the allegations made by Iovine and her corporation in the various proceedings. See <em>Fessenden School, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 124, 130; <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>346 Mass. 677, 681-682. No obligation to defend arose upon the original bill in equity which in substance merely asserted deprivation of access to the Iovine property as a result of Vappi\u2019s closing the passageway. In 1961 when specific negligent acts by Vappi were asserted, Aetna\u2019s duty to defend did arise if the allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>were reasonably susceptible of the interpretation that they asserted injury to property caused by accident and of a type not within the excavation exclusion (fn. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Paragraph 17, subpars. c and d, of the amended bill in equity, and counts 7 and 8 of the action at law in fact tried, alleged (a) negligence not with certainty limited to excavation activity of a type within the excavation exclusion, and (b) injuries and damage of a character not clearly confined to what had been caused otherwise than by accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Exclusions from coverage are to be strictly construed. See <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Equitable Safety Ins. Co. </em>12 Gray, 527, 528-529; <em>Dole </em>v. <em>New England Mut. Marine Ins. Co. </em>6 Allen, 373, 385-386; <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 670, 672-674; <em>McNally </em>v. <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>308 F. 2d 438,445 (6th Cir.); Couch, Insurance 2d, \u00a7\u00a7 15:92-15:94, 41:5, 41:374; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 7403, 7404. Cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>308 F. 2d 709, 710-711 (8th Cir.). Any ambiguity in the somewhat complicated exclusions must be construed against the insurer. See <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>343 Mass. 472, 474-475; <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 218, 224. The allegations, among other things, refer to injuries to land, buildings, and property caused by Vappi\u2019s negligence in failing to take precautions to prevent the diversion of surface water and harmful results from vibrations. Under such allegations proof could be made of various acts and omissions by Vappi and of injuries which would not neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>sarily be wholly within the excavation exclusion. See <em>Ma-goun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>346 Mass. 677, 681-682.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The somewhat general allegations by Iovine and her corporation would also permit proof of injuries which could be regarded, under our decisions, as caused by accident. Unintended or unforeseen consequences of reckless or negligent acts, and even of intentional acts, at least if not undertaken \u201cwith malice or intent to injure\u201d the person or property hurt (see the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>case, 345 Mass. 218, 223-224), may be within the definition of \u201caccident.\u201d See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 204-205; <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn. </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Cory. Ltd. </em>330 Mass. 640, 651-655; <em>Nichols &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>343 Mass. 494, 497; Couch, Insurance 2d, \u00a7\u00a7 41:6-41:24; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4492. Cf. <em>Wrobel </em>v. <em>General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. Ltd. </em>288 Mass. 206, 209, 210-211; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Lloyds Underwriters, </em>339 Mass. 627, 629. Cf. also <em>Kuckenberg </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>226 F. 2d 225, 226-227 (9th Cir;). This court will be slow to adopt any narrow construction of the term \u201caccident\u201d which will limit or defeat any coverage fairly intended to be given by a policy described by the insurer in such broad terms (\u201c [c]omprehensive [gjeneral [1]lability [p]olicy\u201d) as was this policy. The <em>D\u2019Amico </em>case recently reviewed the precedents and there is no occasion for repeating the discussion in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Cases like <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>219 Mass. 147, and <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>262 Mass. 522, relied upon by Aetna, were distinguished in the <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn, </em>case, 330 Mass. 640, 651-652, on the ground that the coverage of the policy there considered \u201cwas not' limited to accidental means as distinguished from accidental results.\u201d We need not now reconsider the cases (see annotation, 166 A. L. R. 469) thus distinguished, for the present coverage B includes \u201cdamages because of injury .to . . .. property . . . caused <em>by accident\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The breadth of interpretation given to the term \u201caccident\u201d by Massachusetts cases makes it unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>deal with Federal cases and cases from other jurisdictions cited by Aetna.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> For convenience this provision is hereafter referred to as the excavation exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> Marjorie K. Iovine owned the land adjacent to the construction site. Marjorie Iovine, Inc., a corporation, was tenant at will of the premises. It was also a plaintiff in the equity suit hereinafter mentioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> Aetna also suggests, without supporting authority, that Vappi \u201cis not . . . to be reimbursed for counsel . . . fees [and expenses] necessarily incurred\u201d by Vappi to protect itself against claims not within coverage B. Under Bule 13, this contention is advanced too vaguely to require our consideration. Belevant decisions indicate, however, that, until Aetna, during its defence of Vappi, narrowed the claims to those seeking \u201ca recovery that the policy did not cover,\u201d Aetna was not relieved from its obligation to defend. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>178 F. 2d 750, 753 (2d Cir.); <em>Christian </em>V. <em>Loyal Ins. Co. </em>185 Minn. 180, 182; <em>Globe Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Cos. Co. </em>39 Wash. 299, 305-306. See also <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Moritz, </em>138 S. W. 2d 1095, 1097 (Tex. Civ. App.); annotations, 41 A. L. B. 2d 434, 436-438, 49 A. L. B. 2d 694, 721.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Paragraph 17 of the amended bill asserts that Vappi \u201cperformed . . . negligent acts . . . which . . . caused . . . damages to the land, building, and business\u201d of Iovine and her corporation, including, in subpar. e, \u201celevating the grade of the [university\u2019s] premises\u201d which caused \u201csurface waters . . . to flow onto . . . [Iovine\u2019s] premises,\u201d and, in subpar. d, Vappi\u2019s use of \u201cinnumerable heavy trucks and other heavy construction equipment so that the vibrations and impacts of said trucks and equipment . . . cause[d] movements, cracks, and tilting in the foundation and . . . superstructure of . . .
