L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 93-116. The prior charter of Medford, St. 1903, c. 345, \u00a7 2, provided for \u201ca legislative body, to be called the board of aldermen.\u201d The permit sought was for an addition to a trucking terminal building on the petitioner\u2019s land in a heavy industrial district.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">The zoning ordinance provides \u201cSec. 19. No permit for . . . [various specific uses] or for anything permitted only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>under Sections eight and nine, shall be issued by the building commissioner until the application therefor has been approved by the board of aldermen as provided in Section twenty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Section 9 of the zoning ordinance provides in part: \u201cIn heavy industrial districts, subject to the provisions of Section nineteen, buildings and land may be used for any purposes, except dwellings . . ..\u201d The record does not expressly foreclose the possibility that a trucking terminal building was permitted under some section of the ordinance other than \u00a7 9. But the trial, however, proceeded on the basis that \u00a7 9 was before the court and that no sections other than 9, 19 and 20 were relevant and we decide the appeal accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Section 19 of the ordinance reserves to the legislative branch of the city a part of the delegated legislative zoning power. <em>Building Commr. of Medford </em>v. <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>319 Mass. 273, 280-281. See <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of No. Andover, </em>337 Mass. 648, 651. Section 97 of c. 43, inserted by St. 1938, c. 378, \u00a7 15, provides for a Plan E city, in part: \u201cThe city council shall have and exercise all the legislative powers of the city, except as such powers are reserved by this chapter to the school committee and to the qualified voters of the city.\u201d General Laws c. 43, \u00a7 3, provides: \u201cNone of the legislative powers of a city shall be abridged or impaired by this chapter; but all such legislative powers shall be possessed and exercised by such body as shall be the legislative body of the city under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">We hold that c. 43, \u00a7 3, is applicable and that the reserved legislative power is now in the city council and not, as the petitioner contends, in the city manager, or his appointees, under G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 104. Compare <em>King </em>v. <em>Mayor of Quincy, </em>270 Mass. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">\n<em>Order for judgment dismissing petition affirmed..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
