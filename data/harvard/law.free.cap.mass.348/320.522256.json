(Great Scott), seeks to enjoin the defendant from using the name \u201cThe Big G\u201d in connection with any store or business within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The plaintiff is a Rhode Island corporation which first engaged in the retailing of food sometime in the late 1930s, doing business under the name of \u2018 \u2018 Great Scott Food Markets. \u2019 \u2019 A Massachusetts corporation was formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>several years ago and an additional store was operated in Fall River under the same name. Early in May of 1963, Great Scott began to convert its stores in Rhode Island to a discount method of operation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As each store was converted, at three to four week intervals, it was named a \u201cBig G Discount Food Store. \u2019 \u2019 On June 3,1963, the plaintiff registered the trade mark \u201cThe Big G Discount Food Stores\u201d in Massachusetts under G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 8, and a certification of registration was issued to it. In October, 1963, a seventh Rhode Island store was acquired (in Pawtucket) and was opened as a \u201cBig G\u201d supermarket. On November 6, 1963, the Fall River store was also converted to a discount operation under the name \u201cBig G.\u201d Continued expansion of the chain in Rhode Island, as well as construction of an additional store at Seekonk, Massachusetts, was in immediate prospect. For some time prior to trial consideration had been given to expansion into the Worcester area, but no negotiations for a specific site had been undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Accompanying the plaintiff\u2019s change in trade name was a transformation in merchandising technique to an \u201ceveryday low price concept\u201d whereby every item in the store was discounted for sale. An intensive advertising campaign to promote \u201cBig G\u201d was begun through the newspaper and radio media contemporaneous with the store conversions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was extensive use of billboards in the greater Providence area. Numerous trade journals carried articles on the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cBig G\u201d stores which, according to the plaintiff\u2019s treasurer, have been \u201cextremely successful,\u201d the dollar volume in sales having tripled.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The defendant, Sunderland Wonder Inc. (Sunderland), is a family-owned complex of five supermarkets operating in the Worcester area. On or about September 10, 1963, the largest of Sunderland\u2019s markets, all of which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>operated under the name \u201cWonder Markets,\u201d adopted the name \u201cBig \u2018G\u2019 Discount Foods\u201d and advertised \u201cAcross-the-Board Food Discounting\u201d in a Worcester newspaper. Officers of the defendant knew of the Bhode Island \u201cBig Gf\u201d chain and had visited the Warwick store prior to the opening of the defendant\u2019s \u2018 \u2018 Big \u2018 G. \u2019 \u201d The exhibits show close similarity between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s trade names and newspaper advertising.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The distance between that store of the plaintiff\u2019s in Bhode Island nearest to Worcester and the defendant\u2019s \u201cBig \u2018G\u2019 \u201d store is approximately twenty-five miles. A specialist in marketing, testifying for the defendant as an expert, stated that the \u201ctrading area\u201d of a typical discount food store in Mew England is no more than six miles; that no more than ten or fifteen per cent of such business would come from beyond such a radius; and that no more than five per cent would come from twenty miles away.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On September 10, 1963, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney served notice on the defendant, by certified mail, to discontinue the use of the name \u201cBig G.\u201d On October 17, this suit was instituted alleging unfair competition under G. L. c. 110, t 7A, inserted by St. 1947, c. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The court found that the name \u201cBig G\u201d \u201chas become associated by the general public with the plaintiff and has acquired a secondary meaning which is a valuable asset of the plaintiff\u2019s business\u201d; that the defendant \u201chas wrongfully assumed and appropriated the trade name \u2018Big G\u2019 for the purpose of appropriating for its own profit the reputation, good will and value connected with the plaintiff\u2019s trade name\u201d; and that the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cBig G\u201d has injured and will injure the plaintiff\u2019s business reputation and will cause \u201cdilution of the distinctive quality of the plaintiff\u2019s registered trade name and mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The defendant has appealed from a final decree enjoining it \u201cfrom using the name \u2018Big G\u2019 in any form or combination similar to the mark as registered by the plaintiff in connection with any food store within the County of Worcester, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">1. The plaintiff bases its claim to relief on G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A, inserted by St. 1947, c. 307, which provides: \u201cLikelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name or trade-mark shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of trade-mark infringement or unfair competition notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services.\u201d Under the principles stated in <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 740, and cases cited, we are of opinion that the plaintiff might in this instance be entitled to relief without reference to the statute. We note also, but express no view on, the possible applicability of the doctrine of reasonably expectable expansion of business. See Restatement 2d: Torts (Tent, draft No. 8, April 22, 1963), \u00a7 732. Since some question is present as to whether the defendant is or is likely to become a business rival of the plaintiff (see <em>Skil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 488), we conclude that the disposition of this case calls for application of the statute and that the plaintiff, falling within its express terms, is entitled to the relief granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">2. The defendant urges that the plaintiff has not shown the acquisition of secondary meaning in its Rhode Island trading area and that, therefore, no secondary meaning had been acquired in the defendant\u2019s trading area. Without expression of opinion as to whether we agree with the defendant in its contention that proof of a secondary meaning is requisite in order to gain relief under the statute (see <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Parkway Motor Sales Inc. </em>324 Mass. 151, 157), we are satisfied that in this case such proof existed. We cannot disagree with the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had acquired secondary meaning in the name \u201cBig G.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>fact that its business tripled in dollar volume sales shortly after the conversions is indicative of the success of its discount merchandising techniques and the impact of its name and style upon the public. That this took place in less than six months, although a factor to be considered, does not lead to a necessary finding of no secondary meaning. Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (4th ed.) \u00a7 38a. Where a promotional scheme such as that adopted by the plaintiff is initiated, the words which accompany it can achieve widespread repute within a brief period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">3. The defendant\u2019s contention that the name \u201cBig G\u201d is not sufficiently unique to warrant protection is without merit. \u2018 \u2018 [A] trade name is not to be resolved into its component parts, and each part analyzed separately in cases of this sort.\u201d <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Food Fair, Inc. 177 </em>F. 2d 177, 185 (1st Cir.), affirming 83 F. Supp. 445 (D. Mass.). That relief under the statute is not dependent on uniqueness of name is supported by the statutory history of \u00a7 <em>7A. </em>See <em>Skil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 489, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">4. The defendant challenges the finding that its use of \u201cBig G\u201d has caused and will cause injury to the plaintiff\u2019s business reputation and dilution of its trade name. Although the plaintiff operated no stores within the Worcester trading area, the defendant\u2019s appropriation of the name \u201cBig G\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> endangered the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and good will. See <em>Monroe Stationers &amp; Printers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Munroe Stationers, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 278, 280. There was testimony that people from Worcester traveled through the Providence area. It is not improbable- that they became acquainted with the name \u201cBig G\u201d and knew of the plaintiff\u2019s method of doing business and that upon their return to Worcester they would see the defendant\u2019s store and shop there in the belief that it was one of the plaintiff\u2019s stores. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>See Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 732, comment a. The statute upon which the plaintiff relies has expressly withdrawn \u201ccompetition between the parties\u201d and \u201cconfusion as to the source of goods or services\u201d as prerequisites to injunctive relief. Indeed \u201c [t]he gravamen of a dilution complaint is that the continuous use of a mark similar to plaintiff\u2019s works an inexorably adverse effect upon the distinctiveness of the plaintiff\u2019s mark .... This injury differs materially from that arising out of the orthodox confusion.\u201d Callmann, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d ed.) \u00a7 84.2, p. 1643. Cf. <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Polaroid, Inc. </em>319 F. 2d 830 (7th Cir.), construing the Illinois antidilution statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">5. Our view of the statute and the field to which it relates has been cogently expressed by Judge Learned Hand who, speaking in <em>Yale Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Robertson, Commr. of Patents, </em>26 F. 2d 972, 974 (2d Cir.), said: \u201c [I]t has of recent years been recognized that a merchant may have a sufficient economic interest in the use of his mark outside the field of his own exploitation to justify interposition by a court. His mark is his authentic seal; by it he vouches for the goods which bear it; it carries his name for good or ill. If another uses it, he borrows the owner\u2019s reputation, whose quality no longer lies within his own control. This is an injury, even though the borrower does not tarnish it, or divert any sales by its use; for a reputation, like a face, is the symbol of its possessor and creator, and another can use it only as a mask. And so it has come to be recognized that, unless the borrower\u2019s use is so foreign to the owner\u2019s as to insure against any identification of the two, it is unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to relief and that any use by the defendant within Worcester County of the name \u201cBig Gr\u201d will endanger the plaintiff\u2019s business reputation and cause the distinctive quality of its trade name to be diluted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal to the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> These stores were located (in the order of their conversion) in Pawtucket, Warwick, Wiekford, Cranston, North Providence and Providence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> Advertising outlets employed included the radio stations and newspapers of Providence, Pawtucket and Fall River, as well as a newspaper in Attleboro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> The plaintiff advertised as \"The Big G Discount Food Stores,\u201d the defendant as \"Big \u2018G\u2019 Discount Foods.\u201d In each case the name is contained within an ellipse differing only in that the plaintiff\u2019s is flat at either end while the defendant\u2019s is curved. The plaintiff\u2019s advertisements are black and white while the defendant has employed black, white, blue and yellow.

Y. S. 2d 196, 199. See also <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737, 740-741, where the fact that one of the defendant's organizers was known in the trade as-\u201cJay\u201d was held not to justify use of the name as a trade name detrimental to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
