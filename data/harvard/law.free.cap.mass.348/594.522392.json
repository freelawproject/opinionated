The defendant Desehenes made a subcontract with Bayer to do certain excavation work \u201cin strict compliance with . . . the [pjrime [c]on-tract\u201d which was incorporated by reference in the subcontract. The subcontract unit prices were lower than the prime contract unit prices. Under the subcontract all work was to start not later than November 24, 1958. Desehenes started work on December 1. The work was to be completed on or before March 1,1959, a period of three months plus one week. By June 22,1959, when he quit, Desehenes had completed only about half the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">The subcontract required Desehenes to \u201cfurnish a bond with surety satisfactory to\u201d Bayer in the sum of $91,000, \u201cconditioned that . . . [Desehenes] shall faithfully perform this [sube] ontract and satisfy all claims and demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>in connection with the performance of same and shall pay all bills contracted for ... in connection with the work . . . and shall reimburse . . . [Bayer] for all . . . expense which . . . [Bayer] may incur in making good any default of\u201d Deschenes. Deschenes furnished a bond of Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna) for $91,000, which incorporated the subcontract by reference, to indemnify Bayer \u2018 \u2018 against any loss or damage directly arising by reason of . . . [Deschenes\u2019s] failure . . . faithfully [to] perform . . . [the sub]contract\u201d and to pay claims for labor and materials, \u201csubject ... to the following express conditions [among others] ... (2) That upon receipt of written notice from . . . [Bayer] of [Deschenes\u2019s] default . . . [Aetna] shall have the right within thirty . . . days after the receipt of such notice to remedy the default or to proceed, or procure others to proceed, with the performance of such [subcontract.; that if . . . [Aetna] does proceed or procure others to proceed with the performance of such [sube] ontract . . . all money that may at the time of such default be due, or that thereafter [may] become due to . . . [Deschenes] under said [sube] ontract shall become due and payable to . . . [Aetna] and . . . [Aetna] shall be subrogated to all the rights of . . . [Deschenes].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">There were various disputes between Bayer and Des-chenes over quantities and billings. Certain portions of the work were done by Bayer prior to June 22, 1959, for Bayer\u2019s \u201cown convenience and to facilitate other work . . . and Deschenes was either impliedly or expressly relieved from doing this work.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In June, 1959, representatives of Bayer talked with Deschenes, who \u201ctold them that he had an opportunity to do another job . . . and was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>leave the Bayer . . . job.\u201d Bayer\u2019s chief engineer said that they were \u201cfar behind schedule\u201d and that he \u201cwanted him to stay on the job.\u201d It may easily be inferred that Bayer at all times was interested in getting Deschenes to perform his subcontract, rather than treating him as in default. On June 22,1959, Deschenes removed his last equipment from the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Bayer sent to Aetna various progress reports (the first sent on February 2, 1959) showing in each instance a probable completion date later than that set out in the subcontract. The last report indicated a probable completion date of December 1, 1959. When Deschenes left the job site, Bayer proceeded itself to complete the subcontracted work and finished doing so by September 2, 1959. On August 18, 1959, Bayer notified Aetna of Deschenes\u2019s default. Deschenes was adjudicated a bankrupt on November 3, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As a consequence of these events, Bayer brought this action at law against Deschenes and Aetna for breach of contract and to recover on Aetna\u2019s bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The facts already stated are based upon the report of an auditor, whose findings were to be final. He found that Bayer is entitled to recover $15,134.95 from Deschenes and Aetna for work that Bayer was required to do because of Deschenes\u2019s breach of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The auditor also found (a) that \u201cany extensions of the completion date ... [of the subcontract were] by mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>agreement of Bayer . . . and Desehenes\u201d; (b) that Aetna \u201chad knowledge that the completion date had been extended\u201d; (c) that Aetna \u201cwas not [in] any way damaged by Bayer . . . performing the balance of the work required by the sub-contract\u201d and that Bayer\u2019s delay in giving Aetna notice of Desehenes\u2019s default <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>was not injurious to Aetna \u2019 \u2019; and (d) that on August 21, 1959, Aetna acknowledged Bayer\u2019s notice to it of Desehenes\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The judge ordered judgments on the auditor\u2019s report for Bayer for $16,848.66 against both Aetna and Desehenes. From these orders Aetna and Desehenes appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">1. Aetna contends that it is discharged as surety by the extensions of time for performance given by Bayer to Desehenes, despite Aetna\u2019s knowledge of these extensions, and the absence of any finding of injury to Aetna caused thereby. Aetna, however, \u201cis a compensated surety and is not entitled to invoke the ancient doctrine of strictissimi juris.\u201d <em>Veneto </em>v. <em>McCloskey &amp; Co. </em>333 Mass. 95,104. See <em>Agoos Leather Cos. Inc. </em>v. <em>American &amp; Foreign Ins. Co. </em>342 Mass. 603, 608; <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>68 F. 2d 289, 291 (1st Cir.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">.In the case of an accommodation surety, \u201cwhere the principal and creditor, without the surety\u2019s consent, make a binding agreement to extend . . . time . . . the surety is discharged unless the creditor in the extension agreement reserves his rights against the surety. \u2019 \u2019 Restatement: Security, \u00a7 129 (1). See <em>Brockton Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>311 Mass. 695, 702-704. Cf. <em>Northampton Inst, for Sav. </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>313 Mass. 1, 5-6 (burden rests on surety of showing an extension and that it was discharged). The modern rule, however, with respect to a compensated surety, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Restatement: Security, \u00a7 129 (2), is that such a surety \u201cis discharged only to the extent that he is harmed by the extension.\u201d See <em>Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Pressed Brick Co. </em>191 U. S. 416, 423-426; <em>American Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>269 F. 2d 406, 408-409 (1st Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bruce Constr. Corp. </em>272 F. 2d 62, 66 (5th Cir.); <em>Phoenix Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Buckner, </em>305 F. 2d 54, 57-58 (8th Cir.). See also Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 6796, 6848-6851; annotation, 12 A.L.R. 382. Cf. Stearns, Suretyship (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 6.8, 6.16-6.19. Present day authority thus generally rejects, with respect to compensated sureties, the contrary rule stated in <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>American Sur. Co. </em>231 Mass. 490, 493-494 (Avhere there was no apparent consideration of the circumstance that the case dealt Avith a compensated surety). Cf. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>278 Mass. 502, 505; <em>Taborsak </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 8, 12-13; <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Cassassa, </em>301 Mass. 246, 252.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In any event, it is only by a binding, enforceable agreement for new consideration for an extension, which cannot be rescinded or disregarded, that the discharge of a surety will be effected. See Restatement: Security, \u00a7 129, comment c. The auditor\u2019s finding concerning the extensions of time for performance is merely that they were made \u201cby mutual agreement of Bayer . . . and Deschenes.\u201d This finding does not import to us an enforceable agreement for consideration but merely Bayer\u2019s effort to obtain even dilatory performance by Deschenes. Cf. <em>Taborsak </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 8, 12-13 (binding agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We hold that Aetna, which has not shown itself to have been harmed by the extensions of time, Avas not thereby discharged as surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>2. Aetna contends that Bayer is barred from recovery on the performance bond by its failure to notify Aetna promptly of Desehenes\u2019s default, and thus to give Aetna \u201can opportunity, within thirty days after receiving [such] notice . . . to . . . complete the work left undone. \u2019 \u2019 Condition (2), see fn. 1, is stated in the bond to be an express condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Condition (2) does not expressly require Bayer, as obligee of the bond, to give notice of Desehenes\u2019s default. It does, however, imply that Bayer was bound to give such notice within a reasonable time (see <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>337 Mass. 185, 187-188) so that Aetna might have opportunity to decide whether it would complete Desehenes\u2019s work as a method of minimizing its own loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">No purpose of Condition (2) is stated other than to give Aetna the opportunity to make that decision. Indeed, the absence from Condition (2) of any specific requirement for giving Aetna notice of a default strongly suggests that no investigation by Aetna (other than of the appropriate method of keeping completion costs low) was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Express requirements for prompt notice of a loss or an accident are often found in insurance contracts. In respect of insurance contracts, however, the situation is somewhat different, for it is frequently important that an insurer have such prompt notice, so that seasonable investigation of the facts relating to liability may be undertaken. Cf. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>232 Mass. 246, 250-251; <em>Kana </em>v. <em>Fishman, </em>276 Mass. 206, 210-211; <em>Wainer </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>288 Mass. 250, 251-252; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Great Am. Indem. Co. </em>316 Mass. 155, 157; <em>O\u2019Kane </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>337 Mass. 182, 184; <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>341 Mass. 238, 243-244. Cf. also Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4732.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Although Condition (2) is expressed as a condition, we regard it as designed only to assure Aetna that the cost of making good any default by Desehenes would not be greater than that for which Aetna itself could do the work, or could procure it to be done. This purpose has been accomplished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>despite Bayer\u2019s delay in giving notice, for the auditor has found that Aetna \u201cwas not [in] any way damaged by Bayer[\u2019s] . . . performing the balance of the work.\u201d This finding we interpret as meaning that Bayer did the work as economically as Aetna could have arranged to have it done, and that Aetna was not otherwise harmed by the delay in giving notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Bayer\u2019s delay did not enlarge Aetna\u2019s risk. If Condition (2) is regarded only as limiting Aetna\u2019s liability to the amount for which it could get Deschenes\u2019s omitted work done, Aetna\u2019s risk remained essentially the same amount regardless of whether notice was given. Accordingly, noncompliance with Condition (2) would not extend Aetna\u2019s risk of loss in the same way in which an insurer\u2019s risk may be expanded by noncompliance with the notice provisions (designed to facilitate loss investigation) of an insurance contract. If Bayer is barred from recovery on the bond because of such noncompliance, even if in fact no loss or damage has been caused to Aetna, the consequence will be a forfeiture of all the protection for which Bayer has bargained and for which Aetna has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Considerations of this character have led some courts to hold compensated sureties upon bonds, notwithstanding the violation of a provision for notice of default, if the violation in fact has caused no harm to the surety. This result reflects a general reluctance to relieve a compensated surety of its obligation because of any insubstantial, harmless violation of such a notice provision, even if expressed as a condition. The principle is in some respects analogous to that underlying the authorities already mentioned, holding that a compensated surety is not discharged by an extension of time which has done him no harm. Indeed, the language of some of those authorities (see e.g. fn. 4) is broad enough to cover the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Under the older cases, Condition (2) would have been regarded as an express condition of Aetna\u2019s liability and Aetna would have been treated as discharged by Bayer\u2019s failure to comply strictly with any express or implied provision of Condition (2). See <em>National Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Long, </em>125 Fed. 887, 891 (8th Cir.); <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>148 Fed. 206, 208 (8th Cir.); Stearns, Suretyship (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 5.7, 7.16. See also <em>Burdett </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>235 Mass. 153,155 (where the court did not enforce a surety company bond when the precise circumstances which would give rise to liability, in accordance with the letter of the bond, had not occurred).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"as_-dedup-0\">On the other hand, in addition to general language in cases cited in the first part of this opinion, the following authorities protect a compensated surety only to the extent that it has been harmed by nonperformance of a condition requiring notice of the principal\u2019s default. See <em>School Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>McCurley, </em>92 Kans. 53, 55; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>127 Kans. 100, 103; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Ramm, </em>254 Mich. 259, 261-262; <em>MacNear </em>v. <em>Malow, </em>282 Mich. 239, 243; Merrill, Notice, \u00a7\u00a7 536, 824; note, 42 Harv. L. Rev. 838.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That there is a split in authority is recognized in <em>Southern Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>MacMillan Co. </em>58 F. 2d 541, 545-546 (10th Cir.). See Simpson, Suretyship, 169-171; Dole, Notice Requirements of Guaranty Contracts, 62 Mich. L. Rev. 57, 92-97; annotation, 23 A.L.R. 2d 1065, 1071-1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>On balance, we do not extend the strict rule of the insurance cases to the present situation so as to cause a forfeiture. We hold that, in the circumstances, Aetna was not discharged by Bayer\u2019s failure to give prompt notice of Deschenes\u2019s default, where Aetna has not been harmed. We need not discuss to what extent a different result would be necessary if Aetna had been caused damage by nonperformance of Condition (2) or if the notice of default had been for the purpose (a) of investigating whether liability had arisen, or (b) of preventing loss of evidence or further loss, or (c) of avoiding other appreciable damage to the surety. Cf. <em>Gilmour </em>v. <em>Standard Sur. &amp; Cas. Co. </em>292 Mass. 205, 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">3. Aetna contends that the claim of one Quinn against Deschenes and against Bayer and its surety should not have been allowed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Quinn, as intervener, filed a claim more than sixty days, but less than ninety days, after Quinn\u2019s work had been done, for about 241 hours of use of dump trucks and operators. The auditor in effect found \u201cas a matter of fact\u201d that Quinn\u2019s claim was not governed by the sixty day period for filing claims for the hire of \u201cdump trucks . . . from common or contract carriers for use in the prosecution of such contract\u201d under Gi. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39A (inserted by St. 1951, c. 694), but was governed by the ninety day limitation provided by \u00a7 29 (as amended through St. 1957, c. 682, \u00a7 1; see later amendments by St. 1962, c. 696, and St. 1964, c. 609, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5). Section 29, as amended, includes claims \u201cfor the rental or hire of vehicles\u201d and \u201cfor labor performed,\u201d terms broad enough to include Quinn\u2019s claim so far as that claim is described in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Section 39A and \u00a7 29, in respect of dump trucks seem to have, in part at least, overlapping coverage, although \u00a7 39A (unlike \u00a7 29) in terms extends to charges for such vehicles incurred by others than prime contractors and subcontrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tors. Section 39A expressly states that the security required in accordance therewith is \u201cin addition to the security required by\u201d c. 30, \u00a7 39. Section 39 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 702, \u00a7 1), was repealed by St. 1957, c. 682, \u00a7 2, and the provisions of c. 149, \u00a7 29, were broadened by St. 1957, c. 682, \u00a7 1, to supplant c. 30, \u00a7 39, and to cover much the same ground.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because c. 30, \u00a7 39A, provided security in addition to that required by former \u00a7 39, we interpret it as providing also security in addition to that provided by c. 149, \u00a7 29, although, as to persons protected by both sections, it is coextensive. There is no reason why a claimant, like Quinn, who is within the scope of c. 149, \u00a7 29, and who complies with that section, should not have the benefit of the security thereby required, even if he does not comply with c. 30, \u00a7 39A. As Quinn\u2019s claim under c. 149, \u00a7 29, was seasonably filed, it is immaterial that any claim which Quinn might have under c. 30, \u00a7 39A, was not seasonably filed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">4. The order for judgment against Aetna is affirmed. The questions raised by a bill of exceptions filed by Aetna (to the denial of its motion for judgment) have been dealt with upon its appeal. Aetna\u2019s exceptions are dismissed. Deschenes filed no brief. His appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\"> For convenience the quoted condition is hereinafter referred to as Condition (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> Section 10 of the subcontract permitted Bayer, if Deschenes should \u201cfail in any respect to prosecute the work with promptness or diligence ... to provide such labor, materials and equipment as . . .

No contention is made that Deschenes\u2019s surety is responsible for any extra cost of subcontracted work done by Bayer before June 22, 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\"> Other matters, not now before us, were heard with this aetion before the same person acting as auditor and master. Such matters were (a) a bill in equity by Deschenes (and one Quinn, an intervening plaintiff who claimed for trucks furnished to Deschenes) against Bayer and its surety; and (b) a bill in equity by one Macomber who seeks to recover from Deschenes, Bayer, and Bayer\u2019s surety under G. L. e. 149, \u00a7 29, for fuel oil furnished to Deschenes. In respect of the other matters, it was found (1) that Macomber seasonably filed Ms claim in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, and that Deschenes owed Mm $1,037.74 plus interest of $249.06 to be paid by Bayer or its surety; (2) that Deschenes owes Quinn $2,052.75 plus interest of $493.66, to be paid by Bayer or its surety; (31) that Bayer owes Deschenes $5,164.50 plus interest of $1,239.48, against wMch should be credited the $1,286.80 due to Macomber and the $2,546.41 due to Quinn, and (4) that Bayer is entitled to set off any money owed by it to Deschenes against the recovery by Bayer against Deschenes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"><em> In </em>the <em>Maryland Cas.

This period was extended, in respect of \u00a7 39, to ninety days by St. 1955, c. 702, \u00a7 1. See <em>J. J. Struzziery Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>A. V. Taurasi Co. Inc. </em>340 Mass. 481, 487. We perceive no legislative intention that \u00a7 39A was to be an exclusive remedy in eases also covered by the language of old \u00a7 39 and present e. 149, \u00a7 29.
