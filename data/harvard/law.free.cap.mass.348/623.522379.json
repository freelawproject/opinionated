Upon the basis of a confirmed master\u2019s report, the final decree (a) enjoined the Mannings \u201cfrom manufacturing ... or selling . . . products patterned from or similar in appearance to . . . [Angell\u2019s] lubricator,\u201d and (b) ordered them to pay to Angell $6,000 as damages plus interest and costs. The facts are stated as found by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Thomas Manning entered the employ of a sole proprietorship, a predecessor of Angell, about forty years prior to 1957 when he was \u201cfinally laid off.\u201d He had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201cprincipal fabricator of\u201d Angell\u2019s lubricators. He was \u201ca trusted and loyal employee . . . familiar with . . . the names and addresses of . . . [Angell\u2019s] customers,\u201d and had \u201cattended to practically all phases of . . . [Angell\u2019s] business . . . with the exception of . . . bookkeeping.\u201d In 1957, Angell\u2019s predecessor, then a partnership, began to pay Thomas a pension of $25 a month. With Angell\u2019s incorporation in 1960 the monthly pension checks, \u201cwithout consultation with Thomas\u201d but with his knowledge, were marked \u201c [p]ension and [c]onsulting fee.\u201d Thomas was, however, \u201cnot an employee of the corporation at any time . . . [after he was laid off] but . . . was given money as . . . [Angell\u2019s] pensioner\u201d until after February, 1962, when Thomas refused to accept further money from Angel\u00ed because Thomas \u201cand his son had copied . . . [Angell\u2019s] lubricator and were selling . . . [their] model in competition with\u201d Angel\u00ed and to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In October, 1960, Robert Manning, with Thomas\u2019s knowledge, sent a messenger to Angell\u2019s shop \u201cto procure one of Angell\u2019s lubricators without disclosing to Angel\u00ed\u201d that it was to be delivered to Robert. Robert dismantled the lubricator and used the parts to make patterns and molds from which lubricator parts were made. These were later assembled into lubricators substantially like Angell\u2019s except for minor changes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Mannings \u201cintended to make their model look and operate like the Angel\u00ed model.\u201d Robert prepared advertising material bearing cuts and instructions similar to the material used by Angel\u00ed in its advertising. Although the appearance \u201cof both sheets was quite similar,\u201d Angell\u2019s name and address \u201cappeared conspicuously on its flyers\u201d while the name \u201cThomas Manning &amp; Company\u201d and its address \u201cappeared conspicuously on\u201d Robert Manning\u2019s flyers, Avhich differed in shape, size, color of paper, typography, and wording from the Angel\u00ed flyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Robert communicated with some of Angell\u2019s customers and offered to sell lubricators to them at about twenty per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>cent less than Angel\u00ed\u2019s price. Angel\u00ed thereafter noticed a sharp decline in its sales and, in 1962 and 1963, this decline was caused by the \u201cmarketing of Robert\u2019s units.\u201d An-gel\u00ed\u2019s loss of profit to the date of filing the bill was $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Neither Angel\u00ed nor Robert Manning ever have held a patent upon their respective lubricators nor have they had any trade marks or trade names for them. Angel\u00ed\u2019s name appeared on the underside of a supporting bracket on its lubricator. Robert\u2019s lubricator omitted this name. \u201cRobert\u2019s finished lubricator was such a perfect copy of Angel\u00ed\u2019s that it was nearly indistinguishable except for the different color of the painted castings and might well cause a person looking at it to believe that it had been manufactured by Angel\u00ed.\u201d Elevator guide rail lubricators are made and sold by many companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">1. The master\u2019s findings (a) establish that Thomas Manning was not in Angel\u00ed\u2019s employ between 1957 and 1962; and (b) furnish no basis for any conclusion that the pension, or indeed any employment agreement, imposed any limitation upon Thomas\u2019s right to work for his son or to use his experience, knowledge, and general skills (see <em>Padover </em>v. <em>Axelson, </em>268 Mass. 148,151) in the manufacture and sale of lubricators. There is no finding that Thomas removed any confidential list of Angel\u00ed\u2019s customers or disclosed any trade secrets. In the circumstances, \u201c [Remembered information . . . [is] not confidential.\u201d <em>American Window Cleaning Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>343 Mass. 195, 199. Cf. <em>New England Overall Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Woltmann, </em>343 Mass. 69, 73, 75-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">2. There is no indication in the master\u2019s report that the Mannings attempted to pass off their product as being that of Angel\u00ed. The difference in the advertising of Angel\u00ed and Robert Manning, the absence of Angel\u00ed\u2019s name from Robert Manning\u2019s lubricators, and the color differences tend to negate any passing off, as does the finding that Robert \u2018 \u2018 offered <em>in his own name </em>to sell . . . [Angel\u00ed\u2019s] customers his lubricators at about 20% less than Angel\u00ed\u2019s\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Barett </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>314 Mass. 279, 281. See also <em>New England, Tel. </em>&amp; <em>Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>National Merchandising </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>Corp. </em>335 Mass. 658, 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">3. Our cases establish that the mere copying and sale of an unpatented product does not furnish to its original manufacturer any basis for injunctive relief or damages. <em>Flagg Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Holway, </em>178 Mass. 83, 90-91. <em>Barett </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>314 Mass. 279, 280-281. See also <em>Dover Stamping Co. </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>163 Mass. 191, 198-199. Two recent cases in the Supreme Court of the United States have given new emphasis to this established principle. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Stiffel Co. </em>376 U. S. 225, 231-233. <em>Compco Corp. </em>v. <em>Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. </em>376 U. S. 234, 238-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">There must be more than mere copying of \u201cdetails of form and appearance\u201d to justify equitable relief. See <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>294 Mass. 44, 49-50. See also <em>New Method Die &amp; Cut-Out Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Milton Bradley Co. </em>289 Mass. 277, 283-286. Our cases, however, have required a person copying an unpatented product to label his own product sufficiently to indicate its origin, where that is appropriate to prevent confusion of his product with that of the original manufacturer. See the <em>Russo </em>case, 294 Mass. 44, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">As already stated the additional element of \u201cpassing off\u201d by Robert Manning has not been found. It would not seem likely that similarity in the packaging of this type of product would be of importance. No findings suggest that there was similarity of packages or that actual confusion of the two lubricators has occurred. Nevertheless, if confusion had been shown Robert Manning might have been required to affix some simple and inexpensive label or tag to his product.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">There was no basis in the findings for the injunction contained in the final decree and no support for any award of damages. There is no finding that injury has been caused by any confusion of the Mannings\u2019 product with that of Angel\u00ed, as distinguished from the injurious effect of the Mannings\u2019 entirely lawful competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">4. The final decree is reversed. A new final decree is to be entered dismissing the bill, with costs to the Man-nings, who are also to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> The Mannings used stampings instead of castings in one clamp and painted in color certain supporting members and spreaders which Angel\u00ed painted black.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
