Onorato Corporation (Onorato) and Levin entered into a written agreement whereby Onorato undertook to build a ranch house for Levin according to certain plans and specifications, for the sum of $41,900. The contract provided that, apart from due allowance to be made for circumstances or conditions beyond the control of Onorato, the building and grounds should be completed in every respect and ready for occupancy on or before December 15, 1952. Work was begun shortly after the agreement was executed. Onorato was in \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d in October and November, 1952, and in December transferred its business to a trustee for the benefit of creditors. During December, 1952, through Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>uary 7, 1953, \u201cvery little work was performed\u201d toward the completion of the house. Shortly after December 15, Onorato had completed only about fifty per cent of the construction under the contract. At the end of December, 1952, Levin ordered Onorato to stop work, and, on January 7, 1953, ordered it to get off the premises. There were no circumstances beyond Onorato\u2019s control which delayed construction. Levin thereupon arranged with one Bosenfeld for completion of the house at a cost of $21,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Onorato brought an action to recover for breach of the contract, claiming $20,000, with interest, as the balance due under the contract (count 2 of the amended declaration). In a separate count (4), Onorato claimed $6,000, with interest, \u201cfor work done and materials provided.\u201d Levin in turn brought an action against Onorato to recover damages for breach of the contract. The trial judge ordered the cases to be tried together, and referred them to an auditor whose findings of fact were to be final. The auditor, in addition to finding the subsidiary facts already stated, concluded in his final report on recommittal that Onorato performed work and provided materials \u201cto the value of . . . $20,950,\u201d and \u201cperformed extra work . . . totaling $1,725, thus making a total of $22,675\u201d; that Levin paid $18,800 to Onorato for labor and materials; and that an additional $550 was credited to Levin leaving a balance of $3,325, plus interest, due from Levin to Onorato under count 4 of its amended declaration. Separate recovery under count 2 of the amended declaration was not granted. The auditor denied recovery in the action by Levin against Onorato, finding \u201cno damage\u201d to Levin.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Upon motions by Onorato for judgments on counts 2 and 4, the trial judge ordered that judgments be entered for Levin on each of these counts. Upon Onorato\u2019s motion for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report in the action by Levin, the judge ordered that judgment be entered for Levin in the sum of $1 as \u201cnominal damages.\u201d Onorato appealed from these orders for judgment, and the appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Onorato in its brief does not refer to the orders for judgment regarding count 2 for $20,000 in its action against Levin, and regarding Levin\u2019s action against Onorato. The appeals from these orders are therefore deemed waived^ Rule 13 of the Rules for the Regulation of Practice before the Full Court, 345 Mass. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">It is evident from the auditor\u2019s findings that count 4 and the accompanying bill of particulars, which refers to a claim of $3,325, comprise claims of $1,725 for \u201cextra work\u201d and of $1,600 for work and materials provided under the contract. We think that Onorato cannot recover the $1,600 claim upon quantum meruit on the theory of <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>7 Pick. 181, since the substantial performance required by that theory could not. here be found \u201cwhere so large a proportion of the work remained unperformed.\u201d <em>Nevins </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>320 Mass. 70, 74, and cases therein cited. <em>Ricciardone </em>v. <em>Carvelli, </em>334 Mass. 228, 230. See <em>Kauranen </em>v. <em>Mattaliano, </em>347 Mass. 583, 586. The \u201cextra work\u201d on which the claim for $1,725 is founded appears to be based on several modifications of the contract itself rather than on collateral agreements. The claim for \u201cextra work\u201d thus \u201cbecame merged into the principal contract and :. . . [is] not now to be dealt with separately. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Nevins </em>v. <em>Ward, supra, </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\n<em>Orders for judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
