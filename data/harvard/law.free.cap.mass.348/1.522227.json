Oberlander (employee) committed suicide. His widow (claimant) brings this claim for compensation alleging that her husband\u2019s suicide resulted from a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We summarize the pertinent evidence. The employee at the time of his death was sixty-three years old. For twenty-one years prior to his death he had been employed as a glazier by Wilbur H. Burnham (employer) who was engaged in the business of designing, making, and installing stained glass windows. Most of the employee\u2019s work was performed at Ms employer\u2019s studio in Boston. He also did work as an \u201coutside man\u201d installing windows. In the performance of these duties he was required to work on a scaffold, and frequently he was obliged to make trips out of town. His duties on these trips also reqMred him to act as supervisor and to hire workmen at the local union headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In 1943, while at work on a cathedral in Washington, he severed a tendon of one of his fingers which resulted in total incapacity for nine and one-half weeks. Thereafter he returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">During the two years preceding his death the employee developed a dislike for out of town work. He disliked especially worMng on the scaffolding and the hiring and supervising of other workmen. When apprised of an impending trip, he became uncommunicative and despondent. About two weeks prior to January 8, 1954, he learned that he would have to do some work on the National Cathedral in Washington. On January 8 the employee appeared to be very troubled and \u201cworried to death\u201d; he had no interest in eating and would not talk. Finally, he said to his wife, \u201cWe are licked, I can\u2019t make that trip, my job is done.\u201d There were several telephone conversations in which the employee and his wife informed the employer that the employee would not do outside work any more. In one of these conversations the employer told the employee that he was \u201cfired.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the employer left a message <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>with a member of the employee\u2019s family suggesting that the employee discuss with him the possibility of returning to work. The employee never acted upon the suggestion and never returned to work. For the next three weeks the employee was very troubled. He would not enter into conversations or respond to questions; he was not interested in eating, reading or watching television. On January 31, at about 2 a.m. (a Sunday) he seemed very disturbed and said that on Monday he would have to go to a union meeting or \u201cthey were going to kill him.\u201d He then uttered the \u201cworst\u201d scream that his wife had ever heard. After that he quieted down, and his wife went back to sleep. Later that morning his body was found downstairs. The cause of death was asphyxiation by hanging.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Dr. Gardner, a psychiatrist called by the claimant and who had never seen the employee, testified in response to a hypothetical question that \u201cthere was a relationship between . . . [the deceased\u2019s] employment and his death.\u201d He based this opinion \u201con one or two possibilities, both of which had some effect.\u201d One of these possibilities was that the employee\u2019s injury to his hand in 1943 might have caused a neurosis and fear of injury. As time went on he became unsteadier and more apprehensive when he went on the scaffolding and he was \u201ctorn between fear of injury and fear of becoming unemployed.\u201d The final blow was the loss of his job. This precipitated \u201ca severe real depression\u201d and this \u201cdepressive reaction . . . culminated in his unfortunate death.\u201d Another possibility was that the employee, approximately two years before his death, \u2018 \u2018 developed a male climacteric, a depressive reaction which occurs in some men with what ... [is called] a change of life.\u201d One in this condition develops \u201cexceedingly strong morbid feelings\u201d which would be aggravated by the fear of outside work. The loss of his job \u201cled to his feeling that he was completely lost and hopeless.\u201d When asked whether the relationship between employment and death was a \u201cpossibility\u201d or a \u201cprobability,\u201d Dr. Gardner answered, \u201cI would state \u2018probability\u2019 if you are giving me choice of words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>A report of Dr. Stoller, a general practitioner, was introduced in evidence which disclosed that the employee had been under his care from April 14, 1953, to January 23, 1954. Dr. Stoller treated the employee for mental depression, insomnia, and gastritis. These conditions, according to the report, were brought on by fear of out of town assignments where he would have to work on scaffolding, and fear of the loss of his job if he refused such assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Dr. Kozol, a psychiatrist called by the insurer, testified that the cause of the employee\u2019s suicide was a \u2018\u2018depressive psychosis of late middle life,\u201d and that \u201c [tjhere was no connection between his employment and the mental illness . . . which caused his death. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The single member in a decision denying compensation made findings of fact and concluded that the \u2018 \u2018 claimant has failed to prove that the employee sustained a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and that therefore there is no causal relationship between his death . . . and any personal injury he may have received while . . . [working for his employer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The reviewing board in a decision rendered by two of its members made findings of its own and reversed the decision of the single member. The board stated that it \u201c adopt[s] the opinion of Dr. Gardner as its opinion and find[s] that the severe depressed mental reaction suffered by the employee on January 8, 1954, constituted a personal injury within the meaning of the . . . act, and that such injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d The board further concluded that the employee\u2019s \u201cstate of mind was directly connected with his personal injury of January 8, 1954.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On certification to the Superior Court a decree was entered dismissing the claim for compensation. The decree recited that the \u201cevidence of causal relationship between the death and employment . . . [was] insufficient to sustain the . . . [b]card\u2019s decision.\u201d The claimant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">In support of the decree below the insurer argues (1) that the employee did not receive a personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>arising out of and in the course of his employment; (2) that even if there was a personal injury within the meaning of the act the claimant (a) failed to sustain the burden of proving a causal connection between such injury and the employee\u2019s suicide, and in any event (b) failed to show \u201cby the weight of the evidence that, due to the injury, the employee was of such unsoundness of mind as to make him irresponsible for his act of suicide.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We assume that the employee\u2019s mental condition was a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under the act. This is a question which has never been decided by this court and we do not now decide it, and in making this assumption we intend no intimation one way or the other. We are of opinion that there was insufficient evidence of a causal connection between the employment and the employee\u2019s mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The burden was on the claimant to prove that there was a probable causal connection. And where, as here, such causal relationship is a matter not within the knowledge or experience of laymen the relationship must be established by expert medical testimony. <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 749, and cases cited. The only evidence on which a finding of causal relationship could rest is the testimony of Dr. Gardner, the psychiatrist called by the claimant. It was his testimony that was adopted by the reviewing board and furnished the basis for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Dr. Gardner, when pressed by claimant\u2019s counsel, was of opinion that the relationship which he said existed between the employment and the employee\u2019s mental condition and subsequent suicide was a probability rather than a possibility. Of course, if the relationship was no more than a possibility the claimant\u2019s case must fail. <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>299 Mass. 426, 431. <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 415. <em>Nass </em>v. <em>Duxbury, </em>327 Mass. 396, 401. <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751. \u201cA mere guess or conjecture by an expert witness in the form of a conclusion from basic facts that do not tend towards that conclusion any more than towards a contrary one, has ... no evidential value.\u201d <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at page 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">With these principles in mind we proceed to an analysis of Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony. The first employment-connected cause considered by him was the injury to the employee\u2019s finger in 1943. There was, in the doctor\u2019s opinion, \u201cone possibility . . . [which had some effect, namely, because of] the accident to his hand . . ., he may have developed some emotional disturbance which would cause neurosis and fear of injury.\u201d But later Dr. Gardner testified that he \u201cdid not attach too much importance to . . . [that injury] because it is not a direct participating factor . . . but as long as there was some disability, it helped him to some depressive tendencies.\u201d The doctor\u2019s attention was directed to the fact that nearly ten years had elapsed following the 1943 injury during which there was no history of complaints by the employee. To this inquiry he gave the following explanation. \u201cI was trying to go back of this man\u2019s history and show you what developed. All the experiences of our life have something to do with determining our reaction. We are getting pretty far afield; it is not of great importance but merely a theoretical consideration in my effort to put a diagnosis on this final reaction and when I went on the final stage of saying there was a causal relationship, I was trying to make it more specific. This long range gradual development of the thing was influenced by such an accident and the male climacteric being-aggravated by the circumstances of this man\u2019s life [in] the last two years.\u201d It would appear that Dr. Gardner had in effect withdrawn one of the two employment connections on which his opinion was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The other possibility considered by Dr. Gardner as a basis for the causal relationship was that the employee be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>cause of Ms age \u201ccould have developed a male climacteric,\u201d or change of life, two years before his death. Such a condition would cause one to have \u2018 \u2018 exceedingly strong morbid feelings. \u2019\u2019 These \u201cfears again were aggravated in connection with his doing this outside work and . . . the final loss of his work led to his feeling that he was completely lost and hopeless.\u201d A severely depressed person, according to Dr. Gardner, is a \u201cpossible suicide.\u201d Elsewhere in his testimony Dr. Gardner stated that the \u201cimportant thing to Mm was that for some reason . . . [the employee] was under great emotional stress,\u201d and that \u201cthis emotional disturbance . . . seemed to relate itself over [the] last two years to out of town assignments with hiring men or climbing, or whatever \u2014 he does not know. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We tMnk that Dr. Gardner\u2019s ultimate opinion as to causal relationship, although clothed in the garb of probability, rests on foundations wMch, when analyzed, are no more than possibilities. To endow opinion evidence with probative value it must be based on something more than that. <em>Rusehetti\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 426, 431. <em>Brownhill </em>v. <em>Kivlin, </em>317 Mass. 168,170. <em>Nass </em>v. <em>Duxbury, </em>327 Mass. 396, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In view of this conclusion we do not reach questions arising under \u00a7 26A. See footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> General Laws e. 152, \u00a7 26A, inserted by St. 1937, c. 370, \u00a7 2, reads in part: \u201cDependents shall not be precluded from recovery under this chapter . . . for death by suicide of the employee, if it be shown by the weight <em>of </em>the evidence that, due to the injury, the employee was of such unsoundness of mind as to make him irresponsible for his act of suicide. \u2019 \u2019 This statute unquestionably was enacted in view of the rule laid down in <em>SponatsM\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 530, and <em>Tetrault\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 447, 448. Whether the words \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d in the statute were intended to alter the well established rule governing the effect of findings of the board (see <em>Hartman\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 508, 511, and eases cited) need not be decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
