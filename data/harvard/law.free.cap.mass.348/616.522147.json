The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission of certain evidence, to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict, and to the instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">We summarize the pertinent evidence. In a policy of insurance issued to the plaintiff, the defendant agreed \u201c [t]o pay for . \u201e . direct loss of or damage to payroll, occurring either outside or within the premises, caused by robbery or attempted robbery from a custodian performing any of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>regular duties with such payroll.\u201d The policy defines the word \u201crobbery\u201d to mean \u201cthe felonious taking of insured property (1) by violence inflicted upon a custodian; (2) by putting him in fear of violence; (3) by any other overt felonious act committed in his presence and of which he is actually cognizant, provided such other act is not committed by an officer, partner, or employee of the insured; (4) from the person or direct care and custody of a custodian who has been killed or rendered unconscious by injuries inflicted maliciously or sustained accidentally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">One Moreau (who was deceased at the time of trial), an employee of the plaintiff, was responsible for transporting the plaintiff\u2019s payroll from a bank to the plaintiff\u2019s office \u201ca couple of times a week.\u201d On November 13, 1959, Moreau went to the bank for this purpose in his own car. The bank teller gave him the payroll in a paper bag. As Moreau emerged from the bank, he \u201csaw a suspicious looking person standing there.\u201d Moreau entered his car and placed the bag between his back and a cushion. He \u201cstarted [to drive the car] out of the parking space and noted . . . [that it] had a flat tire.\u201d He stopped the car, took out the payroll bag, \u201copened the trunk of the car and placed the bag in the rear of the trunk and covered it with . . . [his] hat.\u201d He then \u201cremoved the spare tire and put it against . . . [the] rear bumper.\u201d He \u201cjacked up the right rear wheel . . . [but the] car started to skid off the jack.\u201d He thereupon \u201creleased . . . [the jack] and took . . . a tire chain out of the trunk.\u2019\u2019 He \u201clooked to see if anyone was around . . . and there was nobody in sight.\u201d He then put the tire chain \u201cunder the right front wheel.\u201d \u201cThe trunk door was open [during] all this time.\u201d Moreau then \u201cjacked up the car again . . . removed the flat [tire] . . . [and] put the spare tire on.\u201d He took the flat tire to the trunk, and upon removing his hat therefrom, he saw that the bag of money was gone. At that moment a motorcycle policeman was going by, and Moreau \u201ctold him what [had] happened.\u201d In the course of a subsequent investigation by the police, an examination of the flat tire revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that \u201cthe valve was removed from the valve stem and [that] the tire itself was\u201d intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The plaintiff appears to rely solely upon the provision of the insurance policy which defines \u201crobbery\u201d as \u201cthe felonious taking of insured property ... by any other overt felonious act committed in . . . [the custodian\u2019s] presence and of which he is actually cognizant . . ..\u201d It seems clear that, even if there is evidence that a robbery was \u201ccommitted in . . . [Moreau\u2019s] presence,\u201d there is no evidence that he was \u201cactually cognizant\u201d of it. He had no actual knowledge of a felonious act during its commission and before the thief, if any, had completely disappeared with the payroll. His conclusion that a robbery had been committed was only an afterthought. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. See <em>Sklar </em>v. <em>Globe Indem. Co. </em>129 Cal. App. 439, 441; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>242 Iowa, 416, 422-424; <em>Ashcraft </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>255 S. W. 2d 485, 487 (Ky.); <em>Citizens Loan &amp; Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indem.

It is thus unnecessary to consider the questions raised by the other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\n<em>Exception to denial of motion for directed verdict sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
