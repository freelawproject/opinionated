The allegations of the bill are admitted. The Attorney General has acknowledged notice that constitutional questions are involved. G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8. The questions relate to St. 1964, c. 563, which by \u00a7 18 inserted G. L. c. 161A.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Chapter 161A, by \u00a7 2, creates the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and makes the territory of seventy-eight municipalities of Greater Boston and their inhabitants <em>\u201ca </em>body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of the commonwealth.\u201d Fourteen of these cities and towns, Boston and communities adjacent or close to Boston (which constituted the Metropolitan Transit Authority under St. 1947, c. 544, \u00a7 1), are differentiated from the other sixty-four cities and towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The statute grants the Authority extensive powers in respect of mass transportation facilities. It may own and operate such facilities. It may contract with, subsidize, and lease facilities to private- companies. It may borrow money on bonds or notes. The statute provides for annual payments by the Commonwealth to the Authority of its \u201cnet cost of service,\u201d and the apportionment of such deficit payments among the seventy-eight cities and towns on a weighted basis. The statute also provides for additional payments from the Commonwealth under contracts of assistance, the effect of which will be to reduce the deficit payments by cities and towns and place certain financial burdens on the Commonwealth. It contemplates that the Authority will receive revenue from its operations and may receive grants or gifts. Provisions of the statute, so far as material to the issues before us, will be discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Traitsportatioit Crisis and the Authority\u2019s Immediate Plaits.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The financial situation of the majority of the railroads providing commuter service to Boston is critical. Permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sion of the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon service is being sought or has been given. Help by the Authority is necessary because of imminent cessation of commuter service and the cost and difficulty of reestablishing service once abandoned. There is a similar crisis in bus service in the Greater Boston area. The Authority can best furnish aid to bus companies by leasing new facilities and equipment at rentals \u201ccalculated to provide the necessary financial aid.\u201d It must issue bonds under \u00a7 23 in order to acquire such property for such leasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The Authority must also issue bonds or notes under \u00a7 23 to meet its ordinary needs for new equipment and capital improvements and for expansion and improvement of publicly owned and operated mass transportation in Metropolitan Boston. State assistance is required so that the Authority may meet the large capital needs of public transportation and the needs for assistance to privately owned transportation companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Commonwealth through the Executive Office for Administration and Finance (Executive Office) has contracted with the Authority to furnish such assistance. As a means of providing necessary financing the Authority has also contracted with the defendant banks for the purchase by the banks of $1,000,000 of temporary notes under \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 27 and the Authority has voted to make the borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The Controversy \u2014 The Issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The contract with the banks is subject to four conditions: (1) That the notes be valid obligations of the Authority; (2) That the notes have the security mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13; (3) That the Authority and the Executive Office contract for State aid; (4) That State assistance may lawfully be granted in respect of the notes. Upon the basis of the opinion of counsel to the effect that they are unable to certify that the four conditions have been met, the banks decline to go through with the purchase of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The following are the principal issues: (1) Does G. D. c. 161A establish constitutionally adequate standards under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>which the Authority is to disburse to private companies the funds received from the notes? (2) Is the Commonwealth primarily liable so that there is in effect a borrowing by it without a two-thirds vote as required by art. 62, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Constitution? (3) Is the Commonwealth pledging its credit for the purpose of making payments to a limited class of private companies in contravention of art. 62, \u00a7 1? (4) Is there a loan of the Commonwealth\u2019s credit without a two-thirds vote in violation of art. 62, \u00a7 1, as amended by vote of the electorate, November 3, 1964? (5) Are the provisions for apportionment of net transportation costs among the seventy-eight cities and towns within constitutional limits ?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The Constitutionality of the Broad Purpose of the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The general purpose of G. L. c. 161A is, as the defendants recognize, clearly public. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>337 Mass. 800, 806-807, and cases cited. Transportation concerns every inhabitant of the Commonwealth and every aspect of our society. Even if private enterprise were able to provide it, the public interest would support public action. Where private enterprise has failed, the public interest and the legislative duty to serve that interest by specific enactment are plain. Provisions empowering the Authority to cooperate with private enterprise to accomplish the public purpose are not made invalid by resulting incidental private advantage. <em>Court St. Parking Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>336 Mass. 224, 227-231.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The Adequacy of the Statutory Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">A. Standards for Action by the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">1. The Authority is that kind of agency of the sovereign for which broad general powers and standards are appropriate. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 739, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>743. To meet the public need the Legislature has created a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the Commonwealth.\u2019\u2019 Gr. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 2. The Authority has some resemblance to a county, a regional school district, or a fire, improvement, or incinerator district. Gr. L. c. 34; c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 14-16H; c. 48, \u00a7\u00a7 60-80; c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 44A-44K. The Authority is suitably placed within the existing political framework of the Commonwealth. Its operations are coordinated with the operations of existing agencies. It is subject to appropriate controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Authority is managed (A 6) by a board of five directors appointed by the Governor for five year terms subject to approval \u2014 two by the council, one by the advisory board of the Authority, one by the fourteen cities and towns, and one by the sixty-four cities and towns, with provisions for weighted votes. The board must include a person experienced in transportation, a member of a national or international labor organization, and a person experienced in administration and finance.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Authority by \u00a7 3 has general powers appropriate to a political subdivision including the power to make by-laws and rules and regulations (A 3 [e]); to grant easements (\u00a7 3 [m]); to take real property by eminent domain (\u00a73 [o]); and to buy, sell, lease, pledge, and otherwise deal with property \u201cas may be necessary for or incident to\u201d accomplishing the purposes of the statute (\u00a73 [q]).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Certain action requires the approval of the advisory board. This, by \u00a7 7, consists of representatives of the seventy-eight municipalities: the city manager in Plan D or Plan E cities and in other cities, the mayor, and the chairman of the selectmen of each town. The voting of these members is weighted in relation to the assessments under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The Authority, like other political subdivisions, must operate under a budget approved by representatives of the people who are its inhabitants. Section 5 (i) specifies that current expenses be in accordance with an itemized budget that is to be approved by the advisory board, \u201csubject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>such itemized reductions therein as the advisory board shall deem appropriate. \u2019 \u2019 There may be supplementary budgets over which the advisory board has like power.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Authority by \u00a7 5 (h) reports annually to the Governor, the advisory board, and the Legislature \u201cits operations for the preceding calendar year, including therein a description of the organization of the authority, its recommendations for legislation, and its comprehensive program for mass transportation as most recently revised.\u201d \u25a0 By \u00a7 17, the State Auditor is required to make an annual audit of the accounts of the Authority and to. \u201cmake a report thereon to the directors, the governor and the general court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">2. The standards for action to carry out a declared legislative policy may be found not only in the express provisions of a statute but also in its necessary implications. The purpose, to a substantial degree, sets the standards. A detailed specification of standards is not required. The Legislature may delegate to a board or officer the working out of the details of a policy adopted by the Legislature. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>189 Mass. 247. <em>Chelsea </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>237 Mass. 422, 431. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 341-342. <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commn. </em>324 Mass. 494, 501. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>330 Mass. 713, 719. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 743 (Massachusetts Port Authority had wide scope as to provisions of an authorized trust agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 37-38, under a statute permitting regulation of soil removal, a by-law requiring a permit, without stating standards for its issuance, was held valid. \u201cThe manifest objects of the enabling act and of the by-law furnish in themselves a large measure of guidance. ... It was . . . [the] duty [of the selectmen] to act in a fair, judicial and reasonable manner upon the evidence . . . keeping in mind the objects of the by-law.\u201d <em>Building Commr. of Medford </em>v. <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>319 Mass. 273, 281-282, holds valid an ordinance that required a board in granting a dumping permit to consider the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>upon the neighborhood and the city, and had other provisions that indicated that the board should act to \u201cprotect the community\u201d and its \u201cinterest\u201d and avoid \u201csubstantial injury.\u201d In <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114,118, we held standards adequate wherein the only express requirement was to consider \u201cthe effects upon the neighborhood and the City at large. \u2019\u2019 See <em>Liggett Drug Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>License Commrs. of No. Adams, </em>296 Mass. 41, 50 (The specification of the \u201cpublic good\u201d as the standard for measuring the number of licenses is adequate). Compare Dr<em>uzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 134; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Newbury, ante, </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The obligation to act reasonably in accordance with the statutory purpose and in a manner consistent with the public interest will be implied so far as not expressed. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 2.04, makes the appropriate observation: \u201cNothing should hinge upon presence or absence of such vague phrases as \u2018public interest\u2019 or \u2018just and reasonable. \u2019 The substance is the same whether . . . [the legislative body] says \u2018deal with the problem\u2019 or says \u2018deal with the problem in the public interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">3. The standards of the Authority, found in the express provisions of the statute as well as in the implications of these provisions, of the structure of the agency, and of the declared public purpose, are constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Section 5 (a) states that the purpose of the plaintiff is \u201cto develop, finance and operate . . . mass transportation ... in the public interest ... in order to promote the general economic and social well-being of the area and of the commonwealth.\u201d The plaintiff, in consultation with other public agencies, must develop a long-range program for mass transportation <em>{% </em>5 [g]). The agencies specified are \u201cthe department of commerce and development, the metropolitan area planning council, and such other agencies of the commonwealth or of the federal government as may be concerned with the said program. \u2019 \u2019 The program must be based upon the plans and programs adopted by the public works commission after a submission by its bureau of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>transportation planning and development under G. L. c. 16, \u00a7 3A (inserted by \u00a7 1 of the same statute [St. 1964, c. 563] that inserted c. 161 A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The comprehensive plan must include estimates of costs and revenues and must be submitted for approval to the advisory board of the cities and towns (\u00a75 [g]). If within thirty days after approval by the advisory board, any of the agencies specified in \u00a7 5 (g) \u201cshall advise the authority in writing that the program is not based on the transportation plans and programs adopted by the said commission [of public works], the program shall be subject to the approval of the governor.\u201d As noted above, revisions of the program by \u00a7 5 (h) must be reported annually to the Governor, the advisory board, and the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The statute by \u00a7 29<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that all Federal assistance available to the Authority be used. Whenever Federal aid is used, Federal standards will be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The controls applicable to agreements with private companies are stated in \u00a7 3 (f) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such agreements must be on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>a year to year basis, must include standards for service, and may not provide for cash payments for service in an amount more than will permit the company a reasonable return.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Other controls in respect of \u201cassistance to private companies\u201d from the proceeds of bonds issued under \u00a7 23 (3) and subject to contract assistance are stated in \u00a7 28. This section requires that the Executive Office and the Authority adopt rules and regulations governing the procedures for \u201capplying for assistance to private companies\u201d under \u00a7 23 (3) and the use of such assistance. \u201cSuch rules and regulations shall include provisions (a) requiring any private company which receives such assistance to agree to limit its profits and its expenses for salaries and overhead so as to make available as much of its earnings as possible for repayment to the authority of such assistance; (b) requiring such repayment; (c) enabling the authority and the executive office for administration and finance to examine and audit the books and records of such company for the purpose of establishing and enforcing such limitation and repayment; and (d) requiring the authority to transfer to the commonwealth the commonwealth\u2019s share of such repayment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The regulatory power given the Authority by \u00a7 5 (k) ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> over all private companies providing mass transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>in the area of the. Authority, enables it to protect against the misuse of public subsidies in poor operation and management.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The act provides additional limitations on railroad aid. Thus, contracts with commuter railroads financed under \u00a7 23 (2) may only be for passenger service to and from Boston and may not extend beyond December 31, 1967. Not more than $5,000,000 of bonds nor more than $5,000,000 of State aid may be used for this purpose (\u00a7\u00a7 23, 28 [B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The implicit mandate of the statute is to provide transportation when and where'public convenience and necessity require it. It is not a constitutional defect that there is no requirement for express findings of such convenience and necessity, or for a record so that such findings could be judicially reviewed. There is no more occasion for judicial review of the determination of this political subdivision that transportation of a particular ldnd is required in a particular area than for review of the determination of a town that a certain highway is needed, or that a new school building should be built, and where it should be located. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>161 Mass. 302, 308 (eminent domain). See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 70; <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy.</em>330 Mass. 422, 431 (the Steamship Authority has wide administrative power as to extent of service).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">We think that there is no reasonable likelihood that under c. 161A public funds will be paid to a private company whose particular operations do not greatly serve the public need, so that in the particular instance the private advantage would be principally served. If such a possibility exists, however, it does not establish that the statute is unconstitutional. The Legislature has decided that contracting with private companies is an appropriate means for meeting the public need for transportation. Such contracts are incidental to the general plan. They are means for public ends, just as are the contracts for constructing school buildings and the buildings themselves when built. By contrast, the proposed statute for tax exemption of the</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Prudential project which was to include a public garage and possibly some other public buildings, considered in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 738, 758-759, did not, \u201con the face of the statute,\u201d show that a predominantly public purpose would be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">There are in the statute reasonable administrative checks and controls upon the Authority\u2019s acts in the delegation of power to other agencies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is an analogy in the statutory provisions that relate to and circumscribe public action by other political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">If the Authority acts illegally, that is, in violation of the statute, officials or other persons having standing may act to invoke judicial review. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>269 Mass. 503, 509-510. <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>330 Mass. 422, 431-432. The determinations of the Authority, however, as to how to exercise its powers for the declared ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>public purpose, if within the scope of the delegated power and in conformity with the express and necessarily implied statutory requirements, are not to be set aside by the courts; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 341-343.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">B. Standards for Action by the Executive Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Section 28 authorizes contract assistance by the Commonwealth to the Authority, whereby a portion of the net cost of service shall be paid by the Commonwealth and not assessed upon the cities and towns. The contracts for such assistance are to be made by the Executive Office. The standards to be applied in the making of such contracts are not now directly in issue. Nevertheless, the third condition of the contract with the banks, that is, that the Authority and the Executive Office shall have contracted for State aid, impliedly requires that such contracts be valid. We therefore consider whether \u00a7 28, read in the context of the statute, adequately indicates the purposes of the contracts and the principles which are to guide the Executive Office in making them.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Section 28 defines the kinds of assistance which may be granted and imposes limitations upon each. These limitations are summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">There are general provisions in \u00a7 28 relating to contract assistance. Debt service on indebtedness for which contract assistance is provided must mature serially beginning not later than ten years after date of issue and ending not later than forty years after the date of the bonds. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>amount of each instalment of principal is regulated. \u2018 \u2018 The bonds whose debt service is to receive contract assistance shall be selected in a manner which is consistent with the purposes for which the assistance is granted and which allocates the benefits of the assistance equitably. . . . Any contract under this section shall include such provisions as the executive office . . . deems necessary and desirable to assure the efficient operation of the authority and the minimum burden on the commonwealth and on the cities and towns within the authority.\u201d The provision for rules and regulations to govern assistance to private companies under $ 23 (3) is summarized in part II A above.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The Executive Office, by G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 3, inserted by St. 1962, c. 757, \u00a7 4, serves \u201cas the principal agency of the executive department of the government . . . for . . .: (1) Developing, co-ordinating, administering and controlling the financial policies and programs of the commonwealth; (2) Supervising the organization and conduct of the business affairs of the departments, commissions, offices, boards, divisions, institutions and other agencies within the executive department of the government of the commonwealth; (3) Developing new policies and programs which will improve the organization, structure, functions, economy, efficiency, procedures, services and administrative practices of all such departments, commissions, offices, boards, divisions, institutions and other agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Section 28 reasonably defines the categories of projects that may have State assistance. These projects, of course, must meet the general statutory criteria which govern the Authority in its action under the statute. We have already shown that the standards for action by the Authority are adequate. The program of mass transportation contemplated by \u00a7 5 [g] will, upon adoption, be an important guide to the Executive Office. Certain dollar limitations on contract assistance will then end. Several State agencies will participate in formulating the program and it must be approved by the advisory council and, in a certain contingency, by the Governor. Chapter 7 also gives a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>direction to the Executive Office, that is, to act for sound and wise financial administration. Chapters 161A and 7, together, instruct the Executive Office so to perform its part under c. 161A that that system as created will be capable of \u201cefficient operation . . . [and, consistently therewith, impose] the minimum burden on the commonwealth and on the cities and towns within the authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The Legislature has recognized in c. 161A that each project must be viewed in its relation to the whole statutory purpose and that only at the time of commitment to that project can a financially sound decision in the public interest be made as to the proportion of State aid necessary to its success without undue burden on the cities and towns affected. This need for appraisal and decision after the statute is enacted supports wider discretion than might otherwise be justified. The decision of the Executive Office will, to a limited extent, determine the division of burden between taxpayers generally and those in the seventy-eight cities and towns. There are, however, as shown, general standards for that decision, and the area for discretionary action is fixed by the limits on the total assistance that may be rendered in the several categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Doubtless in 'exercising that discretion the Executive Office will take into account, as one of the factors appropriate for consideration in respect of each project, the extent to which the project will be of benefit to an area larger than the seventy-eight cities and towns in relieving highway congestion, and providing facilities of value to the entire Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">There are analogies. The Department of Public Works, for example, within the limits of its appropriations, has wide discretion as to the building of State highways. It has discretion in making contributions for repairs and improvements of ways in small towns under G. L. c. 81, \u00a7 26. Although the town\u2019s share, if the State contributes, is fixed by \u00a7 26, the discretion to contribute is in the department on such information from the selectmen as it may require (\u00a727). Further, by \u00a7 26A, the county may contribute county funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>in accordance with snch agreements as the commissioners, the selectmen and the department may make. In the particular instance, a decision may greatly relieve local taxpayers in respect of the cost of certain ways. See also G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34 (2) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We conclude that there is adequate statutory guidance to the Executive Office for its decisions in the making of contracts of assistance under \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Constitutional Status of the Provisions for Borrowing Money. Article 62, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">A. Borrowing Directly by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Section 12 requires the Commonwealth to pay the Authority at the end of each year its \u201cnet cost of service.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By \u00a7\u00a7 8 to 11, a part of the net cost of service is assessed upon the seventy-eight cities and towns. See part VI below. By \u00a7 12, the State Treasurer may borrow in anticipation of these assessments and is to repay any sum borrowed \u201cas soon after said assessments are paid as is expedient, but in any event before the close of the year in which the same were borrowed. \u2019 \u2019 Section 13 authorizes advances by the Commonwealth during any year on account of net cost of service. It provides that such advances may be included in the amount to be borrowed by the State Treasurer under \u00a7 12, \u201cany such borrowing to take place in the calendar year in which the assessments under section twelve are to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Article 62, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments provides that the Commonwealth may \u201cborrow money in anticipation of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ceipts from taxes or other sources, such loan to be paid out of the revenue of the year in which it is created.\u201d The banks do not contend that borrowings under \u00a7 12 are not within the authority of art. 62, $ 2. See statutes noted in <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>340 Mass. 646, 650-651. Compare the <em>Singleton </em>case where the proposed borrowing would have been in anticipation of appropriations. It is to be noted that St. 1964, c. 563, \u00a7$ 2 and 6, amend the General Laws to make available for the purpose of affording contract assistance to the Authority under $ 28 of c. 161A a portion of the revenue from the cigarette excise.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">B. Borrowing by the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Section 4 of c. 161A empowers the Authority to establish units of mass transportation facilities for furnishing either express or local service and to acquire the necessary real property, facilities and equipment. The statute contemplates and authorizes the lease of these units for operation by others. The Authority may issue bonds to meet the capital expenditures (see \u00a7 23 [4]) necessary to carry out the provisions of the section. The bonds are to be paid solely from the rentals received or, if a lease is terminated, from the income from the operation of the facilities by the Authority. The term of a lease under \u00a7 4 may not exceed forty years, subject to cancellation at least once each year, and the rental must be at least sufficient to pay the bonds issued in connection with the unit leased. The bonds, being issued under the general power stated in \u00a7 23, must mature within forty years. These bonds under \u00a7 4 are, however, not subject to the limitation on dollar amount stated in $23.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Section 12 enables the Authority temporarily to borrow money and issue notes therefor whenever it lacks sufficient cash to make payments required of it. Such borrowing is in anticipation of payments of \u201cnet cost of service\u201d due from the State under \u00a7$ 12 or 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Section 23, in four numbered subsections, authorizes the Authority to issue bonds for the following purposes: (1) the acquisition of facilities and equipment for express service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>(except rolling stock, garages, yards, and shops); (2) the financing of agreements with railroads for passenger service to and from Boston extending no later than December 31,1967; (3) (a) the acquisition for its own use, or for lease, of facilities and equipment for local service and (b) the granting of relief to private companies injured by competition of the Authority; and (4) the payment of capital costs, including rolling stock, garages, yards, and shops. Section 23 also authorizes refunding bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Section 27 of c. 161A empowers the Authority to issue notes, including bond anticipation notes. Notes may be issued for the purposes and in the amounts for which bonds may be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Commonwealth is of course not the ostensible borrower in any of the foregoing instances. There are, however, related provisions that involve the Commonwealth in the repayment of borrowings. The Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to pay the \u201cnet cost of service\u201d appears to be the only firm assurance to holders of certain bonds of the Authority that the bonds will be paid. This assurance results from the inclusion of the debt service on bonds not otherwise provided for as an expense in computing the net cost of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Section 12 is to be read with \u00a7 13. Section 13, as noted above, imposes an obligation on the Commonwealth to make advances to the Authority at any time when required to put it in funds to meet its obligations. There are in \u00a7 13 specific provisions to assure lenders the aid of the courts to require that the advances needed to pay them are made. This is a \u201cright\u201d enforceable against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The Commonwealth, by contracts of assistance under \u00a7 28 (see part III A, <em>supra) </em>may guarantee temporary notes issued by the Authority in anticipation of bonds. By contracts of assistance also, the Commonwealth will undoubtedly be additionally and substantially committed to the payment of amounts due on certain bonds (see part II B, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We hold that none of these provisions, nor all of them, make the Commonwealth in substance, the principal in the Authority\u2019s borrowings. The principal is the Authority; it has a substantive, independent existence, a substantial business, and substantial business income. It is the Authority that borrows and for its own independent purposes. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>322 Mass. 745, 751-754. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>331 Mass. 771, 777. Compare <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>276 Mass. 617, 621; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>291 Mass. 567, 570; <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admn. </em>340 Mass. 586, 590-598.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The case of <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admn. </em>340 Mass. 586, 590-598, dealt with a very different situation. We there held that, although St. 1958, c. 603, authorized the Massachusetts State Office Building Association to borrow rather than the Commonwealth, in substance the borrowing was by the Commonwealth and the Association was no more than an \u2018 \u2018 artifice \u2019 \u2019 for the construction of the office building by the State without following the statutory procedures and safeguards for the construction of public works. We noted that (1) the only purpose of the Association was to construct the building, lease it, and eventually convey it to the Commonwealth; (2) the building was to be financed entirely from the sale of bonds which were to be paid entirely from \u201crentals\u201d paid by the Commonwealth; (3) the \u201crentals\u201d and the terms of the lease were fixed with reference to meeting the bond obligations and eventual conveyance was dependent upon payment of the bonds; (4) the Association had no usual landlord\u2019s duties and no independent business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">That the Authority is not such an artifice is plain. It has a great and multiple task to perform for an indefinite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>time. The delegation of this relatively new aspect of the public business to an independent agency is appropriate. It is in general accordance with the precedent of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. St. 1947, c. 544. As noted above (part II A), the Authority has the substance that precedents indicate to be appropriate for an independent political subdivision. The seventy-eight cities and towns have a part in choosing the directors by which the Authority is managed as well as a part in the control of its affairs. It is subjected to controls by State officers and other State agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In part, the Commonwealth is the conduit for the payment, by the cities and towns directly benefited, of the deficits in the Authority\u2019s operations. So far as the Commonwealth is committed to payments from its general funds it thus gives suitable State aid to a political subdivision in recognition of the general interest of the entire Commonwealth in efficient public transportation within its borders. Such State aid is \u201cno more than assistance offered by the Commonwealth to the . . . [Authority] to help . . . [the Authority] in part to carry the burden assumed by . . . [it] in a public enterprise.\u201d <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 322 Mass. 745, 753. The Commonwealth is not made a principal by the action under \u00a7 28 resulting in the earmarking of certain of its contributions for particular debt service. <em>Ibid. Opinion of the Justices, </em>331 Mass. 771, 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The statutory procedures for direct action against the Commonwealth are in effect garnishment proceedings that will serve to assure bond and note holders that they will be paid. The statute makes this explicit. Section 13 requires that proceedings to enforce the Commonwealth\u2019s commitment be brought by the Authority or in its name and on its behalf. The State in supplying this mechanism to make the bonds marketable is not making itself the principal on the borrowings.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We conclude, in view of the foregoing, that there is no borrowing by the Commonwealth, such that by art. 62, \u00a7 3, a vote of two thirds of each House of the General Court was required therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Is Credit Given or Lent to Private Parties? Article 62, \u00a7 1, op the Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The hanks concede that no pledge of credit is involved \u201cin simply making payments of cash subsidies from general public funds.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>347 Mass. 789, 790-791. The Commonwealth, however, in the respects already noted may be called upon to act under c. 161A so as to assure or facilitate payments due from the Authority. Some of the borrowings made by the Authority may be used to aid private transportation companies. These companies, as the banks point out, form a small and narrowly defined class.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">None of these provisions and no action under them conflict with the constitutional prohibition against the lending or giving the credit of the Commonwealth \u201cin aid of any individual, or of any private association, or of any corporation which is privately owned or managed.\u201d As we have shown, the aid given is to the Authority in its independent business operated in the public interest. No aid is given or lent to any other person or agency. The benefit to others is indirect and incidental and not the purpose of the statute. <em>Allydonn Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Housing Authy. </em>304 Mass. 288. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>322 Mass. 745, 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The Eeeeot op the Constitutional Amendment op November 3, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Article 62, \u00a7 1, now provides: \u201cThe Commonwealth may give, loan or pledge its credit only by a vote, taken by the yeas and nays, of two-thirds of each house of the general court present and voting thereon.\u201d Plainly, so far as any pledge of the Commonwealth\u2019s credit is <em>made by the Legislature </em>after November 3,1964, a two-thirds vote is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The legislative function in respect of credit under c. 161A was complete when the bill was enacted. True, prior to November 3, 1964, no specific action had been taken under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the statute in connection with which the Commonwealth\u2019s credit was pledged. The authority to take such action, however, had been given. Article 62, \u00a7 1, does not say that action to affix the Commonwealth\u2019s credit to a specific obligation is barred unless the legislative authority, although valid when enacted, was given by two-thirds votes. The language of the amendment, in saying that the only way that the credit can be pledged <em>is by legislative action, </em>excludes the later carrying out of the pledge from the constitutional concept of the pledge itself. The enactment of the statute was the pledge of the Commonwealth\u2019s credit within the meaning of the article. The Justices, speaking of a proposed bill to bind the Commonwealth\u2019s credit, unconstitutionally, to a private corporation to build a bridge to Hull, said: \u201cThe credit of the Commonwealth is given or loaned the moment the bill takes effect. That credit as matter of common knowledge cannot fail to be an influential, favorable factor in the sale of the obligations of the corporation whenever issued.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>276 Mass. 617, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The Authority is right in its contention that the amendment is a regulation of the legislative process. Such an amendment does not necessarily invalidate prior laws. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Board of Commrs. of the Taxing Dist. of Brownsville, </em>129 U. S. 479, 490. \u201cA provision of the Constitution commonly is to be interpreted as stating a broad and .general principle of government, regulative of all conditions arising in the future and falling within its terms.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 523, 543-544. For the general rule that statutes that affect substantive rights operate prospectively see <em>Lindberg </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>335 Mass. 141, 143; <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>338 Mass. 612, 617; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Taunton, </em>343 Mass. 485, 487-488.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The rule that the repeal of statutes that' create liabilities destroys rights based on the statutes does not present an analogy. See <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Taunton, petitioners, </em>290 Mass. 118, 12A-125; <em>Pittsley </em>v. <em>David., </em>298 Mass. 552, 555-557; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>291 U. S. 217, 226. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>See also <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>378 U. S. 226; <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Rock Hill, </em>379 U. S. 306. We think there can be no doubt that the Legislature and the people in adopting the amendment of November 3, 1964, understood that they were making a change in the legislative process effective for the future. We believe there was no intent to halt or impede the continued financing of established projects involving the pledge of the Commonwealth\u2019s credit voted by the Legislature prior to the amendment and hence without reference to the two-thirds vote requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Provisions for the Apportionment of Net Transportation Costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Commonwealth, if at the end of any year it is called upon to pay over to the Authority an amount representing the Authority\u2019s net cost of service for that year, will assess that amount, reduced by State aid, if any, upon the cities and towns. Section 8 provides that that part of the net cost of service which arises from express service is assessed by two computations. Seventy-five per cent is assessed upon the cities and towns according to the proportion that the number of commuters in each hears to the total number of commuters in the area; twenty-five per cent is assessed to those cities and towns having express stations according to the proportional number of riders hoarding at such stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Section 10 (for the fourteen cities and towns beginning in 1976) and \u00a7 11 (for the sixty-four cities and towns be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ginning in 1966) provide that that part of the net cost of service which arises from local service is assessed upon each city and town one half based upon its proportion of the population of the assessed area and one half according to the proportion which the net loss in each city or town bears to the net loss on all routes. By \u00a7 9, from 1966 through 1975, the fourteen cities and towns are assessed for local service in accordance with a combination of two factors; one based upon the \u201cprior method of assessment,\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the other based upon the proportional net loss attributable to each of the fourteen municipalities. In each of the ten years the percentage of assessment based upon the prior method is reduced by five per cent and the percentage based upon loss attributable to routes is correspondingly increased so that in 1975 the apportionment is fifty per cent by each method.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201cCommuters,\u201d by \u00a7 1, are \u201call persons whose place of work is in the city of Boston or the city of Cambridge and whose residence is in one of the fourteen cities or towns or one of the sixty-four cities or towns, regardless of the means of transport of such persons to and from their places of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We assume that a number of commuters do not use express service. The banks point out that some persons within the definition of \u201ccommuters\u201d may live so close to their places of work that they are not commuters in the common sense. Even so, we think the proportional number of commuters is a reasonable basis of apportionment. Express service is related to all other means by which people move about. Those who travel every day between home and work burden all transportation facilities; their number is an appropriate measure of the benefit to their community of express service. The presence of such service as an alternative to the use of private automobiles greatly relieves highway use so that those who do not themselves use such service are benefited.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>It is also reasonable to apportion twenty-five per cent of the cost of express service in relation to the number of riders boarding at express service stations in the municipality. True, the number of riders boarding in Cambridge, for example, is not numerically related to the number of Cambridge taxpayers using the facilities. The city, however, is benefited by a transportation system that moves in tunnels or reserved areas commuters who must pass through the city by some means.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We discern nothing arbitrary in the assessment of the costs of local service. The basis of apportionment of losses to population and to routes is the general benefit to all inhabitants of an efficient public transportation system. The provision for a ten year period for gradual shift of loss computations for the fourteen cities and towns from the present method to the new method appears a suitable means of accomplishing a reasonable change.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Apportionment of costs of debt service on a different basis for the fourteen cities and towns from that applicable to the sixty-four cities and towns is reasonable. It leaves the burden of preexisting debt where it was when originally incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">By any measuring and apportioning schemes that can feasibly be administered, only a rough approximation of equality in the distribution of burdens can be had. Other deviations from an ideal apportionment plan, in addition to those noted, of course exist. They do not, however, render the apportionment invalid. The cost and complexity of refinements justify the legislative decision to avoid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\u201cIt is not essential that the burdens of taxation should be imposed upon cities and towns in proportion to the benefits received by each from the expenditure of the money raised .... [EJxpenses have been apportioned not only \u2018with reference to all the circumstances of benefit to the respective municipalities affected\u2019 but also with reference \u2018to their population, extent, and ability to bear the burden.\u2019 . . . [EJxpenses . . . have been apportioned.according to the valuation of the several municipalities and according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>percentages derived from combinations of valuation and population and upon other bases.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>234 Mass. 612, 620.
