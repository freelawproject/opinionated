The defendants were not subscribers under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The case is here on the exception of the defendants to the denial of their motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">From the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff the jury could have found the following: On the morning of March 14, 1961, the plaintiff, who was over fifty-five years of age, \u201cfelt well\u201d and \u201chad no chest pain before he started . . . work.\u201d He arrived at his place of employment \u201cbetween 8:15 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., \u2019 \u2019 went to the basement, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>and after the performance of various chores,\u201d \u201cpicked up a bundle of large paper sacks weighing 90 pounds or more.\u201d He thereupon suffered a pain in his \u201clower breastbone area \u2019 \u2019 and <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> \u2018 </em>fell down. \u2019 \u2019 After drinking some milk he vomited. The pain recurred and he was taken to a hospital where he stayed until June 9,1961. In July, 1961, he again felt ill, had \u201cchest pain,\u201d and was \u201ctaken to the Veteran\u2019s Hospital . . . [where he] remained two days. \u201d He subsequently returned \u201cas an out-patient about once a month.\u201d \u201c [T]he front and side of his heart\u201d were damaged, and he suffered an \u201cacute anterolateral mycardial infarction.\u201d His ability to work has been impaired as a result of this heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The sole issue before us is whether there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff sustained an injury arising \u201cout of and in the course of [his] employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 66, cl. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">At the trial, a heart specialist called by the plaintiff testified, in response to a hypothetical question, that \u201cthere is a direct causal relationship between the effort of lifting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>bundle of bags and the onset of his acute heart damage.\u201d The defendants contend that a variety of \u201cassumptions not established by the evidence\u201d were submitted to the expert witness in the hypothetical question, and that his answer is thus \u201cwithout probative value.\u201d However, the witness had examined the plaintiff a few months after the accident and made a diagnosis at that time which coincided with the diagnosis made at the hospital. Before the hypothetical question was put to the witness, he testified regarding the events and circumstances immediately prior to the occurrence of the plaintiff\u2019s heart injury as they were related to him by the plaintiff during the medical examination. Whether such testimony would be admissible as proof of the matters stated had the defendants objected thereto is not in issue. In the case at' bar the testimony could properly serve as a basis for an expert opinion. A qualified expert witness may \u201cbase his opinion upon facts observed by himself or within his own knowledge and testified to by himself, or upon facts assumed in the questions put to him and supported either by admitted facts or by the testimony of other witnesses already given or to be given at the trial, or upon facts derived partly from one source and partly from the other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 73. <em>Lovasco </em>v. <em>Parhhurst Marine Ry. </em>322 Mass. 64, 67. See McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15. \u201cThe witness possessed special knowledge and the . . . [opinion] which he rendered bore relation to the facts which the jury could have found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>346 Mass. 1, 4. It is apparent from the witness\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that his opinion, to the extent that it depended on the weight of the sacks or bundles lifted by the plaintiff, was based on information with regard to which the witness had previously testified. Thus, the hypothetical question put to the witness was not crucial to his expert opinion, and the various assumptions in the question which were not \u201cestablished by the evidence\u201d are of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The defendants also argue that \u201c [t]here was no evidence as to the extent to which the plaintiff exerted him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>self.\u201d We do not agree. The evidence regarding the weight of the sacks or bundles lifted by the plaintiff, together with other evidence of his age and physical appearance, is ample indication of the \u201ceffort\u201d or \u201cexertion\u201d involved. We think that the expert opinion had sufficient probative value to support a finding that the plaintiff sustained an injury arising \u2018 \u2018 out of and in the course of [his] employment.\u201d There was no error in the denial of the defendants \u2019 motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-13\"> Section 148, so far as here material, reads: \u201cEvery person having employees in his service shall pay weekly each such employee the wages earned by him to within six days of the date of said payment if employed for five or six days in the week, or to within seven days of the date of said payment if employed seven days in the week.\u201d For violation of this section criminal penalties are provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
