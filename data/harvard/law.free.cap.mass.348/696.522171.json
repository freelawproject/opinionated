G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended by St. 1957, c. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">The issue is whether the February 5, 1962, action of the petitioner (the school committee), as an appointing authority (G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 [a]), abolishing the position of senior account clerk in the school lunch program then occupied by Mrs. Catherine L. Hughes \u201cwas justified.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b), as amended by St. 1948, c. 240. Mrs. Hughes had duly requested a hearing and review under \u00a7 43 (b) and the Civil Service Commission on April 25, 1962, had accepted the report of the hearing officer that the school committee\u2019s action was not justified, and had reversed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The issues in the Superior Court were properly tried on the return. <em>Loranger </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Regional High Sch. Dist. Sch. Comm.. </em>338 Mass. 450, 453. The return properly included the transcript of the evidence on which the Civil Service Commission entered its order. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist. </em>322 Mass. 566, 573-574. Certiorari was the appropriate remedy. <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>343 Mass. 641, 642-643. The State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>is, by \u00a7 1 (2) as appearing in St. 1959, c. 511, inapplicable to civil service proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The intervening step of review by the District Court, provided by Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43 (d) and 45, is only in the case of an affirmance of the order of the appointing authority. After that step, where required; certiorari is available, <em>Sullivan </em>case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Review by certiorari of the proceeding before the commission is governed by Gr. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. It is therein provided that where the petition is to correct errors in proceedings not according to the course of common law it \u201cshall be open to the petitioner to contend . . . that the evidence which formed the basis of the action complained of or the basis of any specified finding or conclusion was as matter of law insufficient to warrant such action, finding or conclusion.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Third Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>316 Mass. 663, 667. See the <em>Mullen </em>case, <em>supra, </em>343 Mass. 641, 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The evidence before the hearing officer was insufficient to warrant his conclusion that the school committee\u2019s action was unjustified. The salient parts of his report are summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His finding is, in essence, based on his disagreement with the committee\u2019s judgment that a reorganization which included the abolition of the position would promote efficiency and economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Such a decision, however, was for the school committee. Chapter 31, \u00a7 43, does not substitute the Civil Service Commission for the school committee in the operation of the school department. See- <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 619; cases gathered in <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Mayor of Newton, </em>308 Mass. 578, 581; <em>Dooling </em>v. <em>Fire Commr. of Malden, </em>309 Mass. 156; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Third Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>316 Mass. 663, 668; <em>Simonian </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>342 Mass. 573, 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">, The school lunch- program is a school committee function. Gr. L. c.-71, \u00a7 72., The- record shows that the committee exercised its best judgment. It shows that, after deliberation, the school committee effected a reorganization that excluded Mrs. Hughes\u2019s position. That.reorganization justified the abolition of the position. \u25a0 True, the testimony shows that Riley, who had been engaged to operate the reorganized program without the clerical assistance which Mrs. Hughes afforded, indicated to the superintendent, after his employment began, that he had need for such help and asked the superintendent if he could retain Mrs. Hughes. ' He said that, after thinking it over, he felt he would need clerical help. He did not,, however, according to the testimony, \u201cmake that impression known to the School Committee when he was interviewed for the position.\u201d Riley\u2019s belated views were not binding on the school committee. They, may tend to show that the committee\u2019s decision was inadvisable; on the other hand, for aught that appears, notwithstanding the views of Riley soon after he was employed, one person can efficiently and economically operate the program. In any event, no basis appears for overriding the committee\u2019s determination. Even though c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b), provides for a hearing \u201cde novo upon all material evidence and a decision .- . . upon that evidence and not merely for a review of the previous hearing\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Roxbury Dist. </em>322 Mass. 566, 572) the issue as to \u201cjust cause\u201d (\u00a7 43 [a]) is narrow where the cause is abolition of the position. This contrasts with the <em>Sullivan </em>case where the removal by the appointing authority was disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The respondent contends that the case is moot. We disagree. Affidavits show that Mrs. Hughes\u2019s employment has been continued during the litigation and that on December 28, 1964, the school committee voted to dismiss Mrs. Hughes \u201ceffective immediately . . . predicated on the initial abolishment of the position . . . and that . . . [she] was so notified.\u201d As to dismissal for mootness on a showing to this court, see <em>Hubrite Informal Frocks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>297 Mass. 530, 534; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Taaffe, </em>339 Mass. 519, 520. We construe the continued employment of Mrs. Hughes as recognition that the validity of the termination of her employment had not been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied. The order deuying the petition is reversed. An order is to enter in the Superior Court reversing the decision of the commission, and affirming the action of the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> The report noted that the school committee\u2019s reasons for abolishing the position were that a reorganization of the school lunch program had become necessary because of deficits, the falling off of student participation and the need of providing a balanced nutrient diet under State requirements and in order, by expansion and consolidation of the program under a reorganization, to obtain a more economical and effective administration of the program. The school committee had engaged Edward Riley to operate the whole project, but subsequently it appeared that Riley wanted to employ Mrs. Hughes to continue her work. No fault was found with her performance of her duties. In view of Riley\u2019s desire to have Mrs. Hughes in the program he could not find that a reorganization necessitated the abolition of the job. She had nothing to do with deficits, or the falling off of student participation, or providing a balanced nutrient diet. \u201cIt seems to me that if there is going to be an expansion of the program and even though there may be some consolidation, a Senior Account Clerk would be all the more necessary and that, therefore, her position should not be abolished.\u201d The school committee had not produced evidence which would warrant it in abolishing the position. The job will be just as necessary after reorganization as before and the action was not justified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
