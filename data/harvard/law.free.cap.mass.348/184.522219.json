It was alleged (and later agreed) that O\u2019Handley was a .disabled veteran; that on August 7, 1954, he had pleaded guilty to, and been sentenced upon, an indictment for armed robbery; and that on September 12, 1958, he received a full pardon.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The case was heard upon a statement of agreed facts. By final decree it was declared that O\u2019Handley must be appointed and was entitled to back pay. The commissioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">On September 16, 1961, a civil service examination was held \u201cto provide a list ... to fill vacancies\u201d as patrolman in the M.D.C.\u2019s police. The list was established on the basis of a \u201cwritten examination, training, and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>as well as a physical examination and strength test.\u201d The commissioner of the M.D.C. made a requisition to the director in order to make twenty-five appointments from the list. The director sent a certification to the commissioner containing thirty-five names of which the first sixteen were disabled veterans and the remaining nineteen were veterans. 0 \u2019Handley was the tenth person in line for appointment. He was certified as a disabled veteran and held <em>\u201ca </em>discharge which covers service in both World War II and the Korean Conflict.\u201d O\u2019Handley is \u201cwilling and able to accept . . . but the [Commissioner has refused to appoint Mm.\u201d The commissioner, as his reason, referred in a letter of January 8, 1964, to 0\u2019Handley\u2019s plea of \u201cguilty to the charge of [armed] robbery .... [O\u2019Handley] was sentenced to an indefinite term for armed robbery of an A &amp; P store and for carrying a dangerous weapon and thereafter was remanded to the . . . [Reformatory at Concord. Inasmuch as . . . [G-. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96A] reads: \u2018No person who has been convicted of any felony shall be appointed as a police officer . . . \u2019 my decision in not appointing him, even though he is a disabled veteran ... is obvious. ... [I]t should be disclosed that on September 12, 1958 ... 0 \u2019Handley was granted a full . . . pardon by the then Governor, with the . . . consent of the . . . Council. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b232-22\">Belying upon a 1961 opinion of the Attorney General (Bep. A. G. Pub. Doc. No. 12,1961, p. 125) in a similar case and also upon a 1964 opinion concerning this very matter, the director wrote to the commissioner that it was \u201cnecessary that . . . O\u2019Handley be appointed.\u201d A second letter (February 14, 1964) from the director stated that \u201cinasmuch as . . . O\u2019Handley, a disabled veteran, has not been appointed . . . the appointments of the following non-disabled veterans, who were appointed from the certification list of December 9,1963 on which . . . [0\u2019Handley\u2019s] name . . . was certified as a disabled veteran, are hereby revoked.\u201d Then followed the names of fourteen patrolmen. It has been stipulated that if O\u2019Handley was, \u201cas a matter of law, entitled to the appointment\u201d he shall receive back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>pay as of December 30, 1963, and that a vacancy \u201cwill be held available until the conclusion of this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">This case is in most respects one of first impression in Massachusetts. It requires consideration of (a) the extent of the appointing authority\u2019s discretion, under Cr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 23 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 627, \u00a7 5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to refrain from appointing a disabled veteran to a civil service post because of his past commission of a serious crime of violence, and (b) the extent to which 0\u2019Handley\u2019s pardon<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may prevent the commissioner from considering, as a ground for not appointing 0 \u2019Handley a police officer, the robbery which led to 0\u2019Handley\u2019s plea of guilty and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">1. The commissioner is the appointing officer of the M.D.C. See G. L. c. 28, \u00a7 3 (as amended through St. 1961, c. 562, \u00a7 1). As such, he possesses whatever discretion is given to an appointing authority under the civil service statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">2. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>166 Mass. 14, the question was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>presented whether a veteran could properly be placed at the head of the eligible list for appointment to the detective force of the Commonwealth\u2019s district police in preference to all others, under St. 1895, c. 501, which authorized appointment of veterans without examination. The court said (p. 24), \u201cThe purpose of St. 1895, c. 501, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6, is to make the appointment of veterans compulsory, if they desire to be appointed, whether the appointing power or the commissioners think they are or are not qualified to perform the duties of the office or employment which they seek.\u201d The court proceeded (p. 25), \u201c [I]t is inconsistent with the nature of our government, and particularly with articles 6 and 7 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of our Declaration of Bights, that the appointing power should be compelled by legislation to appoint to public offices persons of a certain class in preference to all others, <em>without the exercise on its part of any discretion, </em>and without the favorable judgment of some . . . officer or board designated by law to . . . determine whether the persons to be appointed are <em>actually qualified </em>to perform the duties which pertain to the offices\u201d (emphasis supplied). At pp. 26-27, it was said, \u201cWe are of opinion that \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6 ... so far as they purport <em>absolutely </em>to give to veterans particular and exclusive privileges distinct from those .of the community in obtaining public office, cannot be upheld as . . . within the constitutional power of the General Court\u201d (emphasis supplied). The opinion pointed out (p. 20) that there was in the 1895 statute no \u201cindication that the Legislature intended that the [civil service] commissioners should examine a veteran . . . [who made application under the statute] with reference to his moral character, or his mental acquirements and capacity to perform the duties of the position which he seeks.\u201d Moral character thus seems to have been regarded by the court as a requisite of appointment at least on a parity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cmental acquirements and capacity to perform the duties.\u201d Shortly thereafter the Legislature enacted St. 1896, c. 517.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>166 Mass. 589, the Justices considered that statute and certain rules proposed thereunder. Four Justices said (p. 595) that the effect of \u00a7 2 \u201cis that the veterans must first be found qualified, by an examination in accordance with the civil service statutes and rules, to perform the duties of the office . . . and, if they are found so qualified, they are to be preferred in appointment . . .. The General Court may have been of opinion that\u201d an honorably discharged veteran \u201cis a person who has shown such qualities of character that it is for the interests of the Commonwealth to appoint him to certain offices ... in preference to other male persons, <em>if he is found otherwise qualified to perform the duties. </em>The General Court may have so thought, on the ground either that such a person would be likely to possess courage, constancy, habits of obedience, and fidelity, which are valuable qualifications for any public office ... or that the recognition of the services of veterans . . . would promote . . . devotion to the welfare of the State .... If such was the opinion of the General Court, we cannot say that it was beyond its constitutional power to enact this section. Of the wisdom of such legislation we are not made the judges. <em>The section does not purport to give an absolute preference to veterans ivithout regard to their qualifications, </em>and the constitutionality of similar legislation was not considered in\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>166 Mass. 14 (emphasis supplied). Three Justices were of opinion (pp. 599-600) that it was \u201cnot within the constitutional power of the Legislature to enact that veterans shall be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ferred for public office or employment to others who may have higher standing or superior qualifications. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">With respect to \u00a7 3 (see fn. 5) all the Justices were of opinion (pp. 595-596) that it validly gave \u201ca discretion to the appointing power to appoint veterans to certain . . . [positions] without an examination, if in its opinion the needs of the public service require this to be done.\u201d At p. 596, it was said, \u201cUndoubtedly this . . . gives a certain advantage to veterans over other persons in being appointed to office or employment, but <em>the section implies that the veteran to he appointed shall he found qualified hy the appointing power in its own way, and it was not intended to provide for the appointment of veterans who are not qualified to perform the duties pertaining to the office or employment which they seek. </em>The section does not necessarily exclude the appointment of other persons if <em>the appointing power </em>is of opinion that the appointment should be made under the civil service statutes and rules. We cannot say that this section is an enactment beyond the constitutional power of the General Court\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Justices were not confronted with a question involving any specific appointee or office and had only incidental occasion to consider or mention (see p. <em>597) </em>good character or other qualities not established by passing a civil service examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The diverse views expressed in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>166 Mass. 589, indicate strongly that the limited preference <em>for </em>veterans there discussed goes to the limit of what is constitutionally permissible. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Park Commn. </em>215 Mass. 502, 506, where the court strictly construed certain veterans <em>* </em>preference legislation and said, \u201cThis construction finds confirmation in the circumstance that the language occurs in the civil service law, the design of which is to secure efficiency in the public service and prevent discrimination in appointments to it based on any other consideration than fitness to perform its duties. It concerns a preference in favor of veterans, the constitutionality of which has been much debated . . . and ... in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>event cannot go beyond closely confined boundaries. Extension of such preference is not to be implied from equivocal words. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The later cases, like the earlier authorities, have sustained the constitutional validity of a veterans\u2019 preference where there is (a) no legislative requirement of absolute preference and (b) reasonable legislative recognition of the principle that an appointee must be qualified for the position which he seeks. See <em>Canty </em>v. <em>City Council of Lawrence, </em>275 Mass. 261, 263 (G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 23, as amended, \u201cgives ... no absolute and unconditional preference\u201d); <em>MacCarthy </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>319 Mass. 124, 126; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 736, 740-742; <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>330 Mass. 22, 25-26.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The director places some reliance upon <em>Mayor of Lynn </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil Serv. </em>269 Mass. 410, 414, <em>Younie </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Unemployment Compensation, </em>306 Mass. 567, 571, and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>324 Mass. 455. Although in the <em>Mayor of Lynn </em>case, this court adopted the reasoning of the majority Justices in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>166 Mass. 589, it pointed out (pp. 414-415) that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 23, \u201creaches close to the limit of legislative power. \u2019 \u2019 In the <em>Younie </em>case, \u00a7 23 (as amended through St. 1939, c. 238, \u00a7 30) was spoken of (p. 571) as providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cthat, when [disabled veterans have been certified for appointment, the appointing power could not decline to appoint them . . . and appoint others who were not disabled veterans.\u201d No issues relating to moral fitness and character were before the court and we do not construe the quoted language as having reference to such issues. Moral fitness and character, of course, are not readily tested by the ordinary civil service examinations which are the usual basis of certification. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>324 Mass. 455, 460 (as in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>292 Mass. 109, 113), this court did not reach the question of the constitutionality of that part of \u00a7 23 \u201cwhich purports to give to a disabled veteran absolute preference over all other persons including veterans in appointment to office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We conclude that <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>166 Mass. 14, has not been modified by later decisions, and that no opinion of this court has held that an appointing authority must appoint an eligible disabled veteran or veteran, not of good moral reputation and character, merely because of his past military record, in preference to other duly certified, eligible persons of good character. We think that \u00a7 23 (see fn. 1) in requiring that a disabled veteran \u201cbe appointed ... in preference to all other persons\u201d may not be construed (1) as creating a mandatory, absolute preference, or (2) as depriving appointing authorities of the power, implicit in the civil service rules (fn. 3), to protect the services for which they are responsible from unworthy appointees of bad character, or (3) as requiring them to disregard facts concerning a disabled veteran\u2019s character or past conduct which may reasonably be regarded as making him unfit for appointment. To construe \u00a7 23 as imposing such an absolute preference would deprive that section of one basis sometimes advanced to justify a veterans\u2019 preference (see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>166 Mass. 589, 595; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>324 Mass. 455, 460), viz. that a veteran by reason of his military service \u201cmight have such qualities . . . that it is for the interests of the Commonwealth to appoint him to certain offices or employments.\u201d It would be unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>able to impute to the Legislature an absolute requirement that a disabled veteran be appointed where the facts before the appointing authority show that a particular veteran is not a suitable person to appoint. A construction of \u00a7 23 as requiring such an absolute preference would also lead to serious doubts of its constitutional validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In part because of these doubts (see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 785; <em>Bay State Harness Horse Racing &amp; Breeding Assn. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>342 Mass. 694, 699; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>346 Mass. 100, 106) we adopt a construction of \u00a7 23 which is within the constitutional limits set out in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>166 Mass. 14, 21-27, and Opinion <em>of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 736, 740. We hold that under \u00a7 23 an appointing authority has the power and duty to protect the public interest in having only public officers and employees of good character and integrity and may refrain from appointing a disabled veteran in preference to others where there are reasonable grounds to regard that veteran\u2019s character or past conduct as rendering him unfit and unsuitable to perform the duties of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">3. Much confusion concerning the effect of a pardon has been caused by the broad statement in <em>Ex Parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. 333, 380, that a pardon \u201creleases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence.\u201d Of this statement, Professor Williston said (see Does a Pardon Blot Out Guilt? 28 Harv. L. Rev. 647, 648), \u201cEverybody knows that the word \u2018pardon\u2019 naturally connotes guilt<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as a matter of English. Everybody also knows that the vast majority of pardoned convicts were in fact guilty; and when it is said that in the eye of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>they are as innocent as if they had never committed an of-fence, the natural rejoinder is, then the eyesight of the law is very bad.\u201d We adopt, so far as applicable to the facts before us, Professor Williston\u2019s view of the \u201ctrue line of distinction\u201d (28 Harv. L. Rev. 647, 653) as follows: \u201cThe pardon removes all legal punishment for the offence. Therefore if the mere conviction involves certain disqualifications which would not follow from the commission of the crime without conviction, the pardon removes such disqualifications. On the other hand, if character is a necessary qualification and the commission of a crime would disqualify even though there had been no criminal prosecution for the crime, the fact that the criminal has been convicted and pardoned does not make him any more eligible.\u201d In other words, even if a pardon may remit all penal consequences of a criminal conviction, it cannot obliterate the acts which constituted the crime. These acts are historical facts (see Rep. A. G. Pub. Doc. No. 12, 1942, p. 60) which, despite the public act of mercy and forgiveness implicit in the pardon, ordinary, prudent men will take into account in their subsequent dealings with the actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Few Massachusetts cases (see Lattin, The Pardoning Power in Massachusetts, 11 B. U. L. Rev. 505, 519) have dealt with the effect of pardons. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>24 Pick. 277, 280, held that a partial pardon did not restore the competency of the offender as a witness in a day when conviction resulted in excluding the testimony of one convicted of a felony. In the course of the opinion, however, Morton, J., approved a text statement that the power of pardon, \u201cwhen <em>fully </em>exercised, is an effectual mode of restoring the competency of a witness. It must be <em>fully </em>exercised to produce this effect; for if the <em>punishment </em>only be pardoned or remitted, it will not restore the competency, and does not remove the blemish of character. There must be a <em>full and free pardon </em>of the <em>offence, </em>before these can be restored and removed.\u201d We do not construe this statement and the somewhat comparable statement in <em>Rittenberg </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>214 Mass. 343, 347, as more than dicta con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>cerning the effect which a full pardon might have upon the offender\u2019s competency as a witness (in the <em>Perkins </em>case) or, perhaps, upon the use of the pardoned conviction to impeach the witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We, in any event, are unwilling, upon the basis of these statements, to conclude that a pardon precludes public officers from reasonable consideration of the facts constituting the pardoned offence in any matter in which those facts may be relevant. Cases like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>109 Mass. 323, are not pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The authorities outside of Massachusetts are not wholly consistent in describing the effect of pardons. See Wei-hofen, The Effect of a Pardon, 88 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 177. The better considered cases reject the unduly broad language of <em>Ex Parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. 333, 380, and treat a pardon (at least one not based on the offender\u2019s innocence) as removing only penal consequences of the criminal acts without foreclosing reasonable consideration of the conviction and the circumstances of the pardoned crime. A conviction, later pardoned, may be taken into account on the issue of sentence for a subsequent offence, as, for example, under an habitual criminal statute. <em>People </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>9 Cal. 2d 508, 510-514. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Texas Crim. App. 70, 72-77. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edelstein, </em>146 Wash. 221, 243-249. See <em>Carlesi </em>v. <em>New York, </em>233 U. S. 51; <em>Timberlake </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>245 Ky. 163, 165; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>324 Pa. 73, 76-78. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>386 Pa. 62, 65-68. The pardoned offence, and the facts underlying it, may be considered in disbarment proceedings <em>(Matter of Lavine, </em>2 Cal. 2d 324, 327-329; <em>State </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>136 Fla. 875, 877-878); see <em>In re Stephenson, </em>243 Ala. 342, 346-347; annotation, 70 A. L. R. 2d 268, 333-335) and in other instances where proof of good moral background and character is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>requisite. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>140 Fla. 536, 548 (practice of medicine). <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Finegan, </em>254 App. Div. (N. Y.) 110, 114-116 (civil service position). Cf. <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>230 Iowa, 1005, 1010-1012. Even a statute, enacted primarily for the protection of the State and the public, making persons convicted of crime ineligible to hold office has been viewed as creating a disqualification not removed by a pardon which restores other civil rights. <em>State ex rel Atty. Gen. </em>v. <em>Irby, </em>190 Ark. 786, 796-798. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>State Election Bd. </em>169 Okla. 363, 365-366.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">4. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 96A (inserted by St. 1938, c. 342), provides that no person \u201cconvicted of any felony shall be appointed as a police officer of a . . . district.\u201d Whatever the legislative purpose behind \u00a7 96A may . have been,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it necessarily has the practical effect of imposing a quasi penal, civil disqualification to be a police officer as an incident of, and automatically following upon, conviction for felony. In the light of the cases from other jurisdictions, already cited, we think that the absolute disqualification or ineligibility, imposed by such a statute, is to-be regarded as removed by a full pardon, so that the pardoned person (1) may apply for appointment to the office for which he was formerly disqualified, and (2) may hold that office if he is able to sustain the heavy burden of satisfying the electorate or an appointing authority of his good character and suitability at the time of seeking office. We think also that, in considering such a pardoned applicant\u2019s qualifications and suitability, the events underlying the pardoned conviction may be and should be evaluated, and relied upon reasonably, by the proper public body or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We hold that O\u2019Handley\u2019s full pardon removed his ineligibility under \u00a7 96A as an absolute bar to application and consideration for appointment, despite the strong legislative policy in \u00a7 96A that persons once convicted of felony are not thereafter to be entrusted with police duties. Nevertheless, even if O\u2019Handley has ceased to be ineligible under \u00a7 96A to apply for appointment, it was open, and remains open, to the commissioner to refuse to appoint O\u2019Handley because of the serious character of the criminal conduct underlying his conviction. The obvious inappropriateness of appointing as a police officer one previously convicted of felony, even though later pardoned (for grounds other than his innocence), was ample justification for the commissioner\u2019s refusal to appoint O\u2019Handley. See <em>State ex rel. Atty. Gen. </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>44 Ohio St. 98,102,116-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">5. The final decree is reversed. A new decree consistent with this opinion is to be entered, declaring (1) that under Gr.

O\u2019Handley\u2019s plea of guilty to armed robbery strongly implies that his pardon was not granted because he was innocent. A pardon clearly granted because of the wrongful conviction of an innocent person might present questions not raised by this record. See <em>Matter of Kaufman, </em>245 N. Y. 423, 429; Weihofen, The Effect of a Pardon, 88 U. of Pa. L.

It might be argued that a statute of this type would be applicable despite the pardon of a convicted person within its terms. Cf. the <em>Irby </em>case, 190 Ark. 786, 796. We think, however, that \u00a7 96A in terms does create a statutory civil disqualification. Some support for our interpretation may be found in the circumstance that the Legislature has not expressly made \u00a7 9 6A, or some comparable provision, one of the \u201cterms and conditions upon which a pardon may be granted\u201d (see fn. 2), as we assume (without deciding) might have been done under art. 73 of the Amendments to the Constitution of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
