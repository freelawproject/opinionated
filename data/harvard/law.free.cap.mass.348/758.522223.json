DeVincent (the insured) died at a hospital on April 23, 1958. While in the hospital, he executed on February 22, 1958, a revocable trust under which his wife Was to receive the trust income for her life and to have a general power to dispose of part of the principal-by her will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subject to the wife\u2019s interests, the trust property was to be held primarily for the' benefit \u00f3f his children and more remote is\u00e1ue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">The insured placed $100 subject to this trust and shortly thereafter executed the necessary insurance company forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>to change the beneficiaries of certain life insurance policies on his life, so that the trustees of the revocable trust became the beneficiaries. Prior to these changes of beneficiary, the policies had.all been payable, in the event of the insured\u2019s death, to his wife, .and, if she predeceased him, in equal shares to Ms cMldren.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\u25a0 After the insured\u2019s death, the trustees collected $156,099.66 of insurance proceeds. The' executors of the insured\u2019s will (also executed on February 22, 1958; see <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>315 Mass. 639, 647) reported the foregoing facts to the Massachusetts inheritance tax authorities, but claimed that the insurance proceeds were not subject to Massachusetts death taxes (see G. L. cc. 65, 65A). The commissioner on January 29, 1964, apparently treating the changes of beneficiary as made, \u201cin contemplation of the . ...'[insured\u2019s] death\u201d witMn Gr. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1, made a determination of the value of the trust property and, on March 3, 1964, certified to the trustees a tax of $3,047.87 on the present interest in the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The trustees then filed this petition in eqrnty (see Gr. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 65, \u00a7 30) to determine whether a tax under c. 65 was due with respect to the life insurance proceeds. The probate judge reserved and reported the case to this court without decision upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>226 Mass. 306, 310, this court in 1917 considered the taxation of life insurance policy proceeds with particular.reference (see p. 307) to the provision now found in G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 596; see later amendment by St. 1961, c. 403) imposing an inheritance tax upon property passing by gift \u201cmade or.ihtended to take effect . ... after ... .[a decedent\u2019s] death.\u201d This-court applied (p. 309) the principle that tax. laws are to be strictly construed and gave weight (p. 3l0) to \u201cthe'practical construction put upon the law by those charged- With . . . [its] enforcement . .'; through many years.\u201d I\u00f1 \u00e1n opinion by Chief Justice Rugg, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>concluded \u201cthat sums received by beneficiaries in accordance with designations made in contracts of insurance are not subject to the succession tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>309 Mass. 293 (although it was pointed out, see pp. 294-295, that no contention was then made that policies had been \u201ctransferred ... by the insured in contemplation of death\u201d), .it was held (pp. 296-300) that the proceeds of life insurance policies payable to trustees under a trust indenture for the benefit of others were not subject to tax under Gf. L. c. 65 upon the death of the insured. The case placed (p. 298) some emphasis upon the circumstance that \u201cour taxing statutes have never contained any special provisions laying an excise based on the amounts receivable from life insurance by the beneficiary designated in the policy.\u201d The court (by Ronan, J.) went on to say, \u201cThere is no power to tax in the absence of a statute expressly granting such authority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>315 Mass. 704, 711, this court <em>(again </em>speaking by Ronan, J.) \u201cconfined\u201d the <em>Tyler </em>case \u201cto its facts\u201d and declined to extend its doctrine to a death benefit under an annuity contract. We do not regard that case as limiting the effect of the <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Welch </em>cases as applied to insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In the nearly half a century since the <em>Tyler </em>case, there has obviously been reliance on that decision. Despite the limiting language of the <em>Gregg </em>case, the reasoning in the <em>Tyler </em>case and the <em>Welch </em>case was broad, and substantially proceeds on the principle that the payment of insurance proceeds at the death of the insured has not been subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>to succession tax by the Legislature. Although the facts of these cases directly raised only the question whether insurance proceeds could be taxed (under the general language of what is now c. 65, \u00a7 1) as gifts to take effect in possession at or after the insured\u2019s death, most of what was said (especially in the <em>Tyler </em>ease) seems appropriate to exclude a tax upon such insurance proceeds as a \u201cgift . . . made in contemplation of the death of the . . . donor.\u201d As was pointed out in the <em>Welch </em>case (309 Mass. 293, at pp. 299-300), the Legislature has refrained from adopting legislation to change the effect of the <em>Tyler </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">It was said in the <em>Welch </em>case, at pp. 298-299, \u201cthat the concept of transfers within both the Federal and the State taxing statutes has been greatly broadened since the decision in the <em>Tyler </em>case\u201d in 1917. We need not decide whether, as a matter of first impression, the <em>Tyler </em>case would have been decided differently today. That there has been a change of tax concepts does not seem to us to be sufficient reason for changing by judicial decision the long standing interpretation of what is now GL L. c. 65, \u00a7 1. After this lapse of time, we think that, if any change is to be made in the application of Gr. L. e. 65 to the proceeds of life insurance policies, that change should be made by the Legislature rather than by a new interpretation of the statute by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A decree is to be entered in the Probate Court (1) declaring that the proceeds of the insurance policies on the insured\u2019s life are not subject to tax under Gr. L. c. 65, and (2) ordering that the tax certified with respect to such proceeds be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-16\"> The trust appears to have been designed,. in' large' measure to adapt the insured\u2019s disposition of the proceeds -of his life insurance. policies to the \u2018 \u2018marital deduction\u2019 \u2019\u2022 for Federal estate taxi See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 2056.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-17\"> The trust was subject to an overall.,termination provision plainly intended to prevent violation of the rule against perpetuities. See <em>Second Bank-State St. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Second Bank-State St. Trust Co. </em>335 Mass. 407, 410.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> it may be significant that the application of the Federal estate tax to the proceeds of life insurance policies is almost entirely a development which has taken place since the decision of the <em>Tyler </em>case in 1917. See Paul, Federal Estate and Grift Taxation, \u00a7 10.02 et seq. See also H. R. Rep. No. 767, 65th Cong. 2d Sess. p. 32 (C. V. 1939-1, part. 2, pp. 101-102); <em>Lewellyn </em>v. <em>Frick, </em>268 U. S. 238, 250-252; <em>Chase Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>278 U.
