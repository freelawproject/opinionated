On appeal, he argues that his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated when the trial court permitted witness testimony via satellite transmission. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">Harrell was charged with robbery and burglary. The victims, Pedro Mielniczuk and Perla Scandrojlio, a married couple from Argentina, were robbed near the Miami Airport while attempting to return their rental car. The couple was lost and asked a man for directions. After being handed a map, the man reached into the car and grabbed the couple\u2019s belongings. Before returning to Argentina, Scandrojlio identified Harrell in a photographic lineup. Harrell, whose fingerprints also matched the prints lifted from the map, was subsequently arrested and tried for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">Prior to trial, the State requested to introduce the two victims\u2019 testimony via satellite transmission. The State argued that the victims were unavailable to testify at trial, because Scandrojlio was in poor health and because both victims resided in Argentina and were unwilling to return to Florida. The trial judge agreed to allow the testimony via satellite, over Harrell\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">At trial, there were two cameras in the courtroom in Miami; one camera filmed the jury and the other camera filmed the attorneys and the defendant. There was also a screen in the courtroom that allowed those in the courtroom to see each witness in Argentina. In Argentina, there was a camera that filmed the witness and a screen that allowed the witness to see the courtroom in Miami. Thus, the witness could see the defendant and the jury, and the defendant, who was in the courtroom with the judge and jury, could see the witness. The oath was administered to each witness by a deputy clerk in Miami, in the presence of the jury, the judge, and the defendant. The witnesses did not speak English, so an interpreter was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">During the trial there were some minor technical difficulties. The visual transmission of the witnesses\u2019 testimony was not simultaneous with the audio, so there was an approximately one-second delay between what was said and what was seen. There were also two instances in which the end of a question was cut off and one momentary loss of the visual transmission in Argentina. Also, while testifying, Scan-drojlio looked to the right of the camera at an individual who could not be seen on the screen. In order to remedy this problem, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the trial court had the camera focus on both the witness and the individual, who was the manager of the broadcast studio in Argentina from which the witnesses\u2019 testimony was transmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">Harrell was subsequently found guilty and appealed his conviction to the Third District Court of Appeal, which upheld the conviction. <em>See Harrell v. State, </em>689 So.2d 400 (Fla. 3d DCA 1997). The court held that there was no Confrontation Clause violation, because the two-way transmission provided face-to-face confrontation. <em>See id. </em>at 404. The court also found \u201cthat the jurors were able to determine the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses testifying, even during the brief period when the transmission was not perfectly synchronized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. The court also certified the following question to the Florida Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">Does the admission of trial testimony through the use of a live satellite transmission violate the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ... where a witness resides in a foreign country and is unable to appear in court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The Florida Supreme Court answered the certified question in the negative and approved the result reached by the Third District Court of Appeal. <em>See Harrell v. State, </em>709 So.2d 1364 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, 525 </em>U.S. 903, 119 S.Ct. 236, 142 L.Ed.2d 194 (1998). While the Court concluded that the satellite procedure was not the equivalent of face-to-face confrontation, it held that the procedure qualified as an exception to the Confrontation Clause. <em>See id. </em>at 1368-70. The Court began by recognizing public policy reasons justifying an exception to face-to-face confrontation. First, the witnesses lived beyond the subpoena power of the court and thus there was no way to compel them to appear in court. The Court found this to be an important consideration, because it was \u201cclearly in [the] state\u2019s interest to expeditiously and justly resolve criminal matters that are pending in the state court system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370. Second, there was evidence that one of the witnesses was in poor health and could not travel to this country. Finally, the testimony of these two witnesses was \u201cabsolutely essential to this case.\u201d The Court concluded that \u201c[t]hese three concerns, taken together, amount to the type of public policy considerations that justify an exception to the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370. Next, the Court concluded that the satellite procedure \u201csatisfied the additional safeguards of the Confrontation Clause \u2014 oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness\u2019s demeanor\u201d \u2014 because the witnesses were placed under oath by a court clerk in Miami; the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses; the jury was able to observe the witnesses as they testified; and the witnesses could see the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 1371. The United States Supreme Court denied Harrell\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision. <em>See Harrell v. Florida, 525 </em>U.S. 903, 119 S.Ct. 236, 142 L.Ed.2d 194 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">In 1999, Harrell filed a federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court\u2019s admission of testimony via satellite transmission violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. On April 4, 2000, a U.S. magistrate judge recommended that the petition be denied. The district comb agreed with this recommendation and denied the petition. Harrell then requested a certificate of appeala-bility, but the district court denied the request. This Court, however, issued a certificate of appealability, limited to review of the Confrontation Clause issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">On appeal, Harrell argues that, because there were technical difficulties with the satellite testimony, he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses fully, and the jury was unable to determine the witnesses\u2019 credibility and demeanor. The technical difficulties consisted of a one-second delay in the synchronization of the audio and visual transmissions, two instances in which the end of a question was cut off, and a momentary loss of picture in Argentina. Harrell argues that the technical difficulties during the testimony were not harmless error and that his conviction should be reversed as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 <em>de novo. See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Because Harrell filed his federal habeas petition after the April 24, 1996, effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), AEDPA\u2019s review provisions apply. <em>See McIntyre v. Williams, </em>216 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2000). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), \u201cwe can only reverse the district court if we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or involved an objectively unreasonable application of, the governing Federal law set forth by Supreme Court cases. If we cannot so conclude, we must affirm.\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>216 F.3d at 1257. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Thus, we turn to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision to determine if it is contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The Supreme Court has \u201cnever held, however, that the Confrontation Clause guarantees criminal defendants the <em>absolute </em>right to a face-to-face meeting with witnesses against them at trial.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 844, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (holding that one-way closed-circuit television testimony by a child witness in an abuse case may be consonant with the Confrontation Clause). Instead, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause reflects a <em>preference </em>for face-to-face confrontation at trial, a preference that must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849, 110 S.Ct. at 3165 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy and where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850, 110 S.Ct. at 3166. The requisite finding of necessity is a case-specific one. <em>See id. </em>at 855, 110 S.Ct. at 3169. \u201cThe combined effect of [the] elements of confrontation- \u2014 -physical presence, oath, cross-examination, and observation of demeanor by the trier of fact \u2014 serves the purposes of the Confrontation Clause by ensuring that evidence admitted against an accused is reliable....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846, 110 S.Ct. at 3163.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">We conclude that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. As an initial matter, we note that we are bound by the state court\u2019s factual determination that, despite technical difficulties during the testimony, the jurors were able to evaluate the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses. Factual find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>ings of state courts are presumed to be correct, and the petitioner can rebut this presumption only by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1130 n. 58 (11th Cir.2000). The Third District Court of Appeal found that \u201cthe jurors were able to determine the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses testifying, even during the brief period when the transmission was not perfectly synchronized.\u201d <em>Harrell, </em>689 So.2d at 405. Harrell has failed to rebut the presumption that this factual determination is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court law as set forth in <em>Craig. </em>The Florida Supreme Court concluded that public policy considerations justified an exception to face-to-face confrontation and, thus, that the first prong of the <em>Craig </em>analysis was satisfied. <em>See Harrell, </em>709 So.2d at 1369. In support of this conclusion, the Florida Supreme Court noted that: the witnesses lived beyond the subpoena power of the court and thus there was no way to compel them to appear; it is in the state\u2019s interest \u201cto expeditiously and justly resolve criminal matters that are pending in the state court system;\u201d one of the witnesses was in poor health and could not travel from Argentina to the United States; and the two witnesses were \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The Florida Supreme Court also concluded that the reliability prong of the <em>Craig </em>analysis was satisfied. <em>See Harrell, </em>709 So.2d at 1371. The Court noted that both witnesses were placed under oath by a court clerk in Miami; Harrell had an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses; the jury could observe the witnesses as they testified; and the witnesses could see the jury. <em>See id. Cf. United States v. Gigante, </em>166 F.3d 75, 80 (2d Cir.1999) (concluding that two-way closed-circuit television testimony \u201cpreserved all of [the] characteristics of in-court testimony\u201d where the witness \u201cwas sworn; he was subject to cross-examination; he testified in full view of the jury, court, and defense counsel; and [he] gave this testimony under the eye of [the defendant] himself\u2019).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Because the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision' \u2014 that the witnesses\u2019 testimony via two-way, closed-circuit satellite transmission did not violate his constitutional rights \u2014 was neither contrary to, nor an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>unreasonable application of, Federal law set forth by Supreme Court cases, we</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">AFFIRM.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\">. We decline to address Harrell's ineffective assistance argument, because there is no certificate of appealability with respect to that issue. <em>See McIntyre v. Williams, </em>216 F.3d 1254, 1256 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. In <em>Gigante, </em>the government sought to allow a witness to testify from a remote location due to his illness and infirmity. <em>See </em>166 F.3d at 79. The district court permitted him to testify via two-way, closed-circuit television. During his testimony, the witness was visible on video screens in the courtroom to the judge, the jury, defense counsel, and the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 80. The witness could see and hear the courtroom participants on a video screen at his remote location. On appeal, the defendant argued that this procedure denied him of his right to confront the witness in violation of the Sixth Amendment, but the Second Circuit disagreed and concluded that the defendant's confrontation rights had been adequately protected. <em>See id. </em>The Second Circuit concluded that, because the two-way system used for the witness\u2019s testimony \"preserved all of [the] characteristics of in-court testimony,\u201d the Court did not need \u201cto enforce the <em>Craig </em>standard in this case,\u201d because the <em>Craig </em>standard had been \"crafted ... to constrain the use of one-way closed-circuit television, whereby the witness could not possibly view the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"AdW\">We need not decide whether the two-way closed-circuit testimony of the witnesses in this case satisfies all of the characteristics of in-court testimony. However, we do note that the Second Circuit's approach in <em>Gigante </em>supports the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision that Harrell\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b982-13\">.
