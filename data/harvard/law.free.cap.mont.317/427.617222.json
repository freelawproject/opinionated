Cynthia subsequently filed a motion for an order to show cause against Lorney in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, asserting that Lorney should be held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the Dissolution Decree. The District Court found that Lorney failed to comply with the Dissolution Decree, but deferred determination of whether he was in contempt of court for sixty days. Lorney appeals.

Are Cynthia\u2019s claims barred by laches?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u00b64 2.

Is Cynthia entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b67 Lorney and Cynthia were married on June 16, 1972; they have two daughters, Courtney and Lacy. On September 6,1994, Lorney filed a petition for dissolution, seeking to dissolve his marriage to Cynthia.</p>\n<p id=\"Aor\">\u00b68 In early 1996, Cynthia was advised by her family dentist, Dr. Ken Madsen, that Courtney had a unique dental problem involving an impacted cuspid. As a result, Courtney was referred to Dr. Michael Stebbins. Dr. Stebbins recommended that Courtney undergo orthodontic treatment to address her dental problem. These facts were then made known to Lorney. At the request of Lorney, Cynthia agreed to obtain a second opinion regarding Courtney\u2019s need for orthodontic treatment. In May of 1996, Courtney was examined by Dr. Robert Windauer. Dr. Windauer concurred with the recommendations of Dr. Madsen and Dr. Stebbins regarding Courtney\u2019s dental problem. On May 8, 1996, Dr. Windauer arranged a payment schedule for Courtney\u2019s treatment. At Cynthia\u2019s request, Dr. Windauer also wrote a letter, explaining the treatment and the reasons for it. Both the payment plan and the letter were provided to Lorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b69 The District Court dissolved the marriage between Lorney and Cynthia on May 22, 1996. The Decree of Dissolution required that Lorney continue to provide health insurance coverage for his children, and that he pay ninety-two percent of any uncovered \u201cmedical and related expenses\u201d incurred by his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b610 The dental treatment referred to in Dr. Windauer\u2019s letter was subsequently performed by Dr. Windauer and Dr. James Ronald in August of 1996. The part of Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill not covered by Lomey\u2019s insurance amounted to $2,660.00. The uninsured part of Dr. Ronald\u2019s bill was $363.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b611 During Lorney and Cynthia\u2019s marriage, Courtney was prescribed contact lenses to correct a vision problem. In 1996, Courtney required replacement lenses, prompting Cynthia to take Courtney to Wal-mart Vision Center to purchase replacement lenses. The part of the bill from Wal-mart Vision Center not covered by Lorney\u2019s insurance was $239.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b612 Approximately six years later, on March 11, 2002, Cynthia filed a motion for an order to show cause, asserting that Lorney should be held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the Decree of Dissolution. Specifically, Cynthia alleged that Lorney failed to: (1) pay ninety-two percentage of Courtney\u2019s uncovered medical expenses; and (2) pay child support. On March 12, 2002, the District Court issued an order, requiring Lorney to show cause as to why he should not be held in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u00b613 Cynthia ultimately withdrew her claim for unpaid child support, leaving the remaining claim against Lorney for Courtney\u2019s uncovered medical expenses. The District Court conducted a hearing on Cynthia\u2019s motion on May 15, 2002. On September 4, 2002, the District Court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, ordering Lorney to reimburse Cynthia for: (1) ninety-two percent of Courtney\u2019s medical expenses; and (2) part of her attorney\u2019s fees and costs related to the contempt proceeding. The District Court further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">A determination relative to whether [Lorney] has acted in contempt of this Court shall be deferred for sixty (60) days. In the event [Lorney] pays the sums ordered above, said contempt shall be dismissed. In the event [Lorney] fails to make such payment, [Cynthia] shall file with the Court an Affidavit, and the Court shall enter appropriate findings, conclusions and Order respecting said contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Lorney appealed the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law on October 2, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Kovarik v. Kovarik, </em>1998 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 350, \u00b6 20, 954 P.2d 1147, \u00b6 20. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Kovarik, </em>\u00b6 20. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In re Marriage of Kovash </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 517, 521, 893 P.2d 860, 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b615 This Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees absent an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 18, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 18. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial judge acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Steinbeisser, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b616 Are Cynthia\u2019s claims barred by laches?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b617  Laches is an equitable concept that applies to situations where there has been a delay of such a duration as to render enforcement of the asserted right inequitable. <em>Filler v. Richland County </em>(1991), 247 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Mont. 285, 290, 806 P.2d 537, 540; <em>Gue v. Olds </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 117, 120, 799 P.2d 543, 545. However, laches is not simply a matter of elapsed time, it is also a question of the inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced. <em>Filler, </em>247 Mont. at 290, 806 P.2d at 540. That is, for laches to be applied, the court must find lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted and prejudice to the party asserting the defense. <em>Gue, </em>245 Mont. at 120, 799 P.2d at 545. As such, each case must be determined according to its own particular circumstances. <em>Gue, </em>245 Mont. at 120, 799 P.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b618  Lorney argues that laches should bar Cynthia\u2019s claim for reimbursement of Courtney\u2019s uncovered medical expenses because Cynthia waited six years to file her motion. As noted above, however, Lorney received a payment plan and a letter from Dr. Windauer in May of 1996. Lorney then submitted the plan to his insurance provider, and insurance coverage was denied. Lorney was aware that Courtney received the recommended orthodontic treatment. The Dissolution Decree specifically required Lorney to pay ninety-two percent of his children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses. Thus, during the span of six years, Lorney was aware that: (1) Courtney underwent orthodontic treatment; (2) the treatment resulted in a bill of $2,660.00 for Dr. Windauer\u2019s services; (3) Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill was not covered by his insurance; and (4) he was obligated to pay a portion of Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill. Despite his awareness of the above, Lorney has not paid his percentage of Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill. The District Court determined that Lorney was not prejudiced by Cynthia\u2019s delay and therefore the laches defense did not apply. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b619 As we noted above, for laches to be applied, the court must find lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted and prejudice to the party asserting the defense. <em>Gue, </em>245 Mont. at 120, 799 P.2d at 545. Although the six year hiatus between the delivery of the medical care and initiation of the contempt proceeding is unusual, Lorney simply suffered no prejudice. He was aware of the need for the treatment, received the bills in question in a timely fashion and submitted the bills to his insurance carrier. He later learned that his insurance claim was denied, and yet failed to comply with his obligations under the Decree. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that laches did not bar Cynthia\u2019s claim for ninety-two percent of Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b620 The same rationale applies regarding Courtney\u2019s vision expenses. Lorney was aware that Courtney wore contact lenses prior to the dissolution. In 1996, Courtney required replacement lenses, resulting in a bill of $239.60 from Wal-mart Vision Center. Lorney does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>contend that he was unaware that this bill was incurred, but nevertheless argues that he should not be responsible because of Cynthia\u2019s tardy reimbursement claim. The District Court determined that Lorney suffered no prejudice and we again agree. As such, laches does not bar Cynthia\u2019s claim for ninety-two percent of Wal-mart Vision Center\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b621  On the other hand, the District Court treated Dr. Ronald\u2019s bill differently and correctly so. Dr. Ronald assisted Dr. Windauer with Courtney\u2019s treatment, resulting in a bill of $363.65. During testimony at the contempt hearing, it was clearly established that Lorney paid the only bill he received from Dr. Ronald, and that, until Cynthia filed her motion on March 11,2002, he was unaware that an additional bill from Dr. Ronald existed. Therefore, the District Court concluded that Cynthia\u2019s claim for ninety-two percent of Dr. Ronald\u2019s bill was barred by laches. We agree. Lorney was not given a chance to pay his percentage of Dr. Ronald\u2019s bill, nor submit the bill to his insurance provider, because he was not aware that such a bill existed. He suffered prejudice as a result of Cynthia\u2019s decision to wait six years to advise him that an additional bill from Dr. Ronald existed. Accordingly, Cynthia\u2019s claim for ninety-two percent of Dr. Ronald\u2019s bill is barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in requiring Lorney to pay ninety-two percent of Courtney\u2019s uncovered medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b623 In addition to his laches argument, Lorney makes two related arguments as to why he should not be responsible for Courtney\u2019s medical bills. First, he contends that he is not obligated to pay ninety-two percent of Dr. Windauer\u2019s bill because he did not consent to Courtney\u2019s orthodontic treatment. Second, he alleges that orthodontics are cosmetic in nature, and not a \u201cmedical related expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b624 Lorney supports his position with our decision in <em>In re Marriage of Johnson, </em>1999 MT 254, 296 Mont. 311, 989 P.2d 356. In <em>Johnson, </em>the District Court entered a Decree dissolving the marriage between Corliss Johnson and Melvin Johnson. The Decree required that Melvin pay fifty-eight percent of his daughter Hayley\u2019s uncovered medical, dental, orthodontic, optical, hospital, and other medical related expenses. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Sometime thereafter, Hayley began to exhibit behavioral problems and Corliss enrolled her in the Anasazi Foundation, an outdoor wilderness treatment program for behavioral problems. Corliss asked Melvin to pay for fifty-eight percent of the program; however Melvin refused. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 7. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00b625 Corliss filed a motion, requesting that the District Court enforce the Dissolution Decree and require Melvin to pay for fifty-eight percent of the Anasazi program. The District Court found that the Anasazi program was not a \u201cmedical related expense,\u201d as contemplated in the Dissolution Decree, and denied Corliss\u2019 motion. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 8. On appeal, we affirmed the District Court, concluding that substantial evidence existed to support the District Court\u2019s finding that the Anasazi program did not qualify as a \u201cmedical related expense.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b626 Lorney asserts that, as in <em>Johnson, </em>Courtney\u2019s orthodontic treatment does not qualify as a \u201cmedical related expense,\u201d as contemplated in his Dissolution Decree. However, the two cases are distinguishable. In <em>Johnson, </em>the District Court based its finding that the Anasazi program was not a \u201cmedical related expense\u201d on the following three factors: (1) it had no evidence that Hayley was sent to the program on a doctor\u2019s referral; (2) a doctor\u2019s referral was not required to send a child to the program; and (3) the program was not covered by Champ\u00fas health insurance. In the instant case, while orthodontia was not covered by Lorney\u2019s insurance, three separate doctors recommended that Courtney undergo orthodontic treatment to address her dental problem. In fact, when questioned about the necessity of Courtney\u2019s orthodontic treatment, Dr. Windauer specifically testified that Courtney\u2019s treatment was <em>not </em>cosmetic. Thus, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, Courtney\u2019s orthodontic treatment was a \u201cmedical related expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b627 Lorney further maintains that he is not obligated to pay for Courtney\u2019s orthodontic treatment, because he did not consent to such treatment. However, Lorney and Cynthia\u2019s Supplemental Order for Custody and Visitation states that Cynthia, as the parent with actual custody of the children, is required to provide the children with \u201cappropriate medical examinations and treatments.\u201d Nothing in the Supplemental Order requires Cynthia to obtain Lomey\u2019s consent before providing such appropriate examinations and treatments. The District Court determined that, -under the circumstances of this case, the orthodontic treatment performed on Courtney was reasonable. We agree. Therefore, Lorney\u2019s consent was not a prerequisite to Courtney obtaining orthodontic treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b628 Lorney made similar arguments regarding Courtney\u2019s optical needs. The District Court properly disposed of these arguments as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b629 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Cynthia?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b630 The District Court conducted a hearing on Cynthia\u2019s motion for an order to show cause on May 15,2002. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">I\u2019m going to order [Lorney] to pay a portion of [Cynthia\u2019s] attorney fees. I don\u2019t know what the portion is yet. So leave a blank for the amount, and give me an affidavit... that lets me know how much [the fees] are, and I\u2019ll fill it in. I\u2019ll fill in the blank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Cynthia\u2019s attorney submitted an affidavit to the District Court, regarding his attorney\u2019s fees, on May 29,2002. Cynthia\u2019s attorney then served his affidavit on Lorne/s attorney on July 30,2002. The District Court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law, ordering Lorney to reimburse Cynthia for a portion of her attorney\u2019s fees and costs, on September 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b631 On appeal, Lorney maintains that the District Court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay a portion of Cynthia\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs. However, at the hearing on May 15,2002, Lorney made no objection to the District Court\u2019s statement that it intended to order him to pay a portion of Cynthia\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Nor did Lorney object to the affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees submitted by Cynthia\u2019s attorney. It is well stated that \u201cwe will not put a district court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which the appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>In re Pedersen </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 284, 287, 862 P.2d 411, 413. Therefore, in this case, we will not put the District Court in error for awarding Cynthia a portion of her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u00b632 Is Cynthia entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"AVs\">\u00b633 Cynthia asserts that, pursuant to Rule 32, M.R. App.P., she should be entitled to recover the attorney\u2019s fees and costs she incurred responding to this appeal. Rule 32, M.R.App.P., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">If the supreme court is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in a civil case that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof as under the circumstances are deemed proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">As a general rule, this Court will not impose sanctions under Rule 32, M.R.App.P., unless an appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay, or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of the judicial system. <em>Snow v. Snow, </em>2002 MT 143, \u00b6 31, 310 Mont. 260, \u00b6 31, 49 P.3d 610, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b634  In the instant case, there is no evidence that Lorne/s appeal was filed solely to cause delay or to otherwise abuse the judicial system. Moreover, we cannot conclude that homey\u2019s appeal was \u201ctaken without substantial or reasonable grounds,\u201d as contemplated by Rule 32, M.R.App.P. As such, we decline to impose sanctions under Rule 32, M.R.App.P. Accordingly, Cynthia is not entitled to recover her attorney's fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, hEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
