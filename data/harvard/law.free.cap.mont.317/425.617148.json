Cebull, United States District Judge for the District of Montana, Billings Division, filed with this Court a Certification Order pursuant to Rule 44, M.R.App.P. Stated briefly, the issue of law submitted by Judge Cebull for decision by this Court is whether \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, as amended, is unconstitutional under five separate provisions of the 1972 Montana Constitution. Ten relevant facts are included in the Certification Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-20\">\u00b62 On November 26,2002, this Court accepted the certified question, stated we would answer it in due course following briefing and oral argument, set a briefing schedule and invited briefs <em>amici curiae. </em>The briefs, including briefs <em>amici curiae, </em>were received and oral argument was set and ultimately heard on September 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-21\">\u00b63 We have determined that we improvidently accepted the certified question. Simply put, we do not have sufficient facts before us upon which we can render a precedential opinion on the substantial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>significant constitutional questions posed. To issue such an opinion would require, in essence, that we interpret these constitutional issues in a vacuum. We are unwilling to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b64 To fill at least part of this factual void, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel opined at oral argument that we had before us both Judge Cebull\u2019s \u201crelevant facts\u201d and those facts alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. In counsel\u2019s view, because this is a \u201cRule 12(b) motion,\u201d we can and must accept those facts as true'. We disagree. While Judge Cebull\u2019s Certification Order reflects that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is pending in the United States District Court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, no doubt providing at least a partial explanation for the paucity of facts presented to us for purposes of deciding the certified question, such a motion is not pending before this Court. Consequently, we are not free to look to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \u201cfacts\u201d alleged therein, but are bound by the \u201crelevant facts\u201d included in the Certification Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b65  We realize that Rule 44(i), M.R.App.P., appears to require this Court-once it has accepted a certified question-to \u201cstate in a written opinion the law answering the certified question[.]\u201d However, that subsection must be read together with Rule 44(f)(l)(ii), M.R.App.P., which requires that a certification order contain, among other things, \u201cthe facts relevant to the question, showing fully the nature of the controversy out of which the question arose[.]\u201d We conclude that the certification order in this cause number does not set forth sufficient facts to permit us to decide the important issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b66 This is an unfortunate result for all involved. The parties, <em>amici curiae </em>and this Court have spent considerable time on this matter in this Court and, inevitably, the case pending in the United States District Court has been substantially delayed. Unfortunately, it simply is not possible for this Court to know in advance whether the facts presented in a certification order ultimately will be sufficient for this Court to properly decide the question(s) presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b67 THEREFORE,</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b68 IT IS ORDERED that this matter is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b69 The Clerk is directed to mail true copies of this Order to all counsel of record and to the Honorable Richard F. Cebull.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">DATED this 25th day of September, 2003.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-11\">/S/ CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY</judges>\n<judges id=\"b452-12\">/S/ JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON, REGNIER and RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
