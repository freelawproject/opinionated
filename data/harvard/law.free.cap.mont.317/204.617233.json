We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Vukasin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of partner or family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of Vukasin\u2019s prior conduct after granting Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether Vukasin received ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">\u00b66 On January 3,2000, Vukasin went to a bar to drink and play pool with a friend. For about a month, Vukasin had been residing in an apartment with his girlfriend, Angela Zigan (Zigan), who was in the apartment when Vukasin returned during the evening to get some money. Zigan, who had known Vukasin for about eight years and had a child with him, discerned that Vukasin had been drinking. Vukasin then returned to the bar. Zigan later went to the bar, requested that Vukasin not come home because he had been drinking, and asked for Vukasin\u2019s key to the apartment. Vukasin refused to give her the key, and Zigan returned to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">\u00b67 At approximately 10 p.m., Zigan observed Vukasin drive up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>apartment building. Seeking to avoid a confrontation with Vukasin which she anticipated from his past behavior, Zigan took her dog and left the apartment, entering her neighbor\u2019s apartment across the hallway. Zigan testified during trial that, based on her experience, Vukasin\u2019s attitude changes when he drinks and he has become violent when drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b68 Vukasin first entered the apartment he shared with Zigan, and then came out and knocked on the neighbor\u2019s apartment door across the hall. Realizing it was Vukasin, Zigan locked herself in the bathroom of her neighbor\u2019s apartment. When the neighbor opened the door, Vukasin asked where Zigan was, and the neighbor informed him that she was in the bathroom. Vukasin then told the neighbor to unlock the bathroom door, but the neighbor said the door could not be unlocked. He then told the neighbor to tell Zigan to get back to their apartment or he was going to trash it. Vukasin then left the neighbor\u2019s apartment. Zigan listened to this conversation through the bathroom door and related at trial that Vukasin\u2019s \u201cwhole attitude caused me concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b69 Returning to Zigan\u2019s apartment, Vukasin began breaking things and yelling. Zigan testified that \u201cyou could hear the glass being broken. It was just loud. There was a lot of noise. He was screaming.\u201d She then heard Vukasin yell, \u201cget your ass over here you fucking whore. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Zigan stayed in the neighbor\u2019s apartment and called 911, reporting that Vukasin was \u201ctrashing\u201d her apartment. Zigan had three conversations with the dispatcher while police officers were responding to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b610 Upon arrival, the officers heard loud yelling and banging and, after entering the building, discovered the noise was coming from Zigan and Vukasin\u2019s apartment. The officers positioned themselves at the apartment door and readied pepper spray. Officer Badgley then loudly identified their presence as Officer Pinski knocked on the door.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">[Prosecutor] Q: Did you receive any response from inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6L\">[Pinski] A: A knife coming through the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">A: ... I knocked on the door. And the response, I heard a thud coming against the door. I hadn\u2019t looked over at the door, and I believe that the male individual inside was throwing something at the door -until I turned and looked at the door and saw ... four to five inches of a knife blade sticking out of the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Q: Okay. About how many times did it come through the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>A: I wasn\u2019t sure at the time. But we counted ten holes in the door after we had backed out of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">Q: And did they happen slowly or about what pace were they coming through?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">A: The knife was not getting stuck in the door. It was ... one after another. I don\u2019t know the speed or the rate or anything. But it wasn\u2019t like the knife got stuck and then he had to pull it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Q: Now, what was your reaction to the knife coming through?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">A: At that point I put my pepper spray away and took out my firearm. Officer Badgley did the same. And we retreated out of the hallway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b611 In her neighbor\u2019s apartment, Zigan overheard police attempting to communicate with Vukasin, and she opened the door of her neighbor\u2019s apartment. As she did so, she saw one of the officers jump back, and also observed the knife holes in her apartment\u2019s door. The officers instructed Zigan to go back into her neighbor\u2019s apartment. She and the neighbor exited the apartment through a back door, eventually meeting up with police outside the building. Concerned about officer safety, police elected not to immediately arrest Vukasin. Instead, they evacuated the apartment building and arrested Vukasin without incident the next morning, at which time they seized evidence from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b612 Vukasin was charged with two counts of felony assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA; one count of misdemeanor assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA; one count of disorderly conduct, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA; one count of criminal mischief, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA; one count of partner or family member assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA; and one count of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AJY\">\u00b613 Prior to trial, Vukasin pled guilty to the drug paraphernalia charge, and the State dismissed the count of misdemeanor assault. On the day of trial, Vukasin filed a motion in limine requesting that no comment or statement be made about any crime, wrong, or act pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., other than those related to the charges against Vukasin in this matter. The State did not object to the motion in limine, and the District Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\u00b614 At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, Vukasin moved for a directed verdict on the two counts of felony assault and the count of partner or family member assault, which was denied by the District Court. After deliberations, the jury found Vukasin guilty of two counts of felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>assault, one count of disorderly conduct, one count of criminal mischief, and one count of partner or family member assault. On April 25, 2001, the District Court sentenced Vukasin to ten years in prison for each of the felony assault convictions and imposed a term ranging from ten days to six months on the misdemeanor offenses, with the sentences to run concurrently. Vukasin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court properly exercise its discretion when it denied Vukasin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of partner or family member assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b616 This Court reviews a denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Landis, </em>2002 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 308 Mont. 354, \u00b6 23, 43 P.3d 298, \u00b6 23. The decision is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Landis, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b617  Vukasin challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for directed verdict on the charge of partner or family member assault. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Vukasin moved for a directed verdict, contending that no evidence had been presented establishing that Zigan had sustained reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. Section 46-16-403, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">When, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty, the court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the defendant, dismiss the action and discharge the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The State\u2019s charge of partner or family member assault did not allege that Vukasin had actually assaulted Zigan, but had caused her apprehension of injury in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(c), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">(1) A person commits the offense of partner or family member assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">(c) purposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a partner or family member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Thus, in order to meet its burden, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukasin purposely or knowingly caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>reasonable apprehension of bodily injury to Zigan, who was by definition a partner pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-206(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b618 Vukasin argues that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Vukasin purposely or knowingly caused Zigan reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. He notes that Zigan repeatedly testified that Vukasin did not hurt her, and that she had not even spoken directly with him during the incident. Vukasin also points out that Zigan did not testify that his statement, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d had caused Zigan reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. He further notes that, during her three calls to 911, Zigan neither stated that Vukasin had hit her nor specifically indicated that she was fearful.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b619  The standard for determining whether a person has \u201creasonably apprehended bodily injury is that of a reasonable person under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>1999 MT 99, \u00b6 27, 294 Mont. 270, \u00b6 27, 980 P.2d 629, \u00b6 27; <em>see also State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 150, 902 P.2d 14, 19 (\u201cWhen faced with the conduct complained of, would a reasonable person feel apprehension ...? A reasonable person standard is an objective one.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b620 Further, direct evidence is not necessary to establish the elements of a criminal offense. A criminal conviction may be based entirely on circumstantial evidence. <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 22, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 22, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 22. Section 26-1-102(1), MCA, defines circumstantial evidence as \u201cthat which tends to establish a fact by proving another and which, though true, does not of itself conclusively establish that fact but affords an inference or presumption of its existence.\u201d Thus, the direct proof of other facts may give rise to an inference that the victim sustained reasonable apprehension of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b621 The State presented evidence that Vukasin had been drinking that night and that his attitude and behavior changed when he did so. The evidence further established that Zigan asked Vukasin not to return to the apartment because of his drinking, but that Vukasin refused to honor that request and refused to turn over his apartment key to her. When Vukasin returned to their apartment, Zigan, concerned because of Vukasin\u2019s past behavior, removed herself and her dog from the apartment, and locked herself in the neighbor\u2019s bathroom when Vukasin came searching for her. Vukasin then went into a rage, threatening to \u201ctrash\u201d Zigan\u2019s apartment if Zigan did not \u201cget back\u201d to the apartment, destroying property, yelling loudly and threatening to kill Zigan. Zigan placed not one, but three, calls to 911, and continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to take refuge in her neighbor\u2019s apartment until police arrived, even though Vukasin was destroying her property. As officers attempted to communicate with Vukasin, she opened the door to her neighbor\u2019s apartment, only to see an officer jumping back. She observed knife holes in her apartment door and was instructed to go back into her neighbor\u2019s apartment by the officers. She and the neighbor retreated out the back door of the apartment and, on police instruction, left the premises for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b622  The State contends that from the direct proof of these facts, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime, including reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. We agree. Fleeing from her apartment with her dog over concern about Vukasin\u2019s past violent behavior, locking herself in a neighbor\u2019s bathroom, hearing Vukasin scream that he was going to kill her, observing knife holes Vukasin was making in her apartment door, and ultimately fleeing the building are facts from which, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Zigan has sustained reasonable apprehension of bodily injury caused by Vukasin. Thus, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Vukasin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of partner or family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of Vukasin\u2019s prior conduct after granting Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b624 Vukasin claims that the prosecution improperly introduced \u201cprior bad act\u201d evidence which prejudiced Vukasin and prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Prior to trial, Vukasin filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of prior crimes or prior \u201cbad act\u201d evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and to exclude all hearsay testimony. Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine requested, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">1. That there .shall be no reference, comment, allusion or statement made to any crime, wrong or act pursuant to M.R.Evid. Rule 404(b) other than those related to the charges against the Defendant at trial. This restriction shall include, but is not limited to reference to the Defendant\u2019s probationary status and any offenses to which the Defendant may choose to plead guilty to or are dismissed prior to trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">2. That no hearsay testimony regarding any of the offenses charged shall be allowed into evidence pursuant to M.R.Evid. Rule 802, except as otherwise provided by law[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The State did not object to the motion, and it was granted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b625 Vukasin claims the following exchange between Zigan and the prosecutor violated his motion in limine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">[Prosecutor] Q: What happened when he came back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">[Zigan] A: I was at my neighbor\u2019s house. I seen him pull up and I left my apartment and went to my neighbor\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">Q: How did you get to your neighbor\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">A: I walked across the hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">Q: Why did you go over there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">A: Because I wasn\u2019t going to be confronted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">Q: What was causing you that type of thought?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">A: Because he\u2019s been violent in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Likewise, Vukasin asserts the following question and answer between the prosecutor and Officer Pinski violated the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">Q: Okay. And she reported what essentially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-15\">A: She reported that Mr. Vukasin had come to her apartment that night and was intoxicated, had started to argue with her. She indicated to me that there was a history of abuse, that he\u2019d hit her before, and that she was afraid of what was going to happen tonight. So she had run from apartment number three into apartment number four.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">\u00b626 Vukasin argues that this testimony constitutes \u201cprior bad act\u201d evidence which is inadmissible under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and was admitted in violation of the \u00bfre-trial order. He asserts that the evidence was \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d to the charges against him, and allowed the jury to focus on his character instead of his conduct, thereby prejudicing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">\u00b627 At the time the testimony was offered, Vukasin offered no objection to its admission. The State notes this omission and argues that Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine was insufficient to preserve the issue on appeal. Relying on <em>State v. Weeks </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 63, 891 P.2d 477, the State, while conceding that a motion in limine may preserve a specification of error for appeal, argues that the mere act of filing a motion in limine does not negate the obligation to make the basis and grounds of the objection clear to the trial court in order to preserve the issue for appeal, and that Vukasin\u2019s motion was not specific enough to do so. In <em>Weeks, </em>we held that Week\u2019s motion in limine was insufficient to preserve his objection because he failed to specify \u201cany reasons or authority\u2019 regarding why the evidence should be excluded, but rather made \u201csweeping conclusory statements\u201dabout the prejudicial effect of the evidence. We noted that \u201cspecific objections must be made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>portions of testimony deemed inappropriate; broad general objections do not suffice.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 85, 891 P.2d at 490. The State argues that if the testimony of Zigan and Officer Pinski, quoted herein, was the testimony Vukasin intended to exclude by the motion in limine, then he had a duty to specify the expected testimony in the motion, and his failure to do so waived any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b628 Vukasin replies that his motion in limine is distinguishable from the insufficient motion in <em>Weeks. </em>He argues that, unlike the generic, conclusory motion in <em>Weeks, </em>his motion cited the \u201cwell-founded evidentiary rule\u201d of Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and that his motion preserved the issue for appeal in a manner consistent with this Court\u2019s holdings in a series of cases beginning with <em>State v. Brown </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 502, 680 P.2d 582, and followed by <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 227, 921 P.2d 866, <em>State v. Fuhrmann </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 396, 925 P.2d 1162, and <em>State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, 290 Mont. 18, 966 P.2d 103. A proper analysis of these cases reveals that Vukasin\u2019s argument is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b629  The first principle here is that \u201cwe will not put a trial court in error where that court has not been given the opportunity to rule on the admissibility of evidence and to correct itself.\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 230, 921 P.2d at 868, citing <em>State v. McCord </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 317, 325, 825 P.2d 194, 200; <em>see also Brown, </em>209 Mont. at 506, 680 P.2d at 584; <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 85, 891 P.2d at 490. Consistent therewith, we have repeatedly approved the use of a motion in limine to preserve an objection for appeal \u201cprovided the objecting party makes the basis for his objection clear to the district court.\u201d <em>Fuhrmann, </em>278 Mont. at 403, 925 P.2d at 1166; <em>see also Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 85, 891 P.2d at 490; <em>Ingraham, </em>\u00b6 36. In <em>Stuit, </em>we held that the motion in limine must be \u201csufficiently specific as to the basis for the objection.\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 230, 921 P.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b630 In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant filed a pre-trial motion objecting to the admission of evidence of his prior wrongful conduct. The district court did not directly rule on the motion, but ordered the state to provide notice ten days before trial if it intended to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s prior acts, which the state failed to do before introducing the evidence. On appeal, we found that defendant had been prejudiced by the state\u2019s violation of the order, because, had defendant received the required notice, \u201che would have had the opportunity, prior to trial, to evaluate and to move to exclude that portion of such evidence that should not have been admitted.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>209 Mont. at 507, 680 P.2d at 585. We found that, in light of the state\u2019s failure to notify him, Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>had done what he could to raise the issue in the district court, and concluded the issue had been preserved for appeal. Thus, the issue was preserved by virtue of the state\u2019s violation of the trial court\u2019s order, which had deprived the defendant of an appropriate opportunity to make a proper objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Stuit, </em>the defendant filed a motion in limine \u201crequesting that at trial the State be precluded from eliciting testimony from the officer which was anticipated to identify Stuit as the shooter based upon statements made to the officer by others.\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 229, 921 P.2d at 868. Upon assurance by the state that the third party declarant would testify first, the district court refused to grant the motion. On appeal, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that Stuit had waived the issue by failing to object at trial, concluding that Stmt\u2019s motion in limine was sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 230, 921 P.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b632 In <em>Fuhrmann, </em>the defendant sought to exclude comments made by the alleged victim \u201cto the effect that Fuhrmann\u2019s actions were on purpose or not an accident.\u201d <em>Fuhrmann, </em>278 Mont. at 401, 925 P.2d at 1165. The district court denied Fuhrmann\u2019s motion, and further, \u201crelieved him of any obligation to object again at trial\u201d to the state\u2019s introduction of the challenged evidence. <em>Fuhrmann, </em>278 Mont. at 403, 925 P.2d at 1167. We concluded that Fuhrmann\u2019s pre-trial request to exclude specific comments made by a specific witness had properly preserved his objection for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b633 Lastly, in <em>Ingraham, </em>the defendant, prior to trial, \u201cspecifically moved to exclude testimony regarding the presence of lithium, librium, and other chemicals detected in his blood, as well as bottles of prescription medication found in his car.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>\u00b6 29. The state argued in the district court that the \u201ccritical fact\u201d was whether Ingraham had drugs in his system at the time of the accident, and that it was entitled to establish Ingraham\u2019s use of various drugs. The district court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine, and Ingraham did not object to an officer\u2019s trial testimony that he had retrieved two bottles of prescription medication from the car. On appeal, we concluded that Ingraham\u2019s objection had been preserved by his pretrial motion, noting that the motion had also requested that the state be precluded from \u201cmentioning that medications were found in the defendant\u2019s car.\u201d <em>Ingraham, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b634 In each of these cases, the pre-trial motion in limine was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, in each case, the district court was directly faced with the question and ruled against the defendant, thereby preserving for appeal any evidentiary issue that was specifically addressed in the motion. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b635 The District Court granted Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine. However, unlike the objections made in <em>Stuit, Fuhrmann </em>and <em>Ingraham, </em>Vukasin\u2019s motion did not identify either the specific witness or the specific testimony to which he now objects on appeal. Instead, Vukasin generally objected to any \u201creference, comment, allusion or statement made to any crime, wrong or act pursuant to M.R.Evid. Rule 404(b).\u201d Thus, even though the District Court granted the motion, it was not alerted by the motion that Vukasin was objecting to testimony about his past violent behavior which had prompted Zigan to flee from her apartment. Neither was the motion\u2019s objection to the admission of any \u201chearsay testimony... pursuant to M.R.Evid. Rule 802,\u201d which Vukasin mentions only fleetingly in his appellate briefing, specific enough to alert the trial judge to the testimony he was challenging. The only specific objection raised within Vukasin\u2019s motion was to any \u201creference to the Defendant\u2019s probationary status and any offenses to which Defendant may choose to plead guilty to or are dismissed prior to trial,\u201d but such evidence was not introduced at trial, and is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b636 Further, Vukasin\u2019s motion went so far as to infer that he had no objection to the evidence he now challenges on appeal. His motion requested that evidence of his other crimes or acts be excluded \u201cother than those related to the charges against the Defendant at trial.\u201d It could very well have been surmised therefrom that evidence of Zigan\u2019s motivation to flee the apartment was indeed \u201crelated to the charges against the Defendant at trial,\u201d and therefore outside the scope of Vukasin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b637  Aside from this inference, however, it is clear that Vukasin\u2019s generalized motion in limine and his failure to object to the testimony during trial failed to provide the District Court with \u201cthe opportunity to rule on the admissibility of evidence and to correct itself.\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 230, 921 P.2d at 868. The District Court was simply not directed to this specific issue. Far from being able to correct itself, the trial court may not have even known that the issue existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b638 \u201c[SJpecific objections must be made to portions of testimony deemed inappropriate; broad general objections do not suffice.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 85, 891 P.2d at 490. Vukasin\u2019s motion in limine was a generalized objection which did not preserve the evidentiary issue on appeal. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b639 Did Vukasin receive ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b640 Vukasin claims his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during voir dire by failing to ask follow-up questions of Panelist Figgins about a possible bias and by allowing Figgins to serve on the jury. The State argues that Vukasin\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not record based, and therefore, we cannot reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b641 Vukasin contends that the record adequately supports his claim for ineffective assistance, and that his counsel\u2019s errors are similar to those which occurred in <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 947 P.2d 57. In <em>Chastain, </em>we considered defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge for cause or to exercise a peremptory challenge to a juror who had indicated strong feelings unfavorable to Chastain. Reviewing the record on Chastain\u2019s appeal from his conviction, this Court concluded, \u201cwhere as here, defense counsel abandons his client\u2019s right to challenge a juror for no apparent reason, error must be attributed to the lawyer.\u201d <em>Chastain, </em>285 Mont. at 65, 947 P.2d at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b642 In two recent cases, <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738, and <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, 316 Mont. 275, 70 P.3d 1234, we discussed our holding in <em>Chastain, </em>and determined that \u201cin <em>Chastain, </em>it was a mistake for the Court, based on the lack of a reason \u2018apparent\u2019 on the record, to determine that counsel was ineffective in voir dire examination.\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 16. Both cases involved a defense counsel\u2019s failure during voir dire to ask follow-up questions to panelists who had expressed reservations about being impartial, or to challenge them for cause. In considering defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge a panelist for cause, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFg\">[I]t is a mistake to assume that we can determine from a cold record whether there was a tactical reason for not exercising a challenge. The reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or inactions should not be \u201cassumed\u201d but should be the subject of a postconviction evidentiary inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">For the above-stated reasons, we overrule <em>Chastain\u2019s </em>holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to challenge prospective jurors in voir dire can be determined from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>a record which is silent as to the lawyer\u2019s reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30,33. We further concluded that none of the appellant\u2019s claims regarding his counsel\u2019s actions during voir dire could be addressed without considering matters outside the record, and were therefore inappropriate for direct appeal, quoting <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, 304 Mont. 47, 15 P.3d 970 (overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cWhen the record does not provide the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel, a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel more appropriately makes his claim in a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d <em>St. John, </em>\u00b6 40 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b643  The failure of counsel to ask follow-up questions of Figgins about a possible bias and allowing Figgins to serve on the jury are similar to the voir dire errors claimed in both <em>Herrman </em>and <em>Turnsplenty. </em>Likewise, the inadequacy of the record here requires us to reach the same conclusion as we did in those cases. We cannot address Vukasin\u2019s claim because the record does not reveal whether counsel\u2019s inaction was a reasonable tactical decision or a mistake. Because the record is void of any evidence as to <em>why </em>defense counsel did not take such actions, Vukasin has improperly raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b644  We hold Vukasin\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are not record based, and therefore, we dismiss Vukasin\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to his pursuit of the claim in postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b645 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> In <em>Brown, </em>the district court did not grant defendant\u2019s motion on limine, electing instead to impose a notice requirement upon the state for purposes of raising the evidentiary issue again before trial, which the state violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
