We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b62 The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court erred when it directed the clerk of court to file a Certificate of Survey of the Johnsons\u2019 land in compliance with a previous judgment and order of the same court, requiring that the survey not exceed one acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b64 In 1959, A.W. Johnson and George Hamilton orally agreed to exchange two tracts of land. Johnson exchanged his East Tract for Hamilton\u2019s West Tract, and paid Hamilton an additional $1,600. Although no formal survey was conducted, the parties walked and partially staked the perimeters of the two tracts, and each parcel was found to be approximately one acre in size. The West Tract is the subject of the present controversy. The property lies east of Spring Creek and west of Highway 466 in Fergus County, and makes up the northeast comer of a strip of land running parallel with Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b65 The oral exchange was first litigated in 1999 when Hamilton tried to purchase the West Tract back from A.W. Johnson\u2019s son and daughter-in-law, Robert and Anita. At the conclusion of this litigation, the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, ordered specific performance of the oral contract and the vesting of full title to the West Tract in the Johnsons. In addition, Hamilton and the Johnsons were ordered to obtain surveys of their respective parcels and to provide each other with insurable deeds, thereby formalizing the 1959 agreement. In its February 28, 2000 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Law, and Judgment, the District Court determined that a survey of the Johnsons\u2019 West Tract could not exceed one acre. Specifically, the court stated that \u201c[pjlaintiffs, Robert L. Johnson and Anita A. Johnson, shall be responsible for obtaining a recordable survey of the West Tract (not to exceed one acre) within 12 months of this Court\u2019s Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b66 Neither party appealed the ruling. Instead, the Johnsons filed a post-trial motion to amend findings and requested that the \u201cnot to exceed one acre\u201d language be removed from the judgment. The District Court denied this motion, stating again that \u201cthe West Tract should not exceed one acre but may be approximate in size and could be less than one full acre.\u201d The court added that the original agreement between Hamilton and A.W. Johnson contemplated an exchange of parcels approximately one acre in size. The court also stated that, in characterizing the West Tract, its principle concern was to ensure that the two access roads which provided ingress and egress onto the neighboring Knerr Tract and Mill Tract would remain on the property that was transferred to the Johnsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b67 One year later, the Johnsons moved to file the mandatory survey of the West Tract as directed by the District Court. However, their survey exceeded one acre and, upon objection by Hamilton, the District Court ordered Milestone Surveying, Inc., to prepare a new survey that complied with its February 28, 2000 Judgment. In a June 22, 2001 Order, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">A new survey shall be completed by Milestone Surveying, Inc. utilizing the markers previously set by Milestone Surveying, Inc. as the southern and northeasterly boundary, including an area west of the said southern and northeasterly boundaries encompassing the two private access easement[s], <em>not to exceed one acre, </em>the boundary to be so set by Milestone Surveying, Inc. <em>may or may not follow the meander of the ancient stream. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b68 Despite this order, the Johnsons subsequently filed a motion requesting that the District Court file a grant deed to the West Tract identifying the property as more than one acre. Hamilton objected to the motion, and a hearing was scheduled to address the matter. In the interim, the Johnsons filed a Writ of Supervisory Control with the Montana Supreme Court, requesting that the scheduled hearing be vacated. We denied the petition on grounds that the Johnsons had failed to meet, or even address, the criteria under which this Court exercises supervisory control. On February 4,2002, the District Court similarly denied the Johnsons\u2019 request for a grant deed to the West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Tract. Furthermore, in accordance with its previous Order of June 22, 2001, the court filed a new survey prepared by Milestone Surveying, Inc. The Johnsons then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b69 The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling is for abuse of discretion. <em>Mont. Rail Link v. Byard </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 331, 337, 860 P.2d 121, 125. This standard may be applied to rulings on post-trial motions, which i\u00a3encompa[ss] the power of choice among several courses of action, each of which is considered permissible.\u201d <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b610 On appeal, the Johnsons argue that the District Court\u2019s orders of June 22, 2001 and February 4, 2002 effectively altered the original agreement and exchange between A. W. Johnson and George Hamilton. The Johnsons contend that the orders modify the boundaries of the West Tract as it existed at the time of the 1959 agreement by impermissibly \u00a3\u00a3lopp[ing] off the creek frontage\u201d which, according to the Johnsons, was intended to serve as the South and westerly border of the property. The Johnsons maintain that the District Court exceeded its jurisdiction when it made this alteration without the benefit of pleadings or evidence and in the absence of any request by the parties to do so. Ultimately, the Johnsons request that this Court strike the District Court\u2019s February 4, 2002 Order and enforce the one-acre limitation of the February 28, 2000 Judgment by including creek frontage along one side of the West Tract while trimming any excess acreage from the other side of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b611 Contrary to the Johnsons\u2019 position, our review of the record establishes that they are barred by res judicata from litigating this issue. We addressed a similar appeal in <em>Tungsten Holdings, Inc. v. Kimberlin, </em>2000 MT 24, \u00b6 36, 298 Mont. 176, \u00b6 36, 994 P.2d 1114, \u00b6 36. That case involved a challenge to a judgment upon remittitur, in which the trial court granted an access easement over a road that traversed the appellants\u2019 property. <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. The judgment upon remittitur was entered following an appeal and an instruction from this Court to quiet title to the easement in favor of the respondent, Tungsten. <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. The appellants challenged this second trial court ruling on grounds that a portion of the road crossed over onto Forest Service land and that the easement did not exist wholly on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>their property. <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6 35. In response, we determined that the appellants were barred by res judicata from challenging the location of the easement because they had failed to raise the issue during the first appeal. <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b612 In reaching this conclusion, we cited <em>Wellman v. Wellman </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 42, 45-46, 643 P.2d 573, 575, for the proposition that \u2018\u201c[o]nce there has been full opportunity to present an issue for judicial decision in a given proceeding ... the determination of the court in that proceeding must be accorded finality as to all issues raised or which fairly could have been raised, else judgments might be attacked piecemeal and without end.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>Wellman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b613 Here, the February 28, 2000 District Court decision was a final judgment and was treated as such by the Johnsons when they filed their Notice of Entry of Judgment the following April. The decision established that the West Tract consisted of an area of land containing two access roads, one of which served as the western boundary of the property. The judgment indicated <em>only </em>that the West Tract must include these easements, and that the land may not exceed a full acre. The primary reason for identifying the acreage within the West Tract was to make certain that the two easements, both of which Johnson had granted to a third party, would be contained in the parcel. The District Court <em>did not </em>state that the property must include frontage along Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b614 The District Court order from which the Johnsons now appeal merely enforced its February 28, 2000 Judgment. The District Court rejected the original survey submitted by the Johnsons because it included 1.455 acres, nearly half an acre more than what the court\u2019s instructions allowed. The court ordered a new survey to be prepared in compliance with the original judgment. That survey was then prepared and filed pursuant to the Order of February 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b615  Although the Johnsons now characterize their appeal as a challenge to the District Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in issuing this order, the substance of their argument concerns, principally, the size of the West Tract. However, as in <em>Tungsten, </em>the record here demonstrates that the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the boundaries of their property. The result was a final judgment which was never appealed by the parties nor altered by the District Court through subsequent orders. The present appeal is an attempt by the Johnsons to undo that judgment. Accordingly, we hold that the appeal is barred by res judicata, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s February 4,2002 Order directing the clerk of court to file a Certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of Survey of the Johnsons\u2019 land in compliance with the court\u2019s February 28, 2000 Judgment, including the requirement that the survey not exceed one acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b616 Asa final matter, we consider Hamilton\u2019s claim that the Johnsons\u2019 appeal is without substantial or reasonable grounds, and that he is entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant the rules of appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b617 Rule 32, M.R.App.P., provides that \u201c[i]f the supreme court is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in a civil case that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof as under the circumstances are deemed proper.\u201d Typically, this Court will not impose Rule 32 sanctions \u201cunless the appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system.\u201d <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>2000 MT 67, \u00b6 66, 299 Mont. 78, \u00b6 66, 996 P.2d 389, \u00b6 66. We have also stated that Rule 32 sanctions may be appropriate \u201cwhere a party demonstrates a \u2018significant disdain for the integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 66 (citations omitted). For example, we have awarded fees and costs when parties proceeded with their appeals after conceding that dismissal was appropriate and when parties presented conflicting and inconsistent appellate arguments. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 66 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b618  Hamilton argues that Rule 32 sanctions are appropriate because the Johnsons\u2019 appeal is barred by res judicata. Hamilton offers no case law to support this assertion and fails to establish that the Johnsons\u2019 appeal is entirely unfounded, intended to cause delay, or that the Johnsons\u2019 conduct constitutes an abuse of the judicial system. The fact that an appeal is barred by res judicata does not mean that an award of attorney fees is presumptively appropriate. Accordingly, we hold that this is not a proper case in which to impose Rule 32 sanctions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
