The District Court held Tammy was owed only $1,000, concluding that she failed to prove that Larry promised to repay the rest of the funds. Tammy appeals. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u00b62 Tammy presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">1. Did the District Court violate Rule 408, M.R.Evid., when it admitted Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A, a letter Tammy wrote to Larry seeking to settle their financial differences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">2. Did the District Court err in denying recovery to Tammy because she failed to show there was an agreement to repay the $15,000 on a specific date or in a specific manner?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">\u00b63 Because our decision turns on the evidentiary question, we limit our recounting of the facts to those relevant to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">\u00b64 Tammy had been acquainted with Larry since 1990 when he did carpentry work on the building she owned in Whitefish with her husband. After her husband\u2019s death in March 1999, Tammy began a personal relationship with Larry. Over the course of the brief relationship, money changed hands frequently. At times Larry helped Tammy with bills, and more often, Tammy transferred relatively large sums to Larry, including a check for $1,200, and another for $15,000. Tammy contends that the bulk of the money she gave to Larry was understood to be a loan. Larry, on the other hand, claims that these monies were provided as payment for services he provided to Tammy.</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">\u00b65 Tammy asserts that the $1,200 check she wrote to Larry on August 25,1999 was a down payment for her purchase of Larry\u2019s RV, where she lived with her son for a few months. The check was marked \u201cRV-down payment\u201d in the memo line and Larry did transfer the RV title to Tammy. Tammy subsequently transferred the title back to Larry, allegedly under duress, and thus she is seeking repayment of the $1,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u00b66 Larry denied that this money was a down-payment for the RV. He testified that the $1,200 was \"... as part of her rent thing.\u201d Larry claimed Tammy had agreed to pay him rent of $500 per month for two months, as well as $200 to store some of her personal belongings in one of the empty houses he was building. Larry further testified that Tammy was willing to pay such rent, despite the fact that the RV was not hooked up to electricity, heat, sewage or water.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b67 In December 1999, Tammy sold her property in Whitefish and netted $47,000. She testified that Larry pressured her to give him the sale proceeds, offering-in return-to transfer to her title to a 5-acre parcel of land he owned. Because Larry provided no paperwork to protect her, Tammy declined to give Larry the sum of her sale proceeds. Rather, she testified, she agreed to loan him $15,000. She wrote him a $15,000 check on December 16, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b68 Larry claims that the $15,000 check was money Tammy owed him, not a loan. Regarding Tammy\u2019s debts to him, Larry testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">She gave me $15,000 for the money that I had loaned her, the things that I had done, the rent for staying out there in the trailer, all kinds of stuff. She gave me $15,000 at the completion of the sale of her building for the money I loaned her and rents and storage and what have you; you know, money I had loaned her and stuff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">On direct examination, Larry testified that he had kept a ledger for the amounts Tammy purportedly owed him. On cross-examination, he admitted there was no ledger, but\"... it was kind of just in the head.\u201d He testified, for example, that Tammy\u2019s late husband owed him $3,500 for carpentry work done years before. Tammy had never heard about this debt and did not believe it was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b69 In an effort to settle their dispute and recoup some portion of the money she had given to Larry, Tammy wrote a letter to Larry on April 30, 2000, seeking to compromise. The letter lists the amounts Tammy had paid to Larry and shows deductions for the amounts Larry claimed Tammy owed him. The letter seeks repayment of the balance, nearly $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b610 The letter reads, in part: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">Dear Larry,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">You said you would be fair with me. I pray you will. I am tired of playing this game and it is over for me. We have had no relationship for sometime and I fear friendship is no longer a possibility -for we don\u2019t seem to possess the qualities of a true friendship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">Attached is an accounting of the dollars I have paid. I need to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the access. I really thought we had a lifetime commitment but now realize we don\u2019t. I signed over the RV because I trusted you. I always felt that it was half mine as you told me. I was afraid not to sign it over. I feared what you might do if I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to because it was my security for the excess funds I provided. I hate it has come to this, but I must protect my interest and not just write it off. I can\u2019t afford too [sic]. Please be fair to me, for I have been more than fair in my part and actually left out a lot of checks. The trips we took, I pretty much paid for. You said they were for me, but I think you enjoyed them as well. The mileage you put on my car and your taking it was not a good thing. No one that cared for anyone would do that, but I\u2019ll let that go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">Tammy owed Larry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">Jack\u2019s debt I was unaware of: $ 3,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Your time and trouble 5,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">Rent@500/month Aug, Sept, Nov 1,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Storage from 12/15-1/15 200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">Loans 1,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">1.000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">Total $13,100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">Paybacks from Tammy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">Paid to you after I closed 12/18/99 $15,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">Down payment of rv ck#3731 8/25/99 1,200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">Deposit to your personal acct: ck#4061 12/9/99 300</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">ck#406512-12-99 600</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-18\">Larry\u2019s Glasses 150</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-19\">Total $21,033</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-20\">Less amount to Larry 13,100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-21\">Money owed to Tammy $ 7.933</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-22\">This amount is fair and in your favor.

God knows I wish you all the best... Tammy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ann\">\u00b611 This letter is at the center of the evidentiary dispute before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>When defense counsel offered the letter into evidence, Tammy\u2019s counsel objected and sought voir dire on the document. During voir dire, Tammy testified that the letter was written as a compromise offer in an attempt to settle the debt claim. Accordingly, Tammy\u2019s counsel objected on the grounds that the letter was inadmissible under Rule 408 of the Montana Rules of Evidence, which bars admission of evidence of or offers to compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b612 Larry\u2019s counsel responded by asserting that the letter was not an offer of settlement, but an accounting. Further, he argued, the accounting was made prior to any claim being filed against Larry, stating: \u201cRule 408 needs to be read together with Rule 8, which identifies what a claim is. And a claim, under Rule 8, is after an action has been filed. This [letter] predates the action by a year, predates the document which she is suing him on.\u201d Finally, counsel asserted that the letter was not being offered to show the amounts therein, but to impeach Tammy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b613 It is unclear which of the above arguments the district court found persuasive, but the letter was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b614 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is abuse of discretion. <em>Finstad v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>2000 MT 228, \u00b6 43, 301 Mont. 240, \u00b6 43, 8 P.3d 778, \u00b6 43 (citing <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 353, 916 P.2d 122, 128). \u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Co-Op., Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 970 P.2d 84, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b615 Did the District Court violate Rule 408, M.R.Evid., when it admitted Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A, a letter Tammy wrote to Larry seeking to settle their financial differences?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b616 To answer this question, we must address and resolve three preliminary inquiries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">(1) Was Tammy\u2019s letter an offer to compromise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">(2) To fall under Rule 408, must the letter have been written after a legal claim was filed in court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">(3) If the letter would otherwise be inadmissible under Rule 408, does it fall within one of the exceptions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">\u00b617 Rule 408, M.R.Evid., reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Evidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b618  First, based on our review of the record and the text of Tammy\u2019s letter to Larry, we conclude that the letter constitutes an offer of compromise. Several aspects of the letter support this conclusion. Tammy begins by asserting, \u201cYou said you would be fair with me. I pray you will.\u201d She writes, \u201cPlease be fair to me, for I have been more than fair in my part and actually left out a lot of checks.\u201d Tammy concludes the letter with \u201cThis amount is fair and in your favor.\u201d All of these statements indicate that she was presenting Larry with what she thought was a reasonable and fair settlement of the disputed debts between them. It only stands to reason that if Tammy had been seeking to present a full accounting of the money that changed hands, rather than a settlement offer, she would not have left out any checks. Her statement that the accounting \u201cis in your favor,\u201d makes it clear that Tammy was not presenting her own cut and dried figures, but was in fact trying to give Larry the benefit of the doubt on every claim he made and attempting to show that even granting Larry all those claims, he still owed her nearly $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b619 Further evidence that Tammy was trying to give Larry the benefit of the doubt for the purpose of settling the dispute can be found in the first entry under the list of monies \u201cTammy owed Larry.\u201d The first line item is: \u201cJack\u2019s debt I was unaware of: $3,500.\u201d For the sake of compromise, Tammy credited Larry for this $3,500 debt, despite that she had never before known about it and did not, in fact, believe it was valid. (Tammy later introduced arguably compelling evidence to suggest that Larry fabricated this debt.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b620 We next turn to the question of whether an offer of compromise must occur after a formal claim has been filed in order to be excluded under Rule 408, M.R.Evid. Faced with a similar question in <em>Niles v. Big Sky Eyewear </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 455, 771 P.2d 114, overruled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>other grounds by <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, we noted that Rule 408 \u201cdoes not clarify whether litigation must be in progress before [the Rule] takes effect.\u201d <em>Niles, </em>236 Mont. at 463, 771 P.2d at 118. In that case, we said, with respect to the timing of the compromise offer, \u201cboth parties had hired attorneys and a draft of the complaint had been sent to defendants\u2019 attorney. It was certainly clear at the time that Niles had a claim against the defendants.\u201d <em>Niles, </em>236 Mont. at 463, 771 P.2d at 119. Therefore, we concluded that the offer of compromise was within the purview of Rule 408, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b621  In this case, fewer than three months passed between the time Tammy wrote the letter of compromise and the time she filed the lawsuit. Tammy wrote the letter in question on April 30,2000. On July 24, 2000, after Larry failed to respond, Tammy filed her complaint. While it is clear that Rule 408 should not reach into the remote past, shielding admission of documents prepared long prior to litigation, Tammy\u2019s offer of compromise-like the one in Niles-was issued near enough to the commencement of her lawsuit to suggest that it was the predicate to her last resort-litigation. Accordingly, under the facts presented here, we conclude that the letter falls within the purview of Rule 408, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b622 Finally, we must consider whether this letter meets one of the exceptions to Rule 408, M.R.Evid. Rule 408 \u201cdoes not require exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations.\u201d Larry\u2019s counsel asserted, among other things, that he sought admission of Tammy\u2019s April 30th letter not to show the amounts listed in the letter, but to impeach Tammy. If this claim could withstand scrutiny, the letter could possibly be admissible as \u201cevidence otherwise discoverable\u201d that was presented in the course of compromise negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b623 Our review of the trial transcript, however, reveals that the defendant introduced Tammy\u2019s letter to support his argument that Tammy sought to compromise an obligation and not a loan. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Tammy focused on proving that the money she provided to Larry was not a loan. The following exchange is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">Q (defense counsel O\u2019Neill):... Now I\u2019d like you to look down below</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">to the paragraph that begins \u201cTammy owed Larry ... \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">A: (Tammy): Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">Q: Did you write that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">Q: And then I\u2019d like you to look at the next paragraph saying</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201cPaybacks from Tammy.\u201d Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">Q: And then you wrote, \u201cPaid to you after I closed 12/18/99.\u201d Did you write that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">Q: You didn\u2019t write \u201cloaned to you,\u201d did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">A: What did you say? I\u2019m sorry. I was looking at something else. Q: You didn\u2019t write \u201cloaned to you,\u201d you said \u201cpaid to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">A: Yeah, whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">Q: So you\u2019re claiming you had a loan, but you\u2019re telling him that it\u2019s just money that you paid him back?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Defense counsel continued to press his assertion that Tammy\u2019s letter demonstrates the absence of a loan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">Q: And when you said, \u201cPaid to you after I closed,\u201d you really meant \u201cloaned to you\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">A: The $15,000, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">Q: Yeah, but there is no loan document, is there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">A: There is a copy of the cashier\u2019s check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-16\">Q: But the cashier\u2019s check doesn\u2019t say \u201cloan\u201d on it, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-17\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Given this line of questioning, it is clear that Larry sought to use Tammy\u2019s letter to show that her claim of loan repayment was bogus, while his claim that she owed him the money outright was valid. By offering this letter into evidence, Larry sought to and succeeded in convincing the court that no loan was ever intended. He thus accomplished precisely what Rule 408 is designed to avoid: he tendered into evidence an offer to compromise a claim that is disputed as to validity or amount \u201cin order to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim.\u201d Rule 408, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">\u00b624  Accordingly, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted Exhibit A, Tammy\u2019s April 30th letter to Larry. Moreover, because the District Court relied heavily on this improperly admitted evidence in concluding that Tammy presented contradictory testimony and was therefore not credible, we are compelled to conclude that this improper admission resulted in substantial injustice, requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-20\">\u00b625 We find the improper evidentiary ruling in this case dispositive, and thus we do not reach the second issue Tammy presents on appeal. \u00b626 We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to admit Tammy\u2019s letter and order a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-21\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Afq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b627 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. It is my view that Tammy\u2019s letter was not an offer of compromise pursuant to Rule 408, M.R.Evid., and, further, that <em>Niles </em>actually supports the District Court\u2019s admission of the letter. I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b628 Rule 408, M.R.Evid., does not apply to any and all \u201coffers of compromise.\u201d The Rule speaks only to offers or attempts to compromise \u201ca claim\u201d which \u201cwas disputed....\u201d Thus, while the Court is correct that Tammy\u2019s letter related to \u201cdisputed debts\u201d between herself and Larry, a letter trying to resolve a disputed debt between two people does not fall within the plain language of Rule 408 requiring exclusion of an offer of compromise of a disputed \u201cclaim .\u201d In other words, \u201cdispute\u201d-as used in Rule 408-is not the equivalent of \u201cclaim.\u201d To conclude otherwise, as the Court does in this case, is to essentially delete and render nugatory the word \u201cclaim\u201d in the Rule. It is not a court\u2019s job to omit language in making interpretations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. I conclude that Tammy\u2019s letter is not an offer to compromise a claim for purposes of Rule 408, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b629 Nor do I agree with the Court that this case presents \u201cthe question of whether an offer of compromise must occur after a formal claim has been filed in order to be excluded under Rule 408, M.R.Evid.\u201d <em>Niles </em>is clear that a legal claim need not be filed in a court to bring Rule 408 into play. However, <em>Niles </em>also is clear that there must be \u201ca claim,\u201d not merely a private dispute or an offer to compromise such a private dispute. <em>Niles </em>states the relevant portion of Rule 408 as \u201coffers or acceptances in compromise of a disputed claim\u201d are not admissible. <em>Niles, </em>236 Mont. at 463, 771 P.2d at 118. Nothing in Mies supports the Court\u2019s determination here that a dispute is the equivalent of a disputed \u201cclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b630 <em>Niles </em>does hold that when \u201ca claim\u201d exists by a plaintiff against defendants, offers of compromise regarding that claim are within the purview of Rule 408. The decision clearly was premised on the specific facts of that case. \"Where both parties had hired attorneys and a draft of the complaint had been sent to defendants\u2019 counsel, \u201c[i]t was certainly clear ... that Niles had <em>a claim </em>against defendants.\u201d <em>Niles, </em>236 Mont. at 463, 771 P.2d at 119 (emphasis added). I simply cannot agree with the Court that <em>Niles </em>can be stretched to cover this case simply because Tammy sued Larry approximately three months after her letter to him. None of the facts which led the <em>Niles </em>Court to conclude \u201ca claim\u201d existed is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b631 Finally, I do agree with the Court that \u201cRule 408 should not reach into the remote past[.]\u201d It is my view, however, that the facts in <em>Niles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>likely are the outer limit on what can fall within Rule 408, because an actual \u201cclaim\u201d existed there. The same is not true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b632 Most importantly, however, I believe the Court is doing trial courts and legal practitioners a grave disservice in its analysis of Rule 408. The issue of what constitutes an offer to compromise a claim for purposes of inadmissibility under Rule 408 is infrequently litigated-at least in this Court-and relatively well settled. The Court\u2019s opinion gives no guidance at all as to what \u201cthe remote past\u201d might be. The opinion simply unsettles the law, rather than properly applying either the Rule or <em>Niles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b633 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
