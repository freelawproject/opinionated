The State\u2019s primary witness was K.M., the defendant\u2019s toddler daughter, against whom he allegedly committed the offense. Because the young girl was not competent to testify, the State sought to have her hearsay statements admitted into evidence. The District Court conducted a hearing on the issue and held that KM.\u2019s statements were admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. S.T.M. appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues S.T.M. presents for review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined KM.\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">2. Should the District Court have excluded KM.\u2019s hearsay statements as a violation of the right of confrontation, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b63 On July 11, 2001, the State of Montana filed an Information charging S.T.M. with one felony count of incest, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. Alternatively, S.T.M. was charged with sexual assault, a felony, and surreptitious visual observation, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-502 and -223, MCA, respectively. The charges stem from allegations that S.T.M. licked the vagina of K.M., his 35-month-old daughter, while he was putting her to bed one evening. \u00b64 K.M. was the State\u2019s primary witness. S.T.M. challenged her competency to testify, and the State conceded that she was not competent to testify due to her age. However, the State sought to have K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements-made to her mother and to a social worker-admitted into evidence under Rule 804(b)(5), M.R.Evid., which provides a residual exception to the hearsay rule. S.T.M. filed a motion in limine to exclude the hearsay statements. On September 28, 2001, the District Court conducted a hearing on the issue and determined that K.M.\u2019s statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b65 Thereafter, S.T.M. pled guilty to sexual assault, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. Upon his guilty plea, the District Court sentenced S.T.M. to ten years in Montana State Prison, but suspended the term of incarceration on a lengthy set of conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b66 S.T.M. married M.M. when she was fifteen years old and he was approximately twenty-five. The couple has two children: K.M. is now five years old and L.M. is three years old. On or about June 5, 2001, M.M. noticed a rash while changing K.M.\u2019s diaper. M.M. has testified that the she had the following conversation with her daughter after she noticed the rash:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">Mother: Oh, that looks bad. Does it hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">K.M.: Yeah, don\u2019t lick it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">Mother: Lick it, who did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">K.M.: Daddy did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Upon hearing this, M.M. immediately went to the living room to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>confront her husband. M.M. told him what K.M. had just said and asked if it were true. S.T.M. allegedly admitted something to effect: \u201cI really didn\u2019t do much. I just started to and I quit.\u201d S.T.M. gave conflicting accounts of when the incident took place, once claiming it was about a month earlier and later saying it happened just a few days before.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b67 M.M. also testified that later the same evening, she asked her daughter, \u201cDid Daddy do something to you?\u201d and K.M. replied, \u2018Yeah, he licked my bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b68 During this same period of time, S.T.M. and M.M. were in counseling with Mike and Judy Cleveland. The Clevelands, based in Ohio, offered a ministry to help people with sexual addiction problems. M.M. testified that she learned about the Clevelands\u2019 ministry through the Internet and sought their help to deal with S.T.M.\u2019s addiction to pornography. Counseling sessions were conducted by phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b69 During a counseling session, S.T.M. disclosed to the Clevelands that he had licked KM.\u2019s vagina. Mike Cleveland alerted law enforcement authorities in Montana that S.T.M. may have abused his minor daughter. M.M. also later reported the incident to authorities. As a result, on June 26, 2001, Linda Meloan from the Lincoln County Child Protective Services interviewed K.M. Detective Steve Hurtig watched the interview from outside the room. The interview was taped and was viewed by the District Court during the evidentiary hearing. \u00b610 At the time of the interview, K.M. was just over three weeks away from her third birthday. She was extremely shy and reticent during the interview. K.M. clung to her mother throughout and was reluctant to talk to Meloan. Most of her answers were a single word, most often \u201cNo.\u201d In one way or another, Meloan asked K.M. approximately a dozen times whether her Daddy had \u201cdone anything\u201d to her, touched her, kissed her, licked her, or hugged her. K.M. either didn\u2019t answer or said \u201cNo\u201d to each question. At that point, however, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Meloan: Hey, K.M., has anybody ever licked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">K.M.: Daddy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">Meloan: Daddy licked you? Where did he lick you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">K.M.: In the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">Meloan: On the bed? You was on the ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">K.M.: On my bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">Meloan: On your bed. You was on your bed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">K.M.: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">Meloan: Alright. And what part of your body did Daddy lick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>K.M.: (Points to crotch area.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">Meloan: Right down there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">K.M.: Uh-huh (positive).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b611 After the conclusion of the interview, Detective Hurtig visited S.T.M.\u2019s workplace and questioned him about KM.\u2019s allegations. S.T.M. admitted he had licked his daughter on her vagina. He also admitted several other sexual incidents, involving his wife\u2019s younger sisters, and his own sisters. S.T.M. was subsequently charged with incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b612 K.M. did not appear at the evidentiary hearing, but both sides agreed that she was not competent to testify. M.M. testified that K.M. would not respond to questions on the witness stand. She said that K.M. is talkative around her, but very shy around strangers. M.M. testified that K.M. has a good memory, but doesn\u2019t always know the difference between the truth and a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b613 S.T.M.\u2019s first challenge is to the admission of KM.\u2019s hearsay statement under Rule 804(5), M.R.Evid., which provides a residual exception to the hearsay rule. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. The district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be overturned. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 14, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u00b614 In utilizing the guidelines outlined in <em>State v. J.C.E. </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 264, 767 P.2d 309, as the District Court did here, the admissibility of evidence remains in the discretion of the trial judge. Where a court is determining circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, we will defer to the court\u2019s decision unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown. <em>J.C.E., </em>235 Mont. at 275, 767 P.2d at 316 (citing <em>State v. LaPier </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 106, 676 P.2d 210).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">\u00b615 S.T.M.\u2019s second contention is that the admission of KM.\u2019s hearsay statements violates the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Kottel v. State, </em>2002 MT 278, \u00b6 8, 312 Mont. 387, \u00b6 8, 60 P.3d 403, \u00b6 8. Further, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling, even if the court reached the correct result for the wrong reason. <em>Kottel, </em>\u00b6 8, (citing <em>Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 40, 306 Mont. 321, \u00b6 40, 34 P.3d 87, \u00b6 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b617 The District Court ruled KM.\u2019s hearsay statements admissible pursuant to Rule 804(b)(5), M.R.Evid, which provides a residual exception to the rule against hearsay. The exception permits the admission of out-of-court statements, which would otherwise be excluded as hearsay, if the statements have \u201ccomparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to the enumerated exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b618 In <em>J.C.E., </em>we established a framework to guide district courts in determinations about the admissibility of hearsay testimony from young child victims in sexual assault cases. Before hearsay testimony can be considered under Rule 804(b)(5), we held the district court must make the following preliminary findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">1. The victim must be unavailable to testify, whether through incompetency, illness, or some other like reason (e.g., trauma induced by the courtroom setting);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">2. The proffered hearsay must be evidence of a material fact, and must be more probative than any other evidence available through reasonable means; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">3. The party intending to offer the hearsay testimony must give advance notice of that intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\"><em>J. C.E., </em>235 Mont. at 273, 767 P.2d at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\u00b619 Here, the parties agreed that K.M. was not competent to testify. K. M. was the only witness to the alleged crime, other than S.T.M. As the alleged crime left no physical evidence, her hearsay was the most probative of the available evidence. Finally, the State provided adequate notice of its intention to offer K.M.\u2019s hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u00b620 Having appropriately determined that those threshold elements were satisfied, the District Court proceeded to carefully and thoroughly apply the guidelines laid out in <em>J.C.E. </em>to evaluate the admissibility of hearsay statements from child victims. It is important for this analysis to quote extensively from the conclusions of law, in which the District Court applied the <em>J.C.E. </em>framework to the facts of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">1. The Attributes of the Child Hearsay Declarant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-15\">a. The child\u2019s age: K.M. was almost three years old when she made the initial statement to her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">b. The child\u2019s ability to communicate verbally: KM.\u2019s ability to communicate was probably appropriate for her age, but certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>marginal in the scheme of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">c. The child\u2019s ability to comprehend the statements or questions of others: Again, age appropriate, but marginal compared to a typical competent witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">d. The child\u2019s ability to tell the difference between truth and falsehood: Probably age appropriate, but according to her mother, K.M. is unable to consistently differentiate between fact and fiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">e. The child\u2019s motivation to tell the truth (i.e.. whether the child understands the general obligation to speak truthfully and not fabricate stories): There is no reason to believe that K.M. does not love her father or that she would want him to get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">f. Whether the child possessed sufficient mental capacity at the time of the alleged incident to receive an accurate impression of it: K.M. apparently received an accurate impression of what had happened to her, as evidenced by the fact that the Defendant allegedly admitted doing what K.M. reported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">g. Whether the child possesses sufficient memory to retain an independent recollection of the events at issue: K.M. repeated the allegation three weeks after first telling her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">2. The Witness Relating the Hearsay Statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">a. The witness\u2019s relationship to the child: The witnesses who would testify about their conversations with K.M. are her mother and a social worker previously unknown to K.M. There is also a videotape of K.M.\u2019s conversation with the social worker, so, in essence, the jury would be able to assess KM.\u2019s credibility for itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">b. Whether the relationship between the witness and the child might have an impact on the trustworthiness of the hearsay statement: This seems unlikely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">c. Whether the witness might have a motive to fabricate or distort the child\u2019s statement: No, M.M. seems ambivalent, at best, about the prosecution of her husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">d. The circumstances under which the witness heard the child\u2019s statement, including the timing of the statement in relation to the incident at issue and the availability of another person in whom the child could confide: The first statement was made within a month of the crime, probably much closer in time given the continued presence of the rash. From the Court\u2019s observations, M.M. is probably the only person to whom K.M. would have volunteered this information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>3. The Statement Itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">a. Whether the statement contains knowledge not normally attributed to a child of the declarant\u2019s age: It is unknown whether a child of K.M.\u2019s age would typically be able to conceive of having her private parts licked. It seems unlikely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">b. Whether it was volunteered spontaneously: The initial statement to M.M. was volunteered. The second statement on the evening of the initial volunteered statement was in response to a question. The final statement to Meloan followed repeated questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">c. The suggestiveness of prior statements by the witness relating the statement or third parties present when the statement was made: Prior to the statement to Meloan, there were certainly a number of suggestions made as to the answer being sought. That is not the case with the first statements to M.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">d. If statements were made by the child to more than one person, whether those statements were consistent: The statements were not detailed, but they were consistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">e. Its nearness in time to the incident at issue: Unknown, but the first statement was probably made within days. The statement to Meloan was three weeks after the first statement and as long as six weeks or more after the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">4. The Availability of Corroborative Evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">a. Whether the act alleged can be corroborated: The statements are corroborated by the presence of the rash and the Defendant\u2019s alleged admissions to his wife and to a third party and his confession to Detective Hurtig.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">b. If the child\u2019s statement identifies a perpetrator, whether that identity can be corroborated: K.M.\u2019s statements are corroborated by the presence of the rash and by Defendant\u2019s subsequent admissions and confession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">c. Direct versus circumstantial evidence: The rash is circumstantial; the admissions and confession are direct evidence of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">5. Other Considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">The particular facts of a case may present the court with considerations other than those outlined above that in the court\u2019s judgment will bear on the admissibility of the proffered testimony: The Defendant was not Mirandized before either his admission to the counselor in Ohio, which was tape recorded with law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>enforcement assistance, or his interview by Detective Hurtig. Although neither interview was custodial, the investigative focus had certainly narrowed to the Defendant when the interviews were conducted. On the other hand, the admissions and the confession were not the result of vigorous interview technique.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7W\">\u00b621 After considering and balancing all these factors, the court determined that the statements K.M. made to her mother, and later to Linda Meloan, were admissible under the Rule 804(b)(5) exception to the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b622 Were we to decide this case solely on the basis of the hearsay challenge, we might simply affirm here, and end our analysis. However, S.T.M. also challenged the admission of the child\u2019s statements in light of his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers. As explained below, we will no longer consider these two challenges independently. Therefore, we must consider S.T.M.\u2019s second challenge-that the admission of the child\u2019s statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause-before we can decide whether the District Court erred in denying S.T.M.\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b623 Should the District Court have excluded K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements as a violation of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b624 In his motion to exclude KM.\u2019s hearsay statements, S.T.M. argued both that admission of the statements would violate the rule against hearsay, and that admission of the hearsay statements would violate the Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Despite the fact that S.T.M. raised a two-prong objection, the District Court did not acknowledge the constitutional question in its conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b625 In 1988, we issued our opinion in <em>J.C.E., </em>resolving a challenge to the admission of a child\u2019s hearsay statements based on the residual exception to the hearsay rule. Notably, the appellant did not raise a Confrontation Clause challenge. Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, in which it considered a Confrontation Clause challenge to the admissibility of a young child\u2019s hearsay statements in a sexual abuse case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b626 We briefly summarize the facts in <em>Wright. </em>Laura Wright and Robert Giles were each convicted of two counts of lewd conduct with a minor and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for having sex\u00faal intercourse with Wright\u2019s two daughters, ages five-and-a-half and two-and-a-half. Both Giles and Wright appealed their convictions involving the younger daughter to the Idaho Supreme Court. Giles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>contended on appeal that the trial court erred when it admitted the hearsay statements the younger daughter made to a doctor under the state\u2019s residual hearsay exception. The Idaho Supreme Court disagreed and affirmed Giles\u2019 conviction. In her appeal, Wright asserted that the admission of the doctor\u2019s testimony under the residual hearsay exception violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause. The Idaho Supreme Court agreed and reversed Wright\u2019s conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed the decision of Idaho\u2019s high court. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 812, 110 S. Ct. at 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b627 The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b628 While the Court in <em>Wright </em>recognized that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values, it emphasized that the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions should not be equated with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. In other words, the Court said, \u201cThe Confrontation Clause bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814, 110 S. Ct. at 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d at 651. Thus, <em>Wright </em>addresses exactly the question we must answer here: Even if K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements were properly admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, does their admission violate the Confrontation Clause? \u00b629 The <em>Wright </em>Court explained that the Confrontation Clause restricts the range of admissible hearsay, first by requiring a showing of necessity \u2014 the prosecution must demonstrate the declarant of the hearsay is unavailable to testify. Second, the declarant\u2019s statement is admissible \u201conly if it bears adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814-15, 110 S. Ct. at 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d at 651-52. Moreover, when the hearsay statement does not fall within one of the firmly rooted exceptions to the rule against hearsay-and a residual exception is not among the firmly rooted exceptions-the indicia of reliability requirement may be met only where the hearsay statement is supported by \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 816, 110 S. Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b630 The Supreme Court held that \u2018\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 must be shown from the totality of the circumstances,\u201d but cautioned that the \u201crelevant circumstances include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>only those that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 819, 110 S. Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. Specifically, evidence at trial that corroborates the truth of the statement is not to be considered. Thus, while it has been deemed acceptable in a strict hearsay analysis to consider extrinsic corroborating evidence <em>(J.C.E.), </em>such evidence may not be taken into account under a Confrontation Clause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">\u00b631  Reliance upon exceptions to the hearsay rule is permissible if the declarant\u2019s truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility. The factors often identified by state and federal courts as indicia of the reliability of statements made by child witnesses in child sexual abuse cases-for example spontaneity, use of language unexpected of a child of similar age, and lack of motive to fabricate- all relate to whether the child declarant was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made. They do not include factors \u201cthat may be added using hindsight.\u201d <em>Wright, 497 </em>U.S. at 820, 110 S. Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b632 The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">In short, the use of corroborating evidence to support a hearsay statement\u2019s \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result we think at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Wright, 497 U.S. at 823, 110 S. Ct. at 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b633 In the years since <em>Wright </em>was decided, we have had the opportunity to reconcile it with our opinion in <em>J.C.E. </em>In <em>Osborne, </em>we noted that the Supreme Court \u201cconcluded that corroborating evidence is not a basis for presuming the declarant to be trustworthy.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 22, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 22. We went on to write:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">Based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Wright and our prior language in J.C.E., we conclude that the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to satisfy the reliability requirement, both for purposes of admissibility and of the Sixth Amendment right of the accused to confront witnesses, must be drawn from the totality of the circumstances particular to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aym\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 23, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\u00b634  Given the holding in <em>Wright, </em>and our own decision in <em>Osborne, </em>it should be clear that in child sexual abuse cases, a court may not consider corroborating evidence when making a determination about the admissibility of hearsay statements under the Confrontation Clause. Because we cannot conceive of a case in which the admission of the hearsay statements of an alleged victim of child sexual abuse would not implicate the Confrontation Clause as well as the rule against hearsay, we hold that the fourth factor listed in the <em>J.C.E. </em>guidelines-the availability of corroborative evidence-should be struck from the <em>J.C.E. </em>hearsay analysis in child sex abuse cases. In other words, a court may still use the factors outlined in <em>J.C.E. </em>as a vehicle through which to assess the totality of the circumstances surrounding a hearsay statement, provided it does not include corroborative evidence in its evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b635 We now turn to the instant case. First, as we mentioned above, the District Court did not address S.T.M.\u2019s Confrontation Clause challenge to the admission of KM.\u2019s hearsay statements. Second, the court\u2019s decision to admit the statements under the residual exception to the hearsay rule was based in significant part on corroborating evidence. In its conclusions of law, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">As with any balancing test, it is difficult to know how much weight to give to each consideration. We have a very young child who is barely capable of communicating; she certainly resists talking to strangers, even in her mother\u2019s presence. She cannot, or could not or would not, at the time of the interview with Meloan, talk in complete sentences. According to M.M., K.M. cannot always distinguish between fact and fiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">On the other side of the coin, the statements made to M.M. and the statement made three weeks later to Meloan, are consistent and are not the type of statement that we would normally expect to hear from a 2-3 year old child. We certainly wouldn\u2019t expect a child to fabricate such a story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">No doubt the biggest circumstance which provides a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness is S.T.M.\u2019s alleged admissions to his wife and the counselor in Ohio and his confession to Detective Hurtig. K.M. did have a rash, and S.T.M. did admit to several people, including a detective, that he had licked his daughter\u2019s vagina. That is certainly not an admission that we would expect a person to make if it were not true. The Court concludes the presence of the rash and the Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>admissions to three separate people on three separate occasions outweigh any doubts about K.M.\u2019s ability to perceive and communicate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b636 The District Court also took account of the corroborating evidence when it considered the attributes of K.M., the child hearsay declarant. In evaluating whether K.M. possessed sufficient mental capacity at the time of the alleged incident to receive an accurate impression of it, the court wrote: \u201cK.M. apparently received an accurate impression of what had happened to her, as evidenced by the fact that the Defendant allegedly admitted doing what K.M. reported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b637  It is undeniable that the District Court not only considered the corroborating evidence in this case, but indeed found it dispositive in its decision to admit K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements. Because the Confrontation Clause prohibits the consideration of such corroborating evidence, the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in its decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b638 However, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling if it reached the correct result for the wrong reason. <em>Kottel, </em>\u00b6 8. Because we have the opportunity to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of S.T.M.\u2019s Confrontation Clause challenge, we are able to consider the record and make an independent evaluation as to whether admission of K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements would violate the Confrontation Clause. We conclude that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b639  Upon considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding KM.\u2019s hearsay statements, exclusive of the corroborating evidence, we conclude that her statements were supported by the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to withstand a Confrontation Clause challenge. In fact, her statements satisfied a number of the factors upon which state and federal courts have historically relied for indicia of reliability. See \u00b6 31. Most notably, K.M. made the initial statement to her mother spontaneously. Her statement referenced oral-genital contact, a matter not normally within the contemplation of a toddler under three years old. Further, K.M.\u2019s mother was reluctant to participate in the prosecution of her husband, which makes her a particularly reliable witness to relate the hearsay statement. Moreover, neither she nor K.M. had any reason to fabricate the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b640 S.T.M. claims that the interview technique used by Meloan, and KM.\u2019s inconsistent responses to questions, undermine the reliability of K.M.\u2019s statement to Meloan. While we do believe that K.M.\u2019s statement to Meloan raises more concerns about reliability than her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>statement to her mother did \u2014 because, for instance, the statement to Meloan was not volunteered spontaneously, but rather, was offered in response to questioning \u2014 ultimately, we believe it meets the threshold guarantee of trustworthiness necessary for admission into evidence. Significantly, K.M.\u2019s statement to Meloan was consistent with what she volunteered to her mother three weeks before when M.M. was changing her diaper. Meloan had no prior relationship with K.M. or any of her family members that would cast doubt on her objectivity. She had no motive to distort KM.\u2019s account of the incident. Moreover, Meloan\u2019s interview with K.M. was videotaped. As the District Court pointed out, the existence of the videotape strengthens the case for admission. A trier of fact would have the opportunity to watch the interview in its entirety, evaluate the interview technique, and assess the young child\u2019s ability to accurately process and convey information. Based on these factors, the trier of fact could independently determine how much weight, if any, to assign to the child\u2019s statements in that interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b641 We conclude that these circumstances, taken together, combine to meet the level of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d required by the <em>Wright </em>Court in a Confrontation Clause analysis. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to admit K.M.\u2019s hearsay statements into evidence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
