Topp appeals from the District Court\u2019s earlier order denying his motion to dismiss the two misdemeanor charges on statutory speedy trial grounds, having reserved the right to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Topp\u2019s motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">\u00b63 Topp\u2019s vehicle collided with an oncoming vehicle as he drove from the parking lot of the Rustic Hut Tavern in Florence, Montana, onto U.S. Highway 93. He was cited into the Ravalli County Justice Court on January 23, 2001, for the misdemeanor offenses of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs (second offense) and failure to provide proof of liability insurance (fourth offense). On February 5, 2001, Topp pled not guilty to both offenses. The prosecution moved to dismiss the citations because it intended to file charges in the District Court and, on March 14, 2001, the Justice Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AMuH\">\u00b64 On March 21, 2001, the State of Montana (State) filed an information against Topp in the District Court, charging him with felony criminal endangerment and the two misdemeanor offenses previously dismissed by the Justice Court. Topp pled not guilty to all charges on April 18,2001. Subsequent amendments to the information are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">\u00b65 The District Court set trial for August of 2001, but rescheduled it to September 17, 2001, on the State\u2019s motion. On August 13, 2001, Topp moved to dismiss the two misdemeanor charges for lack of a speedy trial. Topp argued that \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, required the misdemeanor charges to be tried within six months of February 5, 2001, the date on which he pled not guilty in the Justice Court. The District Court concluded the constitutional speedy trial analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>rather than the statute, applied and denied Topp\u2019s motion. Reserving his right to appeal that ruling, Topp pled guilty to all three charges. The District Court sentenced Topp and ultimately entered an Amended Judgment. Topp appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges on statutory speedy trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b66 Whether a district court properly denied a motion to dismiss is a legal issue which we review to determine whether that court\u2019s interpretation was correct. <em>State v. Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 368, 901 P.2d 61, 66 (citing <em>State v. Mantz </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 135, 137, 887 P.2d 251, 253; <em>Doting v. Trunk </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 343, 347, 856 P.2d 536, 539).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in denying Topp\u2019s motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b68 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, addresses the time in which a person charged with a misdemeanor must be tried:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">With regard to the constitutional speedy trial right, Montana courts apply a modified <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>test. <em>See City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 148, \u00b6 19, 965 P.2d 866, \u00b6 19 (citing <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101). \u00b69 Analogizing to <em>Mantz </em>and <em>Bullock, </em>the District Court determined that the proper joinder of the misdemeanor and felony charges against Topp, together with the strong policies underlying joinder, rendered all of the charges against Topp susceptible to the <em>Bruce </em>speedy trial analysis. Applying that analysis, the court determined Topp\u2019s constitutional speedy trial rights had not been violated. Topp does not challenge the court\u2019s <em>Bruce </em>analysis. He contends the District Court improperly interpreted-and failed to apply~\u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. He also addresses the case law on which the court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b610 Topp first asserts entitlement to dismissal of the misdemeanor charges pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, because he was not brought to trial on those charges within six months of his February 5,2001 not guilty pleas in the Justice Court. This assertion is totally without merit since the Justice Court charges were, in fact, dismissed without prejudice on March 14, 2001. No charges were pending against Topp for approximately one week thereafter and, consequently, no speedy trial \u201cclock\u201d was running.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b611 Moreover, Topp does not object to the joinder of the misdemeanor and felony charges against him in the District Court. Indeed, he concedes that felony charges may take longer to prepare and try. He contends, however, that the misdemeanor charges remain subject to the \u201csix-month\u201d rule contained in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, while the felony charge falls under the <em>Bruce </em>analysis. We disagree and, because the joinder issue relates to both Topp\u2019s statutory interpretation argument and the cases on which the District Court relied, we discuss that subject next.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b612 Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., states that an indictment or information may charge a defendant with multiple offenses \u201cwhether felonies or misdemeanors or both\u201d if the offenses are based on the same act or transaction. In general, federal authorities are uniformly in support of joining multiple offenses that arose from the same acts by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alexander </em>(7th Cir. 1998), 135 F.3d 470, 476; <em>United States v. Bullock </em>(5th Cir. 1995), 71 F.3d 171, 174. Out of considerations of fairness to defendants and of orderly and efficient law enforcement, the policy of the United States Department of Justice is \u201cthat several offenses arising out of a single transaction should be alleged and tried together and should not be made the basis of multiple prosecutions.\u201d 1A Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 143 (3d. Ed. 1999) (citing <em>Petite v. U.S. </em>(1960), 361 U.S. 529, 530, 80 S.Ct. 450, 451, 4 L.Ed.2d 490, 492).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b613 Montana authorities are generally in accord. Section46-11-404(1), MCA, is substantively identical to Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., providing that multiple offenses, \u201cwhether felonies or misdemeanors or both,\u201d may be charged in the same charging document if the offenses are of the same or similar character, based on the same transactions, or constitute a common scheme. Considerations of judicial economy exert a strong pressure in favor of joining related offenses. <em>See State v. Martin </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 185, 192, 926 P.2d 1380, 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b614 As noted above, Topp does not dispute the propriety of joinder in the present case. In addition, he recognizes that \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>contains a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception. While not expressly stated, Topp may be attempting to argue that, because the District Court did not expressly make a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination, joinder does not constitute good cause as contemplated by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b615 It is true that no express good cause determination was made here. If the District Court implicitly made a determination that joinder and the purposes it serves constituted good cause not to apply \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, to the misdemeanor charges against Topp, that determination would be a conclusion of law in the context of this criminal proceeding, reviewable to determine whether the court was correct. <em>See Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 368, 901 P.2d at 66 (citing <em>Mantz, </em>269 Mont. at 137, 887 P.2d at 253). In that regard, the District Court did state that it would \u201cthwart[] the very principle of joinder\u201d to subject the misdemeanor charges to the statute, thus requiring that they be tried more quickly, while the felony charge remained subject to the separate <em>Bruce </em>analysis. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the conclusion was reached as a good cause determination regarding why \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, does not apply to the misdemeanors in the District Court, Topp advances no authority under which such a determination would be legally incorrect, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. As a result, we will not address that matter further. <em>See In re B.P., </em>2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 430, \u00b6 41, 35 P.3d 291, \u00b6 41 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b616 Topp also asserts that <em>Mantz </em>and <em>Bullock, </em>on which the District Court relied, are not directly on point here. He is correct and, indeed, the District Court acknowledged as much. That court merely analogized to <em>Mantz </em>and <em>Bullock, </em>and we conclude it did so properly.</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">\u00b617 <em>Mantz </em>involved a defendant tried and convicted of a misdemeanor in city court, who thereafter appealed to the district court for a trial <em>de novo. Mantz, </em>269 Mont. at 136-37, 887 P.2d at 252. He was not tried in the district court within the six months set forth in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and sought dismissal of the misdemeanor on that basis. The trial court denied the motion, the defendant was convicted and, on appeal to this Court, the defendant asserted error in the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the misdemeanor charge on statutory speedy trial grounds. <em>Mantz, </em>269 Mont. at 137, 887 P.2d at 252-53. We disagreed, noting that we previously had interpreted the statute as inapplicable to situations in which the case is appealed from a court of limited jurisdiction to a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. <em>Mantz, </em>269 Mont. at 137-38, 887 P.2d at 253. Indeed, in <em>State v. Sunford </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 411, 796 P.2d 1084, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201cA trial de novo is a \u2018new trial,\u2019 one which does not strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>speaking, arise out of entry of plea upon a complaint but arises out of an appeal.\u201d Once an action is appealed from justice [court] to district court, it is treated as if it were a new trial. Questions regarding speedy trial in cases concerning new trials are analyzed under the constitutional standards of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><em>Sunford, </em>244 Mont. at 416, 796 P.2d at 1087 (citing <em>State v. Knox </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 537, 541, 675 P.2d 950, 952). In other words, when the case moved to the district court on appeal by the defendant for a trial <em>de novo, </em>it became essentially a new case in that court and the constitutional speedy trial analysis was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b618 <em>Bullock, </em>on the other hand, involved a statutorily authorized appeal by the state from justice court to the district court for a trial <em>de novo, </em>after the justice court suppressed all evidence pertaining to one defendant and dismissed altogether the charges against another defendant. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 364, 901 P.2d at 63. In response, the defendants moved the district court, among other things, to dismiss the misdemeanor charges because no trial had occurred within the six months allowed by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The district court denied their motions, and the defendants appealed. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 367, 901 P.2d at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b619 On appeal, the defendants contended that the <em>Sunford </em>holding-cited in <em>Mantz-did </em>not apply because, in their case, no trial had occurred in the justice court and, therefore, no trial <em>de novo </em>could occur in the district court. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 368, 901 P.2d at 66. We determined that \u201c[s]o long as the justice court jurisdiction is exhausted within six months by some action which authorizes appeal de novo to the district court, \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, has been satisfied\u201d and the constitutional speedy trial analysis applies. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 369, 901 P.2d at 67. In <em>Bullock, </em>the action which exhausted the justice court\u2019s jurisdiction and authorized appeal <em>de novo </em>was a statute allowing the state to appeal any order, such as that entered by the justice court, which results in dismissing a case. In any event, as in <em>Mantz, </em>the case became a new case when it reached the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">\u00b620  While there are procedural distinctions between <em>Mantz </em>and <em>Bullock </em>and the present case, the principles underlying those cases are equally applicable here. The misdemeanor charges against Topp originally arose via citations into Justice Court, where Topp pled not guilty. Significantly less than six months later, the Justice Court dismissed those charges, thereby exhausting its jurisdiction. At that point, no charges were pending against Topp. The State subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>joined the misdemeanor charges with a felony charge of criminal endangerment and filed them in the District Court via information. At that time, the charges and case were an entirely new matter, in essence a case <em>de novo, </em>in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b621 For these various reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, is not applicable in the District Court in this case. Therefore, we hold the District Court did not err in denying Topp\u2019s motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges against him on statutory speedy trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u00b622 Topp\u2019s final argument is that, if we determine the District Court erred in denying his speedy trial motion, he is entitled to a trial on the felony criminal endangerment charge to which he also pled guilty. Given our holding above, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
