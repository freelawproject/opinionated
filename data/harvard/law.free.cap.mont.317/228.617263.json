INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b61 Carl Dunkerson (Dunkerson) appeals from the amended judgment entered by the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, ordering him to pay restitution. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in ordering Dunkerson to pay restitution when the Presentence Investigation report did not contain victim pecuniary loss documentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in basing pecuniary loss findings on the victim\u2019s listing of valuations not founded on market value?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err when it included Mikulecky\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses as part of the restitution amount owed?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">\u00b66 Patricia Mikulecky (Mikulecky) owns the home of her deceased parents, who accumulated, during their lifetimes, much personal property which was contained within the home. Mikulecky herself also stored some of her personal property at the home, as did her brother.</p>\n<p id=\"AEqV\">\u00b67 On February 7,2001, Appellant Dunkerson, along with two other individuals, burglarized Mikulecky\u2019s parents\u2019 home and other homes. The burglary resulted in considerable damage to the accumulated personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">\u00b68 Dunkerson pled guilty to two counts of felony theft and four counts of felony burglary. On July 16, 2001, a Presentence Investigation (PSI) report was filed. It contained pecuniary loss figures for other victims; however, it attributed no such loss figure to Mikulecky. Rather, the PSI report noted the pecuniary loss figure for Mikulecky was an \u201cundetermined amount.\u201d The PSI report further contained information regarding Dunkerson\u2019s financial resources, namely $2,500.00 in assets and $7,000.00 in debts. The PSI report also stated Dunkerson was taking home $1,000.00 per month and was capable of paying restitution. The District Court entered Judgment and Commitment against Dunkerson on August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">\u00b69 On May 2, 2002, the District Court heard testimony from Mikulecky concerning a handwritten list delineating specifically what property had been damaged, destroyed, or lost from her parents\u2019 home. The list also delineated the monetary value attributable to each article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of property, with a grand total of $24,312.00. In this grand total, Mikulecky also included $7,180.00 in cleanup costs, based on 718 hours Mikulecky and others spent working (at $10.00 per hour) and $860.00 (per Mikulecky\u2019s testimony) in travel and food costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b610 Mikulecky determined the monetary value for each article of property from memory, comparison shopping, and actual receipts, although she provided only five receipts. Regarding Mikulecky\u2019s monetary valuations of the damaged, destroyed, or lost property, she stated she sold cosmetics so she knew the value of her missing inventory. She received an estimate and provided receipts for a guitar and silverware, as well as receipts for the prices of a computer, sewing machine, and drill. For the remaining items, Mikulecky estimated the values. She stated she had not attempted to find the market value for the items and used instead the original cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b611 The May 2, 2002 hearing was continued until June 6, 2002, to provide Dunkerson sufficient time to review the receipts the Respondent State of Montana (State) provided on the day of the hearing. Dunkerson provided no new valuation evidence during this June 6, 2002 hearing, nor did he contradict Mikulecky\u2019s valuations. \u00b612 On July 29, 2002, the District Court entered its amended judgment ordering Dunkerson \u201cjointly and severally liable for restitution\u201d in the amount of $24,312.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b613 Dunkerson now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b614  In cases involving criminal sentences, we review a district court\u2019s sentence for legality. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. Specifically, we review whether the sentence imposed was within the parameters provided by statute. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Perry </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 34, 36, 938 P.2d 1325, 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b615 1. Did the District Court err in ordering Dunkerson to pay restitution when the Presentence Investigation report did not contain victim pecuniary loss documentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u00b616 Dunkerson argues that the District Court must order a probation officer to document a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, an offender\u2019s financial resources, and an offender\u2019s future ability to pay restitution to comply with \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA. The State contends the May 2, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>hearing provided sufficient documentation to satisfy the pecuniary loss requirement of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b617  A sentencing judge must mandate payment of full restitution by an offender to a victim should the sentencing judge find the victim suffered a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. Before mandating payment of full restitution, however, a sentencing judge must find that the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 through 249, MCA, are satisfied. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA; <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 7, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6 7, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6 7 (holding the pecuniary loss requirement of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, was not satisfied where no plea agreement existed).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b618 Failure of a PSI report to contain documentation of a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss and an offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay renders a district court\u2019s sentencing of restitution illegal. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 47, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 47, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 47. However, a full evidentiary hearing can vitiate the need for pecuniary loss documentation in a PSI report. <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 9, 297 Mont. 23, \u00b6 9, 989 P.2d 866, \u00b6 9 (holding the pecuniary loss requirement of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, was satisfied where a plea agreement existed, thereby allowing the District Court to determine the restitution amount should the parties not agree to an amount); <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 25, 310 Mont. 449, \u00b6 25, 51 P.3d 495, \u00b6 25 (holding the pecuniary loss requirement of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, was satisfied where the PSI noted a supplemental hearing should be conducted, such hearing was held, and testimony of the victim\u2019s pecuniary losses was documented).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b619 Here, the PSI report listed Dunkerson as having $2,500.00 in total assets, $7,000.00 in total debts, and $1,000.00 per month in current take-home pay. Further, the report noted Dunkerson was currently capable of paying restitution, thereby satisfying the financial resources and future ability to pay requirements of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b620  Mikulecky\u2019s pecuniary loss was listed in the PSI as an \u201cundetermined amount.\u201d However, the PSI also noted Mikulecky needed more time to accurately account for the restitution owed her. Much like the PSI report in <em>Benoit, </em>a pecuniary loss amount was not listed but a reason was given for its absence. Here, the reason was Mikulecky\u2019s need for more time. Further, much like the victim in <em>Benoit, </em>Mikulecky testified at the restitution hearing as to what property was damaged, destroyed, or lost from her parents\u2019 home and as to the valuation of that property. Thus, like the offender in <em>Benoit, </em>Dunkerson was afforded an opportunity to present evidence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>restitution hearing and to cross-examine Mikulecky regarding her valuation testimony. Therefore, as in <em>Benoit, </em>we conclude that the pecuniary loss requirement of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, was satisfied. The District Court did not err in ordering Dunkerson to pay restitution when the PSI report did not contain the amount of Mikulecky\u2019s pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b621 Before we turn to the second issue, we note here that although \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, was satisfied, the State concedes that the District Court did not comply with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, when ordering restitution. Specifically, the State concedes the District Court failed to specify the total amount to be paid and the method and time of payment of the restitution. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b622 [4] We conclude that the District Court erred by not specifying the amount of restitution Dunkerson owed and the time and method of payment of the restitution. Therefore, we remand this case to the District Court. The District Court must set the amount of restitution and an installment payment schedule for Dunkerson in accordance with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b623 Because we remand for rehearing, we now address the remaining two issues Dunkerson raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b624 2. Did the District Court err in basing pecuniary loss findings on the victim\u2019s listing of valuations not founded on market value?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b625 Dunkerson next argues Mikulecky\u2019s valuation testimony, of a guitar and silverware for example, was not based on fair market value, but rather was based on replacement cost. The State contends some of Mikulecky\u2019s valuations were based on market value. Regardless, the State contends it should be allowed a rehearing so it may establish market value: (1) for new items, applying the purchase value to those items; (2) for items for which the owner or another witness may establish a market value at the time of loss by hearsay testimony, otherwise, market value; and (3) for items for which no market value can be established, applying replacement value to those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b626 According to \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(a), MCA, value means \u201cthe market value of the property at the time and place of the crime or, <em>if the market value cannot he satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of the replacement </em>of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d [Emphasis added]. <em>See also State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 24, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6 24, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6 24 (holding that replacement cost is an incorrect valuation method in determining restitution); <em>State v. Ohms, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>2002 MT 80, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 263, \u00b6 10, 46 P.3d 55, \u00b6 10 (citing \u00a7 45-2-101(74)(a), MCA (now \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(a), MCA)). Much valuation testimony in this case is based on hearsay evidence. But, we held in <em>State v. Bingman </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 101, 113, 745 P.2d 342, 349, that hearsay evidence is admissible during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b627 Generally, the prices offered by merchants for their merchandise are market values. <em>State v. Barker </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 452, 456, 685 P.2d 357, 360. However, familiarity with the property, <em>State v. Pitzer, </em>2002 MT 82, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 309 Mont. 285, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 46 P.3d 582, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13; experience with the property, <em>State v. </em>Fox (1984), 212 Mont. 488, 492, 689 P.2d 252, 254; <em>State v. Dess </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 468, 471, 674 P.2d 502, 504, and employment in the field where the property is used, <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 378, 383, 842 P.2d 344, 347-48, have also been held admissible to establish market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b628 Here, we agree with the State regarding Mikulecky s valuation for some of the items. Mikulecky testified she sold cosmetics so she knew which cosmetics were damaged, destroyed, or lost and their respective values. Such valuation is consistent with <em>Pitzer, Fox, Dess, </em>and <em>Pierce, </em>because Mikulecky herself had familiarity and experience with the cosmetics, in addition to her employment in the cosmetics field. Further, Mikulecky provided purchase receipts for a computer, sewing machine, and drill. These valuation techniques, to the extent they establish the prices offered by merchants, rightly establish market value under <em>Barker </em>and satisfy \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b629  For the remaining items, we conclude, to the extent the value of the property at the time of its loss can be determined, that market value should be applied. Only if the market value cannot be satisfactorily ascertained should the replacement cost of the property be used. Further, we conclude that such valuation testimony for which the owner or another witness may establish a market value at the time of loss can be based on hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b630 We remand this case for rehearing so the District Court can receive appropriate testimony to establish the market value for each remaining item which was damaged, destroyed, or lost. We note that replacement cost should only be used when no market value can be established. Section 45-2-101(76), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b631 3. Did the District Court err when it included Mikulecky\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses as part of the restitution amount owed?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b632 Dunkerson argues the District Court was clearly erroneous in finding cleanup costs of $7,180.00 when he provided testimony that a professional would charge $960.00. However, the District Court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>such comparison lacking similarity. The cleanup Mikulecky faced after the burglary could not be likened to a professional cleaning a home which had not been burglarized, especially a home, like Mikulecky\u2019s, with over fifty years of accumulated property. The State contends Mikulecky\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, namely the cleanup, travel, and food costs, are allowed under \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA, and our holding in <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 31, 310 Mont. 449, \u00b6 31, 51 P.3d 495, \u00b6 31. Thus, the District Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">\u00b633 Under \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA, a victim can recover all special damages, including out-of-pocket losses. Mikulecky and two other individuals testified as to the work they performed in cleaning up Mikulecky\u2019s parents\u2019 home after the burglary. Mikulecky also testified as to the travel and food costs she incurred while cleaning up the home. The District Court found Dunkerson\u2019s comparison of a professional who cleans homes lacking similarity to Mikulecky\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b634  A district court judges the credibility of witnesses, and this Court will not disturb such findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 178, \u00b6 11, 24 P.3d 211, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). We conclude the District Court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous and that the court did not err in ordering restitution in an amount which included out-of-pocket expenses, as those expenses are allowed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b635 We remand this cause to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion. Specifically, the District Court must comply with the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, namely the court must set the amount of restitution and establish a payment installment plan. During these proceedings, the District Court must also require valuation testimony complying with the requirements of \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, by applying market value to the damaged, destroyed or lost property, unless such market value cannot be ascertained. We affirm the District Court\u2019s allowance of out-of-pocket expenses, including cleanup, travel, and food costs, as these findings Eire not clearly erroneous Eind are in compliEince with \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b636 Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
