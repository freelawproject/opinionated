INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b61 John E. Murphy (Murphy) appeals the judgment entered by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, denying his motion to dismiss the charge of failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Murphy\u2019s motion to dismiss, as <em>ex post facto, </em>the charge of failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\u00b64 Our decision in <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829, controls the disposition of this issue and we, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\u00b65 The history of the Sexual and Violent Offender Registration Act (the Act) is set forth in <em>Mount. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">\u00b66 On August 28,1995, Murphy was convicted in California of assault with force, and was sentenced to two years in prison and three years parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">\u00b67 In April 1998, Murphy transferred his probationary supervision from California to Montana, at which time he also signed an acknowledgment of his duty to register as a violent offender. Murphy registered as a violent offender and subsequently updated his address information on August 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">\u00b68 On June 15, 2001, Murphy was charged with failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current, under \u00a7 46-23-507, MCA. Specifically, \u00a7 46-23-507, MCA, states: \u201c[a] sexual or violent offender who knowingly fails to register, verify registration, or keep registration current... may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, of not more than 5 years or may be fined not more than $10,000, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">\u00b69 On July 10, 2001, Murphy moved for dismissal of the charge of failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current. The District Court denied his motion on September 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">\u00b610 Murphy now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">\u00b611 In criminal cases, we review a District Court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo </em>as a question of law. <em>State v. Beanblossom, </em>2002 MT 351, \u00b6 9, 313 Mont. 394, \u00b6 9, 61 P.3d 165, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in denying Murphy\u2019s motion to dismiss, as <em>ex post facto, </em>the charge of failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b613 Both parties argue the application of the intents-effects test. This test was articulated and applied in <em>Smith v. Doe </em>(2003), 58 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164, and was adopted by this Court in <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-90. Save one, Murphy makes much the same arguments that we addressed in <em>Mount </em>and, based on the same rationale stated in <em>Mount, </em>we reject those arguments here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b614  The one argument raised by Murphy that was not raised in <em>Mount </em>is that violent offenders should he treated differently than sex offenders because the pathology and recidivism rate for sex offenders is different than those of violent offenders. We note, however, that this argument was first raised by Murphy in his reply brief. In this regard, the law is well-settled. Arguments and issues first raised in a reply brief are not properly before this Court and will not be considered on appeal. <em>Smith v. State, </em>2000 MT 327, \u00b6 29, 303 Mont. 47, \u00b6 29, 15 P.3d 395, \u00b6 29, <em>cert denied, </em>533 U.S. 917, 121 S.Ct. 2524, 150 L.Ed.2d 696; <em>State v. Longneck </em>(1991) 247 Mont. 95, 98, 804 P.2d 1044, 1045 (citations omitted); Rule 23(c), M.R.App.P. Therefore, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\u00b615 The District Court\u2019s denial of Murphy\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of failing to keep his registration as a violent offender current is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b528-11\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ALS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">\u00b617 For the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>State v.
