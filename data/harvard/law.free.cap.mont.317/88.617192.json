We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">\u00b62 The mother presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it permitted Martina Heavy Runner to testify as an expert for purposes of the Indian Child Welfare Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">\u00b65 On October 6, 1999, the Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office, on behalf of the Department of Public Health and Human Services (\u201cDPHHS\u201d), filed a Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority and Protective Services. The petition sought to temporarily remove N.S., K.S., D.S., and C.S. from their natural mother\u2019s care. The children\u2019s father passed away in 1996. DPHHS requested the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>investigative authority based on a report that the mother and children were living in a trailer with very little food and no electricity, running water, or furniture. The report also indicated that the mother used alcohol and drugs in front of the children and attempted suicide on several occasions in the children\u2019s presence. DPHHS maintained that the children were either members or eligible for membership in the Little Shell Tribe and requested that the court furnish notice of the hearing to the tribe pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act (\u201cICWA\u201d). The District Court granted DPHHS\u2019s petition on October 12, 1999, and DPHHS arranged for the children to live with their maternal uncle in Pondera County, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b66 After obtaining extensions on the temporary investigative authority, DPHHS filed a Petition for Temporary Legal Custody over K.S., D.S., and C.S. on March 30, 2000. The petition did not implicate N.S., presumably because N.S. would attain the age of majority in April 2000. Following a hearing on the petition, the District Court declared the children youths in need of care and granted temporary legal custody of the children to DPHHS for a period of six months. Further, the District Court ordered the mother to complete a treatment plan which required her to: improve upon her parenting skills, maintain a chemically free lifestyle, provide adequate housing and a safe environment for the children, achieve a healthy mental status, maintain a relationship with the children while they remained in DPHHS\u2019s custody, and to cooperate fully with DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b67 On February 9, 2001, DPHHS petitioned the District Court to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to K.S., D.S., and C.S. and grant permanent legal custody of the children to it. DPHHS sought permanent custody based upon the length of time the children remained in foster care and the failure of the court-ordered treatment plan. After multiple hearings and continuances the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order on January 25, 2002. The court found that the mother \u201cdid not comply with or successfully complete the treatment plan\u201d and that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Therefore, the District Court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to K.S., D.S., and C.S. and granted permanent legal custody of the children to DPHHS, assigning to DPHHS the right to consent to the children\u2019s adoption. The mother appeals from the District Court\u2019s order of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b68  Determinations regarding an expert witness\u2019s qualifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and competency are within the discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>In re M.R.</em>G., 2003 MT 60, \u00b6 6, 314 Mont. 396, \u00b6 6, 66 P.3d 312, \u00b6 6. Further, a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary and we review that decision to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re J.W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6 7, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 7, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 7. In reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, we determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re C.B., </em>2001 MT 42, \u00b6 6, 304 Mont. 252, \u00b6 6, 20 P.3d 117, \u00b6 6. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re J.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it permitted Martina Heavy Runner to testify as an expert for purposes of the Indian Child Welfare Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b610 Throughout the proceedings, DPHHS maintained that the children were enrolled or enrollable members of the Little Shell Tribe. Despite the fact that the Little Shell Tribe has yet to gain federal recognition as an \u201cIndian tribe,\u201d the District Court concluded that the \u201cappropriate thing to do is to err on the side of caution and apply the ICWA standard ....\u201d Toward this end, DPHHS introduced Martina Heavy Runner as an expert witness. Over the mother\u2019s objection, the District Court permitted Heavy Runner to testify as an ICWA qualified expert witness. On appeal, the mother contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it accepted Heavy Runner as a qualified ICWA expert witness because she \u201chad absolutely no credentials to give such expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b611 Recently, in <em>In re M.R. </em>G., we looked to guidelines promulgated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for direction on expert witnesses for purposes of ICWA as ICWA itself does not define the term \u201cqualified expert witness.\u201d <em>See In re M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 10. Interestingly, <em>In re M.R.G. </em>presented the identical expert witness issue regarding the same expert, Heavy Runner. We noted that the guidelines provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">D.4. Qualified Expert Witnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">(a) Removal of an Indian child from his or her family must be based on competent testimony from one or more experts qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to speak specifically to the issue of whether continued custody by the parents or Indian custodians is likely to result in serious physical or emotional damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">(b) Persons with the following characteristics are most likely to meet the requirements for a qualified expert witness for purposes of Indian child custody proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">(i) A member of the Indian child\u2019s tribe who is recognized by the tribal community as knowledgeable in tribal customs as they pertain to family organization and childrearing practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(ii) A lay expert witness having substantial experience in the delivery of child and family services to Indians, and extensive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and childrearing practices within the Indian child\u2019s tribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">(iii) A professional person having substantial education and experience in the area of his or her specialty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">44 Fed.Reg. 67, 593 (1979). DPHHS does not indicate which provision of the above guidelines qualifies Heavy Runner as an ICWA expert witness for the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b612 For purposes of subpart b(iii) above, in addition to possessing \u201csubstantial education and experience in the area of his or her specialty,\u201d it is preferable that the witness possess expertise in, and substantial knowledge of, Indian culture, family structure, and childrearing practices. <em>In re M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 12. However, the witness does not have to possess knowledge of the cultural standards of a particular Indian tribe. <em>In re M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b613 Heavy Runner testified that she is a member of the Blackfeet Tribe. Heavy Runner stated that she has a full-blooded Little Shell aunt who related information about the Little Shell Tribe to her at a very young age. Heavy Runner maintained that she is familiar with Little Shell tribal customs pertaining to family organizations, child rearing, and social and cultural practices. At the time of trial, Heavy Runner worked as a family resource specialist for the State of Montana. Prior to that, she worked on numerous \u201cIndian child cases\u201d in varying professional capacities (child welfare specialist, social worker on an Indian reservation in Minnesota, adoption clerk on the Blackfeet Reservation, and teacher). Heavy Runner testified that she has provided family services to multiple Little Shell members in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u00b614  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that DPHHS sufficiently established Heavy Runner\u2019s personal and professional knowledge of Indian culture, family structure, and childrearing practices for purposes of ICWA\u2019s qualified expert witness requirement. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the District Court did not abuse its discretion in accepting Heavy Runner\u2019s expert testimony. Based on this conclusion, we need not address DPHHS\u2019s contention that IC WA should not apply based on the federally \u201cunrecognized\u201d status of the Little Shell Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b616 Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, provides that a court may terminate parental rights upon a finding that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">The mother does not dispute the court\u2019s findings that the children are youths in need of care. Further, the mother admits that \u201cnot all of the conditions of treatment were technically complied with.\u201d The mother contests the District Court\u2019s \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time\u201d finding, stating that she \u201cdemonstrated, repeatedly, the remarkable progress she had made in ending substance abuse and making herself more fit to parent. If anything, a complete turnaround was likely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u00b617 The court-approved treatment plan contained various goals and tasks. The plan, in part, required the mother to: complete parenting classes, enroll in a family based services program, obtain a chemical dependency evaluation, complete any recommended chemical dependency programs, submit to random urinalysis tests, maintain an appropriate residence, abstain from criminal activity, obtain mental health counseling, complete a gambling addiction evaluation, complete an anger management program, attend regularly scheduled visits with the children, and contact her social worker on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">\u00b618 At the termination hearing, Vickie Leigland, a community social worker for DPHHS, testified about the mother\u2019s compliance with the treatment plan. Leigland testified that the mother\u2019s cooperation level with the treatment plan has been \u201cextremely low.\u201d Leigland received no documentation regarding completion of parenting classes, the chemical dependency evaluation, or anger management classes. Leigland stated that the mother failed to contact her on a weekly basis and maintain contact with the children on a regular basis. Leigland testified that, \u201c[The mother] hasn\u2019t completed her treatment plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>There\u2019s still some of the same concerns, her anger, her unwillingness to admit that maybe she does have a problem. She tends to blame everyone else for her problems and doesn\u2019t take responsibility for what has happened.\u201d Based on these observations, Leigland concluded that the treatment plan was not successful, that the mother\u2019s conduct which renders her unable to parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and that termination of her parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b619 Coral Beck, supervisor of the intervention unit in Missoula, Montana, echoed Leigland\u2019s sentiment regarding the mother\u2019s compliance with the treatment plan. Beck indicated that the mother failed to: attend parenting classes, cooperate with the random urinalysis tests, maintain the appropriate level of sobriety, or comply with the crime-free mandate. Pamela Kay Johnson, a licensed clinical professional counselor who worked with K.S. from November 2000 to May 2001, testified that \u201cit is in [KS.\u2019s] best interest to remain outside the custody of her mother.\u201d Finally, for reasons discussed above, Heavy Runner testified that, in her opinion, the children should not be returned to their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b620 [4] Admittedly, the mother presented favorable testimony from friends, family, and professionals. However, because a termination of parental rights case is a non-jury matter, it is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence presented and ascertain the witnesses\u2019 corresponding credibility. <em>In re J.W. </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 46, 50, 757 P.2d 769, 771. Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. That is, substantial evidence supports the findings, the court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and we are not convinced that the court made a mistake. Further, the law presumes that termination is in the best interests of a child when that child has remained in foster care under the state\u2019s custody for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA. The mother does not dispute the fact that the children have been in foster care since October 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b621 [5] Given the evidence presented at trial, in conjunction with the presumption articulated in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to K.S., D.S., and C.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
