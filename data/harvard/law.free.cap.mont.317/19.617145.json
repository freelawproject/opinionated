We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it dismissed the State\u2019s information on the grounds that the time delay between the defendant\u2019s initial appearance and the filing of the information was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u00b63 On December 1, 2001, Clinton Ray Robison (Robison) was arrested and charged with burglary, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA. Robison appeared before the Justice of the Peace on December 3, 2001. At this initial appearance, Robison was advised of his rights and bail was set at $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">\u00b64 Eleven days later, on December 14, 2001, the Lake County Attorney\u2019s office, after obtaining leave from the District Court, filed an information charging Robison with burglary under \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA. The District Court continued bail in the amount of $10,000 and scheduled an arraignment for December 19, 2001. At that time, Robison moved to dismiss the information, arguing that the eleven days which had elapsed between his initial appearance and the filing of the information violated \u00a7 46-10-105, MCA. The District Court granted Robison\u2019s motion to dismiss on December 27, 2001. The State of Montana appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err when it dismissed the State\u2019s information on the ground that the time delay between the defendant\u2019s initial appearance and the filing of the information was unreasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b66 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. Diesen, </em>2000 MT 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 459, \u00b6 11, 992 P.2d 1287, \u00b6 11. However, we have held that a determination of a \u201creasonable time\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-10-105, MCA, is within the discretion of the district court. <em>State v. McElderry </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 365, 370, 944 P.2d 230, 233. The standard of review of discretionary trial court rulings in criminal cases is whether the trial court abused its discretion, and the reasonableness of the delay is a discretionary decision which is factually driven. <em>McElderry, </em>284 Mont. at 370, 944 P.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b67  Section 46-10-105, MCA, provides that in cases triable in the district court, the justice court shall hold a preliminary examination within a reasonable time after the defendant\u2019s initial appearance, unless one of the statutory exceptions exist, including, for purposes of this matter, the filing of an information in the district court. Dismissal of the charges is required if a preliminary examination is not conducted and a \u201creasonable time\u201d expires prior to the filing of an information in the district court. <em>McElderry, </em>284 Mont. at 368, 944 P.2d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b68 Robison\u2019s motion to dismiss cited a series of rulings by the District Court \u201cwhere a delay of more than 10 days resulted in Orders of dismissal with prejudice of the charges.\u201d In response, the State did not discuss the circumstances of the case, nor offer reasons for the time taken to file the information, but argued that the \u201cten (10) day rule for delay under the applicable reasonableness standard would appear arbitrary\u201d and that if Robison could not demonstrate prejudice, his motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s order indicated that \u201cthis Court advised the Lake County Attorney that any delay in excess of ten days will trigger an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay, and that the burden of showing reasonableness is upon the State as held by this Court in <em>McElderry.\u201d </em>Noting that the State had provided \u201cno factual basis for the Court to determine whether the Information was filed within a reasonable time,\u201d the District Court dismissed the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b610 In <em>McElderry, </em>this Court clearly held that no definite or \u201ctrigger\u201d deadlines are applicable in determining the reasonableness of the time taken to file an information. Explaining our previous discussion of this issue in <em>State v. Higley </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 412, 621 P.2d 1043, Justice Trieweiler wrote in <em>McElderry:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">Our intent in <em>Higley </em>was to demonstrate that even a ten-day delay, as proscribed by the federal statute, may not be unreasonable in Montana. This is evident in our discussion of <em>James v. Lawrence </em>(D.C. Cir. 1949), 176 F.2d 18, a case decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>pursuant to the previous federal rule which merely required a hearing in a reasonable time. There, we noted that eighteen days was not an unreasonable delay. <em>See James, </em>176 F.2d at 20. In another example of a standard similar to that used in Montana, we also noted in <em>Higley </em>the Alaska case of <em>Martinez v. State </em>(Alaska 1967), 423 P.2d 700, 710-11, in which the Alaska Supreme Court concluded that what constitutes a reasonable time must be determined by the facts of the case. In <em>Martinez, </em>a sixteen-day delay was found reasonable. <em>See Martinez, </em>423 P.2d at 710. We therefore concluded <em>in Higley </em>that <em>\u201ca </em>10-day delay in determining probable cause was not unreasonable.\u201d <em>Higley, </em>190 Mont at 420, 621 P.2d at 1048.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><em>McElderry, </em>284 Mont. at 370, 944 P.2d at 232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b611 The State correctly argues that the District Court\u2019s use of a ten-day deadline which automatically triggers an inquiry and places a burden upon the State to demonstrate reasonableness is not consistent with our holding in <em>McElderry. </em>We required no such consideration nor procedure. Indeed, Robison\u2019s motion to dismiss was grounded on reasoning which conflicts with McElderry: he simply argued that the District Court\u2019s standing ten-day rule had been violated, and made little effort to demonstrate that the delay under the circumstances was unreasonable, as was his burden in making the motion, except to note that his client had been incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b612 As we stated in <em>McElderry, a </em>reasonableness inquiry must be \u201cdetermined by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>McElderry, </em>284 Mont. at 370, 944 P.2d at 233. A reasonableness inquiry may include consideration of such factors as length of the delay, reasons for the delay, whether the defendant has been incarcerated or prejudiced, whether the defendant has counsel, the seriousness or complexity of the charge, and other relevant matters. Although the State argues that the District Court wrongly interpreted <em>McElderry </em>to mean \u201cthat prejudice to the defendant is not part of the inquiry,\u201d the State is incorrect in this regard. The District Court noted that Robison had been incarcerated during the time in question and found that he had sustained prejudice thereby, a proper consideration when determining reasonableness of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b613 On appeal, the State argues that the delay was reasonable under the circumstances, noting that an initial probable cause determination had been made by the Justice Court, that Robison had been advised of his rights, that an attorney had been appointed, bail set, and that Robison remained incarcerated because he could not make bail, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>because the State delayed in filing an information, thus undermining Robison\u2019s claim to have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b614 However, the reasonableness argument presented by the State on appeal was not presented in District Court. There, the State only offered an assertion that the District Court\u2019s ten-day rule was improper. Although that was assertion was correct, the State nonetheless failed to offer any evidence whatsoever from which the District Court could determine that the time taken to file the information was reasonable under the circumstances. In sum, the State simply failed to contest the issue of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b615  Consequently, while the District Court began its analysis improperly by applying a ten-day rule, we cannot say that it abused its discretion in determining that the time taken to file the information was unreasonable for purposes of \u00a7 46-10-105, MCA. The court found that Robison had been arrested on December 1, that he appeared in Justice Court on December 3, that he had been incarcerated since his arrest, and that this thirteen-day period of incarceration was prejudicial to Robison. The State\u2019s argument on appeal may well have prevailed in the District Court, but it was not made there. The District Court was left to determine if the delay in filing the information was reasonable without any facts from the State explaining why the delay occurred or was necessary. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the delay was not reasonable. \u201c[A] determination of a \u2018reasonable time\u2019 pursuant to \u00a7 46-10-105, MCA, is within the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>McElderry, </em>284 Mont. at 370, 944 P.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b616 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
