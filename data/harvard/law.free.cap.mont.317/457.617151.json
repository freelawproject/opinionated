Griffin subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief in which he alleged various claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court denied Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, and Griffin appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b64 Calvin Griffin was charged by information with 174 counts of sexual abuse of children, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA (1997). Griffin plead not guilty to all 174 counts on July 28,1999. On June 6, 2000, the Respondent, State of Montana, filed an amended information, charging Griffin with ten counts of sexual abuse of children. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Griffin plead guilty to the ten counts contained in the amended information on June 21,2000. Griffin was sentenced by the District Court on August 2, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b65 On June 13,2001, Griffin filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for post-conviction relief. Griffin\u2019s petition asserted various claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court denied Griffin\u2019s petition on November 5, 2001, stating that all of Griffin\u2019s claims were \u201cbarred, waived, or fail[ed] on the face of the Petition and the record.\u201d Griffin appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief on November 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b66 With his appeal pending, Griffin filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of supervisory control with this Court on May 14,2002. Griffin\u2019s petition alleged that, pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, his conviction was invalid. We issued an order on July 16, 2002, denying Griffin\u2019s petition for writ of supervisory control, and remanding Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief to the District Court for consideration of his <em>Ashcroft </em>claim. Upon remand, the District Court examined Griffin\u2019s <em>Ashcroft </em>claim and determined that it failed as a matter of law. Accordingly, the District Court returned the instant case to this Court, for disposition of Griffin\u2019s appeal, on September 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">\u00b67 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Porter v. State, </em>2002 MT 319, \u00b6 13, 313 Mont. 149, \u00b6 13, 60 P.3d 951, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in denying Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">\u00b69 On appeal, Griffin asserts that the District Court erred when it denied his petition for post-conviction relief. The State counters that because Griffin failed to advance evidence in support of his claims, the District Court properly dismissed his petition as a matter of law. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b610  A person requesting post-conviction relief has the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts justify relief. <em>State v. Peck </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 1, 3-4, 865 P.2d 304, 305. If a post-conviction petition fails to state a claim for relief, a district court may dismiss the petition as a matter of law. Section 46-21-20l(l)(a), MCA (1999). Section 46-21-104, MCA (1999), addresses the proper contents of a petition for post-conviction relief. Section 46-21-104, MCA (1999), provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">(1) The petition for post-conviction relief must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">(c) identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b611  In this case, Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief asserted claims of: (1) prosecutorial misconduct; (2) double jeopardy; (3) judicial bias, and (4) ineffective assistance of counsel. However, Griffin failed to bolster his claims with supporting evidence, as required by \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA (1999). That is, while Griffin made numerous factual allegations relating to his claims, he neglected to provide affidavits, records, or other evidence to support such allegations. We have stated that allegations in a petition for post-conviction relief do not constitute evidence. <em>State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, \u00b6 22, 296 Mont. 82, \u00b6 22, 988 P.2d 299, \u00b6 22. Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA (1999). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Griffin\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b612  Griffin further contends that he should have been granted an evidentiary hearing on his petition for post-conviction relief. However, such a hearing is not required. A district court is permitted to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief based solely upon the files and records ofthe case. See \u00a7 46-21-20l(l)(a), MCA(1999), and <em>Swearingen v. State, </em>2001 MT 10, \u00b6 7, 304 Mont. 97, \u00b6 7, 18 P.3d 998, \u00b6 7. Moreover, as we noted above, the allegations in Griffin\u2019s petition were not supported by any form of evidence. We have previously concluded that unsupported allegations are not sufficient to entitle a post-conviction petitioner to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Hanson, </em>\u00b6 22. Therefore, the District Court did not err in denying Griffin\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b613 Griffin also maintains that, pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, his conviction is invalid. Griffin was convicted under \u00a7 45-5-625, MCA (1997), which provides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(e) knowingly possesses any visual or print medium in which children are engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyM\">Griffin was discovered to be in possession of images of children engaged in sexual conduct. As such, Griffin was charged with, and convicted of, violating \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b614  In <em>Ashcroft, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)(B), which prohibited \u201cvirtual child pornography,\u201d was unconstitutional and overbroad. <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 241, 256, 122 S.Ct. at 1397, 1405. Consequently, Griffin asserts that pursuant to <em>Ashcroft, </em>\u00a7 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional, and his conviction is invalid. However, \u201cvirtual child pornography,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)(B), refers to images that are created <em>without </em>using actual children. <em>Ashcroft, </em>535 U.S. at 241-42, 122 S.Ct. at 1397. Griffin was convicted under \u00a7 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA (1997), which criminalizes the possession of visual or print medium in which <em>actual children </em>are engaged in sexual conduct. The District Court found that the images in Griffin\u2019s possession were \u201cclearly and obviously created by someone actually photographing real children engaging in actual sexual activities with other real children and/or with real adults.\u201d Therefore, neither the statute under which Griffin was convicted, nor Griffin\u2019s crimes, dealt with child pornography that was \u201cvirtual\u201d in nature. As such, the <em>Ashcroft </em>decision is inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b615 Finally, we note that Griffin\u2019s appellate brief contains an argument, regarding his eligibility for parole, which did not appear in either his petition for post-conviction relief or his petition for writ of supervisory control. Thus, Griffin raises this issue for the first time on appeal. We have repeatedly held that we will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 58, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 58, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 58. Accordingly, we decline to address Griffin\u2019s argument regarding his eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
