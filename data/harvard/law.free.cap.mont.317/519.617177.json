(VanDyke), contracted to construct a pipeline and widen a road for Stillwater Mining Company (Stillwater). VanDyke filed the underlying action after disputes arose concerning performance of the contracts. It now appeals from the order of the Sixth Judicial District Court, Sweet Grass County, which stayed litigation and compelled arbitration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue is whether the District Court erred when it concluded VanDyke waived its right to object to the arbitration provisions in its contracts with Stillwater. Because we hold the District Court did not err in its conclusion, we need not address the other arbitration-related issues such as ambiguity and mistake which VanDyke raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A3C\">\u00b63 In July of2001, VanDyke, a Montana corporation, and Stillwater, a Delaware corporation conducting mining operations in Montana, executed two construction contracts. Under one contract, VanDyke agreed to build a pipeline for Stillwater for $1,193,607. The second contract required VanDyke to widen a road for Stillwater for $139,030.</p>\n<p id=\"Ags\">\u00b64 Dining the fall of 2001, disputes developed between Stillwater and VanDyke regarding payment on, and performance of, the two contracts. Shortly thereafter, Stillwater terminated both contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">\u00b65 For purposes of the issue presented here, both contracts contain identical provisions. Both include title pages which state \u201c[Stillwater] and [VanDyke] have entered into this Contract based upon the following Contract Documents,\u201d then list the contract documents, including terms and conditions, special conditions, and exhibits. Special Condition 8 (also referred to as SC-8) of both contracts provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Following unsuccessful negotiations of senior executives as provided in the General Condition titled \u201cDISPUTES\u201d and notwithstanding the remainder of such clause, and for any other controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents or the breach thereof, (each a \u201cControversy\u201d), Controversies shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Construction Industry and Arbitration Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b66 On January 4, 2002, VanDyke\u2019s counsel wrote to Stillwater by certified mail in reference to the pipeline contract. The letter began, \u201cPursuant to SC-8 Arbitration of the Contract between [Stillwater] and [VanDyke], request is hereby made by [VanDyke] for Arbitration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>following matters[.]\u201d On January 16, VanDyke\u2019s counsel again wrote to Stillwater by certified mail, this time with reference to the road-widening contract. Again, the letter began with VanDyke\u2019s request for arbitration \u201c[p]ursuant to SC-8 Arbitration of the Contract.\u201d Both the January 4 and the January 16 letters ended with \u201cPlease contact the undersigned by [date] to coordinate the steps necessary to bring this case to Arbitration at an early date for the benefit of all parties.\u201d Stillwater\u2019s attorney responded by letter stating Stillwater did not wish to pursue arbitration at that time, but wanted to attempt to resolve the matter through non-binding mediation, \u201coutside of AAA, thus avoiding fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">\u00b67 On January 18, 2002, VanDyke\u2019s vice-president wrote Stillwater two letters rejecting settlement offers by Stillwater. In both letters, he acknowledged VanDyke\u2019s earlier request for arbitration, which he stated Stillwater had refused. He then set forth breakdowns of the amounts of money due VanDyke for work performed on the contracts and threatened \u201clegal steps and possible litigation\u201d if final payment was not processed expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b68 In a February 25, 2002 letter to Stillwater\u2019s counsel, VanDyke\u2019s attorney suggested possible dates for arbitration of the disputes. Another letter the following month related to lists of possible mediators and arbitrators. Finally, in an April 24, 2002 letter to Stillwater\u2019s counsel, VanDyke\u2019s counsel indicated his client was willing to draft the appropriate documents to initiate arbitration through the American Arbitration Association if further settlement negotiations and mediation were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b69 In May of 2002, Stillwater\u2019s director of project development, the president and vice-president of VanDyke and others, including both parties\u2019 counsel, met at the offices of Stillwater\u2019s counsel to discuss resolution of the disputes. The meeting was unsuccessful. VanDyke\u2019s owner later testified he told the Stillwater representatives at that meeting that VanDyke would not arbitrate and would \u201csee them in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b610 VanDyke filed this action two months later. On VanDyke\u2019s motion, the District Court initially stayed arbitration pending its determination of whether the court or the American Arbitration Association had jurisdiction of the dispute. After a hearing on VanDyke\u2019s motion to enjoin arbitration and Stillwater\u2019s motion to stay litigation and compel arbitration, the court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order. Based on its findings of fact, the court concluded the arbitration provision was neither ambiguous nor included in the contracts by mistake. The court further concluded that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>by insisting on arbitration, VanDyke had waived any legal objections it had to the arbitration provision. The court dissolved its previous stay of arbitration, stayed the underlying litigation, and compelled arbitration of all claims under the contracts. VanDyke appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b611 VanDyke does not appeal any of the factual findings of the District Court. Instead, it challenges the court\u2019s conclusions of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Kingston v. Ameritrade, Inc., </em>2000 MT 269, \u00b6 9, 302 Mont. 90, \u00b6 9, 12 P.3d 929, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it concluded VanDyke waived its right to object to the arbitration provisions in its contracts with Stillwater?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u00b613 In an argument raised for the first time on appeal, VanDyke asserts that because waiver of its right to object to arbitration \u201cis essentially a waiver of VanDyke\u2019s right to a jury trial,\u201d we should apply the test for waiver of a fundamental right, which must be made specifically, voluntarily and knowingly. <em>See State v. Howard, </em>2002 MT 276, \u00b6 12, 312 Mont. 359, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 1075, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u00b614 <em>Howard </em>involved a question concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel. It does not support VanDyke\u2019s assertion that waiver of its right to object to arbitration is essentially a waiver of the right to jury trial. Nor does it support addressing such a claim raised for the first time on appeal when no reason has been given for the failure to raise it earlier. <em>See Eddleman v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 52, \u00b6 11, 288 Mont. 50, \u00b6 11, 955 P.2d 646, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">\u00b615  Waiver is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, claim or privilege, which may be proved by express declarations or by a course of acts and conduct which induces the belief that the intent and purpose was waiver. <em>Tynes v. Bankers Life Co. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 350, 363, 730 P.2d 1115, 1123 (citation omitted). To establish a knowing waiver, the party asserting waiver must demonstrate the other party\u2019s knowledge of the existing right, acts inconsistent with that right, and resulting prejudice to the party asserting waiver. <em>Firestone v. Oasis Telecommunications, </em>2001 MT 297, \u00b6 18, 307 Mont. 469, \u00b6 18, 38 P.3d 796, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\u00b616 In this case, the record is clear that VanDyke had knowledge of its rights regarding arbitration and litigation through its attorney. The January 4 and January 16 letters from VanDyke\u2019s attorney requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>arbitration pursuant to the contracts were totally inconsistent with the right to object to the contract provisions requiring arbitration. The three subsequent letters from VanDyke\u2019s counsel to Stillwater-one each in February, March and April-sought to move the arbitration process along. These letters, too, are inconsistent with a right to object to the arbitration clauses in the contracts. Moreover, the subsequent delay in resolving this matter and the additional cost to Stillwater for having to defend the arbitration provisions in the District Court and in this appeal are clearly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">\u00b617 In arguing it did not waive its right to object to arbitration, VanDyke relies first on the letters its vice-president wrote to Stillwater dated January 18, 2002, which it characterizes as a reservation of the right to litigate, rather than arbitrate. We disagree. Notwithstanding the warning in the vice-president\u2019s letters of \u201clegal steps and possible litigation,\u201d nowhere in those letters did VanDyke object to arbitration and demand to litigate its disputes with Stillwater. Instead, the warning in the January 18 letters could be read as a threat to compel arbitration immediately as a \u201clegal step\u201d rather than to attempt further efforts to negotiate an acceptable resolution. This is especially true when the vice-president\u2019s letters are viewed in the context of the numerous other communications from VanDyke\u2019s counsel to Stillwater following termination of the contracts. Moreover, VanDyke\u2019s owner testified that, until the May 24, 2002 meeting with Stillwater, his company had intended to arbitrate the disputes. On this record, we conclude VanDyke\u2019s vice-president\u2019s January 18 letters do not amount to an objection to arbitration or a reservation of the right to litigate.</p>\n<p id=\"Akok\">\u00b618 VanDyke also relies on its owner\u2019s statement at the May 24,2002 meeting with Stillwater representatives that VanDyke would \u201csee you in court.\u201d The \u201csee you in court\u201d statement was made in the context of overall settlement negotiations. Moreover, that comment was simply too late to revoke VanDyke\u2019s earlier multiple written waivers of objection to arbitration pursuant to the contracts and the owner\u2019s later testimony that-prior to the May meeting-it had intended to arbitrate the disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b619  We hold the District Court correctly concluded that VanDyke waived its right to object to the arbitration provisions in the contracts. On that basis, we hold the court did not err in compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"AXi\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
