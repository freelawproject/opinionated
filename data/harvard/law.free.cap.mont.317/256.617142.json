She alleged that her ex-husband, David Crone (David), failed to comply with the District Court\u2019s previous order to pay his share of medical expenses not covered by health insurance. The District Court found that David failed to fulfill his obligation and ordered that he pay delinquent child support, reimburse Cindy for medical insurance payments, and pay Cindy\u2019s attorney fees. David appeals from that order. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it determined that David was not entitled to indemnity pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-822(4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not consider David\u2019s request to modify his child support obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err when it found David in contempt?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">\u00b67 David and Cindy had three children in the years following their marriage. However, in 1986, the Crones\u2019 marriage was dissolved. The decree of dissolution required that Cindy provide medical insurance for their children and pay any uninsured medical expenses. David was required to pay child support and dental and ocular expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">\u00b68 In June of 1999, David and Cindy\u2019s oldest child, who had reached the age of majority in February of 1999, graduated from high school. David then reduced his child support payment from $525 per month to $350. Thereafter, Cindy filed a motion to modify David\u2019s child support obligation to reflect changes in circumstances that had occurred in the thirteen years since the dissolution of their marriage. According to her affidavit, one of their children suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>emotional problems that required extensive medical treatment. Cindy requested the District Court to order David to pay his share of uncovered health-related medical expenses consistent with current law, as is reflected in the Medical Support Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b69 On February 28, 2000, the District Court ordered that David pay $345.50 per month for each of the two minor children. Cindy was ordered to obtain and maintain medical insurance. The order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae6\">2. Petitioner shall obtain and maintain a medical and hospitalization insurance policy covering the children during their minorities, for so long as same is available to her through her employment, or her spouse\u2019s employment, and the parties shall divide all uncovered health-related costs and deductibles such that Petitioner pays 21% thereof and Respondent pays 79% thereof, as reflective of their respective share of combined available income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b610 At the time, Cindy and her two minor children were covered by her second husband\u2019s health insurance through his employer. The medical coverage was subject to a $250 deductible per person and provided 80/20 coverage. In December she and her husband divorced and she lost that health coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b611 Immediately following the divorce, Cindy obtained health insurance for herself and the children through her employer, Bitney Furniture. The coverage was subject to a $2,000 deductible per person and provided 60/40 coverage. Cindy was covered pursuant to her employment with Bitney Furniture until March of2002, when she left that employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b612 Then, the medical coverage for the two children lapsed until Cindy secured health insurance through her new employment with The Home Depot on June 26, 2002. Cindy did not personally notify David of the changes in health insurance coverage because relations between the two were strained. However, Cindy maintained that her insurance agent provided David with copies of all of the medical bills related to the children. David testified that he was not aware of the changes in insurers and insurance lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b613 On March 13,2002, Cindy filed a petition in which she requested that the District Court hold David in contempt for his failure to fulfill his child support and unpaid medical expense obligation. The motion was supported by an affidavit and copies of medical expenses that Cindy had incurred on the children\u2019s behalf. David responded that Cindy had not previously informed him of the alleged medical expenses. He farther alleged that Cindy failed to maintain medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>insurance and thus, pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-822, MCA, she was not entitled to any contribution from him. He demanded indemnity from these expenses for the children\u2019s medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b614 The District Court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">3. Throughout the times relevant hereto, Petitioner was required to provide health insurance coverage for the minor children and she did so through her subsequent, now-former, husband\u2019s employment until their marriage was dissolved. Thereafter, she had insurance coverage available to her through her employer until she was terminated from such employment and the children were since insured through her current employer, though there were a few months during which she did not have insurance available to her. While Petitioner did not provide written notification of the absence of insurance for such period or of a change in insurers due to her dissolution and employment changes, Respondent was nevertheless aware of same and did not obtain alternative insurance for the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">4. Although Respondent now contends that he should be excused from his obligation to contribute to his children\u2019s health care costs because of such lack of notice, the change in coverage and then the absence of same for a limited period of time was unavoidable by Petitioner; moreover, the costs incurred which might have been paid by alternative insurance coverage is speculative at best and only a small portion thereof was incurred during the limited period when no insurance was available; and finally, the Court is not inclined to interpret a statute intended to assure medical support for children in such a way as to excuse a parent from his obligation to provide same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b615 On December 16,2002, the District Court ordered that David pay four months of disputed child support and his portion of uncovered medical expenses. It also awarded Cindy attorney fees. David appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b616 A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Albrecht v. </em>Albrecht, 2002 MT 227, \u00b6 8, 311 Mont. 412, \u00b6 8, 56 P.3d 339, \u00b6 8. We consider: (1) whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, whether the court misapprehended the effect of that evidence; and (3) where there is substantial evidence that has not been misapprehended, whether this Court is left with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 8. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b617  We review a district court\u2019s award or modification of a child support award to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Syverson </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 1, 9, 931 P.2d 691, 696. A district court\u2019s award of attorney fees is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Pfeifer v. Pfeifer </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 461, 465, 938 P.2d 684, 687. Whether the district court abused its discretion considers whether the court acted \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in a substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b618 Did the District Court err when it determined that David was not entitled to indemnity pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-822(4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b619 David asserts that the District Court erred when it found that he was aware of the change and subsequent lapse in medical coverage. He maintains that the District Court failed to give effect to the clear statutory provisions of \u00a7 40-5-822(4)(b), MCA, requiring written notice. He argues that Cindy has the obligation to indemnify him from any further liability for the costs of uncovered medical care provided to their children because he did not receive written notice of the change in, and lapse of, medical coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u00b620 When interpreting statutes, this Court\u2019s only function is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2002 MT 263, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 249, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 387, \u00b6 14. When we interpret a statute we determine legislative intent based on the plain and ordinary language used by the Legislature whenever possible. <em>Contreras v. Fitzgerald, </em>2002 MT 208, \u00b6 14, 311 Mont. 257, \u00b6 14, 54 P.3d 983, \u00b6 14. This Court must reasonably and logically interpret statutory language in a manner giving words their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Contreras, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b621 The enforcement provision of the Medical Support Reform Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">(4) An obligated parent who defaults on a medical support order by failing to obtain individual insurance or a health benefit plan or who permits the individual insurance or plan coverage to lapse without securing a comparable replacement is liable for all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>child\u2019s medical expenses and shall indemnify the other parent, the department, or the third-party custodian for the cost of obtaining health benefit coverage and for all medical expenses of the child. The obligated parent may be relieved of liability by proving to the satisfaction of the tribunal that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">(a) no reasonable-cost or cost-beneficial individual insurance coverage or health benefit plan was available for the child during the period of time involved and the other parent, the department, or the third-party custodian has received notice of the nonavailability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">(b) the individual insurance coverage or plan ceased to be available for reasons wholly unrelated to the conduct of the obligated parent, replacement coverage has not been available, and timely written notice of the nonavailability has been given to the other parent, the department, or the third-party custodian; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">(c) the other parent or third-party custodian has obtained health coverage for the child and all parties have entered into an enforceable written agreement to share the costs of the coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Section 40-5-822(4)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b622 Cindy was ordered to \u201cobtain and maintain a medical and hospitalization insurance policy covering the children during their minorities, for so long as same is available to her through her employment, or her spouse\u2019s employment....\u201d Immediately following issuance of the order, Cindy complied with the order and the children were covered by her then husband\u2019s insurance. Therefore, Cindy did not fail to obtain the ordered medical coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b623 The record indicates that the insurance available through Cindy\u2019s second husband terminated around December of2000. That insurance carried a $250 deductible and 80/20 coverage. Then, the children became insured pursuant to Cindy\u2019s medical insurance provided by Bitney Furniture. However, this insurance carried a $2,000 deductible and 60/40 coverage. The court did not find, nor would anything suggest such coverage was \u201ccomparable.\u201d When Cindy\u2019s employment with Bitney Furniture terminated she secured employment with The Home Depot. However, medical insurance temporarily lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">\u00b624  Consequently, Cindy is required by \u00a7 40-5-822(4), MCA, to indemnify David for health care costs for the children unless she has satisfied one of the statutory exemptions found in \u00a7\u00a7 40-5-822(4)(a), (b), or (c), MCA, because she permitted the children\u2019s medical insurance to lapse without securing comparable insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\u00b625 Section 40-5-822(4)(a), MCA, provides that a parent may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>relieved of liability if no reasonable-cost or cost-beneficial insurance or health plan is available during the lapse, so long as the other parent is on notice of the lapse. However, the District Court did not find that no reasonable-cost or cost-beneficial insurance was available. Therefore, subsection (a) does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b626 Section 40-5-822(4)(b), MCA, specifically addresses the circumstances of this case. The District Court found that the original coverage ordered by the court became unavailable to Cindy for reasons outside of her control. With that much of its findings we agree. However, Cindy was statutorily required to provide David with written notice of the change in insurance policies and the ultimate lapse in coverage. While the court found that David was aware of the change, the record indicates that he did not receive written notice of the change as required. Therefore, Cindy is not excluded by the provisions of subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b627 Finally, \u00a7 40-5-822(4)(c), MCA, excuses an obligated parent from liability for a lapse in medical coverage where the parties have entered into an enforceable agreement to share the cost of the coverage. In this case no such agreement was entered into by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b628  Therefore, because the written notice required by \u00a7 40-5-822(4)(b), MCA, was not given, we conclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the statute does not require Cindy to indemnify David for expenses he may have incurred as a result of the change and subsequent lapse in insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b629 However, David has consistently maintained in the District Court and on appeal that he has no obligation to pay any medical costs incurred for the children subsequent to the date when the insurance Cindy had through her second husband lapsed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b630  In the context of an agreement, indemnity is defined as a contract by which one engages to save another from the legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties. Section 28-11-301, MCA. Indemnity is an obligation by one party to make another whole for a loss that the other party has incurred. <em>PPG Indus., Inc. v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(Cal. 1999), 975 P.2d 652, 657. In Montana, an obligation to indemnify exists where one who is compelled to pay money which, injustice, another ought to pay, the former may receive from the latter sums so paid. <em>EBI/Orion Group v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 99, 104, 782 P.2d 1276, 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b631  Section 40-5-822(4), MCA, does not provide that Cindy must pay all such expenses. Rather, it requires that she indemnify David, making him whole. Upon proof of the amount owed, Cindy would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>required to pay David for any additional medical costs he incurred on behalf of the children to the extent that those payments were in excess of what his ordered obligation would have been had Cindy maintained insurance pursuant to her second husband\u2019s coverage. However, apparently relying on his erroneous interpretation of the law, David presented no evidence to the District Court of the additional amount he claimed he would be forced to pay because of the change in, or lapse of, health care insurance for the children. Considering this complete lack of proof, the District Court was correct in finding costs incurred which might have been paid by alternative insurance coverage are speculative. The District Court was left with a record in which Cindy presented evidence which showed to the penny how much David was obligated to pay and had nothing from which to determine an amount that should be deducted. Under these circumstances we will not hold that the District Court erred in ordering David to pay his share of the health care costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b632 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to consider David\u2019s request to modify his child support obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b633 David contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to consider his request to modify child support. He argues that, because the court ordered a hearing on all issues before Cindy withdrew her motion to modify, the court was required to consider the evidence he presented at trial. However, he cites no authority for this proposition. In response, Cindy maintains that her motion to modify child support, which was the only motion to modify actually before the court, was properly withdrawn and, therefore, was not an issue properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b634 Cindy filed a motion for modification of child support on February 19, 2002, which was supported by an affidavit and the requisite financial information. David filed a financial affidavit but did not file a formal response to that motion. On May 23, 2002, Cindy withdrew her motion. David did not object to her withdrawal and did not file an independent motion for modification of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b635 The District Court formally recognized only the motion for contempt at the hearing. It stated: \u201c[T]he motion for modification was withdrawn on May 23rd.... Okay. So what we\u2019re hearing today, then, is the contempt motion, to which you [David] have responded.\u201d David argued that he had experienced a substantial change in circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and requested permission to present evidence concerning the modification of child support despite the fact that Cindy had withdrawn her motion. In response the court stated: \u201cOkay. Well, we will see where we get.\u201d The court\u2019s order makes no reference to child support modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b636 A plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss his or her own claim without an order of the court when notice is filed before the adverse party files an answer or motion for summary judgment on that claim. Rule 41(a), M.R.Civ.P. Although Rule 41 does not specifically address withdrawal of a motion to modify child support, it is nonetheless applicable to the present case. Cindy notified both the court and David that she was withdrawing her motion for modification before David filed a response with the court. Consequently, we conclude that her motion was properly withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b637 With respect to David\u2019s request that the District Court consider evidence his circumstances had changed, Rule 7(b), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in part, that a motion for an order from the court shall \u201cstate with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.\u201d While David\u2019s counsel made a general request that the District Court modify his child support obligation, he did not state with particularity the grounds for the motion. In fact, counsel requested that the court consider evidence pursuant to Cindy\u2019s withdrawn motion. He did not move the court to consider an independent motion on David\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b638  We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion under these circumstances when it did not consider David\u2019s request for child support modification because the issue was not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b639 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b640 David maintains that the District Court improperly awarded attorney fees to Cindy pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA. He argues that \u00a7 40-5-824(7), MCA, required the court to find that his response was filed frivolously or in bad faith to award attorney fees pursuant to the Medical Support Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b641 Section 40-5-824(7), MCA, provides in part: \u201cIf the tribunal finds that the conduct, claim, or response of a party was frivolous or in bad faith, the tribunal may impose sanctions against the party including an award of costs and attorney fees.\u201d However, that section relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>expedited enforcement procedures, which this was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b642 Section 40-4-110, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">(1) The court from time to time, after considering the financial resources of both parties, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under chapters 1 and 4 and for professional fees, including sums for legal and professional services rendered and costs incurred prior to the commencement of the proceeding or after entry of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Section 40-4-204, MCA, provides a court with the authority and guidelines for issuing child support orders and \u201corders to address health insurance.\u201d Consequently, we conclude the District Court considered the proper statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b643  This Court applies a three prong approach in deciding whether attorney fees are appropriate. <em>Pfeifer, </em>282 Mont. at 466, 938 P.2d at 687. The award must be: (1) based on necessity; (2) reasonable; and (3) based on competent evidence. <em>Pfeifer, </em>282 Mont. at 466, 938 P.2d at 687. Facts considered in determining necessity are: (1) the requesting party\u2019s inability to pay his or her own attorney fees; (2) the other party\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees; and (3) the relative financial positions of the parties. <em>In re Marriage of Bee, </em>2002 MT 49, \u00b6 42, 309 Mont. 34, \u00b6 42, 43 P.3d 903, \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b644 In the present case, the District Court concluded: \u201cFor the reasons above set forth in Finding of Fact No. 7 and as provided by Section 40-4-110, M.C.A., Respondent should pay Petitioner\u2019s attorney fees and costs reasonably and necessarily incurred in this matter.\u201d In Finding of Fact No. 7, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">As a direct result of Respondent\u2019s above-found failures of compliance with previous Orders in this matter, Petitioner has been required to retain counsel in order to pursue the instant Motion and has thus requested that Respondent be Ordered to pay her attorney fees and costs reasonably and necessarily incurred for such purpose; and such request is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u00b645  The court\u2019s findings of fact do not indicate that it considered the parties\u2019 financial resources when it determined that attorney fees were appropriate. Neither was there evidence on the amount of such fees nor a finding that such fees were reasonable. Consequently, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it awarded Cindy attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b646 Did the District Court err when it found David in contempt?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b647 David alleges the District Court committed an error when it found him in contempt of court. The District Court stated in part, \u201cthe Court declines to find [David] in contempt at this time ....\u201d As no such order finding David in contempt was entered, we will not consider this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b648 Therefore, we reverse the award of attorney fees to Cindy and affirm the remainder of the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
