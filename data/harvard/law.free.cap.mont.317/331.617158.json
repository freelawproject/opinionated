Daniels (Daniels) with one count of felony robbery in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. After a jury trial, Daniels was convicted and the court sentenced Daniels to 45 years in prison with 10 years suspended. Daniels appeals his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the State\u2019s comments during closing argument constitute plain error?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court commit plain error when it permitted Alfred Joe Smith (Smith) to testify during Daniels\u2019 trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court commit plain error when it gave Jury Instruction #6?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">\u00b66 4. Was Daniels\u2019 counsel ineffective for his alleged failure to interview potential defense witnesses and for his failure to object to certain evidence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">\u00b67 On or about February 18,2000,16-year-old Cole Tolliver (Tolliver) and his friend Gary Houser (Houser) were driving together after leaving a mutual friend\u2019s house at 11 p.m. in Great Falls. The pair decided to stop at Keith\u2019s Country Store to purchase something to drink. Tolliver pulled into the store parking lot and parked in the rear of the store. Houser went inside and Tolliver followed, but returned to his car when he realized he left his money there.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">\u00b68 As Tolliver collected the money, two young men exited a nearby vehicle. One of the young men, who Tolliver later identified as Daniels, pointed a laser-sighted handgun at Tolliver and ordered him to get on the ground and give him all of his money. Tolliver got down and gave the money to him. Daniels took the money, and the two perpetrators returned to their car. The second man, who Tolliver later identified as Smith, visibly displayed a police scanner and warned Tolliver to not call the police or he would be killed. The men then drove away from the store and Tolliver did not obtain identification plate numbers for the assailants\u2019 vehicle. Houser returned from the store, and Tolliver told Houser about the assault as they drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00b69 Later that evening, Tolliver returned home and told his parents about the robbery. Tolliver\u2019s parents insisted that he report the robbery to the police, but no one actually reported the robbery initially. Two days after the robbery, Tolliver went with his mother and reported the incident to the police. At the police station, Tolliver gave a description of the perpetrators to Officer Tito Rodriguez. Rodriguez then provided Tolliver with photos of potential suspects, and Tolliver identified Daniels and Smith as the perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b610 The Great Falls Police Department began searching for Daniels and Smith and considered them armed and dangerous. On February 21,2000, Officers Hollis and Wells observed Daniels and Smith at the Holiday Village Mall. When Daniels and Smith saw the officers, they immediately left the mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b611 On February 22, 2000, Detective Don Scheele (Scheele) met with Macedonia Mondragon (Mondragon). According to Scheele, Mondragon told him that she had seen Daniels and Smith with a laser-sighted pistol and a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b612 On February 25, 2000, police apprehended Smith. Initially, he provided no statement to police. However, on September 14, 2000, Smith admitted that Daniels was with him during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b613 On February 29, 2000, police, acting on a tip that Daniels was hiding at Lisa Cole\u2019s (Cole) house, contacted Cole by telephone and requested permission to search her home. Cole agreed to the search and police arrived and searched her house. Police discovered Daniels, who was hiding inside a couch, and arrested him. At the time, Daniels denied his identity, stated his name was Moe, and stated the tattoo on his shoulder with the initials M.D. actually showed M.O. However, Daniels indicated to police that he had ingested drugs before the officers arrived and he started to vomit. The officers called an ambulance. Daniels was taken to the hospital, treated, and later released into police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b614 In custody, officers provided Daniels with a warning against self-incrimination, and Daniels decided to talk with the officers. Daniels stated that he was at the store with Jerri Matye (Matye), a friend, in a different car than Smith. He stated that Smith was also at the store in another car. Daniels said that Tolliver approached him outside the store and asked him to buy some beer for him, but Daniels declined the request because he was not old enough to buy beer. Daniels said that Tolliver then walked over to Smith\u2019s car and presumably made a similar request, at which point Tolliver gave Smith his money and then raised his hands as if being held at gunpoint. Daniels said he saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Smith drive away from the store parking lot. At that point, Daniels told Matye to leave the area, and Matye drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b615 In September 2000, Smith pled guilty to Tolliver\u2019s robbery. As part of the plea agreement, Smith agreed to provide a tape-recorded statement regarding the events of the robbery and agreed to testify truthfully against Daniels. Smith provided a statement and testified against Daniels at his first trial. He also testified at bis change of plea hearing regarding his participation in the robbery. Smith testified that Daniels was present at the robbery, held a handgun, and demanded the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b616 Daniels pled not guilty and the case went to jury trial on September 18 to 20, 2000. The first trial resulted in a hung jury. A retrial was held February 20 to 21,2001. At the second trial, the State called Smith to testify. Smith testified that his prior testimony regarding Daniels\u2019 involvement in the crime was false in that the actual person who was with Smith at the time of the robbery was his cousin John Bearstone. Smith testified that John Bearstone, not Daniels, was responsible for the crime. Smith described John Bearstone as a Native American, 19 or 20 years old, six feet tall, with black hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b617 The State then cross-examined Smith using his prior statements. The State also presented other testimony to rebut Smith\u2019s statements. Detective Beecroft testified that Smith had never previously mentioned John Bearstone\u2019s name when he talked to the police, and that after some investigation, Beecroft was unable to locate or identify any person by the name of John Bearstone. Beecroft did admit, however, that if John Bearstone lived outside of Great Falls or had no criminal record, he would probably not know who John Bearstone was. \u00b618 After the State rested, Daniels did not call any witnesses. During closing argument, the prosecutor discussed Smith\u2019s change of testimony and the existence of \u201cJohn Bearstone,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">Now [Smith\u2019s] got motive to try [to] implicate somebody who doesn\u2019t exist because he knows [we] can\u2019t go after an imaginary person. John Bearstone is general for Alfred Smith. It\u2019s convenient that he just mentioned his name for the first time today....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">[John Bearstone\u2019s] an imaginary person ... Detective Beecroft who\u2019s been the follow-up aversion on this case, looked for a John Bearstone, 19 or 20 years old, Native American male on the Blackfeet reservation. That\u2019s the reservation we got from Alfred Smith on the stand. There is no such person. We didn\u2019t find any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>such person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">Detective Beecroft works in narcotics, he knows the gangs. He knows the people in the gangs, knows their gang members and he knows who they associate with. That\u2019s his job, ladies and gentlemen. If this person were real, wouldn\u2019t you think that Detective Beecroft would have at least heard this name before?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Q\">Daniels\u2019 counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b619 The jury found Daniels guilty. Daniels now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b620 [1] Where the defendant raises the plain error doctrine to request our review of issues that were not objected to at the district court level, our review is discretionary. <em>State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 25, 316 Mont. 263, \u00b6 25, 71 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 25. In <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">[T]his Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The plain error doctrine is to be employed sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to the narrow circumstances articulated in <em>Finley. Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215. In order to determine the applicability of the plain error doctrine, we consider the totality of circumstances of each case. <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 31, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 268, \u00b6 12, 975 P.2d 321, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\u00b621 We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel following the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 20, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 20. Under the standard, a defendant must show both that the counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this performance prejudiced the defense and denied the defendant a fair trial such that the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 20. We presume counsel\u2019s performance was effective. <em>State v. Niederklopfer, </em>2000 MT 187, \u00b6 19, 300 Mont. 397, \u00b6 19, 6 P.3d 448, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00b622  We review jury instructions in criminal cases to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 15, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 15. A district court has broad discretion when issuing instructions to the jury, and in order to constitute reversible error, the instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b623 1. Did the State\u2019s comments during closing argument constitute plain error?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b624 Daniels contends his trial was fundamentally unfair due to the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument regarding John Bearstone. Specifically, Daniels asserts the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of Detective Beecroft and attacked the credibility of Smith. In addition, Darnels contends the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the existence or non-existence of JohnBearstone were outside of the scope of evidence presented and constituted vouching to the extent the prosecutor informed the jury which version of facts he knew to be true. Daniels further contends the State\u2019s cross examination of Smith regarding his agreement to testify truthfully also constituted prosecutorial vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b625 The State contends that Daniels failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments at trial, and that, therefore, Daniels must demonstrate plain error to constitute reversible error. The State further contends Daniels has not shown, even if in error, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments would reach a level of manifest miscarriage of justice or show any fundamental unfairness at the trial. In addition, the State contends the prosecutor\u2019s comments were appropriate comments on the evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b626  We agree with the State. Although it is improper for the prosecution to comment on evidence not in the record or to offer personal opinions regarding the credibility of a witness, it is proper \u201cto comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Further, as mentioned, we will not review a claim that was not properly preserved for appeal unless it constitutes plain error. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b627  In this case, our review of the record indicates Daniels fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>demonstrate the prosecutor\u2019s comments amounted to any error, much less a fundamental unfairness resulting in plain error. Accordingly, Daniels does not meet the narrow criteria required and we decline to invoke our discretionary plain error review. <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b628 We also note here that we will not set a precedent of presenting full analysis whenever a party asserts that an issue not properly preserved for appeal constitutes plain error. Such an approach would defeat the rule requiring an argument to be preserved for appeal and would allow a party to make virtually any argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b629 2. Did the District Court commit plain error when it permitted Smith to testify during Daniels\u2019 trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b630 Daniels next contends that Smith\u2019s testimony was so inconsistent as to render it highly unreliable and as a result, Daniels\u2019 conviction was fundamentally unfair. He argues Smith\u2019s testimony at either trial is so inherently untrustworthy that it should not have been allowed as evidence to support a conviction. Daniels relies on <em>State v. White Water </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 85, 89-90, 634 P.2d 636, 638-39, for his proposition that unreliable evidence cannot serve as basis for a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b631 The State contends this testimony was not objected to and that this argument is raised for the first time on appeal. Therefore, the State once again points out this issue cannot justify a reversal of the conviction without plain error. The State also contends the use of Smith\u2019s prior testimony was permissible pursuant to Rule 801, M.R.Evid. Further, the State points out that even assuming Smith\u2019s statements were inherently unreliable, Tolliver\u2019s direct testimony also supported the conclusion that Daniels committed the robbery so Daniels\u2019 conviction was not solely based on Smith\u2019s prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b632  Again, we agree with the State and note there was no fundamental unfairness such that plain error applies. Because Smith\u2019s testimony at the second trial was inconsistent, the State was entitled to point out these inconsistencies to the jury under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), M.R.Evid. Which version of Smith\u2019s testimony to believe was for the jury. Because there was other testimony pointing to Daniels as the perpetrator of the robbery, the rule from <em>White Water </em>regarding prior inconsistent statements does not apply. Again, there is no error, much less plain error, in presenting different stories of the same witness for a jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b633 3. Did the District Court commit plain error when it gave Jury Instruction #6?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u00b634 Daniels contends the District Court erred when it read Jury Instruction #6 to the jury and therefore violated his right to a fair trial. Specifically, Daniels contends the text of the instruction, which instructed the jury to view with distrust the testimony of one legally accountable for the same crime, i.e. Smith\u2019s testimony, could be construed to instruct the jury to view with distrust Daniels\u2019 exculpatory statements to police officers immediately after his arrest since he implicated Smith in his statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b635 The State contends that while Daniels objected to the instruction at trial, the reason given the trial court for the objection was that Smith\u2019s testimony had changed and was no longer inculpatory, thereby negating any need for the instruction. Thus, the State asserts Daniels should not now be able to argue against the instruction under a new theory that was not presented to the District Court. Again, the State asserts plain error does not apply. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b636  A party may not change their theory on appeal from that advanced in the district court. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 454, 458, 877 P.2d 1013, 1016. In order to constitute the plain error required for reversal in this case, the instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights such that there is a manifest miscarriage of justice or a fundamental unfairness. Again, our review of the record indicates that no error occurred here at all and we decline to invoke our discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b637 Before we turn to the final issue, we note that Daniels contends his counsel was ineffective for failing to object as necessary to preserve the above arguments. However, as discussed above, our review of the record indicates that none of those issues amount to error, let alone plain error. Ergo, Daniels\u2019 counsel was not ineffective regarding those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b638 4. Was Daniels\u2019 counsel ineffective for his alleged failure to interview potential defense witnesses and for his failure to object to certain evidence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b639 Daniels now contends his counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate and interview certain witnesses in order to present a case in chief. Daniels contends his counsel failed to interview Matye to confirm a potential alibi and failed to interview Houser to show Tolliver\u2019s story was not credible. Daniels also contends that his counsel was ineffective for not interviewing Smith prior to trial to discover that he would be changing his story. Daniels further contends that his counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to questioning regarding comments made to Tolliver by friends and others that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>suggested a threat of harm to Tolliver if he pursued charges against Daniels. In addition, Daniels contends his counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to the testimony of several witnesses who made comments unrelated to the current charges but instead implied that Daniels was a dangerous person, a gang member, and a drug user. Daniels contends that the record suggests there was no legitimate purpose for the presentation of this testimony except to show that Daniels was of bad character, in violation of Rule 404, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b640 The State contends Daniels cannot demonstrate on direct appeal that his counsel\u2019s actions were not objectively reasonable or that there was a reasonable probability that his counsel\u2019s errors caused a prejudicial result. Therefore, the State asserts Daniels\u2019 conviction must be affirmed. We agree, with the caveat that some of Daniels\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claims cannot be properly reviewed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b641 In analyzing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we must first consider whether the record is sufficient to determine whether counsel was ineffective. \u201c[WJhere ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal and, conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, those claims must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 12, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 12, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 12). We stated: \u201cThe underlying principle of the foregoing rule is that a silent record cannot rebut the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance... Absent a complete record, this Court will not speculate on counsel\u2019s alleged errors.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b642 In <em>White, </em>we held that the operative test is whether or not the record contains the answer as to why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20. However, we also noted that failing to adequately investigate is usually a non-record based claim. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18. In contrast, we also noted that failure to object to testimony is generally record-based and appropriate for direct appeal. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b643 With respect to Daniels\u2019 first contention that his counsel failed to interview and determine the potential testimony of Matye, Houser, and Smith, the record here is insufficient to show why Daniels\u2019 counsel did not call these people as witnesses. With the present record, we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>only speculate as to what investigation Daniels\u2019 counsel undertook or why he made the decisions he made. Therefore, we cannot conclude, pursuant to the test set forth in <em>Strickland, </em>that Daniels\u2019 counsel was ineffective on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b644 In contrast, regarding Daniels\u2019 claims that his counsel failed to properly object to certain testimony, we conclude the present record provides adequate information to review Daniels\u2019 claims on direct appeal. We further conclude that Daniels\u2019 counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. As to Tolliver\u2019s testimony that he received threats from others due to his report to police regarding the robbery, the record shows that Tolliver was adequately cross-examined by Daniels\u2019 counsel. Upon cross-examination by Daniels\u2019 counsel, Tolliver admitted that no one made any direct threats. In fact, Tolliver testified the threats were generalized warnings from friends and peers ofTolliver\u2019s. On redirect, Tolliver further conceded that neither Daniels nor Smith made any threats to Tolliver aside from the time of the alleged robbery. Defense counsel\u2019s approach to Tolliver\u2019s testimony fits well within the accepted practices of trial attorneys, and nothing suggests the jury would have reached a different verdict on the basis of Tolliver\u2019s testimony regarding the warnings from friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b645 [7] We also conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to object to comments regarding Daniels being considered armed or implying Daniels was a gang member or drug user did not constitute ineffective assistance. We have held counsel is not ineffective for failing to object to testimony that is properly admissible. <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 108. In this case, although Daniels asserts the objectionable testimony was only admitted for the purpose of showing his bad character, the record demonstrates otherwise. Instead, the record demonstrates the testimony Daniels refers to was proper evidence establishing the occupations of the investigating officers and the process involved in apprehending Daniels for the charged crime. Specifically, evidence that Daniels attempted to evade arrest, including that he fled the shopping mall, that he hid in a couch, and that he gave a false name, was properly admissible as circumstantial evidence showing consciousness of guilt. <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Simply because otherwise properly admissible evidence might imply Daniels was of bad character does not mean the evidence is objectionable. Therefore, Rule 404, M.R.Evid., is not even applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b646 In addition, Daniels provides no citations to where Daniels was directly referred to as a \u201cgang member.\u201d Rather, Daniels objects to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>implications that could be taken from the testimony. Such implications are for the jury to assess. Finally, with respect to comments by witnesses that Daniels was armed or considered \u201carmed and dangerous,\u201d these comments were corroborated with testimony by Stacey Parrish (Parrish) that Daniels had a gun in Parrish\u2019s home on or about February 18, 2000, and a statement by Mondragon that she saw Daniels with a laser-sighted handgun. This evidence was provided to show that Daniels had access to a gun as used in the robbery. Therefore, because the evidence was admissible, Daniels\u2019 counsel was not required to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b647 Accordingly, Daniels\u2019 counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. As Daniels does not meet the first requirement of <em>Strickland, </em>showing deficient performance, Daniels\u2019 claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel fail on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b648 We conclude that Daniels\u2019 counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b649 Daniels has not shown error in his trial.
