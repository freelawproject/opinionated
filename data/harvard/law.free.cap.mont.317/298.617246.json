We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in transferring custody jurisdiction to a Louisiana court based on the interest of the minor child?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in failing to address Jennifer Fontenot\u2019s motion under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b65 In November of 2002, Jennifer Fontenot petitioned the District Court to dissolve her marriage to Jacob Ryan Fontenot. Jennifer\u2019s petition stated she and Jacob had been married in Great Falls, Montana, in 2001, and had one son, Wyatt. She stated Wyatt was living with her in Great Falls while Jacob was stationed with the United States Air Force in Louisiana. Jennifer asked the court to grant a dissolution, divide the personal property, and adopt a parenting plan under which Wyatt would live primarily with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b66 In January of2003, Jacob filed a response stating that Wyatt had been in his custody in Louisiana since December of2002, he had filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in Louisiana in December of 2002, and the Louisiana court had issued an emergency order giving Jacob sole custody of Wyatt. Jacob also moved to dismiss Jennifer\u2019s petition on the basis that, under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCC JA), Louisiana had custody jurisdiction of Wyatt.</p>\n<p id=\"AAq\">\u00b67 Jennifer immediately moved the District Court for a determination under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCC JEA) that (1) the District Court has jurisdiction over this child custody matter because Montana is Wyatt\u2019s home state; and (2) Montana is the more appropriate and convenient forum in which to determine custody issues. She also asked the court to hold an immediate hearing on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b68 Without holding a hearing, the District Court entered the following order dated February 11, 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">Pursuant to the conference between this Court and the Honorable J. Larry Vidrine on February 11, 2003, both Courts have concluded that it is in the best interest of the child that jurisdiction is with the 13th Judicial District in Zille Platte, Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that jurisdiction in this matter is transferred to the Louisiana 13th Judicial District Court, Evangeline Parrish [sic], Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Jennifer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b69 On February 18, 2003, just days after the District Court\u2019s order, we issued our opinion in <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2003 MT 25, 314 Mont. 139, 64 P.3d 997. In that opinion, we traced the history of the various federal and uniform state statutes which had been adopted in recent years to address problems raised by interstate child custody disputes. <em>See Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-16. Thereafter, we addressed the issue of first impression presented, which involved the provisions of the UCCJEA that permit a district court in Montana to decline to exercise jurisdiction when it determines it is an inconvenient forum. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-41. As noted above, the District Court in the present case did not have the benefit of <em>Stoneman </em>when it entered its order transferring custody to the Louisiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b610 As outlined in <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14, the 1999 Montana Legislature adopted the UCCJEA to take the place of the UCCJA, which had been in effect in Montana since 1977. Under the UCCJEA, a Montana court has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination if Montana is the \u201chome state\u201d of the child. Section 40-7-201, MCA. As the \u201chome state\u201d of a child, Montana will continue to have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction unless a Montana court declines to exercise its jurisdiction. Section 40-7-202(2), MCA. A court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if the court determines it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum to make the child custody determination. Section 40-7-108(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b611 Our standard of review of a decision on a motion to decline jurisdiction is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court err in transferring custody jurisdiction to a Louisiana court based on the interest of the minor child?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b613 The sole reason the District Court gave for its transfer of jurisdiction is that it is in \u201cthe best interest of the child\u201d that jurisdiction be with the Louisiana court. Jennifer correctly points out this is not the proper standard for such a determination under the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\u00b614 The UCCJA incorporates an \u201cinterest of the child\u201d standard in a district court\u2019s determination of whether to waive jurisdiction on the basis that the court is an inconvenient forum. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA (1997). Montana\u2019s former UCCJA statutes set forth \u201cinterest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>child\u201d as the standard in the inconvenient forum provision and then listed specific matters which the court \u201cmay\u201d take into account in determining the \u201cinterest of the child.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">\u00b615 [1] The interest of the child standard, <em>per se, </em>was eliminated from inconvenient forum provisions, however, when Montana enacted the UCCJEA in 1999. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-7-108, MCA; <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 18. Section 40-7-108, MCA, now provides that a Montana court with jurisdiction over a child custody matter may decline to exercise its jurisdiction if the court determines it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and a court of another state is a more appropriate forum based on various factors. The court \u201cshall allow the parties to submit information\u201d on certain factors, including whether domestic violence has occurred, the length of time the child has resided outside Montana, the distance between the Montana court and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction, the relative financial circumstances of the parties, any agreement of the parties as to which state shall assume jurisdiction, the nature and location of the evidence regarding the issues, the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously, and the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues. Section 40-7-108(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b616  We hold that the District Court erred when it relied on an \u201cinterest of the child\u201d standard in its determination regarding jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b617 2. Did the District Court err in failing to address Jennifer Fontenot\u2019s motion under the UCCJEA?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b618 Jennifer moved for determination that the District Court has jurisdiction over this child custody matter because Montana is Wyatt\u2019s home state and Montana is the more appropriate and convenient forum in which to determine custody issues. The facts set forth in Jennifer\u2019s petition for dissolution indicate the District Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-201(l)(a), MCA, because Montana was Wyatt\u2019s home state on the date Jennifer filed her petition and, while Wyatt was absent from Montana at a later time, Jennifer continued to live here. Therefore, on the face of it, the Montana District Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b619 Jacob relies on \u00a7 40-7-107(2), MCA, in claiming that no hearing or input from the parties was required before the District Court communicated with the Louisiana court regarding jurisdiction. Section 40-7-107, MCA, addresses simultaneous custody proceedings in Montana and another state. Section 40-7-107(2), MCA, specifically excludes from its provisions temporary emergency jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>proceedings under \u00a7 40-7-204, MCA. The copy of the Louisiana court\u2019s order appended to Jacob\u2019s brief indicates the Louisiana court took jurisdiction based on its determination that an emergency situation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b620  In addition, the copy of the Louisiana court\u2019s judgment references the UCCJA as the controlling law in that court. The provision upon which Jacob relies refers to \u201ca court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this chapter.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-7-107(2), MCA. As indicated above, the UCCJA is dissimilar to the UCCJEA in critical respects. Because the Louisiana court is not operating under the UCCJEA, we conclude the Louisiana court could not divest the District Court of jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-107(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">\u00b621  The District Court did not hold a hearing on the motion to-dismiss as required under \u00a7 40-7-108(2), MCA. <em>See also Marriage of Vanlaarhoven, </em>2002 MT 222, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 368, \u00b6 19, 55 P.3d 942, \u00b6 19; <em>Stoneman, \u00b6 </em>20. The court did not allow the parties to submit information on the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-7-108(2), MCA, or make any mention of those factors in its order. The court did not make a determination, based on facts adduced from the parties, that it was an inconvenient forum. Jacob has cited no authority which supports the District Court\u2019s summary order transferring jurisdiction. We hold the District Court erred by making a determination regarding its jurisdiction without holding a hearing and without making any determinations of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b622 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
