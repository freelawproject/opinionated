Larson presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b62 This case derives from an automobile accident which occurred on September 22,1998, involving Hegwood and Brian Sutherland. At the time of the accident, Sutherland was driving a chip truck for his employer, Missoula Cartage. On September 12,2001, Hegwood filed a negligence action against Sutherland and Missoula Cartage and a declaratory judgment action against Missoula Cartage\u2019s insurer for damages allegedly sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b63 In July 2002, Missoula Cartage and Sutherland moved the District Court for an order compelling Hegwood to submit to an independent medical examination (IME) conducted by Dr. Catherine Capps, a licensed orthopedic surgeon. Hegwood opposed the motion and sought a protective order which permitted (1) a court reporter and video recorder to document the entire examination and (2) Hegwood\u2019s counsel to attend the full examination. Hegwood argued that such measures were necessary since Dr. Capps no longer practices medicine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and, instead, conducts IMEs \u201cfor insurance companies and defense counsel full time.\u201d Additionally, through discovery requests, Hegwood sought the following from Dr. Capps: information regarding each IME Dr. Capps performed within the last five years (who retained her services, the subject of each examination, the result of her findings, how much money she received to conduct the IMEs, etc.); all documentation produced in the course of the above IMEs; and tax returns from 1997 to 2001 reflecting Dr. Capps\u2019 income from all sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b64 On November 12,2002, the District Court entered its Opinion and Order on Outstanding Motions. The District Court ordered Hegwood to submit to the IME, conducted by Dr. Capps, pursuant to Rule 35, M.R.Civ.P. Citing <em>Mohr v. District Court </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 423, 660 P.2d 88, the District Court denied Hegwood\u2019s motions to record the examination and allow her attorney to attend the entire examination. Finally, the District Court deemed the above discovery requests \u201coverbroad and excessively burdensome\u201d and ordered that Dr. Capps need not respond to the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b65 On February 18, 2003, Hegwood filed the present petition for a writ of supervisory control. Hegwood argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">Supervisory control is appropriate in this case because the District Court made a mistake of law or willfully disregarded the law when it ordered Hegwood to submit to examination without protecting her from the oppression that could occur if Dr. Capps is permitted to examine and question her off the record, and then testify about what she says, unconstrained by a record of the examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Supervisory control is also appropriate because the District Court placed Hegwood at a significant disadvantage when it deprived her of the protection of counsel....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">Dr. Capps\u2019 opinions will have a significant impact on the course of discovery, the prospects of settlement and the outcome of this case, and in the absence of an accurate record and the discovery Hegwood needs to cross-examine and impeach her, the jury\u2019s verdict may be meaningless. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b66  Typically, orders pertaining to discovery are interlocutory in nature and are generally not reviewable in an original proceeding. However, we will exercise our original jurisdiction when an order will place a party at a significant disadvantage in litigating the merits of the case. <em>Burlington Northern v. District Court </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 207, 212, 779 P.2d 885, 889. Supervisory control should issue when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>district court proceeds under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice for which an appeal is not an adequate remedy. <em>Safeco v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist., </em>2000 MT 153, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 123, \u00b6 14, 2 P.3d 834, \u00b6 14. Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 14. For the reasons discussed below, we decline to exercise supervisory control in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\u00b67 Rule 35(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">Order for examination. When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party\u2019s custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In contemplating Rule 35, M.R.Civ.P., motions, a court must balance the right to obtain a physical or mental examination with the plaintiffs right to privacy. <em>Winslow v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., </em>2001 MT 269, \u00b6 5, 307 Mont. 269, \u00b6 5, 38 P.3d 148, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b68 In <em>Mohr, </em>Mohr sought an order from the district court which permitted his attorney to attend a medical examination or, in the alternative, permitted him to videotape the examination. The trial court denied Mohr\u2019s requests and we accepted supervisory control. Ultimately, we held that \u201cthe party s attorney has a right to be present while the examining physician is taking the client\u2019s history, but that the attorney cannot be present during the physical examination.\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>202 Mont. at 424, 660 P.2d at 88. In so holding, we attempted to \u201cstrike a balance between the rights of a litigant to counsel, and the need for efficiency in the court-ordered examination process, giving due consideration to the needs of the medical examiner.\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>202 Mont. at 426, 660 P.2d at 89. However, critical to our determination, was the presumption that Rule 35, M.R.Civ.P., examinations constituted \u201cnonadversarial proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b69 Most certainly, the IME procedures of years past have experienced marked permutation. The mounting prevalence of the proverbial \u201chired gun\u201d has increasingly strained the \u201cnonadversarial\u201d nature of court-ordered examinations. <em>See, e.g., Behler v. Hanlon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(D.Md. 2001), 199 F.R.D. 553, 554 (\u201cSuch examinations, euphemistically referred to by counsel as \u2018independent medical examinations\u2019 ... can be anything but independent, if they are performed by a doctor who has significant financial ties with insurance companies and attorneys assigned to defend personal injury cases.\u201d); <em>Tirado v. Erosa </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1994), 158 F.R.D. 294, 298 (\u201cCertainly, in an era in which classified advertisements offering expert testimony appear commonly in publications addressed to lawyers, the adversarial context in which these examinations occur is a reality that must be taken into account in determining what procedures best accommodate the conflicting interests of the parties in a particular case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b610 In <em>Simms v. Montana Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 89, \u00b6 33, 315 Mont. 135, \u00b6 33, 68 P.3d 678, \u00b6 33, we indicated that \u201cRule 35, M.R.Civ.P., does not empower a defendant to seek out and employ the most favorable \u2018hired gun\u2019 available no matter the inconvenience to the plaintiff and without regard to the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d Hegwood insists that Dr. Capps embodies the \u201cexaminer for hire\u201d lamented in <em>Simms. </em>As such, Hegwood argues that the District Court should have ordered the requested safeguards to protect her rights throughout the adversarial examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b611 Amicus MTLA submits that \u201cthe rule in <em>Mohr, </em>when blindly applied, has potentially harsh and oppressive consequences, particularly when defendants choose a professional expert as their Rule 35 examiner.\u201d Therefore, MTLA urges us to \u201cmore clearly articulate the exceptions alluded to in <em>Mohr </em>and the options allowed to district courts, so as to ensure that the interests cited by the Court in <em>Mohr </em>are in fact protected and a proper balance between the parties\u2019 rights maintained within the intrusive and limited context of Rule 35, M.R.Civ.P.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b612  <em>Mohr </em>does not categorically preclude representation at, and documentation of, the physical examination. In fact, it provides that \u201c[t]he actual physical examination, <em>at least in most cases, </em>does not require the presence of counsel to safeguard its objectivity because, by nature it is a nonadversarial procedure.\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>202 Mont. at 426, 660 P.2d at 89 (emphasis added). Implicit in <em>Mohr </em>is the notion that the examinations may, in some instances, border on advocacy. WTien an examinee sufficiently demonstrates subjective predilections or the likelihood of prejudice, i.e., the exam shifts from independent in nature to adversarial, courts must have protective mechanisms at their disposal to negate the inequities.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\u00b613 For such protective measures, litigants and courts should rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Rules 26(c) and 35(a), M.R.Civ.P., for direction. Rule 26(c), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in relevant part, that a court \u201cmay make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:... (2) that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions ....\u201d Rule 35(a), M.R.Civ.P., requires a court to \u201cspecify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.\u201d We decline to articulate a bright line standard for measuring prospective Rule 35, M.R.Civ.P., debates. Instead, we leave the matter to the discretion of the trial courts to determine, based on the facts presented and authority derived from <em>Mohr </em>and Rules 26(c) and 35(a), M.R.Civ.P., whether to impose checks and balances (representation, recording devices, or the like) upon the IME process. <em>See Wood, v. Chicago Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific R. Co. </em>(Minn. Ct. App. 1984), 353 N.W.2d 195, 197 (\u2018We think <em>exercise </em>of the sound discretion of the trial court provides the most appropriate safeguard against [Rule 35] abuses.... We leave the decision to allow an attorney\u2019s presence during adverse examination to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">\u00b614  Here, the record does not support the desired intrusion into the examination room. This case does not present the inconvenience contemplated in <em>Simms, </em>nor the subjectivity referenced herein, to warrant remedial measures. Merely demonstrating that an examiner performs exams for the insurance industry does not inherently establish the degree of prejudice or potential for abuse as presented in <em>Simms. </em>Therefore, without more, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it prohibited Hegwood\u2019s counsel from attending, and recording devices from documenting, the entire independent medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b615 Finally, Hegwood served the Defendants with several interrogatories and requests for production. Among the requests were: (1) Interrogatory No. 42 which sought information from every IME Dr. Capps performed within the last five years; (2) Request for Production No. 38 which sought \u201call documentation of Dr. Capps\u2019 findings, conclusions, opinions and testimony in the cases and claims\u201d identified in Interrogatory No. 42; and (3) Request for Production No. 39 which sought Dr. Capps\u2019 tax returns from 1997 to 2001, reflecting her income from all sources. The District Court ordered that the Defendants \u201cneed not respond to these requests\u201d as the requests \u201care overbroad and excessively burdensome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b616  A district court has inherent discretionary power to control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>discovery under its authority to control trial administration. <em>Bartlett v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 63, 72, 929 P.2d 227, 232. A district court\u2019s objective in controlling and regulating discovery is to ensure a fair trial for all concerned, neither according one party an unfair advantage nor placing the other at a disadvantage. <em>Bartlett, </em>280 Mont. at 72, 929 P.2d at 232. The district court is in a better position than this Court to supervise the day-to-day operations of discovery. <em>Bartlett, </em>280 Mont. at 72, 929 P.2d at 232. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s order affecting discovery unless it amounts to an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Burns </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 37, 42, 830 P.2d 1318, 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b617 We agree with the District Court that Hegwood\u2019s above discovery requests are overbroad. A plaintiff in like actions might well be allowed to discover information such as: the number of cases the examiner has handled for insurance carriers; which insurance carriers were involved in past examinations; the general subject matter of such examinations; whether the examiner testified on the matter and, if so, the venue in which the examiner testified and the subj ect matter of the testimony; and the income derived from the examinations. However, the examiner should not have to produce such things as prior tax returns and detailed examination reports, absent the requisite relevancy considerations articulated in Rule 26(b), M.R.Civ.P. Hegwood simply has not demonstrated that the District Court abused its discretion when it rejected the above requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, Hegwood\u2019s petition for a writ of supervisory control is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">DATED this 12th day of August 2003.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
