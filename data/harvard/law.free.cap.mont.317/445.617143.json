We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented upon appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied as untimely Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b63 On September 18,2000, Martin Lee VonBergen was charged with seven misdemeanors and one felony involving the poaching of a deer, possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, and theft. The District Court held an omnibus hearing on November 27, 2000, at which VonBergen and his counsel were present. VonBergen indicated at the omnibus hearing that he would file motions to suppress both the evidence and his confession on the grounds that the stop and search were unlawful, and that his Miranda rights had been violated. In its omnibus order, the court set January 29,2001, as a 60-day deadline for filing these pretrial motions, and scheduled the trial for April 10,2001. VonBergen made no request to extend the 60-day deadline. VonBergen\u2019s counsel filed the intended suppression motions within the time provided for doing so under the omnibus order. On February 26, 2001, the court conducted a hearing on the motions, and on March 26, 2001, the court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b64 On April 6, 2001, four days before trial, VonBergen substituted counsel and moved for a continuance of the trial. The District Court granted the motion, and set trial for November 19, 2001. On May 7, 2001, VonBergen\u2019s new counsel filed another motion to suppress based on an issue not raised in VonBergen\u2019s initial suppression motion: that the warrant did not state with particularity the items to be seized from VonBergen\u2019s premises. VonBergen\u2019s new counsel also requested a second omnibus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b65 On June 20, 2001, the District Court ruled that VonBergen had waived his right to file a second motion to suppress by failing to give notice of this motion at the omnibus hearing or by January 29, 2001, the subsequent deadline set by the court. Noting that VonBergen\u2019s initial motions to suppress were timely filed, the court denied the subsequent suppression motion because \u201cthe Defendant had every opportunity to file the instant motion to suppress but did not do so in a timely manner and waived his right to bring such a motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b66 On November 26,2001, VonBergen pled guilty to all eight counts in the Information under a plea agreement which reserved his right to appeal the denial of his second suppression motion. On January 7, 2002, VonBergen received a suspended sentence on the felony theft charge and lesser, concurrent periods of probation on the other charges, except for fifteen days in the county jail. His sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">\u00b67 The standard of review for a denial of a motion to suppress is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>whether the trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. Griffing, </em>1998 MT 75, \u00b6 7, 288 Mont. 213, \u00b6 7, 955 P.2d 1388, \u00b6 7 (quoting <em>State v. Greywater </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 28, 36, 939 P.2d 975, 980). The district court\u2019s determination that a motion to suppress is untimely is a conclusion of law. <em>Griffing, </em>\u00b6 7. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Griffing, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b68 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of relief from waiver, pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, which arises from an untimely motion, will be addressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it denied as untimely Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b610 VonBergen argues the court erred in ruling his motion to suppress, filed on May 7, 2001, was untimely and that he waived the right to file additional pretrial motions by not indicating his intention to do so at the November 27, 2000, omnibus hearing or by the motion deadline of January 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b611  Title 46 contains several sections setting forth timing requirements for filing pretrial motions. These sections provide that pretrial motions must be filed at or before the omnibus hearing unless otherwise provided by Title 46, or at a later date ordered by the court. First, \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, regarding pretrial notices and motions, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">(1) Except for good cause shown, any defense, objection, or request that is capable of determination without trial of the general issue must be raised <em>at or before the omnibus hearing unless otherwise provided by Title 46.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">(2) Failure of a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court, constitutes a waiver of the defense, objection, or request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">(3) The court, for cause shown, may grant relief from any waiver provided by this section. Lack of jurisdiction or the failure of a charging document to state an offense is a nonwaivable defect and must be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of a proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">(4) Unless the court provides otherwise, all pretrial motions must be in writing and must be supported by a statement of the relevant facts upon which the motion is being made. The motion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>order or relief sought. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Second, \u00a7 46-13-110, MCA, which governs the omnibus hearing, mandates that counsel for both parties \u201cmust be prepared to discuss\u201d motions to suppress at the omnibus hearing, and provides that the district court may rule on the motion at the hearing, or may schedule the matter for \u201cbriefing and further hearing as the court considers necessary.\u201d Section 46-13-110(3), (5), MCA. Third, \u00a7 46-13-302, MCA, regarding motions to suppress, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">(1) A defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the court to suppress as evidence anything obtained by the unlawful search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">(2) If the motion states facts that, if true, would show that the evidence should be suppressed, the court shall hear the merits of the motion <em>at the omnibus hearing or at a later date if the court orders.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(3) If the motion is granted, the evidence is not admissible at trial. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Thus, a party has a statutory mandate to bring any defense, objection, or request that is capable of determination without trial of the general issue, including motions to suppress, at or before the omnibus hearing, or, at the latest, by a subsequent date ordered by the court. The consequence for failure to do so is clear: \u201c[a] party\u2019s failure to raise matters which are capable of determination without trial and required to be raised at or before the omnibus hearing constitutes a waiver.\u201d <em>Griffing, </em>\u00b6 10 citing \u00a7 46-13-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b612 VonBergen argues that under \u00a7 46-13-101(2), MCA, suppression issues are waived only if not raised \u201cprior to trial.\u201d He contends his May 7, 2001, motion should have been considered timely because it was filed just 31 days after substitution of new counsel and 196 days before the rescheduled trial. However, this argument ignores that the phrase \u201cprior to trial\u201d in subsection (2) is further defined by the appositive \u201cat the time set by the court,\u201d and further ignores the plain meaning of subsection (1), which specifically requires that pretrial motions be raised \u201cat or before the omnibus hearing unless otherwise provided....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">\u00b613  The timely filing of pretrial motions is a well established requirement. The Court \u201cconsistently ha[s] affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to suppress under both current and predecessor statutes setting time requirements for such motions.\u201d <em>Griffing, </em>\u00b6 11. <em>See State v. Landis, </em>2002 MT 45, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 354, \u00b6 20, 43 P.3d 298, \u00b6 20; <em>see also State v. Hart </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 185, 191, 650 P.2d 768, 772; <em>State v. Hall </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 511, 514, 600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>P.2d 1180, 1182; <em>State v. Briner </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 185, 189-90, 567 P.2d 35, 37-38 (in each case, the Court upheld the denial of untimely motion to suppress under a previous version of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Griffing, </em>the Court upheld the denial of a suppression motion filed over four months after the omnibus hearing, applying the same version of \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, at issue here. <em>Griffing, </em>\u00b6 12. Likewise, in <em>Greywater, </em>the Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion filed over three months after the omnibus hearing pursuant to this statutory language. <em>Greywater, </em>282 Mont. at 37, 939 P.2d at 980. These rulings demonstrate that the timeliness of a pretrial motion is determined not by the length of time prior to trial the motion is submitted, but by compliance with the statutory requirement of filing at or before the omnibus hearing, or a later date set by the court. \u00b615 VonBergen contends that none of the opinions or rationale expressed by this Court, particularly <em>Griffing </em>and <em>Greywater, </em>apply to a pretrial suppression motion which, like his, was filed six months before trial. However, this premise erroneously assumes that timeliness is a function of the time remaining before trial. According to statute, whether VonBergen\u2019s motion to suppress was timely is properly determined by reference to November 27,2000, the date of his omnibus hearing, or January 29, 2001, the later deadline set by the court. VonBergen\u2019s motion was filed thereafter, and therefore, as a matter of law, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b616 The purpose of requiring pretrial motions to be brought at or before the omnibus hearing is the \u201corderly and fair administration of the criminal justice system itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Sisca </em>(2nd Cir. 1974), 503 F.2d 1337, 1349. Section 46-13-110(2), MCA, states \u201c[t]he purpose of the [omnibus] hearing is to expedite the procedures leading up to the trial of the defendant.\u201d Further, the Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, state \u201c[t]he general theory of the entire chapter is to simplify the procedure... in bringing a case to trial.\u201d Although VonBergen contends the purpose of \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, is to establish reasonable timetables, his interpretation, without more, would erase the time frame created by the statutes and subject pretrial proceedings to potentially arbitrary governance.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b617 Having determined that VonBergen violated the statute and waived the right to file his second motion to suppress, we must consider whether the District Court erred in denying relief from that waiver pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, which provides such relief can be granted for good cause. It states, \u201c[t]he court, for cause shown, may grant relief from any waiver provided by this section.\u201d VonBergen asserts that a reasonable interpretation of this language necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>requires that substitution of counsel constitute good cause. He argues that because his substituted counsel was hired after the omnibus hearing and after the motion deadline date, it was impossible for his new counsel to have filed the second motion to suppress by the dates required by statute. VonBergen argues that if a defendant changes attorney before trial, the defendant should have the benefit of the new attorney\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b618 We have not previously enunciated a standard of review to be applied to a district court\u2019s denial of relief from waiver pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. However, a district court\u2019s determination of the existence of \u201cgood cause\u201d is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion. For example, a district court\u2019s determination of whether good cause exists for withdrawal of a plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Tweed, </em>2002 MT 286, \u00b6 26, 312 Mont. 482, \u00b6 26, 59 P.3d 1105, \u00b6 26. Further, discretionary district court rulings, such as the granting or denial of a motion to continue, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 73, \u00b6 10, 75 P.3d 313, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b619  Paragraph one of the Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, emphasizes \u201c[t]he statute continues to recognize the court\u2019s wide discretion in controlling pretrial motion practice.\u201d What constitutes good cause for granting relief from the waiver is fact-specific and falls under the sound discretion of the district court. For example, this Court concluded a public defender\u2019s busy case load was not good cause to grant a waiver of an untimely motion to suppress in <em>Greywater, </em>282 Mont. at 37, 939 P.2d at 980, but concluded that confusion over whether the prosecution was going to drop or continue a defendant\u2019s charges was good cause to grant a waiver in <em>State v. Bentley </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 129, 132, 477 P.2d 345, 346. Therefore, we conclude that we will review the District Court\u2019s denial of relief from a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA, under an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b620 This Court has not previously addressed whether substitution of counsel constitutes good cause for a relief from waiver under \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. Recently, we held that a defendant\u2019s right to counsel must be carefully considered by the district court in determining whether to grant a continuance of the trial itself, noting the court \u201cmust be sensitive to the defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice, as well as the public\u2019s interest in prompt and efficient administration* of justice.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>\u00b6 32. Here, the District Court gave such consideration, granting the request of VonBergen\u2019s new counsel to continue the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b621  It does not follow, however, that new counsel is necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>entitled to have pretrial proceedings rescheduled or conducted anew. Although new counsel may request such accommodations, a district court retains the authority to control the progress of the case, and may, within its discretion, grant or deny the requested relief, as it deems appropriate. In considering such requests, a district court may properly consider the history of the proceedings prior to new counsel\u2019s involvement. To hold otherwise would subject criminal proceedings to the vagaries of counsel substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b622 The holdings of the federal courts are instructive. In <em>United States v. DeLuna </em>(W.D.Mo. 1985), 616 F. Supp. 534, 538, the court, -under similar circumstances, was faced with whether good cause relieved the defendant\u2019s failure to file a timely motion to suppress pursuant to Rule 12(f), Fed.R.Crim.P., which then contained nearly identical language to \u00a7 46-13-101(2), (3), MCA. It concluded that \u201c[wjhere defendant has been represented throughout the proceedings by counsel, the addition or substitution of new counsel does not constitute good cause compelling a court to grant relief from defendant\u2019s waiver.\u201d In <em>United States v. Johnson </em>(8th Cir. 1980), 614 F.2d 622, 623, where, as here, the defendant added new counsel and changed his trial strategy, the appellate court, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of relief from the defendant\u2019s waiver, concluded \u201c[w]e cannot say ... that the district court abused its discretion in holding that there was no good cause compelling it to grant relief of the waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b623  As in <em>DeLuna, </em>VonBergen was represented throughout the proceedings by his first counsel and substituted counsel on the eve of trial. Nothing prevented VonBergen\u2019s first counsel from filing a timely motion attacking the sufficiency of the warrant by the November 27, 2000, omnibus hearing or the January 29, 2001, deadline set by the court. In fact, VonBergen\u2019s first counsel filed several other motions to suppress which met these two deadlines. Thus, we conclude from these circumstances that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying VonBergen\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
