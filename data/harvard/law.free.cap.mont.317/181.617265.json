Bay appeals from the conviction for assault on a peace officer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to support Ba/s conviction of the offense of assault on a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">\u00b63 Bay appeared before the Miles City City Court on February 6, 2001, on a bench warrant. During that appearance, the court found Bay in contempt of court and Miles City Police Officer Shawna Kaiser (Kaiser), who was present in the courtroom, attempted to take Bay into custody. An altercation ensued between Bay and Kaiser, and Bay was later arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u00b64 The State of Montana (State) ultimately charged Bay with assault on a peace officer and three counts of resisting arrest, and the District Court scheduled a jury trial. Prior to trial, the District Court dismissed one of the counts of resisting arrest on the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\u00b65 At trial in the District Court, Billie Burkhalter (Burkhalter), Clerk of the Miles City City Court, testified Bay came to her desk at the City Court office prior to Bays appearance in the City Court and said, in an intimidating manner, \u201cI\u2019m here on this bull shit warrant.\u201d Because she was concerned that Bay might cause trouble, Burkhalter wrote a note to Kaiser asking Kaiser to remain in the area during Bays appearance in the City Court. Burkhalter heard the judge find Bay in contempt and saw Bay start to exit the courtroom. Kaiser raised her hand and told Bay to stop, but Bay continued towards Kaiser and shoved her \u201cvery hard,\u201d causing Kaiser to fall back. Kaiser then pushed Bay up against a wall, causing a picture to fall down. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>two struggled and Kaiser attempted to do a \u201cleg sweep\u201d maneuver of Bay with her right leg. Kaiser then screamed out in pain and fell to the ground. Bay stood for a moment before picking up an object from the floor and running out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b66 The City Court Judge testified that when Bay appeared before him, she refused to answer his questions, even to confirm her identity. After he warned Bay that she could be jailed for contempt, Bay attempted to leave the courtroom. The judge told Bay she was in contempt and instructed her not to leave, and Kaiser attempted to prevent her from leaving. From his location, the judge could not see Bay as she approached Kaiser, but he heard Kaiser tell Bay not to leave, the noise of a struggle, and Kaiser saying that she was hurt and asking for an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b67 Kaiser testified she heard the judge hold Bay in contempt. Kaiser also heard the judge tell Bay that Kaiser was going to take her to jail; Bay responded she was not going to jail and then attempted to leave the courtroom. Kaiser positioned herself between Bay and the exit, put out her hand and told Bay to stop. Bay continued walking towards Kaiser and, upon reaching her, shoved her hard, knocking her backwards. Kaiser testified that the shove hurt. She then attempted to grab Bay\u2019s arms so she could handcuff her, but Bay continued to break free. At some point in the struggle, Bay knocked Kaiser\u2019s glasses from her face. Kaiser grabbed Bay by her coat and turned her against the wall. She then attempted a \u201cleg sweep\u201d maneuver of Bay by bringing up her own right leg and using her knee to strike a nerve in Bay\u2019s left leg. As Kaiser lifted her right leg and Bay continued to struggle with her, Kaiser\u2019s left knee gave out, causing her to drop to the ground in pain. Kaiser testified she rolled onto her right side to protect her firearm. Bay stepped over her, picked an object up from the ground and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b68 Bay was arrested a short time later at a local restaurant where, according to the testimony of Miles City Police Lieutenant Marty Hagemeister, she again resisted arrest. It took three officers to get her handcuffed and into a patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b69 Following the trial, a jury found Bay guilty of assault on a peace officer and two counts of resisting arrest. The District Court sentenced Bay and entered judgment. Bay appeals from the conviction for assault on a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b610 We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction by determining whether, when the evidence is viewed in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>2002 MT 181, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 52, \u00b6 23, 53 P.3d 356, \u00b6 23 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b611 Is the evidence sufficient to support Bay\u2019s conviction of the offense of assault on a peace officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b612 In this case, assault on a peace officer consists of purposely or knowingly causing bodily injury to a peace officer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA. Bay maintains that her actions do not meet the statutory requirements for the offense. She contends that Kaiser\u2019s knee injury was not caused by Bay\u2019s actions because Kaiser\u2019s knee merely gave out under her own body weight. Bay asserts, on that basis, that the State did not present sufficient evidence regarding the requisite mental state for the offense because she did not purposely or knowingly cause bodily injury to Kaiser. Bay\u2019s arguments focus almost entirely on Kaiser\u2019s knee injury and the purported lack of sufficient evidence to support a causal link between Bay\u2019s actions and that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b613 The State asserts, however, that we need not determine whether Bay purposely or knowingly caused Kaiser\u2019s knee injury; we need only examine the evidence-in the light most favorable to the prosecution-to determine whether it would permit a rational jury to find the elements of assault on a peace officer beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude evidence unrelated to the knee injury is sufficient to meet this test.</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">\u00b614  \u201cBodily injury\u201d means \u201cphysical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.\u201d Section 45-2-101(5), MCA. Burkhalter and Kaiser both testified that, prior to Kaiser injuring her knee, Bay shoved Kaiser hard enough to knock her backwards. Burkhalter described the shove as \u201cvery hard,\u201d and Kaiser testified that it hurt. Bay denies she shoved Kaiser, but the determination of the credibility of witnesses and weight of the evidence is within the province of the jury. <em>See State v. Landis, </em>2002 MT 45, \u00b6 30, 308 Mont. 354, \u00b6 30, 43 P.3d 298, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). The evidence is sufficient to support a jury finding that Bay caused Kaiser bodily injury by shoving her hard enough to cause Kaiser physical pain. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(5), MCA. Having established the evidence supports a finding of the bodily injury element of the offense, we turn to the question of whether Bay acted purposely or knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b615 \u201cA person acts knowingly with respect to the result of conduct described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the result will be caused by the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>conduct.\u201d Section 45-2-101(34), MCA. The appreciation of the probable risk posed by a person\u2019s conduct constitutes a \u201cknowing\u201d action by the person. <em>See State v. Lambert </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 231, 236, 929 P.2d 846, 849. \u201c[A] person acts purposely with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.\u201d Section 45-2-101(64), MCA. The result required for the offense of assault on a peace officer is that the officer suffer bodily injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b616  A person\u2019s mental state rarely can be proved by direct evidence; it usually must be inferred from the facts and circumstances about which the witnesses testify. <em>State v. Longstreth, </em>1999 MT 204, \u00b6 34, 295 Mont. 457, \u00b6 34, 984 P.2d 157, \u00b6 34. Indeed, a defendant\u2019s mental state may be inferred from his or her actions and the facts and circumstances connected with the offense charged. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b617 In the present case, trial testimony reflected that Bay\u2019s demeanor was \u201cagitated\u201d from the time she entered the courtroom and her tone of voice was \u201csnotty\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d as she spoke to the judge. Burkhalter listened closely to Bay\u2019s conversation with the judge because she anticipated that Bay \u201cwas going to go off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b618 After the City Court Judge found Bay in contempt and informed her that she was to be taken into custody, Bay tried to leave the courtroom. Bay stated that she was not going to jail. Indeed, Bay\u2019s admitted intention was to leave the courtroom without being taken into custody by Kaiser. Kaiser, a uniformed police officer, stood in Bay\u2019s path as Bay tried to leave, put out her hand and told Bay to stop. Bay continued walking towards Kaiser and shoved Kaiser hard, knocking her backwards. According to Burkhalter, Bay walked into Kaiser and shoved her \u201cvery hard\u201d and \u201cin one continuous motion.\u201d From these facts and circumstances, including Bay\u2019s actions and stated intention to leave without being taken into custody, a jury could reasonably infer that Bay was aware of the high probability that her conduct in shoving Kaiser hard enough to knock Kaiser backwards would result in physical pain to Kaiser and, therefore, that Bay acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b619  On this record, we conclude a rational jury could determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Bay acted knowingly in causing Kaiser bodily injury. We hold the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support Bay\u2019s conviction of the offense of assault on a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
