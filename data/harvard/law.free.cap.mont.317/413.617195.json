Croonenberghs (the Croonenberghs) on Counts II and III of the amended complaint of Dale T. and Jeanne M. Kohler (the Kohlers), seeking, among other things, an order establishing a fence line and a 1976 survey line as the boundary between the Kohlers\u2019 and the Croonenberghs\u2019 respective properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b62 By way of further background, on May 31,2000, the Kohlers filed their Amended Complaint and Demand for Trial by Jury against the Croonenberghs, Erma W. Lewis (Lewis), Commonwealth Land and Title Insurance (Commonwealth) and FLR Partnership, LLP, d/b/a Lambros Real Estate (Lambros). The Kohlers\u2019 amended complaint specified eleven counts and included, in addition to the claim aforementioned, various claims for damages against the Croonenberghs, Lewis, Lambros and Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b63 In due course, the Kohlers and Commonwealth, in its capacity as the Kohlers\u2019 title insurer, moved for partial summary judgment against the Croonenberghs as to the claims in Counts II and III of the amended complaint. Lambros joined in this motion. A few weeks later, the Croonenberghs moved for summary judgment against the remaining defendants and objected to the Kohlers\u2019 and Commonwealth\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Following briefing and a hearing, the trial court granted the Kohlers\u2019 and Commonwealth\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment holding that the 1976 boundary line agreement should be enforced as a matter of law. Specifically, the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Kohlers, Commonwealth and Lambros and against the Croonenberghs on Counts II and III of the amended complaint and denied the Croonenberghs\u2019 motion for summary judgment against the Kohlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u00b64 Lambros then filed a Motion and Brief requesting that the trial court certify the court\u2019s order of September 9, 2002, as final as to Lambros pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. Similarly, the Kohlers and Commonwealth moved for Rule 54(b) certification as to them. The Kohlers and Commonwealth maintained that the court\u2019s ruling on Counts II and III of the amended complaint also disposed of Counts I, IV, VII and VEIL<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also contended that the court\u2019s order disposed of Counts IX, X and XI, leaving only Counts V and VI, the Kohlers\u2019 tort claims against the Croonenberghs, for farther litigation. In their motion for certification, the Kohlers cite this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roy v. Neibauer </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 81, 610 P.2d 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b65 For their part, the Croonenberghs objected to Commonwealth\u2019s, Lambros\u2019, and the Kohlers\u2019 motions for certification contending that the court\u2019s opinion and order were not final; had not disposed of all claims; and that the criteria for Rule 54(b) certification set out in Roy were not met. After further briefing by the Kohlers and Commonwealth, the court entered its order of certification on February 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b66 In its entirety, the court\u2019s order of certification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">Upon application pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P., good cause having been shown, and there being no just reason for delay, the Court hereby certifies the Order of September 9, 2002, as a final partial Judgment as to Counts II and III of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint. Additionally, the Order of September 9, 2002 is also certified as a final Judgment as to Defendant Lambros.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b67 On this procedural background, we conclude that the court\u2019s failure to comply with our decisions in <em>Roy </em>and in <em>Weinstein v. Univ. of Mont., at Missoula </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 435, 898 P.2d 101, in entering its certification order, requires dismissal of this appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u00b68 The dispositive issue is whether the court\u2019s certification order meets the criteria set forth in Roy and in <em>Weinstein. </em>We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">\u00b69 While neither party raised this issue, we do so, <em>sua sponte, </em>for the reason that if a district court abuses its discretion in certifying an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>order as final under Rule 54(b), we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. <em>Weinstein, 271 </em>Mont. at 440, 898 P.2d at 104 (citing <em>Reidy v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 127, 130, 637 P.2d 1196, 1197).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b610 In <em>Roy, </em>we set forth in some detail the procedural steps and an underlying rationale for Rule 54(b) certification. Among other things, we noted that the Rule \u201cattempts to strike a balance between the undesirability of piecemeal appeals and the need to make review available at a time when it best serves the needs of the parties.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 85, 610 P.2d at 1188 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b611 We then went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">This does not mean, however, that the decision allowing an appeal to proceed should be lightly entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">... Indeed, the draftsmen of this Rule have made explicit their thought that it would serve only to authorize \u201cthe exercise of a discretionary power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh case ....\u201d It follows that 54(b) orders should not be entered routinely or as a courtesy or accommodation to counsel. The power which this Rule confers upon the trial judge should be used only \u201cin the infrequent harsh case\u201d as an instrument for the improved administration of justice and the more satisfactory disposition of litigation in the light of the public policy indicated by statute and rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\"><em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 85, 610 P.2d at 1188 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">\u00b612 At the outset, we note that there is nothing in the District Court\u2019s certification order or, for that matter, in the parties\u2019 motion and brief seeking certification, demonstrating that the case at bar is the \u201cinfrequent harsh case.\u201d Rather, this case involves little more than a routine partial summary judgment disposing of some, but not all of the claims raised in the amended complaint, and some but not all of the parties. Specifically, the court\u2019s September 9,2002 Opinion and Order facially disposed of only two of eleven counts in the amended complaint and did not dispose of Defendant Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b613 As we noted in Roy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">The burden is on the party seeking final certification to convince the trial court that the case is the \u201cinfrequent harsh case\u201d meriting a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-12\"><em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 86, 610 P.2d at 1188 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">\u00b614  Rule 54(b) provides for certification when, among other things, \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d We note that the trial court\u2019s certification order quotes this language. Notwithstanding, in Roy, we stated that a proper exercise of discretion by the trial judge requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the court to do more than \u201cmerely recite the magic words.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont, at 86, 610 P.2d at 1189. Rather, the trial court \u201cmust clearly articulate the reasons and factors underlying its decision to order a Rule 54(b) certification.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 86, 610 P.2d at 1189. We went on to note that an appellate court is entitled to have some basis for distinguishing between well-grounded orders which have considered all of the relevant factors and mere boiler-plate approval unsupported by the facts or an analysis of the law. <em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 86, 610 P.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b615 We then listed those factors that an appellate court will normally consider in a Rule 54(b) certification. Those include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">(1) The relationship between the adjudicated and unadjudicated claims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">(2) the possibility that the need for review might or might not be mooted by future developments in the district court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(3) the possibility that the reviewing court might be obliged to consider the same issue a second time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">(4) the presence or absence of a claim or counterclaim which could result in a set-off against the judgment sought to be made final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">(5) miscellaneous factors such as delay, economic and solvency considerations, shortening the time of trial, triviality of competing claims, expense, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-10\"><em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 87, 610 P.2d at 1189 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">\u00b616 Finally, we set forth three guiding principles for Rule 54(b) certification summarizing those as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">(1) the burden is on the party seeking final certification to convince the district court that the case is the \u201cinfrequent harsh case\u201d meriting a favorable exercise of discretion; (2) the district court must balance the competing factors present in the case to determine if it is in the interest of sound judicial administration and public policy to certify the judgment as final; (3) the district court must marshall and articulate the factors upon which it relied in granting certification so that prompt and effective review can be facilitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-13\"><em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 87, 610 P.2d at 1189 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">\u00b617 It is undisputed that the trial court\u2019s perfunctory certification order in this case discusses neither the factors nor the guiding principles set forth in <em>Roy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">\u00b618 <em>Roy, </em>and the analysis required of the trial court, was reaffirmed in <em>Weinstein. </em>Additionally, we noted in <em>Weinstein </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">[ijdeally the facts and theories separated for immediate appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>should not overlap with those retained; to the extent they do, the court of appeals is \u201cdeciding\u201d claims still pending in the district court, and may have to cover the same ground when the district court acts on the residue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><em>Weinstein, </em>271 Mont. at 442, 898 P.2d at 105 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b619 The case at bar implicates this concern as well. The trial court\u2019s partial summary judgment order only disposed of Counts II and III of the amended complaint. Notwithstanding, the movants for certification argued to the trial court that the claims in Counts II and III disposed of or mooted a number of the other counts leaving, apparently, four counts for further litigation including two counts, pertaining to Defendant Lewis, which may or may not have been resolved. The court\u2019s certification order addresses none of these contentions and, indeed, were we to rule on the merits of this appeal, this Court would be deciding claims which are still technically pending in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b620 Finally, our admonition in <em>Roy </em>bears repeating here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Too often this Court is confronted with cases that are not ready for appellate review within the meaning of the rules, but where the opposing parties do not bring this crucial fact to our attention. We often do not discover this until we are deeply into the process of review and indeed often in the opinion-writing stage. We cannot and will not tolerate this state of affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\"><em>Roy, </em>188 Mont. at 84, 610 P.2d at 1187 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u00b621  We hold, as we did in <em>Roy </em>and <em>Weinstein, </em>that here, the District Court erred in failing to apply the factors and guiding principles set forth in <em>Roy </em>and <em>Weinstein </em>as discussed above. Accordingly, as we did in those cases, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in certifying its partial summary judgment Opinion and Order of September 9, 2002, as final under Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. We are, therefore, without jurisdiction to hear this appeal. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order certifying its partial summary judgment Opinion and Order as a final judgment and we dismiss this appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b622 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> Here, the Kohlers and Commonwealth contended that Defendant Lewis had never been found to be served, hut that Counts VII and VIII likely could be dismissed because the court\u2019s opinion and order determined that Lewis\u2019s representations about the boundary line were true.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
