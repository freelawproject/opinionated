The district court dismissed his suit as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>that federal courts lack the authority to issue a -writ of mandamus to direct the performance of a state court. This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Jackson does not brief any argument challenging the basis of the district court\u2019s decision. Jackson has thus waived any such challenge on appeal, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993), and has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
