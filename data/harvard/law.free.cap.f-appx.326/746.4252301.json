The Department later moved for summary judgment against Defendants, asserting that (1) Defendants are each \u201cemployers\u201d under the FLSA and thus individually liable for any FLSA violations, (2) Defendants violated various provisions of the FLSA, (3) the Department is entitled to liquidated damages, and (4) Defendants should be enjoined from committing any future violations of the FLSA. In response, Defendants conceded that both Hooglands Nursery and Michael Hoogland were \u201cemployers\u201d under the FLSA but argued that Fredric Hoogland was not. Defendants contested all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">The district court granted the Department\u2019s motion in part and entered judgment against Hooglands Nursery and Michael Hoogland. The district court denied the Department\u2019s motion only to the extent that it sought to have Fredric Hoog-land declared an \u201cemployer\u201d under the FLSA. After entering judgment, the district court closed the case. Hooglands Nursery and Michael Hoogland filed a notice of appeal, and we asked the parties to address whether the district court\u2019s order is a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over which we have jurisdiction. Although they initially appealed, Hoogland Nursery and Michael Hoogland now assert that we lack jurisdiction because the district court did not resolve the Department\u2019s claims against Fredric Hoogland.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">In its order addressing the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-18\">Defendant Fredric owns 98% of the nursery and is an owner/manager. However, Fredric testified that he has no authority regarding company policies. He testified that Michael totally operates the nursery. He admits that he has the authority to hire employees and make changes to employee pay, but claims that he has not exercised this authority. Fredric has no dealings with the office or bookkeeping and has no responsibilities in regard to the business. He has not been involved in the employment of the company\u2019s workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>and does not know what payroll records are kept. Under these facts and circumstances, the Court finds that Fredric lacked- sufficient operational control to constitute an employer under the FLSA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-0\">The district court\u2019s judgment only mentions Fredric Hoogland in a sentence denying the Department\u2019s motion \u201cto the extent it seeks to have Fredric Hoogland deemed an \u2018employer\u2019 under the FLSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The Department contends that the district court\u2019s order is final, as it resolved all rights and liabilities of the present parties. According to the Department, the district court \u201cessentially\u201d found \u2014 on undisputed facts \u2014 that Fredric Hoogland was not an \u201cemployer\u201d under the FLSA and thus cannot be liable for the alleged violations. The Department thus suggests that the district court effectively decided the claims against Fredric Hoogland and asks this court not to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The district court\u2019s order (along with its closing the case) certainly implies the resolution of all the Department\u2019s claims against Defendants, and the lack of a judgment resolving the claims against Fredric Hoogland was perhaps a mere oversight. Yet, as the Department concedes, the district court did not explicitly dismiss the claims against Fredric Hoogland. Fredric Hoogland did not file a cross-motion for summary judgment nor did he request that the case against him be dismissed, and the district court did not grant summary judgment <em>sua sponte </em>against the Department on this issue. Instead, the district court merely denied the Department summary judgment regarding Fredric Hoogland. Thus, the Department\u2019s claim against Fredric Hoogland has not been finally resolved. Without a judgment dismissing (or otherwise addressing) the Department\u2019s claims against Fredric Hoog-land, the district court\u2019s decision is not final under \u00a7 1291. Moreover, this case presents no ground for reviewing a nonfi-nal order. We therefore lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See generally Briargrove Shopping Ctr. Joint Venture v.
