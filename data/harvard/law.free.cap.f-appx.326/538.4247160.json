Atwell, through counsel, appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>reduction of his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the denial of his post-order motion for reconsideration. At-well\u2019s sentence reduction was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Atwell argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range. Atwell asserts that, despite the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which constrains the court\u2019s authority to vary from the amended range, that section, like all of the Guidelines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Atwell also argues that the court imposed an unreasonable sentence by applying the guidelines as mandatory and failing to specifically discuss the applicability of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding whether to grant the reduction and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the extent of it. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole \u2018demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Atwell\u2019s argument that the court erred in refusing to sentence him below the amended guideline range is foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and thus the court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the district court adequately accounted for the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at Atwell\u2019s amended 168-month sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
