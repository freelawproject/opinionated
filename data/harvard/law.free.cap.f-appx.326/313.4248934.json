The district court dismissed his complaint as malicious<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as time barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Antunez\u2019s complaint as malicious. \u201cRepetitious litigation of virtually identical causes of action is subject to dismissal ... as malicious.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Antunez had brought a prior suit against Mendez based on the same facts and raising the same claims he brings in the present action. The district court in that prior case granted Mendez summary judgment because Antunez failed to properly exhaust administrative prison grievance remedies before bringing suit, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, after Antunez received an unfavorable response to his Step 1 grievance filing, he filed his Step 2 grievance outside of the ten day period a prisoner has to submit an appeal. The district court was within its discretion to sua sponte screen this repetitious complaint and dismiss it as malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
