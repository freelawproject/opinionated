Heller, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). Triplett contends that his claim may be considered under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because <em>Heller </em>establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>offense and the claim was previously foreclosed by circuit law.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). To do so, the petitioner must show that (1) his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) his claims were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the elaim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>Heller, </em>the Court specifically noted that possession of a firearm by a convicted felon did not fall within the protection of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17. In <em>United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632, 633-34 (5th Cir.2003), this court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), prohibiting possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, does not violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Recently, this court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Darrington, </em>stating that <em>\u201cHeller </em>provides no basis for reconsidering <em>Darrington.\u201d United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2009). Triplett fails to show that his claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
