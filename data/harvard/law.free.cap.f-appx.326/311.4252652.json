He appeals his sentence of concurrent 58-month terms of imprisonment and concurrent three-year terms of supervised release. Alvarado argues that the sentencing court erred by failing to downwardly adjust his sentence sua sponte because he was not motivated by profit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because his role in the offense was minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also argues that the sentencing court plainly erred by enhancing his offense level for obstruction of justice based on his trial testimony<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and further enhancing his offense level because the offense involved a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">Because Alvarado did not raise these objections at sentencing we review all of his arguments for plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Alvarado\u2019s challenges to the adjustments to his offense level are all based on factual determinations that were made or, in the case of the argued-for downward adjustments, could have been made, by the district court. Essentially, Alvarado argues that the court\u2019s factual determinations are not supported by the record. \u201c[Questions of fact capable of resolution at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, Alvarado is not entitled to appellate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
