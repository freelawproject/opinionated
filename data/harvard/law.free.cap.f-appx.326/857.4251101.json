The district court denied Florence leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Florence is challenging that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Our inquiry into Florence\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review a \u00a7 1915 dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Florence argues that he was denied his First Amendment right to access to the courts. His argument fails, however, because he does not challenge the district court\u2019s correct finding that he had not established that he was prevented from filing a claim in a court. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 821 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). He also has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his retaliation claim had been raised in another action. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Florence has not sufficiently briefed his assertion that the district court was biased. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Florence\u2019s arguments that his due process rights were violated in connection with his disciplinary hearing fail because the punishment he received, a reduction in line classification status, does not trigger due process protections. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 959 (5th Cir.2000). Florence\u2019s claim that his constitutional rights were violated in connection with the processing of his grievances seeking to overturn his disciplinary conviction is similarly unavailing. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir.2005).; <em>see also Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 137-38, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977) (Burger, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Florence has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination, that his appeal is frivolous, is incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP status is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. All other outstanding motions in this case are also denied. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Florence has at least two previous strikes. <em>See Florence v. Deel, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 697, 697-98 (5th Cir.2007). Because he has accumulated three strikes, Florence is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">IFP MOTION, ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
