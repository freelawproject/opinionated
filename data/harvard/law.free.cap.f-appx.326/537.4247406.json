Crummie\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Crummie asserts the district court erred in determining the extent of his sentence reduction, under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">A district court\u2019s resolution of a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). It is apparent from the resentencing order that the district court calculated Crummie\u2019s amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making this determination, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the ... factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). There is nothing in the record that indicates the district court took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when deciding to reduce Crummie\u2019s sentence to the high end of the amended Guidelines range. Without such information, we lack a meaningful basis from which we can determine whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding how much to reduce Crummie\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
