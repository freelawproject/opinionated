Smith, Mississippi prisoner # 92541 appeals the dismissal, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, of his civil rights action. Smith\u2019s complaint included a claim to recover funds allegedly taken from his prison account without authorization. Smith also claimed that he was being denied access to the courts because he did not have access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>to a law library and because the inmate legal assistance program would not assist him in filing a tort action to recover the missing funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">A dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe complaint must be liberally construed, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">\n<em>Due Process Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s claim regarding the taking of his funds pursuant to <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). \u201cUnder the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, a state actor\u2019s random and unauthorized deprivation of a plaintiffs property does not result in a violation of procedural due process rights if the state provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Ieyoub, </em>62 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.1995) (footnote omitted); <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194; <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 641-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). The <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine is applicable if (1) the deprivation was unpredictable or unforeseeable; (2) predeprivation process would have been impossible or impotent to counter the state actors\u2019 particular conduct; .and (3) the conduct was unauthorized in the sense that it was not within the officials\u2019 express or implied authority. <em>Caine v. Hardy, </em>943 F.2d 1406, 1413 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Smith argues prison officials have engaged in a \u201cpattern\u201d of taking money from inmates\u2019 accounts. In his complaint, Smith alleged that his funds were taken pursuant to the policy, practices, and customs of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. \u201cAs this Court noted, where employees are acting in accord with customary procedures, the \u2018random and unauthorized\u2019 element required for the application of the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine is simply not met.\u201d <em>Brooks v. George County, Miss., </em>84 F.3d 157, 165 (5th Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Smith\u2019s allegations, which this court must accept as true, even if they are doubtful in fact, <em>see Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), preclude application of the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Woodard, </em>419 F.3d at 351; <em>Augustine v. Doe, </em>740 F.2d 322, 327-29 (5th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s claim regarding the alleged taking of funds from his prison account and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">\n<em>Claim of denial of access to the courts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Smith argues that his right of access to the courts is being violated because there is no law library and he cannot obtain legal assistance to pursue other remedies regarding the alleged taking of his funds. The district court did not address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Prisoners have a constitutionally protected right of access to the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). Given Smith\u2019s factual allegations regarding the absence of a law library and his inability to obtain legal assistance in preparing a tort action to recover his funds, the district court erred in dismissing Smith\u2019s claim of denial of access to the courts without addressing it. Accordingly, the dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>this claim is vacated and the claim is remanded for farther proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"ABS6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
