He contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because it was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which he argues is not supported by empirical evidence. He further contends that his sentence is unreasonable even if a presumption of reasonableness is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">Zetino\u2019s contention that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the relevant Guideline is not supported by empirical evidence is without merit. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009). Zetino\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the district court addressed the factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2014 particularly the need to deter Zetino from committing future offenses \u2014 when imposing sentence. Zetino has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
