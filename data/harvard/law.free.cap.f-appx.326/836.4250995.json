Ed-monson has served the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation, and the district court imposed no further term of supervised release. Therefore, Edmonson has no \u201cconcrete and continuing injury,\u201d and there is no case or controversy over which this court may exercise jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The Government\u2019s motion to strike the reply brief is DENIED as unnecessary, and this appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
