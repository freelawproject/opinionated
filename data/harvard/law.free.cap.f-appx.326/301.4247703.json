Silva\u2019s petition for panel rehearing is GRANTED, our prior panel opinion is WITHDRAWN, and this opinion is SUBSTITUTED therefor. No member of the panel nor Judge in regular active service of this Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Fed. R.App. P. and 5th C\u00ede. R. 35), the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED. The attorney appointed to represent Silva has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Silva has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Silva\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm R. 42.2. Silva\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
