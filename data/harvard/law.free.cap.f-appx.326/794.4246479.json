He argues that the district court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) to his sentence based upon the classification of his prior Texas conviction for possession of a prohibited firearm as a crime of violence, as that term is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Although Moore acknowledges that this argument was rejected in <em>United States v. Serna, </em>309 F.3d 859, 864 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>(5th Cir.2002), he contends that <em>Serna </em>has been overruled or undermined by <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). <em>Begay </em>did not specifically overrule <em>Serna </em>regarding this issue. Moreover, the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 states, \u201cUnlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"Aes\">In his reply brief, Moore addresses that commentary and argues that it is not applicable because the district court improperly relied upon the presen-tence report\u2019s quoted language from the indictment to classify his prior Texas conviction as a crime of violence. However, defense counsel admitted at sentencing that Moore\u2019s prior conviction was for possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Thus, even if we assume that Moore\u2019s argument was properly raised before this court, the district court was permitted to utilize Moore\u2019s admission when determining whether his prior conviction was a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2006). In light of <em>Serna </em>and \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s commentary, the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) to Moore\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 607 n. 1 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2009) (No. 08-9578); <em>United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 338 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Moore also challenges the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) in light of <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
