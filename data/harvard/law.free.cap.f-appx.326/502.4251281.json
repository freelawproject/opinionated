Associated allowed its subcontractor, R <em>&amp; </em>R Brick and Block Corporation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), to use the leased equipment. When Fabiano Cantao, an R &amp; R employee, was operating the equipment, he backed over the edge of an unmarked ditch, was trapped under water, and drowned. Mr. Cantao\u2019s Personal Representative and parents sued, among others, both Associated and Ring Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Ring Power brought a declaratory judgment action against Amerisure, seeking to be declared a covered insured. The district court found that, under the plain language of Amerisure\u2019s insurance contract with Associated, Ring Power is an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that bound the district court. <em>Beshers v. Harrison, </em>495 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2007). We resolve all genuine issues of material fact in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>We review the interpretation of an insurance contract <em>de novo. LaFarge Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>118 F.3d 1511, 1515 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">We agree with the district court that Ring Power is an additional insured under the plain language of the Commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>cial General Liability Coverage Form (\u201cCGLCF\u201d), Associated\u2019s insurance contract with Amerisure. Ring Power\u2019s Rental Agreement with Associated includes the following indemnification language: \u201cLessee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lessor ... against all loss, liability and expenses ... by reason of bodily injury including death.... \u201d Thus, Associated specifically assumed liability to indemnify Ring Power for bodily injury resulting from Associated\u2019s rental of equipment. Correspondingly, Ring Power\u2019s Rental Agreement with Associated qualifies as an \u201cinsured contract\u201d under Associated\u2019s insurance contract with Amerisure, as it is a \u201ccontract ... under which [Associated] assume[s] the tort liability of another party to pay for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 ... to a third person....\u201d Associated\u2019s insurance contract with Amerisure covers liability \u201c[assumed in a contract or agreement that is an \u2018insured contract\u2019, provided the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement....\u201d Thus, Ring Power is an additional insured under the plain language of the CGLCF by virtue of its insured contract with Associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Moreover, Ring Power is an additional insured under the plain language of the Advantage General Liability Extension Endorsement (\u201cAGLEE\u201d), which modifies the CGLCF. The AGLEE includes the following language, expanding the breadth of those insured under the CGLCF:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">3. Each of the following is also an insured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">h. Any person or organization who is the lessor of equipment leased to you to whom you are obligated by virtue of a written contract to provide insurance such as is afforded by this policy, but only with respect to their liability arising out of the maintenance, operation or use by you of such equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Amerisure contends that since \u201cyou\u201d refers to the Named Insured, here, Associated, Ring Power\u2019s insured contract cannot qualify because the rented equipment was being operated by an R <em>&amp; </em>R employee at the time of the accident. As such, Ameri-sure argues, Ring Power\u2019s liability does not arise out of \u201coperation ... by [Associated].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The relevant question is whether R &amp; R\u2019s operation of the equipment \u201car[ose] out\u201d of Associated\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d of the equipment. \u201cThe term \u2018arising out of is broader in meaning than the term \u2018caused by\u2019 and means \u2018originating from,\u2019 \u2018having its origin in,\u2019 \u2018growing out of,\u2019 \u2018flowing from,\u2019 \u2018incident to\u2019 or \u2018having a connection with\u2019 the use of the\u201d equipment. <em>Hagen v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>675 So.2d 963 (Fla. 5th Dist.Ct.App.1996) (en banc). Associated allowed its subcontractor to use the rented equipment; R &amp; R\u2019s use certainly flowed from and had a connection with Associated\u2019s use of the equipment. Accordingly, because R <em>&amp; </em>R\u2019s use of the equipment arose out of Associated\u2019s use, Ring Power is an insured under the plain language of the AGLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
