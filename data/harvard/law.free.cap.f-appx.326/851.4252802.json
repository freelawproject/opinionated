He was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentence of 60 months of imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which was based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine. We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Suazo argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reduce his sentence because the district court erroneously believed its authority to reduce his sentence was limited by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-24\">The district court could not have imposed a guidelines sentence that was lower than the statutorily mandated minimum penalty. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 212, 172 L.Ed.2d 157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>(2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 559 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Accordingly, Suazo has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a reduction of his sentence. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DISMISSED as moot, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
