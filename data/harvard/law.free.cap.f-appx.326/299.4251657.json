Escajeda argues that imposing his revocation sentence to run consecutively to his sentence for his drug offense resulted in an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The district court considered the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when exercising its discretion to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See Gall v.
