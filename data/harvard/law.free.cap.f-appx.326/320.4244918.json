This court affirmed his conviction and sentence, and his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was unsuccessful. Jones then filed a purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he raised claims related to his indictment, trial, and sentence. The district court determined that Jones\u2019s alleged \u00a7 2241 petition was actually a \u00a7 2255 motion over which it lacked jurisdiction. The court thus dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Jones appeals that dismissal. He argues that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion to amend. He also contends that he is entitled to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, that the district court misinterpreted <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001), and that the merits of his claims should be considered because he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Jones has shown no abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion to amend. <em>See United States v. Saenz, </em>282 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.2002). He also has not shown that the district court erred by determining that his alleged \u00a7 2241 petition was best construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Finally, Jones has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s interpretation of binding caselaw, nor has he shown that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
