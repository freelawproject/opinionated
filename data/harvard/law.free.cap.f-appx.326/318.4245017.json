The district court denied the motion, and the Defendants now appeal. The Defendants contend that they were entitled to relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the jury award because (1) the award of $2.5 million in general damages was disproportionate and excessive; (2) the award of $563,343 in lost future wages was not supported by the evidence; and (3) the jury\u2019s allocation of fault was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial or remittitur rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge; that exercise of discretion can be set aside only upon a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>Eiland v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>58 F.3d 176, 183 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see Foradori v. Harris, </em>523 F.3d 477, 504 (5th Cir.2008). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Defendants were not entitled to a new trial or remittitur for essentially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Order and Reasons. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
