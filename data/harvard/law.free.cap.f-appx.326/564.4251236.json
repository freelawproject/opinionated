United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000). Federal courts may issue a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), which states that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). The bar for <em>coram nobis </em>relief is high, and the writ may issue only when (1) \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe error involves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular or invalid.\u201d <em>Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Because federal prisoners, like Blue, may make use of the statutory remedy of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>coram nobis </em>relief is unavailable to them. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1274 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cCoram nobis </em>relief is unavailable to a person, such as the appellant, who is still in custody.\u201d); <em>United States v. Broum, </em>117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">In affirming the district court for this reason, we note in passing that the court correctly concluded that Blue\u2019s <em>coram no-bis </em>motion should not be treated as a \u00a7 2255 motion, because Blue had already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and had not obtained from this court leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, as required by \u00a7 106 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>1214, 1220-21. <em>See Garcia, </em>181 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
