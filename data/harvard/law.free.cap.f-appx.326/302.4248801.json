Samaniego argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced in light of Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that Amendment 709 modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 and 4A1.2, and, thus he is entitled to have his criminal history score recalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) (May 2008). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a district court does not abuse its discretion by denying a reduction in a sentence based on Amendment 709. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Samaniego has failed to show that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 709 did not apply retroactively and could not be used to support a motion under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Samaniego concedes that the district court was correct in its determination that he is not entitled to relief under Amendment 706 because he was convicted for a powder cocaine offense and not a crack cocaine offense. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Samaniego\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
