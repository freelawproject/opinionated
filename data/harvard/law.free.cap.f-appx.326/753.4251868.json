He asserts that the sentence he received is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">Marinero contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, was not created based on empirical evidence and double-counted his prior crime of violence. Because Marinero did not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence on this ground in the district court, we review this appellate argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). He has not established that the district court plainly erred by relying on \u00a7 2L1.2 to impose his sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">Marinero also maintains that the sentence was greater than needed to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He notes that he returned to the United States to find work and reconnect with his family and that his prior criminal history was caused by a history of alcoholism. Marinero further contends that his offense was not inherently evil and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d The district court heard Ma-rinero\u2019s allocution about his reasons for returning and his problems with alcohol but elected to impose a sentence within the applicable range. The court\u2019s statements at sentencing reflect the court\u2019s concerns about the severity of Marinero\u2019s prior offenses. Marinero has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in selecting a sentence or, consequently, that the within-guidelines sentence imposed is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
