Texas prisoner # 389529, moves for permission to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the denial of his motion for preliminary injunction. In that motion, Turner sought to compel prison officials to comply with his dietary restrictions, allegedly necessitated by both his peanut allergy and religious practices. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Turner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">A movant for a preliminary injunction must demonstrate (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat that failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury, (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause to the adverse party, and (4) that the injunction will not have an adverse effect on the public interest. <em>Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991). Turner argues that his injuries from the inadequate meals are irreparable because they constitute violations of his First and Eighth Amendment rights and affect his health. We have previously held, however, that \u201cprisons need not respond to particularized religious dietary requests to comply with the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Bara-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>nowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 122 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 707, 169 L.Ed.2d 553 (2007). Additionally, Turner\u2019s brief is devoid of legal argument demonstrating that the prison\u2019s policy to not adhere to special dietary needs during lockdown is unreasonable, and he has therefore waived review of that issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). In light of <em>Baranowski, </em>Turner\u2019s inadequate briefing, and the lack of evidence supporting Turner\u2019s allegations of physical injury, Turner has failed to show that the allegation of irreparable injury has arguable merit with regard to his First Amendment free-exercise claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">With regard to his Eighth Amendment claim, \u201c[t]he deprivation of food constitutes cruel and unusual punishment only if it denies a prisoner the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 214 n. 3 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u2018Whether the deprivation of food falls below this threshold depends on the amount and duration of the deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither Turner\u2019s factual allegations nor the evidence adduced in support of his request for injunctive relief evinces a continuous deprivation of food for any period much less a lengthy period. Consequently, Turner has not shown that he has been deprived life\u2019s basic necessities and has therefore shown neither the threat of irreparable harm nor a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">As Turner has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous is incorrect, his request for IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). We note that Turner has already accumulated one strike in <em>Turner v. Mooneyham, </em>266 Fed.Appx. 335 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished). Turner is therefore cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
