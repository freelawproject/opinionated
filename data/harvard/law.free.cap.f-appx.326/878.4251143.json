Hernandez filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 seeking to be deported to Peru before completing his sentence. He now moves to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The district court denied Hernandez leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons stated in its order denying relief. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Hernandez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">This court reviews the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>See Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., </em>565 F.3d 228, 232 (5th Cir.2009). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the \u201ccourt accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 170 L.Ed.2d 63, <em>and cert. denied, \u2014U.S. </em>\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Hernandez\u2019s bald assertion that the record shows that the Attorney General ordered the relief he requested is unsupported by any evidence. This assertion is not a well-pleaded fact, but it is at best gross speculation based on the letters in evidence and at worst an intentional misrepresentation of that evidence. The district court did not err in finding that Hernandez\u2019s petition had not presented a claim for habeas relief that was plausible even when viewed in the light most favorable to Hernandez. Hernandez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Hernandez has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
