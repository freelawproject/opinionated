The district court\u2019s applied the career offender guideline under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and sentenced Wilson to 188 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Wilson contends that the district court erred by imposing the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">A defendant is a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 if \u201c(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Wilson challenges only the third element, arguing that the district court erred by applying the career offender enhancement based solely on his pre-sentence report\u2019s characterization of the two prior convictions underlying the enhancement, a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation with intended other felony and a federal conviction for conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>While the district court was not provided materials independent from the pre-sentence report documenting these prior convictions, Wilson\u2019s counsel admitted at sentencing that Wilson was in fact convicted of the burglary and conspiracy offenses. The district court was permitted to rely on this admission in determining that those convictions could be used as a basis to enhance Wilson\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">After filing a written objection challenging Wilson\u2019s burglary conviction \u201cas a basis for asserting he is a career offender,\u201d Wilson\u2019s counsel conceded at the sentencing hearing that Wilson\u2019s burglary and conspiracy convictions satisfied the requirements of the career offender guideline, stating, \u201cYes, statutorily and pursuant to the sentencing guidelines those would qualify, I can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d In light of this concession, Wilson waived the issue whether those convictions fall within the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of the career offender enhancement. <em>See United States v. Salazar, </em>542 F.3d 139, 145-46 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1669, 173 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2009). Wilson also briefs no such argument in this court and thus has waived any such challenge here. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 647 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
