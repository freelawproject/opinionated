California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Morganfield has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Morganfield\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CRImP. 36. The restitution order states the amount of restitution as both \u201c$387,405.87\u201d and \u201c$387,406.87.\u201d The judgment should be amended to reflect that the amount of restitution is $387,406.87, which is the total of the victims\u2019 individual restitution awards. The judgment\u2019s reference to \u201c$387,405.87\u201d should be deleted and replaced with \u201c$387,406.87.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-23\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Mor-ganfield\u2019s pro se motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
