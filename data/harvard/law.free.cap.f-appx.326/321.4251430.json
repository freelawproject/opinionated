The claim is for employee healthcare benefits pursuant to an insurance policy. The district court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and granted defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Stipulated Facts and Uncontested Material Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In its Order and Reasons entered on July 31, 2008, 571 F.Supp.2d 728, the district court carefully explained that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the basis, <em>inter alia, </em>of the stipulations that were agreed to. For example, the court correctly found that \u201c[t]he Joint Stipulation contains calculations demonstrating that the Bank has been over-reimbursed by $55,401.22.\u201d The court also properly declared that \u201cthe contract was unambiguous and fully integrated,\u201d so \u201cthe Bank cannot maintain its detrimental reliance claim.\u201d Also, the bank accurately found that there was no negligent misrepresentation, because the alleged misrepresentation, <em>via </em>a letter, \u201coccurred after the Bank purchased the extension coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This matter is more than seven years old, has received ample judicial scrutiny, and needs to be brought to a close. Essentially for the reasons scrupulously explained by the district court in its comprehensive opinion, its rulings on the motions for summary judgment are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
