With one addition, we therefore AFFIRM the final judgment of the district court essentially for the reasons stated in its well-reasoned and thorough opinions dated December 6, 2006, 2006 WL 3531644, and April 18, 2008, 2008 WL 1805481.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">We note one point. Appellant now acknowledges that suit against the Board is barred by the Eleventh Amendment but argues that the district court should have permitted him to amend his complaint to include Board Members in their official capacities as defendants. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s characterization, the district court did not restrict the amendment to additional claims against Defendant Foti. The order explicitly allowed \u201cclaims against the proper defendant(s).\u201d Heedless of this order, the amended complaint did not name Board Members in their official capacities as defendants. Appellant\u2019s erroneous belief that the district court\u2019s order implicitly prohibited him from doing so does not provide a ground for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"A2y\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
