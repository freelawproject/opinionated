On appeal, McAffee argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to sentence him below the amended guideline range was error in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-21\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s request for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). We also review <em>de novo </em>questions <em>of </em>statutory interpretation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-26\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement provides that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). The policy statement does allow for one exception, <em>see id., </em>but that exception is not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On this record, it is unclear whether the district court declined to sentence McAffee below the amended guideline range for discretionary reasons, or because it concluded that it lacked the authority to do so. We need not resolve that issue, however, because either way, McAffee\u2019s argument is foreclosed by recent precedent. In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-94 (11th Cir.2009), we held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and thus, the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>See id. </em>(holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
