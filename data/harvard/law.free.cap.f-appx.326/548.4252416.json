Vallejo pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to import one or more kilograms of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. The district court sentenced Vallejo to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, which we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Vallejo, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 473 (11th Cir.2005) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">In his section 3582(c)(2) motion before the district court, Vallejo, then proceeding <em>pro se, </em>relied on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. In addition, Vallejo alluded to section 3582(c)(2) relief based on other unspecified amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines related to mitigating-role reductions and the computation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. The United States of America (\u201cthe Government\u201d) responded, asserting that Amendment 706 did not apply because Vallejo\u2019s conviction did not involve crack cocaine. Then represented by counsel, Vallejo replied, in which he conceded that Amendment 706 did not apply to him because he was not convicted of a crack cocaine offense. Vallejo did not discuss or mention the other amendments, to which he had previously alluded in his initial <em>pro se </em>motion. In its order denying relief, the district court found only that Vallejo was not entitled to relief under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">On appeal, Vallejo argues that the district court, once it denied relief under Amendment 706, erred by failing to consider whether he was also entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) based on Amendments 668 and 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines, the unspecified amendments alluded to in Vallejo\u2019s initial <em>pro se </em>motion. He contends that, because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) rendered the Guidelines advisory, the district court possessed the authority to grant him relief under Amendments 668 and 709, despite the fact that the Sentencing Commission did not make these amendments retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citations omitted). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements unless it is made pursuant to an amendment that the Commission has made retroactive through its inclusion in U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Vallejo did not waive his argument regarding Amendments 668 and 709 as well as <em>Booker, </em>precedent nonetheless forecloses the same. We have held that, in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, a district court\u2019s discretion is limited by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201cConcluding that <em>Booker </em>and Kimbrough<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we hold that a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S.Feb.10, 2009) (No. OS-8664). Because the Sentencing Commission did not make Amendments 668 and 709 retroactive, a district court would violate Commission policy by granting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on these amendments. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) and (a)(2)(A). Because the district court lacked discretion to contravene Commission policy in Vallejo\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, any error by the district court in failing to address Amendments 668 and 709 was harmless. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. Moreover, <em>Booker </em>neither provided a district court with an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Vallejo\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) nor granted a district court authority to disregard the policy statements set forth in \u00a7 lB1.10(a). <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. Thus, Vallejo\u2019s claim that even non-retroactive amendments may serve as a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) lacks merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-4\">. <em>Kimbrough v.
