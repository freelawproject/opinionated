The offense occurred on or about May 31, 2003; however, the Government did not file the indictment until January 9, 2008. On appeal, Castillo argues that the Government\u2019s pre-indictment delay violated his due process rights and that the district court clearly erred in not making specific findings on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">Castillo did not raise the issue of pre-indictment delay prior to sentencing, nor did he manifest an intention to preserve the issue for appeal by entering a conditional guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915-16 (5th Cir.1992). A review of the plea colloquy reveals that the district court provided the appropriate admonitions to ensure that Castillo entered a voluntary guilty plea and understood the consequences of entering the plea. <em>See Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>see also United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 524 (5th Cir.2001); Fed. R. Chim. 11. Accordingly, because Castillo entered an unconditional and voluntary guilty plea, this court is precluded from considering the merits of his pre-indictment delay claim. <em>See United States v. Sealed Appellant, </em>526 F.3d 241, 242 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 521, 172 L.Ed.2d 383 (2008); <em>Bell, </em>966 F.2d at 915-16; <em>United States v. Brice, </em>565 F.2d 336, 337 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
