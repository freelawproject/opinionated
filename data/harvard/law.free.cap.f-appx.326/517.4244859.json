On appeal, Hightower argues that the district court erred in finding that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence due to the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender, because <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission has noted that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">The district court did not err in denying Hightower\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (holding that a district court lacks authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when the defendant was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender). Additionally, Hightower\u2019s <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>arguments are foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
