TPCIGA challenges the BRB\u2019s award of disability benefits, attorney\u2019s fees, and interest under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>TPCIGA contends that (1) it was not liable under state law for penalties, attorney\u2019s fees, and interest; (2) it was not liable for attorney\u2019s fees because it had accepted the recommendations of the informal conference; and (3) the agency\u2019s factual findings in respect to causation and disability were not based on substantial evidence. Finding these arguments unpersuasive, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">TPCIGA is a state-created association which pays claims for insolvent insurers. Claimant Escareno was injured while working for Friede-Goldman. While Es-careno\u2019s claim was pending, both Friede-Goldman and its insurance carrier, Reliance, became insolvent. Accordingly, TPCIGA became the insurer and the sole respondent that defended against Eseare-no\u2019s claims before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">' On March 17, 2000, Escareno was struck on the right side of his head and shoulder by a metal frame weighing approximately 350 pounds during the course of his employment. He was subsequently treated for headaches, dizziness, and depression. He sought ongoing disability and medical benefits under the LHWCA. The case was presented to an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">The ALJ concluded that Escareno presented a <em>prima, facie </em>showing that his injury was compensable under the LHWCA. Based on a review of the record as a whole, the ALJ concluded that the claimant established a causal relationship between his employment and his headaches, dizziness, and depression. Accordingly, the ALJ awarded the claimant temporary total disability compensation from March 18, 2000 through April 23, 2000, partial disability compensation from April 24, 2000 through May 17, 2000, and temporary total disability from May 18, 2000 and continuing. The ALJ also awarded Escareno medical expenses and interest. Initially, only Reliance and Friede-Goldman were held liable; however, because they became insolvent during the proceedings, Escare-no moved for reconsideration to hold TPCIGA liable. In ruling on the motion for reconsideration, the ALJ concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that TPCIGA would be liable for all interest, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees related to the case. After the ALJ issued its decision on the motion for reconsideration, Escareno filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees and TPCIGA filed a response. On March 20, 2007, before the ALJ reached any decision in respect to attorney\u2019s fees, TPCIGA filed a notice of appeal to the BRB in respect to the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits and its declaration on reconsideration that TPCIGA is liable. On June 19, 2007, the ALJ awarded Escareno attorney\u2019s fees. In an unpublished decision, on December 17, 2007, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision awarding benefits and holding TPCIGA liable but declined to consider the ALJ\u2019s decision as to attorney\u2019s fees because it was not part of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">TPCIGA now timely petitions this court for a review of the BRB\u2019s December 17, 2007 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">II. TPCIGA\u2019s Designation as a Carrier</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">TPCIGA, for the first time in this petition, contests that it is a LHWCA carrier and challenges subject-matter jurisdiction. As in a similar case involving TPCI-GA, <em>Levingston Ship Bldg. Co. v. Pelaez, </em>312 Fed.Appx. 711, 713 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished), here, \u201c[bjefore the ALJ, TPCI-GA repeatedly referred to itself as Leving-ston\u2019s carrier. The ALJ similarly referred to TPCIGA in that way. And, although TPCIGA referred to itself as Levingston\u2019s \u2018insurer\u2019 before the BRB, it did not contest its carrier designation.\u201d For the same reasons as in <em>Levingston, </em>\u201c[hjaving repeatedly referred to itself as the carrier and not contested that designation before the BRB, TPCIGA is estopped from contesting that designation now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Levingston, </em>\u201c[t]o the extent TPCIGA\u2019s contention is properly read as a challenge to the DOL\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014rather than merely a repetition of its precluded challenge to having been designated a carrier\u2014we reject it. The DOL indisputably has jurisdiction under the LHWCA\u201d and \u201cTPCIGA is liable under the LHWCA for penalties, attorney\u2019s fees, and interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">III. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The BRB did not address TPCI-GA\u2019s argument that it is not liable for attorney\u2019s fees because it had accepted the agency\u2019s recommendation after the informal conference. In the only order currently before us for review, the BRB declined to review this issue because the \u201cemployer has not properly appealed the administrative law judge\u2019s award of a fee.\u201d In its petition, TPCIGA fails to identify any errors in BRB\u2019s refusal to address this issue on procedural grounds, but, instead, challenges the merits of the underlying fee award. Accordingly, TPCIGA has failed to properly and timely exhaust its administrative remedies as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees by failing to properly abide by the BRB\u2019s procedure. We decline to address this issue. <em>See Cox v. Benefits Review Bd., </em>791 F.2d 445, 447 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Hix v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>824 F.2d 526, 527-28 (6th Cir.1987); <em>Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>644 F.2d 827, 832 (9th Cir.1981) (declining to review issues not properly presented to the BRB); <em>see also Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County, Fla. v. Finch, </em>414 F.2d 1068, 1072 (5th Cir.1969) (\u201cThe general rule of appellate review from decisions of an administrative agency is \u2018that courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952))); <em>Public Citizen, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A., </em>343 F.3d 449, 461 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, a party cannot judicially challenge agency action on grounds not presented to the agency at the appropriate time during the administrative proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">IV. Causation and Extent of Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThis court ... reviews decisions by the BRB to determine whether it has adhered to its proper scope of <em>review </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with the law.\u201d <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2004). In respect to causation and disability, TPCIGA is requesting this court to overturn the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination because the ALJ relied on the claimant\u2019s expert testimony rather than TPCI-GA\u2019s expert testimony. \u201cAn ALJ is a factfinder and is entitled to consider all credibility inferences. He can accept any part of an expert\u2019s testimony; he may reject it completely.\u201d <em>Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, </em>332 F.3d 283, 292 (5th Cir.2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The agency\u2019s determination is supported by expert testimony and we have no basis to overturn its findings as to causation and the extent of injury because these factual findings are based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
