In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Martinez challenged his guilty plea conviction and sentence for possession with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">After Martinez filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, he filed in the district court a motion for appointment of appellate counsel or for review of his case. The district court granted this motion, allowed Martinez to withdraw his guilty plea, and ordered the case be set for trial. The district court was without jurisdiction to grant such relief. <em>See Shepherd v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>372 F.3d 326, 329 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Lairsey v. Advance Abrasives Co., </em>542 F.2d 928, 932 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">We construe the district court\u2019s grant of relief as a request for remand and authorization to grant relief. <em>See Willie v. Continental Oil Co., </em>746 F.2d 1041, 1046 (5th Cir.1984). The request is GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for re-entry of its order granting relief and for further proceedings as are necessary. Martinez\u2019s motions for a COA and leave to proceed IFP on appeal are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
