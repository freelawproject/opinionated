Because Cherry received a 240-month statutory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), his sentence was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1. Consequently, the district court did not err in finding that Cherry was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because his guideline range was not lowered by the Amendment. The court properly rejected his arguments that: (1) his minimum mandatory sentence was invalid because it was based on a drug quantity not charged in the indictment or found by the jury, in violation of <em>Apprendi;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and, (2) <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>made the sentencing guidelines advisory. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Cherry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As noted above, this appeal concerns the denial of Cherry\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We begin by reviewing the relevant facts regarding his underlying criminal conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In January 1993, a federal grand jury returned a first superceding indictment charging Cherry with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count One), possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count Three), use of a firearm in a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Four), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Five). Rl-198 at 63-65. Prior to Cherry\u2019s trial, the government filed a notice stating that, based on Cherry\u2019s prior drug conviction, it would seek a sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). A jury found Cherry guilty on all counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) (Nov. 1992), the probation officer set the base and total offense level at 32, because Cherry had distributed more than fifty grams, but less than 150 grams of crack cocaine. Specifically, the probation officer found that Cherry\u2019s involvement was limited to a transaction that concerned 80.5 grams of crack cocaine. Based on the total offense level and a criminal history category of IV, the calculated guideline range was 168 to 210 months of imprisonment. However, because a mandatory minimum term of 240 months of imprisonment applied under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), due to Cherry\u2019s pri- or felony drug offense, the probation office determined that 240 months was the applicable minimum guideline sentence. Cherry was also subject to a sixty-month consecutive sentence on Count Four pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">At sentencing, among other objections, Cherry argued that there was no eviden-tiary basis for holding him responsible for 80.5 grams, considering the amount of crack cocaine that was reasonably foreseeable in connection with Cherry\u2019s activities and Cherry\u2019s ignorance of the quantity involved. Rl-198 at 70-71. The court overruled the objection and adopted the PSI\u2019s factual statements and guideline calculations. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78. The court sentenced Cherry to the mandatory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>term of 240 months of imprisonment for Counts One and Three, and a consecutive sixty-month term of imprisonment for Count Four.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 84. Cherry appealed his sentence to us and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>40 F.3d 389 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In March 2008, Cherry filed the present motion to reduce his sentence, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), after which the district court appointed a federal public defender to represent Cherry. The district court also ordered the probation office to prepare a supplemental presentence investigation report (the \u201c2008 PSI\u201d). Rl-198, 199. In the 2008 PSI, the probation office concluded that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize the court to modify Cherry\u2019s sentence because the amendment did not affect his guideline range, as he was subject to a 240-month statutory minimum sentence. In its court-ordered response, the government argued that the district court should deny Cherry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence prevented the amendment from reducing Cherry\u2019s guidelines range. Rl-202 at 2. The government noted that in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding all sentencing determinations are to remain unchanged. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The government also argued that a court granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not apply the sentencing guidelines in an advisory fashion, and, even if the guidelines were advisory, Cherry\u2019s sentence would be unchanged because the court is still bound by the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums after <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In his response, Cherry, through counsel, argued that his mandatory minimum sentence was invalid, because no drug quantity was ever alleged or pledged to the jury, in violation of <em>Apprendi. </em>Rl-207 at 3-4. Cherry recognized that <em>Apprendi </em>had not been held to be retroactive, but argued that the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding renders the judgment no longer final. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Cherry argued that, because he cannot be subjected to the statutory minimum, the amendment lowered his guideline range from 168-210 months to 135-168 months. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 6-7. Cherry also argued that under <em>Kimbrough </em>the court could consider the treatment disparity between crack and powder cocaine in determining a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">The district court found that because Cherry was subject to a statutory minimum term of 240-months of imprisonment, Amendment 706 did not lower his sentencing guideline range. Rl-208 at 1. Accordingly, the district court found that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize the court to reduce Cherry\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Cherry filed a motion to reconsider asking the court to address his arguments concerning the invalidity of his minimum mandatory sentence and <em>Apprendi. </em>Rl-209. In denying this motion, the court rejected Cherry\u2019s argument that <em>Apprendi </em>was applicable because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) rendered his judgment no longer final for the limited purpose of imposing a reduced sentence. Rl-210 at 1-2. The court found Cherry\u2019s argument to be contrary our circuit precedent as established in <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 3582 only provides discretion to reduce a sentence following the lowering of a sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582 does not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>tute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing and all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged except for the guideline range amended after the original sentencing); and <em>United States v. White, </em>251 Fed.Appx. 658, 659 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (holding that because <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable on collateral review, the court did not err in using the defendant\u2019s original sentence as the starting point for granting the government\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence for substantial assistance). Rl-210 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On appeal, Cherry argues that he was erroneously subjected to a mandatory minimum of 240-months of imprisonment because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), under which the jury convicted him, indicates no minimum mandatory sentence and only a 360-month maximum sentence. He asserts that the court had the authority to correct his illegal sentence because, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), his judgment was no longer final for the purpose of reducing his sentence. Cherry also contends that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have facts that are essential to his sentence charged by indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt were violated because his sentence was based on facts that were neither charged by indictment nor found by a jury. He posits, however, that his case does not turn on the application of <em>Apprendi </em>because he was erroneously subjected to a mandatory minimum sentence. Cherry also argues that (1) under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough, </em>the sentencing guidelines are advisory in all contexts, (2) his sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing \u2014 noting that the court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing conduct \u2014 and (3) based on our ruling in <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), the district court erred in concluding it lacked authority to consider the crack/powder sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Cherry also argues that he is not asking to apply <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>retroactively, because he is not challenging his 1993 sentence; instead, he invites us to apply <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>to the district court\u2019s 2008 sentence. He contends that his sentence was unconstitutional because he received a 240-month sentence in 2008, based on judge-made findings, where no drug quantity was alleged with respect to his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Cherry further argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, one exception is for \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels, was made retroactive effective 3 March 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the Sentencing Commission, a reduction of a term of imprisonment would be inconsistent with its policy statements \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment did \u201cnot have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, we have held that a defendant whose original sentencing range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, since the amendment would not lower his applicable guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008) (denying reduction for defendant subject to career offender guideline), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 5.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">A. <em>Applicability of the 2^0-Month Statutory Mandatory Minimum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), any person who possesses with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base \u201cafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, ... shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years[.]\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (in the context of collateral review). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce a sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3) (noting that proceedings \u201cdo not constitute a full resen-tencing of the defendant\u201d). A district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (holding the district court correctly declined to re-examine the number of marijuana plants involved in the drug offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">At Cherry\u2019s original sentencing, the district court found that Cherry was responsible for 80.5 grams of cocaine base, and it is uncontested that Cherry was previously convicted of a felony drug offense. Rl-198 at 77-78. This previous felony drug offense, in turn, served to enhance Cherry\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum sentence to 240-months of imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (for offenses involving more than fifty grams of crack cocaine, requiring that the 120-month minimum be increased to a 240-month minimum if the offense was committed after a conviction for a prior felony drug offense). The district court, considering Cherry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, did not have the authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reexamine the amount of drugs for which Cherry was held responsible. <em>Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563. The court also did not have the authority to reexamine the amount based on <em>Apprendi </em>because the court could not apply <em>Apprendi </em>retroactively for the purpose of disturbing factual findings it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>required to leave intact. <em>Id.; see also McCoy, </em>266 F.3d at 1258. Cherry argues that he is not seeking to apply <em>Apprendi </em>retroactively because his judgment was no longer final for the purpose of resentenc-ing and instead asserts that he seeks to apply <em>Apprendi </em>to the 2008 sentence imposed by the district court. These arguments have no merit because Cherry was not eligible for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As a result, Cherry was never resentenced, so there is no 2008 sentence to which to apply <em>Apprendi. </em>Because <em>Apprendi </em>is a Supreme Court decision, as opposed to a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission, <em>Apprendi </em>cannot serve as an independent basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Cf. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Consequently, the district court did not err in finding that the 240-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) was still applicable to Cherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">B. <em>Statutory Minimum Sentences and Eligibility for Relief Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Where the statutory minimum sentence exceeds the top end of the applicable guideline range, the statutory minimum becomes the guideline. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s application notes indicate that the operation of \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\u201d would prevent an amendment from \u201chav[ing] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Consequently, a defendant who is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced the sentencing guideline range is not eligible for a sentencing reduction, because the range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that defendant sentenced to statutory minimum was not eligible for a sentence reduction, where even the court at the original sentencing had granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to sentence below the mandatory minimum).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The district court did not err in finding that Cherry was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Cherry\u2019s sentencing guideline range was not affected by Amendment 706, due to being sentenced to a 240-month mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), rather than the guideline range established by \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See id. </em>Although the applicable guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1 was 168 to 210 months, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) required Cherry to be sentenced to not less than 240 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), Cherry\u2019s applicable guideline range effectively became 240 months. This range was not altered by Amendment 706, because that amendment only applies to sentences imposed under \u00a7 2D1.1, <em>see Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, and does not apply to sentences imposed under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), <em>see Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">C. <em>Applicability of Booker, Kimbrough and the \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">To the extent Cherry argues that the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>provide an independent basis to obtain 3582(c)(2) relief, our precedent forecloses his argument. In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664), we held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), \u201cdo not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that \u201ca district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>statements by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1190. We specifically held that the district court was bound by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s limitation on the court\u2019s discretion to impose a sentence below the low end of the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94. Cherry\u2019s argument that under <em>Stratton, </em>district courts always have authority to consider the crack/powder sentencing disparity is not persuasive because <em>Stratton </em>concerned the court\u2019s authority on direct appeal to consider the crack/powder sentencing disparity and did not address the court\u2019s more limited authority to modify sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, because Cherry is not entitled to resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), his arguments concerning the reasonableness of his sentence seeking to apply <em>Booker, Kimbrough, </em>and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, at resentencing are academic. <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding the defendant\u2019s arguments for the application of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>at resentencing were \u201cacademic\u201d because the defendant was not entitled to resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">As explained above, the district court did not err in finding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize the court to reduce Cherry\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Cherry\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-17\">.
