Lee contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to certain crack cocaine offenses. The district court held that it lacked the authority to resentence Lee based on Amendment 706 because Lee was sentenced as a career offender. Lee argues that the was entitled to a reduction because although he qualified as a career offender, the district court\u2019s downward variance of his sentence meant that he was not sentenced as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that was later reduced by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence reduction is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and therefore not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A defendant sentenced under the career-offender provision of \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because Amendments 706 and 713 do not lower the applicable guideline range for career offenders. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Although the district court applied a downward variance in sentencing Lee originally, it still considered him a career offender. The district court never stated that it did not consider Lee a career offender or that the career offender designation overrepresented his criminal history. Instead, after explicitly discussing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Lee\u2019s extensive criminal history, the district court applied a downward variance to reduce the sentencing disparity between Lee and a codefendant. Because Lee was sentenced as a career offender, he is not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
