The district court determined that Pickett\u2019s complaint, challenging the 2004 revocation of his parole, was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, it dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), or alternatively Sections 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"A8s\">Pickett has not adequately briefed any challenge to the determination that his complaint was time barred and, thus, has abandoned the sole issue for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Pickett\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of Section 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Pickett is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">Pickett has not established that his appeal presents the sort of exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, his motion for appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED. Because Pickett has filed a brief, his motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A96\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
