The district court sentenced Hewitt to 80 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. First, Hewitt argues that his computer was illegally searched and seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Hewitt does not challenge the validity of his guilty plea, and a voluntary and unconditional guilty plea waives the right to challenge any nonjurisdictional defects arising before the plea was entered, including a claim of illegal search and seizure. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1999). Because Hewitt\u2019s plea was voluntary and his plea agreement did not reserve the right to assert a challenge to illegal search and seizure on appeal, his argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Coil, </em>442 F.3d 912, 914-15 (5th Cir.2006). Hewitt\u2019s contention that the waiver of his challenge to illegal search and seizure relates to his failure to make a pretrial motion to suppress, as governed by Fed.R.CRIM.P. 12, is incorrect. <em>See Wise, </em>179 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Second, Hewitt argues that the Government should not have been permitted to file objections to Hewitt\u2019s presen-tence report (PSR) beyond the 14-day limitations period provided in Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f)(1). Because Hewitt did not object on this ground in the district court, this issue is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 331 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). To show plain error, Hewitt must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 332. If Hewitt makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">In its out-of-time objections, the Government sought the assessment of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) because Hewitt possessed images involving sadistic conduct and the Government opposed awarding Hewitt an adjustment under the Sentencing Guidelines for acceptance of responsibility. The district court applied the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement, and the district court awarded Hewitt a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E 1.1(a) but did not award the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">While Rule 32(f)(1) requires PSR objections to be filed within 14 days of receipt of the PSR, Rule 32(b)(2) permits the district court to change, for good cause, any time limitations prescribed in Rule 32. Hewitt\u2019s sentencing hearing did not take place until nearly six months after the Government filed its out-of-time objections, and Hewitt has not shown that he was prejudiced in his ability to adequately prepare for sentencing. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 749 <em>&amp; </em>nn. 11-12 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, Hewitt\u2019s substantial rights were not affected because the district court could have imposed the same rulings even absent the Government\u2019s objections, as Hewitt was aware of the underlying images supporting the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>facts supporting the Government\u2019s opposition to the \u00a7 3El.1(b) reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 749 <em>&amp; </em>n. 13; <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Third, Hewitt argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in applying the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) because the Government\u2019s objection concerning this enhancement was based on his results on the Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest (AASI), which results were ultimately excluded from the record by the district court. The Government\u2019s objection concerning the enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) was not based on the AASI results. The \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement applies \u201c[i]f the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\u201d The images possessed by Hewitt included images of \u201cprepubescent females\u201d having \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with adult males, a \u201cminor female\u201d having \u201csexual intercourse\u201d with a dog, and children performing \u201coral sex.\u201d The district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise, in applying the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d 234, 240 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Fourth, Hewitt argues for the first time on appeal that he should have been granted an additional one-level reduction to his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b) for acceptance of responsibility because the Government\u2019s basis for opposing this reduction was invalid as it stemmed from nothing other than his results on the AASI. We review the Government\u2019s refusal to move for the additional level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(b) to determine whether that refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate government end. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2522, 171 L.Ed.2d 802 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">In its filings in the district court, the Government indicated that it opposed the \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) reduction on the ground that Hewitt possessed child pornography because he had a sexual interest in children and that Hewitt was a poor candidate for treatment because he was denying this interest. The Government contends that it was required to expend additional time and resources to refute evidence to the contrary that Hewitt sought to present at sentencing. Current law does not make clear whether the Government\u2019s basis for refusing to file a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion satisfies the standard set forth in <em>Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 378. Thus, any error would not have been clear or obvious, and there was no plain error with respect to this newly raised issue. <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Fifth, Hewitt argues for the first time on appeal that the district court failed to comply with Rule 32(f)(1)(A) and (i)(3). Hewitt\u2019s challenge is unavailing because he has not demonstrated that such errors affected his substantial rights. <em>See Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Sixth, Hewitt argues for the first time in his appellate reply brief that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We do not consider a new claim raised for the first time in an appellate reply brief. <em>United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989). Regardless, the record is not sufficiently developed to allow a fair evaluation of the merits of Hewitt\u2019s claims, <em>see United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 336, 169 L.Ed.2d 236 (2007); <em>United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502-03 (5th Cir.1998), and thus we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"A02f\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
