Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">Robelo-Molina first contends that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, which then affected the weight given to his criminal history. Due to the dismissal of his criminal prosecutions by the Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>setts state court, Robelo-Molina argues that he did not have a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Although Robe-lo-Molina argues that the district court erred in its factual findings, he does not challenge the factual matters set forth in the Government\u2019s exhibits submitted to the district court. Thus, Robelo-Molina\u2019s challenge lies with district court\u2019s characterization of the two Massachusetts prosecutions and hence its application or interpretation of the relevant Guidelines. This is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Valdez-Valdez, </em>143 F.3d 196, 197-98 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>522 F.3d 607, 611 (5th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\">Federal law, not state law, applies to the issue of statutory interpretation and, thus, \u201cwe are not constrained by a state\u2019s treatment of a felony conviction when we apply the federal sentence-enhancement provisions.\u201d <em>Valdez-Valdez, </em>143 F.3d at 200 (internal quotations omitted). In <em>Valdez-Valdez, </em>the Court examined Texas\u2019s deferred adjudication scheme and determined that a defendant\u2019s deferred adjudication under that scheme constituted a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Id. </em>at 198-201. We find no material difference between that case and Robelo-Moli-na\u2019s case. <em>Id.; see also De Vega v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 45, 48-50 (1st Cir.2007). Robelo-Molina\u2019s admission to sufficient facts and continuance without a finding of guilt (\u201cCWOF\u201d) under Mass. Gen. Law ch. 278, \u00a7 18 constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d for sentencing enhancement purposes under \u00a7 2L1.2, notwithstanding the treatment of such procedure under Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Likewise, Robelo-Molina\u2019s procedural challenge to the district court\u2019s assessment of criminal history points based upon his prior Massachusetts prosecutions for threat to commit a crime and assault with a dangerous weapon is without merit. In <em>United States v. Giraldo-Lara, </em>919 F.2d 19 (5th Cir.1990), the Court concluded that a Texas \u201cdeferred adjudication probation\u201d could properly be counted as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 23 (applying \u00a7 4A1.2(f)). Moreover, when considering the same issue presented here, the First Circuit held that a Massachusetts court\u2019s CWOF was a \u201cdiversionary disposition\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(f) and was properly counted as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.1. <em>United States v. Morillo, </em>178 F.3d 18, 20-21 (1st Cir.1999). Robelo-Molina has not shown that the district court committed any procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Robelo-Molina next argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He contends that the guidelines range of imprisonment overpunished him and yielded a sentence greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes. Robelo-Mo-lina also challenges the presumption of reasonableness that this court may apply, asserting that \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed and not entitled to deference because, like the Guideline at issue in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), it was not based on empirical data or adopted under the usual Sentencing Commission procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Although Robelo-Molina generally argued for a sentence below the guidelines range based on his mental health and other factors, he did not contend that the sentencing regime created by our precedent was unduly restrictive, nor did he raise his policy challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, we review those arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Given our dispositions of similar arguments in <em>Campos-Maldonado </em>and <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008), we conclude that Robelo-Molina has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>demonstrate any reversible plain error. To the extent that Robelo-Molina may have preserved a substantive reasonableness challenge to his sentence based on his particular circumstances, he has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that we afford the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
