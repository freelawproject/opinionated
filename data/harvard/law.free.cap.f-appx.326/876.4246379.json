In December 2006 Driver was sentenced to consecutive terms of 48 months and 60 months of imprisonment. By order entered April 9, 2008, the district court subsequently granted a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent amendments to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, and reduced Driver\u2019s 48-month sentence to 38 months. Driver also filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his conviction. By order entered April 9, 2008, the district court denied Driver\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Driver did not appeal this decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-25\">Driver now appeals the district court\u2019s July 10, 2008 order denying Driver\u2019s motion, filed June 30, 2008, for copies of the search warrant that was executed in his criminal case and his arrest records. Driver alleges that these records are necessary to proceed with a claim challenging his conviction for possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking offense. He also attacks the validity of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-26\">Because Driver did not timely appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, any challenge to his conviction is not before this court. When Driver filed his motion for documents in the district court, he did not have a \u00a7 2255 motion pending before the district court; thus, Driver is not entitled to free copies of the documents in question. <em>See United States v. Carvajal, </em>989 F.2d 170, 170 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Walker v. United States, </em>424 F.2d 278, 278-79 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-27\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Driver\u2019s motion. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
