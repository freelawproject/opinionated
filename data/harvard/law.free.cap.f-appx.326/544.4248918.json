In April 2008, Hubbard moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence in accordance with Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels for cocaine base offenses. The district court found that Amendment 706 applied and reduced his prison term to 210 months. Nevertheless, the court denied his request for further reduction in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Hubbard now appeals the court\u2019s decision, arguing that the court erred by not reducing his sentence further based on those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentence range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, the Sentencing Guidelines provide that, in general, a district court \u201cshall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">Hubbard\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and, accordingly, do not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
