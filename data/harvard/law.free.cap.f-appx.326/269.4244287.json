Hannawacker sued her former employer, Defendant-Appellee Kansas City Southern Railway Co. (\u201cKCS\u201d), asserting violation of Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). She based her claims on assertions of discrimination based on her sex, a disability, and retaliation for filing an EEOC charge. Following due proceedings had, the district court granted the motion of KCS for summary judgment and dismissed all claims asserted by Ms. Hannawacker. She timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">We have now reviewed the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, including the district court\u2019s Memorandum Ruling which patiently and exhaustively analyzes all aspects of Ms. Hannawacker\u2019s claims, disposing of each in order and ultimately dismissing all by summary judgment. Our review satisfies us that the district court got it right for all the right reasons. As nothing would be gained here by reiterating the district court\u2019s disposition of Ms. Hannawacker\u2019s claims against KCS, we affirm for essentially the same reasons as set forth by the court in its Memorandum Ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
