He contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Citing <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Rodriguez-Montelvo contends that his second state conviction of possessing a controlled substance is not a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense,\u201d and thus is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He argues that his second state possession offense does not correspond to a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act as required by <em>Lopez </em>because recidivist proceedings were not invoked in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir.2005), this court held that a second state offense of possessing a controlled substance is considered an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because such an offense, if charged in federal court, could be punished as a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). In light of <em>Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>the district court did not err by enhancing Rodriguez-Montelvo\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). In <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), this court affirmed a defendant\u2019s sentence based on <em>Sanchez-Villalobos </em>and held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez </em>did not require it to abandon the holding in that case. Rodriguez-Montelvo concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cepeda-Rios. </em>He raises his argument solely to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">Rodriguez-Montelvo does not allege that the district court committed any other procedural error in imposing his sentence and does not allege that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
