Hamilton appeals his jury trial conviction for theft of mail mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ter by an officer or employee in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709. Hamilton argues that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement during closing argument that the mail in question was delivered by a mail carrier to Hamilton in the Mesquite, Texas post office on February 17. He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper because there was no evidence introduced at trial to establish that the mail was delivered to him on that date. He also argues that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In closing arguments, a prosecutor may only discuss properly admitted evidence and any reasonable inferences or conclusions that can be drawn from that evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA prosecutor may not directly refer to or even allude to evidence that was not adduced at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We review a claim that a prosecutor made an improper argument in two steps.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, we determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s remark was \u201clegally improper.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the remark was legally improper, we determine whether the remark \u201cprejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe determinative question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To determine whether to reverse a conviction for improper prosecutorial argument, we consider \u201c(1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge, and (3) the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">We see no error in the court\u2019s permitting the prosecutor to claim that the mail in question was delivered to Hamilton on February 17, as opposed to some other date, because this was a reasonable inference based upon the evidence introduced at trial. Even if the comment about that date was improper, the error did not prejudice Hamilton\u2019s substantive rights. The jury was cautioned before trial and in the final jury charge that the lawyers\u2019 statements were not evidence. Given the cautionary instructions by the court, the fact that defense counsel made clear during his closing argument that the February 17 date had not been established by the evidence, and the strength of the evidence supporting Hamilton\u2019s conviction, any error by the prosecutor does not cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
