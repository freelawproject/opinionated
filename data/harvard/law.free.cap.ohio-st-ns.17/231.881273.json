It is not admissible to explain or contradict this record by parol evidence, because \u2014 (1.)

Both liens are purely legal, depending upon statutes. If there be any difference, in equity, between them, it is in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s. His papers were ready for judgment at 10 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-10\"><em>O. Bowen, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-11\">It was the duty of the district court that tried the case to find whether, on the 9th of May, 1859, there was such a court in session as could render a judgment <em>before </em>11 o\u2019clock a. m.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-12\">The record was read to the judges, and <em>failed </em>to enlighten or convince them on the subject. It did not show the <em>hour, </em>but only the <em>day </em>the court convened. The district court was therefore constrained to hear other evidence \u2014 to listen to witnesses as to the precise hour when the common pleas commenced its session. That was done, and the issue was found for the defendant. On the record evidence alone, the finding could not, as I can see, have been for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-13\">A liberal and fair interpretation of the language used in the statute warrants no other conclusion, it seems to me, than that the judges shall have authority'to fix the <em>day </em>of the commencement of the term, not the <em>hour.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-14\">*As to the words \u201c specifying precisely the commencement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u2022of the term.\u201d The language and directions of the law would be plainer, and more in accordance with the intent of those who framed it, if those words were stricken out, and the words \u201c specifying the day of the commencement of the term\u201d inserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-5\">As to the order fixing the terms of the court, providing that \u201cthe courts will .convene on the first day, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m.\u201d The making of such an order without any authority of law, and the impossibility of carrying it into effect, should not be treated as conclusive proof that the common pleas did, notwithstanding all the casualties which interrupt, delay, and often defeat judicial proceedings from going on at the precise hour or on the precise day appointed by law, unmistakably commence its term at precisely 10 \u2022o\u2019clock, May 9th.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">It appearing, then, that the plaintiff did <em>not </em>recover his judgment <em>before </em>11 o\u2019clock, May 9th, the mortgage of Messenger, having become a lien on the land at that hour, has preference over the judgment, although the latter was obtained on the same day, but <em>after </em>11 o\u2019clock.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcTL\">A brief statement will present the principal question to be considered in the determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The plaintiff, Davis, recovered a judgment against Joseph Johnson, in the court of common pleas of Union county, at a term which began on the 9th day of May, 1859. The judgment became a lien \u2022on one hundred and twenty-seven acres of land owned by Johnson. The land was mortgaged by Johnson to Messenger, the defendant, and the mortgage was left for record on the 9th day of May, 1859, at 11 o\u2019clock a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The land was subsequently sold upon proceedings to which the plaintiff was not a party; thereupon he brought his action to recover the proceeds of the sale, claiming that his judgment lien was prior to that of the mortgage. The parties were at issue on this question; and, on the trial in the district court, the plaintiff gave in evidence an entry upon the journal of the court of common pleas, whereby it appeared that the judges of the judicial district embracing the county of Union had fixed the times for holding the several terms of the court of common pleas of that county for the year 1859, and had issued their order, \u201c specifying precisely the commencement of the term,\u201d in May, to be on the '9th day of that month, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m. The plaintiff also gave in evidence an entry on the journal of the court of common pleas, showing that the court convened on the 9th day of May, 1859; but the hour at which the court opened is not mentioned, further than is contained in the statement that the court convened on that day \u201cinpursuance of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The defendant then called witnesses to prove that the court did not commence its session until after 11 o\u2019clock a. m. To this evidence the plaintiff objected; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the testimony. To this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The court found that the session of the common pleas was not commenced until after 12 o\u2019clock, noon, on the 9th day of \u2022KMay, 1859; and that before the court opened its session \u2014 at 11 o\u2019clock a. h., on the same day \u2014 the mortgage was filed for record. The court held that the lien of the mortgage was prior to that of the judgment, and rendered a decree against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">This petition in error is brought to reverse the judgment of the \u2022district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">It will be seen that the error alleged is, that the court admitted testimony to prove that the court began its session at an hour later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>than that shown, by the record, as the one fixed by the judges of the district, upon the theory that the term began at the time the court was opened for the transaction of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">No equitable considerations are involved in the determination of this case, for the lien of each party rests alone upon legislative enactment. The mortgage was \u201c delivered to the recorder\u201d on the 9th day of May, at 11 o\u2019clock a. m. ; and there is no dispute but that, under the statute, it took effect and held the land from that time. S. &amp; C. Stat. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">It is equally clear, under the statute, that, inasmuch as that was the \u201c first day of the term at which the judgment was rendered,\u201d the land was \u201c bound for the satisfaction thereof\u201d on the same day. S. &amp; C. Stat. 1064; Follett <em>v. </em>Hall, 16 Ohio, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Here arises the real question in the case: At what time in the day did the judgment lien attach ?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">There would be little difficulty in answering this question, but for the holding, in the case of Follett <em>v. </em>Hall, that a \u201cmortgage handed in for record on the first day of the term of court, but before the court actually convenes, will prevail against the lien of a judgment recovered at the same term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">While we are not, at this time, disposed to question the correctness of the decision of that case, we think, to say the least, that this ease is so clearly distinguishable from that, that it can not be regarded as an authority conclusive of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In that case, the legislature had declared on what day of the month the court of common pleas should be held, and nothing more. 1 Curwen\u2019s Stat. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"AgCI\">*In this case, the court was held pursuant to an act passed April 12, 1858. 4 Curwen\u2019s Stat. 3089. By that act it was made the duty of the judges of the Supremo Court \u201cto fix and prescribe the times for holding the terms of the district courts for the next succeeding y\u00e9ar.\u201d It was made \u201cthe duty of the judges of the common pleas, in each and every common pleas district in the state, to fix the times for the terms of the court of common pleas in each of the counties in their respective districts.\u201d It is further made the duty of the judges of-the common pleas to \u201cissue their written order to the clerk of the court of common pleas of each and every county in their district, specifying precisely the commencement of the term of the district court, and of the several terms of the court of common pleas in said county, and in all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>counties in said district.\u201d It is also made the duty of the clerk to enter this order \u201cupon the journal of the court\u00a9f common pleas, and also upon the journal of the district court in his said county, . . . and said entries shall be full and sufficient evidence as to the legal terms for holding said courts as therein specified.\u201d It is also further provided that the courts shall be held \u201c at the times fixed and ordered by the judges in accordance with the foregoing provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">It is shown by the record, given in evidence by the plaintiff, that the judges fully performed the duty required of them by this act. They \u201cfixed the times for the terms of the court of common pleas,\u201d and issued their order \u201c specifying precisely the commencement of the term.\u201d They specified both the day and the hour at which the term should begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Whether they were required to fix the hour of the commencement of the term or not, they, at least, had full authority to do so. Having in their order specified \u201cprecisely\u201d the hour at which the term would commence, the statute provides that the record of that order \u201cshall be full and sufficient evidence as to the legal terms for holding said courts as therein ordered,\u201d and that the court shall be held \u201c at the times fixed and ordered by the judges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Giving effect to these provisions of the statute, we feel constrained to hold that, no matter at what hour the court convened, where a term of the court was held, \u201c the legal *term \u201d began \u201cprecisely\u201d \u2014 in the language of the statute \u2014 \u201cat the time fixed and ordered by the judges;\u201d and that the record of this order was \u201c sufficient \u201d and conclusive \u201c evidence as to the legal term \u201d held pursuant to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">This construction of the statute is not only in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the act, but best harmonizes with other statutes that relate to the commencement of terms of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Except as otherwise provided in special cases, judgments date as of the first day of the term, and become liens on lands upon that day, at whatever time in the term they may be rendered. There may be no session of the court on the first day of the term, by reason of the absence of the judge (when, by section 593 of the code, the sheriff is required to adjourn the court till the next day), still a judgment rendered on a subsequent day of the term, would become a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s land from the first day of the term, in virtue of the positive provisions of the statute. If, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>fore, the lien attaches on the first day, when there is no .session of the court, a rule declaring the commencement of the lien to be at the opening of the court for business, must meet with embarrassing exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In such a case it would be difficult to determine at what time in the day the lien attached, unless it begins with the first moment that the term might by law begin, or, as in this case, where the time is fixed of record, in pursuance of a statute, \u201cprecisely\u201d at the time specified in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This construction renders the commencement of judgment liens fixed and certain, as we are warranted in presuming that the legislature intended they should be. Any other construction would give rise to great practical difficulties. The commencement of judgment liens would rest only in the uncertain memory of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Eor obvious practical reasons, it is the undoubted policy of the law to render the commencement of all legal liens on lands definite and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">We think that the law, and the record made in pursuance of the law, conclusively fixed the time when the lien of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment attached; and that was at the commencement *of the legal term of the court, on the 9th of May, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">It follows, that the district court erred in overruling the objection of the plaintiff to the evidence offered by the defendant, to prove that the court of common pleas opened at a later hour, and in holding that the lien of the judgment did not attach to the land until the court opened for business' on the 9th of May.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"As5\">White, Welch, Brinkerhoee, and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
