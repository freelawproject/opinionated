Said brothers and sisters of the said grandmother, Margaret Clayton, upon the death of said Mary Margaret, intestate, took possession of said lands, as-her next of kin, of the blood of her father, Lewis Clayton, from whom the lands descended to her; and under proceedings in partition by them, as such next of kin, all their title to said lands became vested in the defendant, John Drake, subject to the dower of the said Christina, widow of said Lewis, which, in the same proceedings in partition, was duly set off and assigned .to her.

The act of 1853 is the law under which the descent was cast, Lewis Clayton, the father of the intestate, is the ancestor, within the meaning of the act, from whom the intestate came.

The case is governed by the sixth subdivision of section 1 o\u00ed the act of 1853, which casts the descent upon the <em>\u201cnext of kin \u201d to </em>the intestate, of the blood of the ascestor from whom the estate came. If John and Joseph Clayton had been living at the time of the death of Mary Margaret Clayton, they would have inherited equally with the parties on the side of the defendant, but the children left by Joseph, and the children and grandchildren left by John, can not take as the representatives of their father and grandfather. 62 O. L. 32. The children or grandchildren of the uncles of the father can not be \u201cnext of bin\u201d to the child (intestate) so long as there are uncles and aunts of the father living. 29 Penn. 118, 121. The words \u201cnext of kin\u201d in our statute do *not include representatives to any extent. Nor should the common-law method of computation be applied to the statute. 13 Ohio St. 21, 42; 2 Bla. 224, 225; 4 Kent, 411; 2 Hilliard on Real Prop. (3 ed. 1855), 201, see. 61; 9 Ohio St. 330; 19 Ohio, 39, 40.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-6\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A--\">The descent in this case is governed by the first section of the act of March 14,1853 (3 Cur. 2270), \u201cregulating descents.\u201d And under the state of facts found by the court below, and agreed to by counsel, it is clear that the case is to be determined by the provisions of the sixth clause of that section, which passes the estate \u201c to <em>the next of kin to the </em>intestate, <em>of the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate came.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The assignments of error raise two questions. First, which of the two, Lewis Clayton, the father of the intestate, or Thomas Clayton, her grandfather, is to be regarded as <em>\u201cthe ancestor from from whom the estate came.\u201d </em>The estate came to the intestate, in this instance, by <em>immediate </em>inheritance from her father, Lewis Clayton, and that he is therefore <em>\u201c </em>the ancestor from whom the estate came,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, has been fully settled by prior adjudications of this court. Prickett <em>v. </em>Parker, 3 Ohio St. 394; Curren <em>v. </em>Taylor, 19 Ohio, 36; Brewster <em>v. </em>Benedict, 14 Ib. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Second. As the paternal grandfather and grandmother of the intestate are both of the blood of her father from whom the estate came, it is claimed that the plaintiffs are a portion of the next of kin to the intestate, and that the court below erred in wholly excluding them from any share of the lands descended.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">And here the first question made by counsel for plaintiffs, is as to the proper mode of ascertaining who are \u201cthe next of kin,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. There are two modes of computing, the degrees of kindred; one, according to the <em>canon </em>law, and the other, by the rules of the <em>civil </em>law. On the subject of descents, the common law of England adopts the former mode of computation, which the plaintiffs claim is to be followed, in this state. But we think it is clearly otherwise; and that the rule of the civil law is the ^common law of this country in the computation of degrees of kindred. This is believed to be xmiversally the case in all the states of the Union, except, perhaps, in North Carolina, where the common-law rule prevails, generally, and in Now York, with respect to the more remote relations. 4 Kent, 412; Walker\u2019s Am. Law, 346, 348; 2 Hilliard on Real Prop. 202, sec. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The common-law rules, or canons of descent in England, grew out of the feudal system of tenures, and a state policy designed to perpetuate that system; and both are foreign to the spirit of republican institutions. The common-law mode of computing kindred was an important element in that policy, which, being wholly unsuited to our circumstances, our habits of thought, and political institutions, has never been regarded as the law of this state. As to personal property, even in England, their statutes of distribution are governed and construed by the rules of the civil law; and the next of kin is determined by the rule which it furnishes. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 422; T. Raym. 596; 2 Ves. Sr. 214; 2 Bla. Com. (Kerr\u2019s) 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">If we adopt the canon or common-law rule, the children and grandchildren of John and Joseph Clayton, as well as the brothers and sisters of the defendant Drake, together with their children and grandchildren, would all stand related in equal degree of consanguinity to the intestate, and would be entitled, each, to an equal share of the lands in question. \u25a0 A rule which would thus make parceners of father, son, and grandson, is unknown in Ohio. Indeed, such is not the theory of the plaintiff\u2019s petition, in which the plaintiffs claim merely as <em>legal representatives </em>of John and Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Clayton, and not as the next of kin. Adopting, then, the rule of the civil law, the brothers and sisters of Margaret Clayton, the gi\u2019andmother, being the grand-uncles and grand-aunts of the intestate, are nearer of kin to her than the plaintiffs, who are the children and grandchildren of her grand-uncles. The plaintiffs, therefore, are not entitled, under the statute, to share in the inheritance, unless, as is claimed by their counsel, they can be let in as the legal representatives of the deceased grand-uncles, whose children and grandchildren they are. Rut the clause of the statute which governs the descent in this case, gives the estate to the next of kin, ^without any reference to the principle of representation. In the prior clauses of the same section, when' the estate is given to \u201c children,\u201d or to \u201c <em>brothers and sisters,\u201d </em>the principle of representation is expressly provided for by the words \u201c or their legal representatives.\u201d And, as there are no such words in this clause, it is not easy to perceive how the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d can be construed as embracing any who are <em>not </em>next of kin. These words describe a class of persons to be ascertained by the rules of law, and when ascertained, the words become as definite and specific as the words \u201cchildren,\u201d or \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d and are as effectually exclusive of all other persons. None of these words, <em>ex vi termini, </em>import representation, and whether that principle shall be applied in respect to any of them, must depend on the express provisions of the statute. If they direct the admission, of \u201c legal representatives \u201d into any class of descendants, they must, of course, be admitted; but if they exclude representatives, or are silent on the subject, courts have no power to enlarge the plain terms of the statute, by admitting into any class those who do not come within the meaning of the words descriptive of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The first statute of descents, in this state, was that of February 22, 1805 (1 Chase, 515), which gave ancestral lands, first, to the children of the intestate and their legal representatives; and in default of this class, then to the brothers and sisters of the intestate and their legal representatives, provided they were of the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate came; and, in default of this class, then to the next of kin to the intestate. This statute seems to have adopted the'rules of the civil law, which,'in general, gave the inheritance to the next of kin to the intestate, and admitted no representation among collaterals, after the children of the intestate\u2019s brothers and sisters. And, in exact accordance with this rule, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the provisions of the English statute of distribution of 22 and 23, Charles II., ch. 10, which ordered distribution \u201cto every of the next of kindred of the intestate who are in equal degree, and those who represent them; provided, that there be no representation admitted .among collaterals, after ^brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children.\u201d 8 Stat. At Large, 347, secs. 6, 7 ; Carter <em>v. </em>Crawley, T. Raymond, 496; 2 Ves. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Various statutes of descent have been enacted in this state since 1805, which have, from time to time, increased the number of specified classes to whom the estate shall descend, and have also extended the principle of representation to such of them as was thought proper. In each of these statutes there is a clause casting the descent upon the \u201c next of kin,\u201d upon failure of the specified persons and classes. But in no case, until the act of March 4,1865, amendatory of the statute governing this case (62 Ohio L. 32), were these words, \u201cnext of kin,\u201d followed, or qualified by the words, \u201c or their legal representatives,\u201d or any equivalent expression. We know of no case in which it has ever been held, under any of these statutes, that \u201c next of kin\u201d can be construed so as to include <em>representatives </em>of next of kin. That representatives are not within the meaning of the words themselves seems to have been the legislative understanding, when, by the amendatory act of 1865, the legal representatives of the next of kin were expressly named.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The words of the statute are clear and explicit; \u201cthe estate shall \u25a0 pass to the next of kin to the intestate.\u201d The plaintiffs are <em>not the </em>next of kin; and to admit them to a share in the inheritance in any other character would be an act of direct legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"ArdD\">The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-8\">Day, C.
