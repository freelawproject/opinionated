The sections of an ordinance, like those of a law, or the parts of an instrument of writing, are to be construed together, and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>possible, so that all the parts may stand.

As to the language of the two sections of the ordinance: Section 12: \u201c He shall not be allowed to receive any perquisities or .fees,\u201d Section 9 : \u201c For each and every license granted he shall receive the fee of one dollar.\u201d A fair and reasonable construction of the language, we think, is this: The mayor shall not receive any perquisites or fees, except as provided in the laws of this state and in this ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">The fee of one dollar is not to be paid by the applicant for the license, but by the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">3.

The 9th section of the ordinance in question requires that the one dollar should pass into the Mayor\u2019s hands, without saying distinctly whether it should be for his benefit or not, in that section; but section 12 immediately says that he is to derive no benefit from the funds coming into his hands, under any law allowing fees but those of the state. We claim that each of th'ese sections clearly and explicitly says what we have described. Now are these two sections inconsistent in the slightest degree ? Not at all. The clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>and evident meaning of the two, taken together, is that the money is to be for the benefit of the city, and paid over into the treasury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b54-5\">Brinkerhoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJM\">It appears from the record, that George Hatch, plaintiff in error, axxd who was also plaintiff below, was mayor of the city of Cincinnati from April 8, 1861, to Apxdl 8, 1863; and that, in August, 1863, he brought suit against the city, ixx the Superior Court of Cincinnati, to recover from the city a'sum of money, which was the aggx*egate of the sums which had been received by him as mayor, from applicants for various licenses, which he, as mayor, under the ordinances of the city, was authorized to issue, and had issued, and which sums he had paid over into the city treasury. It fui'thex\u2019more appeax\u2019S, <em>from </em>the special finding of facts contained in the X\u2019ecord embodying the ordinances of the city bearing upon the question between the parties, that for several years preceding the 9th of July, 1856, and up to and including the time of the plaintiff\u2019s two years\u2019 service as *mayor, the mayor was axxthorized to exact from the applicant, a fee of one dollar for each and every license issued by him, under the ordinances of the city; and this in addition to the <em>price </em>for a license \u2014 sometimes less, axid often mxxch more thaxx one dollar per license \u2014 exacted by the city and payable into its treasury. Axxd up to that date \u2014 July 9, 1856 \u2014these fees, with others not here necessary to notice, constituted the compensation of the mayoi-, for his official services as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">But on that day the city council passed an ordinance, the 9th and 12th sections of which are as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cSection 9.....The mayor, for any good cause shown, may revoke any license issued or granted by him. For each and every licexxse granted, he shall receive the sum of one dollar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201c Section 12. The salary of the mayor shall be two thousand dollars per annum, payable quarterly; and he shall not be allowed to receive any perquisites or <em>fees, for any services </em>pex\u2019formed, <em>except in such cases as are provided for in the laws of the State of Ohio.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMo\">Duxdng the time of his official service, the plaintiff received the fees of one dollar for each licexxse issued by him, and, for the greater portion of that time, paid them over to the city treasury; and afterward brought this actioxx to recover them back. The court below, both at sjxocial and general term, decided agaixist him. And this petition iix error is prosecuted to reverse those judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Counsel on both sides admit, ixx argument, that the case depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>on the proper construction and meaning of the 9th and 12th sections of the ordinance above quoted. If the mayor, under the 9th section of the ordinance, was entitled to receive for his own use a fee of one dollar for each license issued by him, in addition to his salary, fixed by the 12th section, then the court below was wrong; but if the ordinance intended to continue, for the benefit of the city treasury, the charge, as theretofore, of one dollar each for licenses issued by the mayor, and, in lieu thereof, to give the mayor a fixed annual salary, then it was right. We are of opinion that it wasright.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">*It is clear, from the terms of the 9th section of the ordinance, that the city did not intend to relinquish, in favor of applicants, the charge of one dollar each for licenses granted by the mayor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201c Section 9. . . . . The mayor, for any good cause shown, may revoke any license issued or granted by him. For each and every license granted, he shall receive the sum of one dollar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">And that these fees were not intended to be received by him for his own individual benefit, we think is equally evident from the 12th section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201c Section 12. The salary of the mayor shall be two thousand dollars per annum, payable quarterly; and he shall not be allowed to receive any perquisites or fees, for any services performed, <em>except in such cases as are provided for in the\u25a0 laws of the State of Ohio.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">We think that the meaning and policy of these sections of the ordinance are alike obvious and wise. They were intended to retain, for the benefit of the city, a charge of one dollar for each license issued by the mayor, and to compensate him, for official services, by a fixed salary; and thus to remove from hiln the temptation to refrain from revoking a license which might have been improperly granted, and the temptation to the granting of a license which ought to be withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">There are fees to the mayors of cities, \u201c provided for in the laws of the State of Ohio,\u201d as contradistinguished from the city ordinances \u2014 such as relate to the taking of depositions, etc., for example \u2014 which, by the provisions of this ordinance, are reserved for the individual benefit of the mayor; but they do not include fees for licenses, \u2022 <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b55-12\">Day.
