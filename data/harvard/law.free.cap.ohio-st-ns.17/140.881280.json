Reserved in the district court of Hamilton county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-9\">On the 12th of May, 1853, the plaintiff, William Resor, contracted with the defendant, the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad Company, to-sell and convey to that company a perpetual leasehold interest in a tract of land, for the consideration of $8,000 of their capital stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-10\">At this date the plaintiff had title only to an undivided moiety of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-11\">Immediately after the execution of this contract, the railroad company, with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, entered into possession of the land, and proceeded to erect upon it a turn-table and other improvements necessary for the operation of the road, and, from the same date, paid the ground-rents and taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-12\">On April 16, 1855, the plaintiff, erroneously supposing that, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>virtue of proceedings in partition, he had acquired title to the estate in severalty, executed a deed in due form to the railroad company, handed it to the president of the company and asked for the issue to him of certificates of the stock. The president took the deed and sent it to the solicitor of the company, for an examination of the form of conveyance, and of the plaintiff\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">The deed was pronounced satisfactory. But irregularities were discovered in the proceedings for partition, and a few weeks elapsed before these irregularities were corrected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">When the title had been made good, the plaintiff was 'informed that it was satisfactory to the company, and he then called for his certificates of stock, and received a promise that they should be issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">On August 29,1855, having repeatedly asked for the issue of these certificates, and having been always met with the promise that they should be issued, but the neglect to do so having continued, the plaintiff formally notified the railroad company that he declined to receive the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\">On the 23d of January, 1856, the deed executed by the plaintiff, and which had from the day of its date remained in *the possession of the railroad company, was by its president placed on record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-9\">On the 1st of March, 1856, and again on the 1st of May, 1856, the railroad company executed mortgages, in the usual form of railroad mortgages, upon all its property, to secure large issues of bonds, which are still unpaid \u2014 the mortgagees and bondholders being ignorant, at the time they became such, of any claim set up by the plaintiff to the premises in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-10\">On the 14th of June, 1858, plaintiff commenced the present action in the common pleas against the railroad company and said mortgagees, asking to have his deed delivered up and canceled, and said contract between him and the railroad company rescinded, and praying for a release of all interest and claim of the mortgagees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-11\">The plaintiff afterward filed an amended petition, in which he claims a judgment against the railroad company for the value of the stock at the time it was first demanded, being 28 per cent, of its nominal value, and an order to sell the premises on default of payment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-12\"><em>V. Worthington </em>and <em>J. </em>Burnet, for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkA\">argued (among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>points not decided) that, as the mortgages do not describe specifically the plaintiff\u2019s land, but cover over, in general terms, the property <em>owned by the company, </em>they were not in any degree or in any sense received on the faith of the company\u2019s pretended title to the plaintiff\u2019s land; and cited Ogden <em>v. </em>Ogden, 4 Ohio St. 182.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-4\"><em>Thos. G-. Mitchell, </em>for defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU50\">argued that where one of two innocent parties must suffer, he who, by any carelessness, undue confidence, or neglect, has been.the means of enabling the other to be deceived, must bear the loss; that this is a much safer rule than that of <em>prior in tempore potior in jure; </em>and that Ogden <em>v. </em>Ogden, 4 Ohio St. 182, is against the plaintiff, as to the rights of the bondholders in the present case, who purchased the bonds on the faith of a mortgage on the road and appendages of the company, of which the land purchased from the plaintiff was an important portion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-5\">*Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR1B\">It is unnecessary to decide the question mainly argued by counsel \u2014 whether the deed was in fact <em>delivered </em>\u2014or to inquire into plaintiff\u2019s right, as between him and the railroad company, to rescind the contract of sale or to have a <em>lien </em>for the value of the stock. We think the plaintiff, under the circumstances, is estopped.!, as against these mortgagees, from denying the delivery of the deed, or setting up any claim to the premises. By <em>his own acts </em>in putting the land and the deed of conveyance therefor into the possession of the company, he has plainly said to the world that the company was the <em>owner </em>of the land, and might safely be dealt with as such. To allow him now to set up claims inconsistent with these acts and to the prejudice of the mortgagees, would be, in effect, to work a fraud upon their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s petition will be .dismissed as to the mortgagees; and the plaintiff, if he desires it, can have judgment against the company for the value of the railroad stock \u2014 28 per cent. \u2014 with a junior lien upon the mortgaged premises for its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-8\">Day, C. J., and White, .Bsxnkebhoee, .and . Soott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
