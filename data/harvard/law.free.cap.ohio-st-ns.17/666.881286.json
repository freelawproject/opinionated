The petition also alleges the other necessary qualifications of Collins, as a legal voter at said election, but it does not aver that the judges in rejecting his ballot acted \u201ccorruptly or in bad faith.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-8\">The defendants (plaintiffs in error) interposed an answer containing eight several grounds of defense, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-9\">1. They admit that Collins, at the time he offered to vote, was a male citizen of the United States, and of the State of Ohio; that he was over twenty-one years of age; that he was a person having a \u201cvisible admixture of African blood,\u201d with a preponderance of white blood; and that the fact, that he had much more of white than African blood, was at the time of his offering to vote plainly apparent, and was proved to *their satisfaction. But they allege that Collins, having been challenged by them on the ground of the said visible admixture of his blood, agreeably to the provisions of the aet'of April 16, 1868 (65 Ohio L. 97), did not by the kind of proof required in said act, and in the manner therein prescribed, show that he was such white male citizen, and that they, therefore, deny the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-10\">2. That Collins, when so challenged and required to answer the questions propounded to him agreeably to the provisions of said act, among other things, answered that his parents lived together as husband and wife, but refused to answer whether they were married.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-11\">3. That when asked one of the questions specified in said act, to wit: \u201c In the community in which you liv.e, are you classified and received as a white or colored person, and do you associate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>white or colored persons?\u201d Collins answered as follows: \u201cI know of no established and well-defined classification of persons as to color and shades of color, and am, therefore, unable to say how I am classified. I associate with persons white and persons black, when agreeable to all parties.\u201d And that Collins failed and refused further or more fully to answer said questions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">4. That Collins, having been required to produce witnesses to testify to his qualifications as a voter, as required in said act, produced his father, who, upon being sworn, refused to answer whether he and the mother of said Collins were married, although he answered that they lived together as husband and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">5 and 6. That Collins called two other witnesses, when so required, one of whom refused to answer some of the questions prescribed for such witnesses by the act, and the other of whom refused to answer any of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">7. That Collins having been also challenged by said judges under the provisions of the act of April 17,1868 (65 Ohio L. 100), on the ground that he had come into the city of Xenia to attend, and was \u2022,hen attending, a university there, as a student, and having been \u00abworn and questioned as required by said act, answered as follows: <em>L </em>That he was not a qualified elector at the time he commenced attending said university; *2. That he came there to attend 3aid university; 3. That his parents did not, at the time he came there, reside in said ward; 4. That his parents had subsequently removed to, and were then in said ward, but he did not know whether they intended to make it their home; 5. That he, the defendant in \u2022error, had no other place of residence than said ward; 6. That he did not think it was his intention to make said ward his permanent residence, but did not know how long he should remain there, and had, as yet, no place selected or in view to go to. And therefore the respondents averred that, \u201c although said Collins had resided in said ward more than thirty days next preceding said election,\u201d yet under the provisions of said act of April 17, 1868, he was not entitled to vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-8\">8. That Collins refused, when tendered to him agreeably to the said act of April 16, 1868, to take the final oath or affirmation prescribed in the 5th section thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-9\">To this answer Collins demurred generally, denying that either or all of said several grounds of defense constituted a bar' to his .action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The demurrer was overruled in the common pleas, and judgment thereupon entered for defendants. To reverse this judgment, Collins prosecuted his petition in error in the district court of Greene county, where, the judgment of the common pleas was reversed; and now, to reverse this judgment of the district court, leave is asked to file a petition in error here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-5\"><em>E. H. </em>Munger, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-6\">The general question raised in this case is as to the constitutionality of the two acts relating to elections, passed April 16,1868, and April 17, 1868. On this question:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-7\">1. The presumption is always in favor of the validity of a statute. Before the court will deem it their duty to declare an act of the legislature unconstitutional, a case must be presented in which there can be no reasonable doubt. 1 Ohio St. 77, 86; 15 Ohio St. 574, 591; 10 Ohio, 237; Ex parte McCullam, 1 Cowen, 564.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-8\">2. The constitution, in general terms, vests the whole legislative power of the state in the general assembly. Art. 2, *see. 1. The limitations upon this power are special, and must be, either by express prohibition or necessary implication. 15 Ohio St. 573, 592, and cases cited; 11 Ohio St. 534, 542; People <em>v. </em>Morrell, 21 Wend. 563.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-9\">3. Article 5, section 1, the only provision in the constitution which confers the right to vote, provides the qualifications of electors ; and, by necessary implication, those not thus qualified are disqualified. It necessarily follows that the possession of the qualifications is the subject of proof, and dependent upon evidence. Hence, the legislature has power to require proof of qualifications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-10\">4. The legislature having power to require proof of qualifications, has, also, for the same reason, power to regulate it by prescribing the kind of proof and the mode and manner of supplying it; this power being limited by implication of the constitution so far as to prevent the legislature from excluding or prohibiting or unduly restraining the exercise of the right to vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-11\">5. But, according to the authorities above cited, the courts will not set aside an act of the legislature regulating the proof of qualifications, unless the legislature has <em>clearly </em>transcended its powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-12\">6. Under the same grant of power in the old constitution, the legislature exercised the right to require proof, and to regulate it as to kind and mode of supplying it, in regard to similar qualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cations. Yet the right of this legislature had never been questioned' by citizens or courts ; and the framers of the new constitution made no change in this respect. Swan\u2019s old Stat. 307, sec. 12; 1020, secs. 13-18 ; S. &amp; C. 545, 546, secs. 82, 85; Const. of 1802, art. 1, sec. 1, art. 4, sec. 1, et seq.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-4\">7. The act of April 16, 1868 (65 Ohio L. 97), does not, in any of its provisions, expressly exclude or prohibit a qualified elector from voting. The act confines itself to providing for proof \u2014 the kind of proof and the manner of furnishing it \u2014 in reference to the qualifications of persons of <em>mixed blood </em>\u2014 \u201c having a distinct and visible admixture of African blooda class of persons recognized to exist by the constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">*8. Nor is the kind of proof required, nor the manner of furnishing it such as are manifestly or necessarily impossible, nor such as necessarily to work an exclusion, or clearly a restraint of the exercise of the constitutional right of the qualified elector to vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\">9. It is not a sufficient objection to say that a qualified elector <em>might </em>not be able to furnish the proof in the manner prescribed by this statute; for he might, by his own act, put the proof beyond his power. The same objection could have been, but never was, made to the act of 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\">10. Though the visible admixture of African blood is, under the statute (sec. 1), a <em>cause of challenge, </em>it is not made a <em>disqualification. </em>The doubt of such a person\u2019s qualification, raised by his appearance, is made sufficient to put him to the proof of the degree and proportion of blood, color alone being a very uncertain test. The statute of 1841, sec. 18, still in force, requires the judges to challenge every person they may know or suspect not to be duly qualified as. an elector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-8\">11. The questions prescribed in section 1 are material and pertinent. None of them appear to tend to the prejudice of .the right of voting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-9\">12. It is to be presumed that the legislature saw good reason for requiring (in sec. 2) the .person challenged to produce two other credible witnesses to prove his qualification, though this is not required of other persons. This is owing to the difficulty of proving the proportion of white blood. The legislature may require a reasonable amount of proof and number of witnesses to any extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>short of plainly excluding or unnecessarily hindering the exercise of the right of voting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-5\">13. To avoid delay, and to afford the opportunity for all qualified electors to vote, notwithstanding numerous questions and answers, section 3 provides for additional clerks. And it is not to be presumed that the judges will act improperly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-6\">14. While the law does not expressly provide that the challenged party may call more than two witnesses besides himself, neither \u2022does it say he may not nor shall not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-7\">15. The rule prescribed in section 4, as to what evidence shall *not be received, etc., is reasonable. The objection to it goes to the power of the legislature to prescribe what sort of evidence shall be competent to prove a given fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-8\">16. It can hardly be objected that the vote of the person challenged shall be rejected because he refuses fully to answer the questions prescribed (sec. 5). The statute of 1841 (sec. 14) contains the same provision. To the objection that the section requires the rejection of the person\u2019s vote, for the refusal of either of his witnesses to fully answer the questions prescribed by this statute, it may be answered: (1.) The legislature has power to require witnesses to prove a fact, and to prescribe questions and to require them to be answered. (2.) It is the fault of the party, knowing the \u2022questions to be asked, if he produces witnesses that will not answer them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-9\">17. To the objection that to answer some of the questions might (as claimed in this case with the father) subject the witness to criminal prosecution or disgrace, I reply that this is not a necessary consequence. The constitution does not prohibit the legislature from requiring a witness to give evidence against himself in .any other than a criminal case. If the challenged party produce a witness that can not or will not answer, it is his own fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-10\">18. The rule for testing the qualification of electors who have a visible admixture of African blood does not conflict with the constitutional provision that \u201c all laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation throughout the state.\u201d The rule prescribed by this law does so operate wherever it finds a subject to act upon. The same obj\u00e9ction could as well be made to the lawfor prescribing a different rule to persons challenged as aliens, or non-residents, etc. See Cass <em>v. </em>Dillon, 2 Ohio St. 616, 617 ; 6 Ohio St. 269, 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-11\">19. As to the act of April 17, 1868 (65 Ohio L. 100): At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>adoption of the constitution, the legal definition of domicil or residence was, in the strict sense, <em>\u201c </em>that place where a person has his <em>true, fixed, permanent home, </em>and principal <em>establishment, </em>and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\u201d Story\u2019s Confl. Laws, 50, 51, sec 41. See also election statutes of 1841, sec. 2; of 1856, sec. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-5\">The language of the constitution (art. 5, see. 1), expressly ^giving to the legislature the power to provide the <em>time </em>of residence in the county, township, and ward, carries with it an implied power otherwise to define and qualify residence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-6\"><em>John Little, </em>for defendant in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-7\">1. A person offering to vote at any election in this state can not be challenged, except for want of some of the constitutional qualifications conferring the right to vote. Williams <em>v. </em>Whitney, 11 Mass. 432; Lincoln <em>v. </em>Hutchins, Id. 350; 3 Conn. 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-8\">2. The first section of the statute in question (65 Ohio L. 97) requires the judges to challenge any person having a <em>\u201c </em>distinct and visible admixture of African blood,\u201d for that reason. This is not a valid cause for challenge under the constitution, because a person may have a visible admixture of African blood, and still be a white man within the meaning of the word \u201cwhite\u201d in the' constitution. He may have a preponderance of white blood. Gray <em>v. </em>The State, 4 Ohio, 354; Anderson <em>v. </em>Millikin, 9 Ohio St. 570. Therefore this requirement of the statute is unauthorized and void, being a causeless infringement and restraint upon the exercise of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-9\">3. It is not competent for the legislature to require the kind and manner of proof provided for in this statute. To <em>regulate </em>the exercise of a constitutional right is a very different thing from <em>retarding, restraining, </em>or <em>preventing </em>the exercise of such right. Provisions for regulating the right to vote must be <em>reasonable, uniform, </em>and designed to <em>secure </em>and <em>f\u00e1cilitate </em>the .exercise of that right in a <em>prompt, orderly, </em>and <em>convenient </em>manner. Capen <em>v. </em>Foster, 12 Pick. 488; Lehman <em>v. </em>McBride, 15 Ohio St. 573; Hulseman <em>v. </em>Rems, 41 Penn. St. 396; Osman <em>v. </em>Riley, 15 Cal. 48; People <em>v. </em>Pease, 30 Barb. 588. The provisions of the statute in question violates this rule, and are therefore without the scope of legislative authority, and void. C., W. &amp; Z. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Comm\u2019rs of Clinton Co., 1 Ohio St. 77. The act <em>unreasonably </em>requires the challenged person to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>more </em>than satisfy the judges of his right to vote, and is not uniform, applying to one class of voters and not to all, and is not designed to <em>facilitate </em>the exercise of the right to vote, of that ^portion of voters to which it relates, in a <em>prompt </em>and convenient manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\">Again, the act subjects the portion of voters challenged to requirements not exacted of other voters even of the same class, and takes away from that portion means of proof extended to other voters. It is class legislation, in the most odious sense, and violates that provision of the constitution which requires all laws to be of uniform operation throughout the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-6\">4. The provisions of the act are inoperative, because in contravention of the letter and spirit of the \u201c civil rights bill,\u201d commonly .so called in this, that under them, the party challenged on account of his color has not the same right to give evidence as' is enjoyed by white citizens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-7\">5. As to Collins\u2019 refusal to answer whether his parents were married or not: The answer, either way, could not have thrown any light upon the question whether he was <em>white. </em>Can the legislature authorize the rejection of a vote for refusal to answer an impertinent question, and the answer to which might bring discredit upon the voter or his family ? If the legislature have such power, it may convert elections into such an inquisition as to practically subvert the right to vote. If the constitution prohibited bastards from voting, such question would be proper enough; but the constitution provides that the general assembly may exclude from the privilege of voting <em>only </em>those convicted of perjury, bribery, or other infamous crime. Art. 5, sec. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-8\">And the oath itself is one that no man could conscientiously take, for who knows of his own knowledge anything about his <em>parentage </em>or <em>pedigree ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-9\">6. As to the refusal of some of the witnesses to answer fully: Is the voter to be <em>disfranchised </em>for such refusal ? If Collins\u2019 father and mother were not married, the father in refusing to answer the question was justified, for the answer would have subjected him to the liability of a criminal prosecution. Wilkins <em>v. </em>Malone, 14 Ind. 153. Upon the supposition made, it was the father\u2019s constitutional privilege to refuse to answer the question, as it was his privilege under the law. *And whether witnesses rightfully or wrongfully refuse to answer questions, the voter can not help it, and should not be deprived of his vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>7. The voter is the only proper person to answer to his qualifications. People <em>v. </em>Pease, 30 Barb. 589; State <em>v. </em>Hart, 6 Jones (Law), N. C. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">8. The legislature has no power to prescribe a mode of proof of qualification to vote, so as to defeat the right of a single voter. The execution of the statute in question must result, in some instances, in so consuming time in examining voters and witnesses, and thereby incumbering elections on account of a certain class of voters, as to prevent other electors from voting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-6\">9. The attention of the court is directed to the <em>spirit </em>of this statute. Any challenging party may ask other questions than those prescribed, and call any number of witnesses to prove <em>disqualification, </em>but the challenged person is not authorized to ask any witnesses to prove <em>qualification. </em>Any sort of evidence is admitted to prove a man is black, but the person challenged is restricted to-impossible evidence almost, and, in many cases, quite impossible, to prove that he is white. Heavy penalties are visited upon persons for procuring the right to vote against this law, but no penalty is prescribed for thwarting the right of visible admixture electors. Judges are severely punished for <em>receiving </em>votes not lawful, but no <em>penalty is </em>prescribed for <em>rejecting </em>lawful votes. It is made perjury to <em>procure </em>the right to vote by <em>false swearing, </em>but it is not made perjury to <em>defeat </em>the right by <em>false swearing.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-7\">10. The defense that Collins came into the ward, where he offered to vote, to attend a university, and declared he did not intend to make the ward his place of <em>permanent </em>residence, is not sufficient. The record shows that the ward was then his place of <em>\u201cresidence\u201d </em>within the meaning of the constitution, and it was not competent for the legislature to require the residence to be <em>permanent, </em>or to give to the word \u201cresidence\u201d any other than the ordinary meaning attached to it when the constitution was adopted. The meaning of the words contained in the constitution is for judicial, not legislative determination. *Cass <em>v. </em>Dillon, 2 Ohio St 607; Work <em>v. </em>The State, Id. 296; Lehman <em>v. </em>McBride, 15 Ohio St. 573; Chase <em>v. </em>Miller, 41 Penn.

The judgment of the district court must clearly be reversed,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u2022entirely independent of any issue going to the merits of the action, because the demurrer filed to the answer reaches back to the petition, which is bad. <em>A </em>distinct and independent clause of the 10th section of the act of April 16,1868, provides, that in suits brought against any judge of election for rejecting the vote of a porsou having a distinct and visible admixture of African blood, no recovery shall be had in such action, unless the jury are Satisfied on the evidence that the judge of the election, in rejecting such vote, acted \u201c corruptly or in bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">The court is bound to make every reasonable intendment in favor of the constitutionality of the law, and not set aside a proper provision, though other parts of the act may be unconstitutional. Lehman <em>v. </em>McBride, 15 Ohio St. 573-653.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">No averment is made in the petition that the judges of election .acted <em>\u201c </em>corruptly or in bad faith,\u201d and it is apparent from the record that no such averment could have been made, so that this defect could have been cured by amendment on trial. The petition below is therefore bad. Waldersmith <em>v. </em>Waldersmith, 2 Ohio, 156; Edwards <em>v. </em>Owen, 15 Ohio, 506.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">2. The constitutional power of the legislature to lay down a rule, that no recovery can be had unless the judges of election act <em>\u201c </em>corruptly or in bad faith,\u201d can not be doubted. Especially is this the rule in New York, Pennsylvania, and in England, as appears by the citation of authoi\u2019ities by Lane, O. J., in delivering the opinion of the court in Jeffries <em>v. </em>Ankeny, 11 Ohio, 374, where the court .adopted the Massachusetts rule in deciding the law in Ohio to allow an action without an averment of malice. The legislature can clearly change, by law, the rule then adopted by the Supreme Court for the more reasonable rule requiring proof of malice, as laid *down by the highest court in several of our sister states. The State, for use of Rosette, <em>v. </em>Boring, 15 Ohio, 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-8\">3. The court of common pleas, in which this case originated, had no jurisdiction, as appears by the record. .The judges of election \u2022not being liable in damages for rejecting the vote of a person having a visible admixture of African blood, by a clause in the act of April 17, 1868, therefore no judgment could have been rendered \u2014the subject-matter of the action, to wit,- damages, which gives jurisdiction, being taken away. The legislature has clearly this power under section 4, article 4', of the constitution, which prescribes that the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas shall be fixed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>law, and it is decided they can exercise none until conferred bylaw. Stevens <em>v. </em>The State, 3 Ohio St. 453. No principi\u00e9is better settled,, than that courts can not pass upon more abstract questions of law, no matter how important the rights affected by adverse legislation; a point unanimously decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Georgia injunction case, arising under the reconstruction acts of Congress. The Supreme Court of Ohio has no power over constitutional questions, except those arising in quo warranto, mandamus, habeas corpus, and procedendo, and the general assembly may, at any time, take away its appellate jurisdiction in <em>other </em>cases, and this it has done in this case with the common pleas court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-5\">4. The act of April 16, 1868, commonly called the visible admixture law, is constitutional on the points made by the demurrer to the answers in this record. It does not conflict with the preponderance rule as to white blood, laid down by the Supreme Court.. It merely copies the provisions of the election laws of 1841 and 1857, and applies the question of the qualifications of a voter to this same process of proof, following the decisions of the Supreme Court as to the laws of evidence in reference to parentage and pedigree, by which alone preponderance of white blood can be established. The first plea in the answer in this case sets up, that the defendant\u2019s vote was rejected because he offered proof based <em>solely </em>on opinions as to his appearance, which the statute rejects, unless accompanied by the facts as to the parentage of the voter challenged \u2014 a test in strict conformity with the case of *Polly Gray <em>v. </em>The State, 4 Ohio, 453 \u2014 the fountain source of the whole doctrine of preponderance. There it is laid down that \u201c cplor alone is insufficient,\u201d and that preponderance is a question of blood. The legislature adopted this rule, which is supported by the well-known fact, that in mixed races appearance is no test; sometimes the blood of one parent predominating without reference to proportion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">It is set up in the 2d, 3d, and 8th pleas in the answers that the party challenged refused to answer fully the questions and take the oath prescribed by the statute. The universal practice under our election laws now in force, is to reject such votes. S. &amp; C. 546, secs. 14, 15, and 16. The judges of election may even reject the vote after the party has taken the oath that he is twenty-one years of age, etc., and proceed to take further testimony as to his qualifications. Is there anything unreasonable in the questions prescribed in the act of April 16,1868, to require the rule to be made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>less stringent as to persons of mixed, blood, than that at present applied to white men? The question propounded as to whether the parents of the person challenged were married, or lived together as man and wife, is pertinent to establish the proof by which preponderance of white blood can alone be established under the rules of evidence. If marriage of the parents is proven, it lets in testimony as to reputation of parentage, which is excluded where the family relation does not exist, on the well-known principle that a bastard is \u201c nobody\u2019s son.\u201d The oath requires the party to swear, that from his knowledge of his pedigree, he is a white male citizen of the United States \u2014 the only way in which he can know it \u2014 as the fact depends, under our judicial decisions, upon a preponderance of white blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMl\">The same reasoning applies to the pleas Nos. 4, 5, and 6, in the answer as to the questions propounded to the witnesses produced, which they refused to answer. This was an obstinate refusal to give information on the subject of parentage, upon which the party\u2019s right to vote depended; 'and it was his own fault if he produced such witnesses. The law nowhere prescribes the rejection of votes on account of the nature of the answers, but leaves the whole matter to the ^discretion of the judges, as at present; \u25a0for by section 18 of the act of 1841, it is their duty, at any rate, to challenge every one suspected of not being a duly qualified elector. The questions prescribed in the statute do not preclude other questions tending to establish that the party challenged is a white male \u2022citizen of the United States; and the requisition for two witnesses is in strict analogy to the naturalization law of Congress requiring two witnesses in certain cases.

The legislature, in this act, does not interfere with the doctrine \u2022of the Supreme Court as to preponderance of white blood, but lays down rules of evidence to prevent the enormous abuses practiced \u2022under color of that decision, by which the ballot-box is stuffed with votes, without regard to color, in certain localities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-7\">6. It is unnecessary to argue the students\u2019 voting law (act April 17, 1868), because the six judges of the district court'unanimously held it to be constitutional, and but a re-enactment of the present law in more definite terms as to temporary residence.

This act shall be given specially in charge to the grand jury at each term of the court of common pleas by the presiding judge thereof, and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">As connected with this act, is to be considered also the concluding clause in a proviso, upon the same subject, contained in section 3 of the act of April 17,1868 (65 Ohio L. 104), amendatory of the general election law. This section 3, which is an amendment of section 24 of the general law, provides for penalties against judges of election who \u201c shall refuse to <em>receive, </em>or shall sanction the <em>rejection </em>of a ballot from <em>any person, </em>knowing him to have the qualifications of an elector,\u201d and then concludes with this proviso: \u201c Provided, that the provisions of this act, [that is, the general act, of which this is section 24], and the penalties thereto, shall not apply to clerks or judges of election for <em>refusing to receive </em>the votes of persons having a distinct and visible admixture of *African blood, <em>nor shall they be liable for damages by reason of such rejection.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">If these enactments are constitutional, it is plain that the district court erred in holding that none of the defenses interposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>was a good bar to the action. That Collins refused to answer fully all the questions put to him; that either or any of the witnesses-produced by him failed to answer the questions put to them; that Collins failed to take the final oath prescribed in section 5 of the act of April 16, 1868; that the evidence, elicited by direct answers to the statutory questions, failed to show that Collins was a white man \u2014 either of these defenses was a good bar to the action, by express provision of the act of April 16,1868. Besides, it is to be observed, the demurrer to the answer reaches back to the petition, and if it is bad, no matter if-the defenses are all bad, the demurrer must be sustained, and the action fail. If these enactments are valid, the petition itself is probably bad, for two reasons : 1. Because it does not show that in rejecting the vote the judges acted \u201c corruptly or in bad faith;\u201d and, 2. Because it does show that the vote rejected was that of a person having a visible admixture of African blood, in which case it is provided that \u201c the judges shall not. be liable for <em>damages </em>for such rejection.\u201d Possibly the two provisions last referred to may be fairly construed to mean that where there is no corruption or bad faith, there shall be no right of action ; and where corruption or bad faith is shown, an action may be sustained, but no <em>actual </em>damages \u2014 that is, no more than mere <em>nominal </em>damages \u2014 shall be recovered. This is, however, quite immaterial in the present case, as abundant ground of defense under the statute is set up in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The whole case, therefore, resolves itself into a question of the validity and constitutionality of these provisions of law \u2014 the act of April 16, 1868, in connection with the clause denying the liability of the judges for damages, in the act of April 17,1868. It is quite evident that all the provisions of the act of April 16, and the single provision of that of April 17, must stand or fall together. They are all parts of a single scheme, having a common object, and are so interwoven, and so dependent one upon the other, that, no single provision, at least no *one that is relied upon as a defense in this case, can be made to stand, and have full force and effect, if the others are held to be in violation of the constitution. The single question then is \u2014 are these enactments constitutional and valid <em>?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The right of suffrage is guaranteed by the constitution of Ohio to \u201cwhite male citizens.\u201d By the constitution of 1802, it was guaranteed to \u201c white male inhabitants.\u201d Under the constitution of J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>1802 it was repeatedly held by the Supreme Court of the state that men having an admixture of African blood, with a preponderance of white blood, were white men within its meaning, and had the same right to vote as persons of pure white blood. See Polly Gray <em>v. </em>The State, 4 Ohio, 353; Williams <em>v. </em>School Directors, Wright, 579; Jeffries <em>v. </em>Ankeny, 11 Ohio, 372; Thacker <em>v. </em>Hawk, 11 Ib. 376; Chalmers <em>v. </em>Stewart, 11 Ib. 386; Lane <em>v. </em>Baker, 12 Ib. 237; Stewart <em>v. </em>Southard, 17 Ib. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The same was held by this court in Anderson <em>v. </em>Millikin et al., 9 Ohio St. 568, to be the meaning and effect of the present constitution. A colored man, therefore, having more white than black blood, is a <em>white man </em>within the meaning of the constitution, and the legislature have no more power to deny or intrench upon his right to vote than they have to deny or intrench upon that of a man of pure white blood. As electors, both stand equal before the law, and are regarded as white men. If the law in question would be unconstitutional when made applicable to white men of any other description, then it is unconstitutional in its present form. If the legislature have power to deny or abridge the right of suffrage of white men of visible admixture, then they can exercise the same power in regard to <em>white men </em>of black hair, of low stature, of small fortune, of unorthodox religious opinions, or of any other description. Between the legislative power and the legal elector, no matter who or what he is, the constitutional provision stands as a bulwark for the protection of his right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">What the legislature can not do directly it can not do by indirection. If it has no power expressly to deny or take away the right, it has none to define it away, or unreasonably to abridge or impede its enjoyment by laws professing to be merely remedial. The power of the legislature in such cases *is limited to laws <em>\u25a0regulating </em>the enjoyment of the right, by facilitating its lawful exercise, and by preventing its abuse. All reasonable latitude should be allowed to the legislature in the exercise of this power of regulation, and every reasonable intendment in favor of the constitutionality of laws enacted for that purpose should be made by the courts. Such laws are not to be held unconstitutional unless <em>clearly </em>so, and if they will at all bear a construction which makes them consistent with the constitution, they are to receive that construction, and so to be upheld. The true line between laws which take away \u25a0or abridge the right of suffrage, and those which may lawfully be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>enacted to regulate its exercise, is laid down by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Capen <em>v. </em>Foster, 12 Pick. 488. It was there held, substantially, that laws of the latter description must be <em>reasonable, uniform, </em>and <em>impartial, </em>and must be calculated to <em>facilitate </em>and <em>secure, </em>rather than to <em>subvert </em>or <em>impede </em>the exercise of the right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Tried by this rule, what is the character of the law in question? Is it unreasonable, partial, or calculated to subvert or impede the exercise of the right of suffrage by the class of voters to whom it applies? Is it <em>clearly </em>such? We are unanimous in the opinion that it is, and that it has all these unconstitutional elements combined. We speak of the effect, the scope, and spirit of the law, and not of the ultimate object of the legislature, whom as a co-ordinate branch of the government we are bound to respect, and to whom we would attribute no unlawful purposes. But that the effect of the law is to impede the exercise of the right of suffrage by the class of voters referred to, and, to a great extent, to deny the right, and that its operation would be partial and unjust to an extreme degree, any candid man has only to read the law to admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In the first place, the law is partial, and calculated to impede the exercise of the right of suffrage, by imposing upon the class of voters referred to, unreasonable burdens of proof, and limitations as to kind and amount of evidence, which are not imposed upon other voters. They are challenged \u2014 nay, <em>must be </em>challenged \u2014 not because they are not, in law, white men, but because of their visible admixture. If they are <em>prima *facie </em>white men, or even, as in the case at bar, are plainly and clearly white men, the burden of proof, contrary to all rules of evidence, is cast upon them nevertheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">This burden they are required to remove by a particular specified description of proof, which, in many cases, is impracticable. It being assumed, that they are in law black men, no drop of white blood can be proved into'their veins by \u201creputation,\u201d by \u201cappearance,\u201d or by \u201copinion;\u201d while the challengers are unlimited as to the kind of proof. Again, they seem to be limited to their own testimony and that of two witnesses, and are confined, in giving that testimony, to answering certain prescribed and apparently immaterial questions, which give them no aid; while their adversaries are unlimited as to the number of witnesses they may call, and the questions they may ask, as well as in regard to the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>testimony to be elicited. An' admixture of <em>black </em>blood may be proven by reputation, appearance, or opinion, and by any number of witnesses that may \u201c seem proper\u201d to the challengers, who may ask \u201c an <em>j'other </em>questions\u201d that may \u201cseem to them necessary;\u201d but <em>white </em>blood must be shown by direct and positive testimony, and in many, if not most cases, such testimony as can not be supposed to be within the power of the voter.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">If, notwithstanding these unequal rules and restrictions, the voter succeeds in accomplishing an apparent impossibility, and the judges thus become \u201csatisfied\u201d that he is a <em>\u201cwhite male citizen </em>of the United States,\u201d <em>before </em>receiving his ballot they are to tender him an oath or affirmation, to the effect that he not only believes himself to be a <em>white male citizen, </em>but that he <em>\u201cknows the fact\u2019to be so </em>from a knowledge of both his parents'and his pedigree.\u201d The refusal t\u00f3 take this oath or affirmation, of course works a forfeiture of his right to vote; for, otherwise, the tender of it would be without object, and would be an idle ceremony. So, his refusal, <em>or the refusal of either of his witnesses, </em>to \u201c answer <em>fully \u201d </em>any of the questions propounded, works a like forfeiture. If answering \u201c fully \u201d means answering according to the <em>facts of the'case, </em>such an answer would be impossible in most cases. If it means merely answering according to <em>knowledge, </em>then it is enough to say his right to vote is placed by the lawin the hands of *his witnesses. I believe the former to be its true meaning. Otherwise it would be folly to require the voter to produce the two witnesses \u2014 a requisition which he could easily evade, by calling witnesses who had little or no knowledge on the subject; and if answering \u201c fully \u201d in the case of the witnesses is to have that meaning, it must receive the same meaning in case of the voter himself. The requisition to produce two witnesses must be held a requisition to produce <em>testimony </em>in corrobpration of <em>testimony </em>already given by the candidate himself. If so, it is a requisition that in most cases could not be complied with, and the vote would have to be rejected. '</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The law is also unreasonable, and calculated to impede rather than facilitate the exercise of the right of suffrage by white\u2019citizens of less than half African blood, in that it is so framed as to be liable^ at least in the judgment of' unpracticed men \u2014 such as usually act as officers of an election \u2014 t\u00f3 the construction that no man having' African blood is a <em>white man </em>or has a right to vote.' Indeed, it is extremely doubtful whether such is not the legitimate interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>tion of the law. The ground of the challenge is, not that the voter has more than half black blood, but that he has <em>some </em>black blood. The <em>quantity </em>of black blood \u2014 the <em>proportions </em>of black and white blood \u2014 although the most material matter to be inquired of in the case, and indeed that to which all the provisions of the law ought to relate, are carefully excluded from inquiry. The man of pure black blood is not required to be challenged. Throughout the whole act but <em>two classes </em>are mentioned. One of these is a \u201c person having a visible admixture,\u201d and the other is a \u201c white male citizen -of the United States.\u201d Ail the questions put to the candidate, as well as those put to his witnesses, tend only to show whether he is, or is not, a person of <em>visible admixture. </em>The case begins with a challenge that he <em>is </em>a person of visible admixture, and then he is required to acquit himself of the charge, by his own testimony, and that of two other witnesses, by showing whether his parents were of <em>visible </em>admixture, and with whom he and his children associate I Any and all questions as to the <em>quantity </em>or <em>proportions </em>of the blood-are carefully excluded. If this is not the technical interpretation of the act, its .true meaning is so *well hidden, and lies so -deep, that none but lawyers would be likely to reach it. It is well known to lawyers that the words \u201c white man \u201d have a legal and \u25a0constitutional meaning, quite different from their popular sense. A law calculated to <em>facilitate </em>and <em>secure </em>the enjoyment of the right \u25a0of suffrage by <em>white men </em>who have African blood, would promote \u25a0that object by at least <em>intimating, </em>in some part of the law, what is nowhere intimated in this law, that by the terms \u201c white male \u2022citizens \u201d colored persons of less than <em>half </em>black blood are not excluded. On the contrary, the .law in question purports throughout to use the terms in their popular sense. And when it is seen that high penalties, and unrestricted liabilities, await the judges who err in <em>receiving </em>the vote contrary to the law, and that perfect impunity is guaranteed to them in case of its rejection, it is easy to see how, in the hands of unpraeticed, though honest judges, the exercise of the elector\u2019s right to vote would be likely to be impeded or denied. All doubts \u2014 and the law, whether from design or not, is full of doubts \u2014 would be resolved against the elector.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The most objectionable feature of the act, however, and that which is calculated most effectually to impair the right of the colored elector, is its unjust discrimination against him in regard to penalties, liabilities, and safeguards, for its protection or against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>its abuse. This is an important consideration, because without a <em>\u25a0sanction </em>the law has no operative force or vitality. If the sanctions are all on- one side, the operation of the law will necessarily \u25a0be partial and unjust. Such, we think, is plainly the character of this law, and .such must be its practical effect. If any judge of \u2022election <em>receives </em>the vote of a person of visible admixture, or sanctions its 'reception, contrary to the provisions of the act, although he may act in good faith, yet he is liable to be imprisoned from \u25a0one to six months, and to a penalty of five hundred dollars.for every such <em>mistake; </em>and in order to insure his prosecution for the penalty, half of it is given to any elector bringing suit therefor, \u25a0and an acquittal on prosecution for the offense is no bar to an action for the penalty. On the other hand, if the judges err in <em>rejecting </em>the vote contrary to the provisions of *the act \u2014 nay, if they \u2022reject it \u201ccorruptly and in bad faith\u201d \u2014 no punishment or penalty is to follow; if a civil action can be sustained at all, which is, to say the least, doubtful, no actual damages can be recovered; and the case or prosecution can only be sustained by a kind of proof that is, in most cases, impossible. If the judges err in <em>rejecting </em>the vote of <em>any other voter </em>than those of visible admixture, though they -act in <em>good faith, </em>they are still liable to a civil action for full damages, and if they reject it in bad faith they are liable to punishment ; and in either of the latter cases there are no restrictions as to the kind of proof required upon the trial, and no part of the penalty goes to the prosecutor. The judges are made liable for <em>rejecting </em>and for <em>receiving </em>the vote of <em>other electors, </em>and for <em>receiving </em>that of the colored voter, but they are guaranteed perfect impunity for <em>rejecting </em>the vote of the latter, even where it is done \u201c corruptly or in bad faith.\u201d For any official act done corruptly they \u2022are made liable, with the single exception that they may with perfect impunity <em>reject </em>a colored man\u2019s vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The same is the case with any person \u201c aiding, abetting, or counseling\u201d any judge, etc. He is only made liable for aiding, abetting, or counseling the \u201creception\u201d or <em>\u201coffering\u201d </em>of the vote. He may counsel its <em>rejection </em>with perfect impunity. So in regard to \u2022\u201c impeding \u201d or preventing the operation of the law.. Any person may, with impunity, impede or prevent the <em>voting, </em>or the <em>offering </em>of a vote by the colored man, but if he impedes the \u201c challenging\u201d he is liable to \u25a0 penalties and imprisonment. Safety is m.ade to consist in doing all the \u201c aiding, abetting, counseling,\u201d and \u201c im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>peeling \u201d against the colored voter, and in favor of his adversaries. If a judge is sued for <em>rejecting </em>the vote of a colored person, he. (the judge) may change the venue, but the colored person can not; and the change maybe-made on the judge\u2019s affidavit alone, and to <em>any county he may elect </em>in the whole judicial district. In other words, he may choose his own forum. No such right to change the venue is allowed in case of an action by any other elector for re-, jeeting his vote. The same partiality and discrimination appears in other parts of the act, and in fact throughout its provisions. It is ma,de perjury by *the act to <em>\u201cprocure </em>\u201d the right of the colored person to vote, by false swearing, but it is a crime by false swearing to <em>deny </em>it or effect its <em>disallowance. </em>Tbe <em>posse </em>of the. sheriff, provided for in the 11th section, is required to be furnished only \u201c where there is a probability that the <em>challenging </em>under the provisions of <em>this act </em>will'be impeded.\u201d . The probability that the <em>voting </em>of the colored man will be impeded, or. even that the challenging of the <em>pure white man </em>will be impeded, or that any other disturbance will take place, requires no <em>posse. </em>It is only the challengers of the colored voter who are awarded this extraordinary protection. With all the odds in their favor, by the other provisions of the act, they alone are to have full protection, and be insured against all possible interference. One would think that without this <em>posse </em>there was protection enough for the challenger, in the apparent impossibility of proving the colored man\u2019s right, in the difficulty of procuring witnesses to run the risk of prosecutions for perjury, and'in the almost certain liabilities to punishment and penalties fox\u2019 aiding, counseling, or interfering in his behalf. Surely, if any such protection is needed, it is needed upon the side of .the voter and not of the challenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">For these reasons, and others apparent upon the face of the act, it is manifest to us that it can not be supported as a law to facilitate and protect the right of suffrage and to regulate its exercise within the scope of legislative power. Its manifest tendency and effect are to subvert instead of protect the x\u2019ight of suffrage, and to impede instead of facilitate its exercise in a particular class of voters. If it acknowledges their right at all, it does so grudgingly, and by mere implication. It discriminates against them in all its penalties; its liabilities, and its safeguards, as well as in regard to the. amount and kind of proof required of them, both at the polls and in courts of justice. It therefore lacks that element of faixmess and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>impartiality which should characterize all laws of that description. Under its provisions, fully carried out, not one perhaps in ten of the class proscribed by it could exercise the right of voting. It presents them with difficulties and impediments at every step, such that, if they are not absolutely insurmountable, a quiet ^peace-loving citizen, in most cases, would choose to relinquish his right to vote rather than encounter them.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">It is not only true that the act is calculated to impair and defeat the exercise of the colored man\u2019s constitutional right to vote, but any candid man must admit that such <em>seems </em>to be its <em>leading, </em>nay its <em>only </em>object. It <em>seems </em>to be a studied and cunningly devised <em>scheme </em>to effect that single object to the utmost that it could be effected, without <em>expressly </em>and <em>d\u00e1rectly </em>violating the constitution of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We therefore hold the act of April 16,1868, with the clause in the subsequent law referred to, to be unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As to the eighth ground of defense, by which it is probably intended to raise a question as to the constitutionality of the provisions of said act of April 17, 1868, other than the clause referred to, we have only to say that in our judgment no such question arises. That part of the answer setting up this defense admits that Collins \u201c had <em>resided </em>in said ward for more than thirty days next preceding said election.\u201d This admission establishes his right to vote, so far as the question of residence is made, and it would be going out of the case to consider questions regarding the constitutionality of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b643-8\">Dat, C.
