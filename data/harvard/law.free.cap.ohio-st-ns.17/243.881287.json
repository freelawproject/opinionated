James H. Ewing left a widow, Sarah Y. Ewing (who subsequently intermarried with Henry McBride), and two infant children, both of whom died previous to 1852, intestate, unmarried, and without issue. His brother and sisters were Jacob W. Ewing, Martha A. Ferris, and Catharine P. Floyd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-23\">4. James H. Ewing died seized of several pieces of real estate in Cincinnati, viz., the two lots described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, a vacant lot on Spring street,, and a house and lot on Ninth street; all worth, say $13,000. All of which property, except the vacant lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u2022on Spring street, came to him by will of Elmore Williams, deceased, his maternal uncle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">5.

On the 1st of December, 1856, the Harrisons reconveyed the same to Mrs. McBride for $3,000. On the 9th of March, 1858, Lucy A. Williams conveyed her dower in said lot to Mrs. McBride for $500. McBride and wife conveyed the same by the following mortgages, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">One to Newman, for $2,500, November 9,1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-10\">One to same, for $1,000, March 15, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">One to J.

Chatfield, in April, 1857, as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Clark\u2019s estate, presented to Faran, Ewing\u2019s administrator, a claim for money collected by Ewing, as administrator of *Clark\u2019s-estate, and not accounted for by him before his death. This claim was rejected by Faran, and suit brought thereon, upon the administration bond of Ewing, against Faran, as administrator, and Cary and Spader, as Ewing\u2019s sureties on the bond, in the Superior-Court of Cincinnati, on the 1st of April, 1857, and judgment of nonsuit was rendered in said cause on the 15th of November, 1857. A new suit was commenced in the court of common pleas, and in December, 1859, judgment was rendered against the said defendants on said bond for $885, and $12.82 costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">On the 24th of March, 1859, Faran, as administrator, filed his-petition, in the Superior Court of Cincinnati, against McBride and wife, and others, setting forth the pendency of the suit brought against him by Clark\u2019s administrator, and that he had no property in his hands to satisfy that claim, and praying that the sale under the Newman mortgage might be set aside, or the proceeds retained in court until the amount of the claims against the estate of Ewing- and the expenses of administration were ascertained and paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">McBride and wife were then living in the city of New York, and Gibbons, as their attorney, acknowledged service upon the writ in that case, on the 24th of March, 1859, and the writ was returned by the sheriff on the 4th of April, 1859; and that suit is still pending, and nothing has been done therein since the return of the-summons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">9. Mrs. Ferris was, at the time this suit was brought, the owner-of a lot in Cincinnati, worth $15,000, and she is abundantly responsible for more than the amount of the claim sought to be collected herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-10\">10. No execution was ever issued on the judgment against the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u2022sureties of Ewing, until February 12, 1864, and then execution was ordered stayed by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">The sureties, Cary and Spader, are responsible for more than the amount of said judgment; and both have property subject to levy and.sale on execution in Hamilton county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">.The judgment against Cary and Gazley, referred to in No. 2 of this statement., has been paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>* Collins &amp; Serr\u00f3n, </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">1. The record shows a valid and subsisting claim against Ewing\u2019s \u25a0estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">It is admitted that a judgment was rendered by the court of common pleas in favor of the administrator of Clark against the administrator of Ewing, for the amount of this claim, and that this judgment is still unreversed and unsatisfied. It can not be impeached collaterally for error, Ludlow\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Johnson, 3 Ohio, 553, 560; but only by proof of fraud or mistake. O\u2019Conner and Dennison <em>v. </em>Ohio, 18 Ohio, 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-10\">In the present case there is no claim of fraud on the part of the plaintiff through which this judgment was obtained. It was not permitted by him to be obtained without resistance* He employed counsel, he filed his answer, and used every means in his power to defeat the claim. There was clearly no fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-11\">Was there any mistake? There are no facts now presented to this court showing that the sum now claimed was not, in fact, due. It is not denied in the record that Ewing, as administrator of Clark, collected money and died without having accounted for it. There was then no mistake as to the facts on which the judgment was predicated. 1 Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 110; Jeremy\u2019s Eq. Jurisd., B. 3, pt. 2, p. 358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-12\">Error of law in the court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter, is not such a mistake as will impeach the judgment of that court in a collateral proceeding. Admitting the right of the defense to go behind the judgment of the court of common pleas, is there any evidence to show that said judgment was not properly rendered ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-13\">The only objection raised in the case to the judgment is,-that the \u25a0claim was not presented within four years after the appointment \u25a0of plaintiff as administrator of Ewing. S. &amp; C. 585, sec. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-14\">To this we answer: 1. That the action was founded on a bond as to which the limitation is ten years; 2. This case comes under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tbe exception stated in sec. 103, p. 586, and sec. 248, p. 614, S. &amp; C. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-5\">The claim sued on in the present ease did not accrue until the appointment of Chatfield as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of *Clark. On the death of Ewing there was no party in being to present this claim to his administrator, and hence the statute of limitations did not apply to it.

The real estate of Ewing, if still in the hands of his heirs, was liable to the payment of this claim at the time this suit was&gt; brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-8\">The real estate of Ewing, at his death, descended to his heirs,, subject to the payment of his debts, and which were a lien thereon.

The plaintiff is not the party to maintain this action, even if it could be maintained, because he is not liable for the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-14\">2. There is no valid debt subsisting against the estate of Ewing.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az9\">*3.

The claim was barred, by the lapse of four years before its presentation, as in section 101, which gave the heirs the right to-convey their lands discharged of all lien for this debt, and said lands are now held so discharged by defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\">5. Chatfield must resort to this judgment against the sureties; and they pursue the heirs, under part 9 of the administration law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">6. If the court find the lands still liable, Eobinson\u2019s title being the dower interest of two widows, and both living, should be protected, not being liable for any debts of the estate of Ewing. The cause should be sent back, to have the lands of the estate brought in, and contribution made between the several tenants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">7. The interest of <em>estates </em>and the protection of the rights of purchasers require this court to enforce the rule of limitation laid down in the statutes; and this is a fit case to justify a strict decision to that effect..</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">See S. &amp; C.

By the negligence of Faran, he permitted the balance *of the proceeds of the sale of the lot to Eobinson, to be paid over to Mrs. McBride, one of the heirs of Ewing, at the very time when his petition was pending in the Superior Court, the prayer of which was, that McBride and wife and their mortgagees be restrained from selling until Chatfield\u2019s judgment should be paid, or if the sale should take place, that a sufficient sum should be reserved out of the proceeds to pay Chatfield\u2019s claim. By the negligence of Faran, and by that alone, the money was allowed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>paid over to Mrs. McBride, by Gibbons, her attorney.

This property must \u25a0first be exhausted, and, before the lot of Bell can be reached, Robinson must be held to account for the balance of the purchase money paid by him, which he permitted to go into the hands of Mrs. McBride, pending the suit by Faran to subject that sum to pay Chatfield\u2019s claim. That suit was commenced long after the sale to Bell, and he can not be charged with notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-11\">Therefore, as bfetween Robinson and Bell, Robinson must pay.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AnvB\">*Brinkerhoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANK6\">If, from the mass of minute details \u2022contained in the agreed statement of facts on which this case is \u25a0submitted, we eliminate the few prominent facts which establish the relations of the parties, the questions which arise out of those relations are found to be both few and simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">The plaintiff, Faran, as administrator of Ewing, administered the estate of his intestate.

All debts due from the estate, so far as known and recognized by the administrator, being thus paid, a settlement of the estate, then supposed to be final, was made; and a small balance remaining in his hands \u2014 though much less than the sum derived by him from the rents of real estate before mentioned \u2014 was distributed amoDg the heirs of the intestate. The heirs thereupon made partition of the real estate among themselves ; and subsequently they individually made a variety of sales and conveyances of, and out of, their respective shares to other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Pausing here, and bearing in mind the facts thus far outlined, we will go back again.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Ewing, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was, at the time of his death, administrator of the estate of one Clark, having been duly appointed and having given bond, with sureties, as such, and died without having made settlement of his accounts as administrator, and leaving an apparent balance of considerable amount in his hands, in favor of the estate he represented, unaccounted for. And between two and three years after the filing by the plaintiff, Faran, of his supposed final account, an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Clark\u2019s estate presented to him for allowance a claim for the before-mentioned balance apparently remaining in the hands of Ewing, in favor of that estate, at the time of his death. The plaintiff rejected this claim; and thereupon the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Clark brought suit on the bond of Ewing, as administrator of Clark, against the plaintiff as administrator *of Ewing, and Cary and Spader, sureties of Ewing in his bond. The plaintiff Faran, so far as appears, without collusion, in good faith, and with due diligence, attempted to defend the suit; but in this he failed, and judgment was rendered against him as administrator, together with the sureties in the bond, in December, 1859, for $885 \u2022and costs. This judgment remains in full force, unsatisfied and unreversed; and it is to pay this judgment and costs, that he now asks an order to sell so much of the real estate of which his intestate died seized, as may be necessary for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Is he entitled to such order ? We think he is. He is entitled to it under the distinct provisions of section 130 of the act \u201c for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.\u201d 1 Curwen\u2019s Stafc. 734. Whether error did or did not intervene in the rendition of that judgment, is not a question of which, in this proceeding, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>can take cognizance. In- this collateral proceeding, it is conclusive evidence of the indebtedness adjudged by it, unless impeached for fraud or mistake in obtaining it; or, perhaps, the-culpable negligence of the plaintiff in the defense of the action in which it was obtained. O\u2019Connor <em>v. </em>State, 18 Ohio, 225. And no fraud or mistake recognized in law as such, is here claimed to* have existed in the obtaining of the judgment against the plaintiff in this case, nor is there any allegation of such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is said, in argument, that the judgment may be enforced against, and its amount collected from, the plaintiff\u2019s co-defendants-in the judgment \u2014 the sureties in the bond of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. So, perhaps, it might. But this would bo inequitable. The-estate of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate is primarily liable for it, and ought to pay it; and if the sureties were compelled to pay it in the first instance, the ultimate result would be the same; for they would be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor, and entitled to-enforce the judgment against the estate represented by the plaintiff here, for their indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The fact that the real estate of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate has been-partitioned among his heirs, and by them conveyed, with or without notice, to third persons now claiming title in or through <em>them, </em>makes no difference. Under our laws, *the real estate of a deceased person,- subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower, is, in the last resort, as much and as truly assets in the hands of his personal representatives for the payment of debts, as his personal property is. His debts are a lien on his real estate; his heirs to-whom it descends take it <em>cum onere; </em>and whoever buys it from them, does so subject to the application of the rule of <em>caveat emptor. </em>Stiver <em>v. </em>Stiver, 8 Ohio, 221. For their indemnity, if any, in ease their lands are sold out from under them, they must look to such guaranties or warranties as they may have had the precaution to insist on, or to such right as they may have to compensation or redistribution from their co-partitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Decree for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-8\">Hat, C.
