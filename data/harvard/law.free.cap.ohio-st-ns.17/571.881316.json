To prove the confirmation of this sale and an order upon the sheriff to make a deed, the plaintiff produced the journal of the court of common pleas for the September term, 1843, in which was entered, among the proceedings of the last day of the term, an order of confirmation, etc., in due form. The journal showed that Emery D. Potter, who was at that time the president judge of the court, was present on that day, but the journal of the day\u2019s proceedings was signed by J. Wolcott, senior associate judge. Objection was made to the introduction of this order of confirmation in evidence, for the reason that the journal of that day\u2019s proceedings was not signed by the president or presiding judge. This objection was overruled, and the order of confirmation, etc., permitted to go in evidence. To this ruling of the court the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-9\">The plaintiff then offered the record, from the records of deeds in the recorder\u2019s office of Lucas county, of <em>a, </em>deed of conveyance made by the sheriff of the county to the Albany City Bank, in pursuance of this sale and confirmation. This deed bore date October 10,1843, and was recorded December 13,1843. To the introduction of this deed in evidence the defendants below objected, on the ground that no preliminary order of confirmation of the sale of the property thereby conveyed had been proved, and that the sale of the property had not been judicially approved and confirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>This objection was also overruled, and the plaintiff was permitted to read the deed in evidence; and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">In the further progress of the trial, the plaintiff, to show a conveyance of the property in controversy from the Albany City Bank to Charles Butler, under whom the plaintiff claimed, offered in evidence the record, from the 'records of deeds in the recorder\u2019s office of the county, of what purported to be a deed from the bank to Butler, and which, excepting the description of the property, was follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">*\u201c This indenture, made this second day of July, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, between the Albany City Bank of the first part, and Charles Butler, of the city of New York, of the second part, witnesseth :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">\u201c That the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar, lawful money of the United States of America, and for other valuable considerations to them in hand, paid by the said party of the second part, at or before the ensealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained, sold, aliened, remised, released, conveyed, and confirmed, and by these presents, do grant, bargain, sell, alien, remise, release, convey, and confirm unto the. said party of the second part, and to his heirs and assigns forever, all those certain pieces, lots, or parcels of land,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">[Here follows a description of certain property, including a true description of the property in controversy.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\">\u201c In witness whereof, the.said party of the first part have caused their corporate seal to be hereto attached, and these presents to be signed by their cashier, on the day and year first above written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-10\">\u201c II.

That the record was not admissible as evidence of any legal instrument of conveyance of the property of the Albany City Bank to Butler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-10\">2.

That the pretended order of confirmation, in the suit of the Albany City Bank against Edward Bissell, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, was not in force and valid, by reason of the journal of the day of the entry of the order, not being signed by the president judge, then sitting in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-18\">2.

That the pretended order of confirmation entered upon the journal, which journal was signed \u201c J. \"Wolcott, Senior Associate-Judge,\u201d was not valid and not in force, on the ground that the journal showed that Emory D. Potter, then president judge, was then sitting in court and did not sign the journal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">4. That the deed, made by the sheriff to the Albany City Bank, pursuant to the pretended order of confirmation, was invalid and of no effect, because there was no evidence of any valid order of confirmation of the sale of the lands mentioned in the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">5. That the pretended deed of the Albany City Bank to Butler, was not the deed of the bank, on the ground that the same was not legally executed and proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\">6.

That the record was not at all admissible in evidence, because it was the record of an instrument which, in law, was not entitled to be recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-11\">The court refused to charge the jury as thus requested, but did instruct them:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-12\">1. That, in order to comply with the requirements of the statutes, in force at the time the proceedings were had, for the confirmation of the sale under the execution issued upon the judgment in-favor of the Albany City Bank and against Bissell, it is not necessary that the minutes of the proceedings of the court should be-signed by the president judge, if the court was actually held, when the journal was signed, by the associate judges; and the-journal was signed by the senior associate or presiding judge,, in the absence of other *proof, it would be presumed that the court was then constituted and held without the president judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-13\">2. That it was not necessary, in order to create a valid deed by the Albany City Bank, that the corporate name of the bank should be signed thereto, by some one of its officers or agents. It was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sufficient if the corporate seal of the bank was affixed to the deed by some officer or agent of the bank, for that purpose authorized, and the deed was signed by some officer or agent of the bank in his own' name officially, for and by the authority of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">3. That the record of the deed was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its execution and existence, and would bind the bank until the contrary was proved, to enable the plaintiff to read the record in evidence. It was not necessary for the plaintiff, claiming under the deed, to make any further proof of the corporate seal; of the authority of the officer affixing the same; or the genuineness of the signature of the officer signing the deed, or his authority for that purpose. The record was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of all such facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff. The defendants moved to set it aside, and for a new trial on the grounds that\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">1. The verdict was against the evidence and the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-8\">2. The court erred in admitting the evidence objected to by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-9\">3. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested by the defendants, and in the charge given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-10\">This motion was overruled, and judgment entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-11\">To reverse this judgment the defendants below filed a petition in error in the district court, which was reserved for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-12\"><em>Lee &amp; French, </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-13\">1.

The journal-showed that Emory D. Potter, who was at that time the president judge of the court, was present in court on the day of confirmation, but the journal entries of that day\u2019s proceedings were not signed by him, but by J. Wolcott, senior associate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">By section 110 of the practice act, in force at the time these proceedings were had, it was provided: \u201cThat for preventing errors in entering the judgments, orders, and decrees of-each court, the judges thereof, before every adjournment, shall cause the minutes of their proceedings to be publicly read by their clerk, and corrected where necessary; and the same shall be signed by the president judge then sitting in court, which minutes so signed shall be-entered in a book and carefully preserved among the records; and no proceedings, orders, judgments, or decrees of either of said courts, shall be in force or valid until the same be so read and signed.\u201d Swan\u2019s St. (of 1841) 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>And in the case of The State, ex rel. Goodin, <em>v. </em>The Judges of Hamilton County, 7 Ohio, 135, it was held that, under the provisions of this section, every operative order of the court must be entered upon the minute-book, and until it is so entered and the minute-book signed by the presiding judge, it can not <em>\u201c </em>be in \u2022force or valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">But the journal in this case does not show that the president judge of the court was present, sitting in court,\u2019when the minutes of the proceedings of the last day of the term, on which the confirmation was ordered, were read and signed. If he was then absent, the journal was properly signed by the senior associate judge, who, in such case, would be the presiding judge of the court. We think the maxim, <em>\u201c Omnia rite acta presumuntur,\u201d </em>is properly applicable to such a case. We are not to presume a state of facts which would invalidate the journal entries, when a different state \u2022of facts may be reasonably presumed which would make them regular and valid. We think the entry of confirmation was prop\u25a0erly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Leveral questions are raised by counsel for plaintiff in error upon the admission in evidence of the record in the *offiee of the recorder of the county, which was introduced by the plaintiff below for the purpose of showing a conveyance of the premises in controversy by the Albany City Bank to Charles Butler, this conveyance being an essential link in the plaintiff\u2019s claim of title. It is claimed, in the first place, that the statute declares, not that <em>the record itself, </em>but only \u201c <em>copies </em>from the records of deeds, etc., duly certified,\u201d etc., shall be received as evidence. 1 S. &amp; C. 468, sec. 10. We think this ground of objection can not be sustained. It is clear, as well upon principle as upon authority, that whenever authenticated copies of a record are competent evidence, the record itself is equally so. 1 Starkie\u2019s Ev. 151; King <em>v. </em>Kenny, 4 Ohio, 82. The existence of- a record and its contents can not be more satisfactorily established by the secondary evidence of a copy than by the production of the record itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">But a question of more difficulty is raised by the objection made to the same deed on the ground that it does not appear to have been legally executed by the grantor, the Albany City Bank, the name of the corporation not being signed to the deed, but the name \u25a0of its cashier only. We have no general statute in this state prescribing the mode in which deeds of conveyance are to be executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>by corporations. Our statute on this subject, which requires deeds to.be signed and sealed by the grantor or grantors, has relation only to deeds executed by \u201cany man or unmairried woman,\u201d and to deeds executed by \u201chusband and wife.\u201d S. &amp; C. 458, 461. The mode in which, at common law, corporations aggregate execute deeds, is by affixing thereto their corporate seal. 1 Bl. Com. 475 ; 1 Parsons on Contr. 140, 141; 3 Sugden on Tend. 353, bot. paging; Angel &amp; Ames on Corp. Ch. 7; 1 Kyd on Corp. 268; 15 Wend. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In this case the deed throughout purports to be the deed of the corporation, and it concludes thus: \u201c In witness whereof, the said party of the first part,\u201d [the Albany City Bank] \u201c have caused their corporate seal to be hereto attached, and these presents to be signed by their cashier, on the day and year first above written.\u201d It is then signed by the cashier as such, and the corporate seal is affixed. It purports *to have been acknowledged by the officer who executed it on behalf of the bank, before a commissioner for the State of Ohio, who certifies that the cashier is known to him to be such, and that said cashier, moreover, made oath before him that he was such cashier, and that the seal affixed thereto was the corporate seal of the Albany City Bank, and was affixed by him to-said deed by order of the said bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Whether, in the absence of any express statutory requirement, an acknowledgment is essential to the validity of a deed of conveyance-executed by a corporation, it is not necessary, at present, to determine. It is enough to say, that, if essential, the acknowledgment in this case seems to be regular and perfect, and to be made by the-proper person, through whose agency the corporate seal was attached. And that the deed was well executed by the corporation, at common law, would seem to admit of no doubt. It seems-equally well settled that the seal of a corporation affixed to a deed, is <em>prima fade </em>evidence that it was so affixed by the authority of the corporation; and that it lies with the party objecting to the due execution of the deed to show that it was affixed improperly ox without authority. Lovett <em>v. </em>The Steam Saw-Mill Association, 6 Paige, 54; Angel &amp; Ames on Corp. sec. 224; 1 Kyd on Corp. 268; 6 Serg. &amp; R. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Several cases are cited by counsel for plaintiffs to show that this-deed was not properly executed, but which are unlike the case at bar. Elwell <em>v. </em>Shaw, 16 Mass. 42, was a case in which the convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>anee, on its face, purported to be tbe deed of the attorney, and not of his principal. Brindley <em>v. </em>Mann, 2 Cush. 338, and Hatch <em>v. </em>Barr, 1 Ohio, 390, are cases in which conveyances purporting to be made-on behalf of corporations, by officers thereof, under their own seals, and not that of the corporation, were held not to be the deeds of the corporation. The decision in the case of Isham <em>v. </em>The Bennington Iron Co., 19 Vt. 230, rest on the construction given by the court to&lt; the statutes of that state. The judge delivering the opinion concedes that the conveyance under consideration would be valid at common law, and would be good also in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Several statutes of this state confer upon classes .of corporations *the power to acquire and convey lands to a limited extent, and prescribe in what manner their conveyances shall be executed. Thus, the general railroad law of 1848, and that of 1852, direct that conveyances made by railroad companies \u201c shall be signed by the president, under the seal of the corporation.\u201d S. &amp; C. 273, see. 14; 279, sec. 32. These provisions are not indicative of any policy requiring the deeds of a corporate body to be signed with the name of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">No question seems to have been made in the court below as to the power of the Albany City Bank, under its charter, to acquire, hold, and convey real estate; and assuming that it had such power, we think its conveyance by deed, under its corporate seal, and signed by its cashier by authority of the corporation, must be held, in this state, to be well executed, there being no statute requiring a different mode of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">But while our statute, which prescribes the mode of executing deeds, is in terms limited to conveyances made by natural persons, we think its provisions relative to the recording of all instruments of wrting for the conveyance, etc., of lands, must be held to embrace deeds executed by corporations. Deeds of corporations, unlike those of natural persons, do not admit of personal execution by the grantor, but the public policy which requires registration is the same in both cases. The language of the statute is, that all deeds, etc., \u201cexecuted agreeably to the foregoing provisions,\u201d shall be recorded, etc. The spirit and substance of the requirement is, that all deeds executed agreeably to law, shall be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\"><em>We </em>have carefully examined all the evidence in the case bearing on the issue made by the pleadings, as- to the adverse possession of plaintiffs in error. That evidence is conflicting, and a majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of the court think that, to say the least, it is not such as would justify us in holding that the court below clearly erred in refusing to set aside the verdict, and award a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-6\">Day, C.
