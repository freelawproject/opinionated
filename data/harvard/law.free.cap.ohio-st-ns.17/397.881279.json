Thus, in Starling <em>v. </em>Price, 16 Ohio St. 29, 31; Banning <em>v. </em>Banning, 12 Ohio St. 456; Moore <em>v. </em>Beckwith, 14 Ohio St. 132; Thompson <em>v. </em>Thompson, 4 Ohio St. 333; Lessee of Williams <em>v. </em>Veach, 17 Ohio, 180; Brewster <em>v. </em>Benedict, 14 Ohio, 383. And see other cases collected in the Ohio Digest, 324, 580. See also Wills Act, sec. 55; 8 Ohio, 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-8\">The question is one of construction. Every case must necessarily, in a great measure, stand by itself \u2014 must be determined from the language of the whole will. Brasher <em>v. </em>Marsh, 15 Ohio St. 103, 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-9\">2. The question before the court may, we think, be properly stated in this form: Does it clearly appear, looking to the language of the will and the apparent object of the testator, that in the contingency mentioned \u2014 a failure of children in the plaintiff Euretta \u2014 she shall not be entitled to the whole estate ? We deny that, looking to the whole will, and the facts existing at the time of its execution, any such inference can be drawn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-10\">Much of the property was unproductive. Was it intended that the plaintiff Euretta should improve her part of the real estate, and pay the taxes and assessments thereon, and that in the event she should die without children, that the whole should pass to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>brothers,and sisters? On the contrary, the terms of the will and the condition of things at the time it was made, strongly support the claim of the plaintiffs; and the construction for which we contend is plainly in accordance with the affections and intentions of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">In disposing of his property, the testator provided first for his widow, in a manner similar to that contemplated by the statute, and then, as to his eight children, equality was his main object.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">Why did the testator, when he provided that in case of the death of a devisee his share should pass to the other devisees, restrict this in terms to the death of a devisee within the *fifteen years? If ho had not intended that a different rule should prevail in case of the death of a devisee <em>after </em>the fifteen years, these words would certainly have been omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-7\">When we look to the general provisions and expressions, we can, not fail to see that the testator intended to dispose of all his property. He gave <em>all </em>his real estate to trustees; they were required to convey <em>all </em>to his children in equal proportions. But the equal share of each daughter was subject to a provision inserted by the testator for the benefit of her children; hence, failing the children, the daughter takes the whole, and the trust should be so executed; the case thus falling within the principle of Winckworth <em>v. </em>WinCkworth, and other cases of that class already cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-8\">3. Waiving the principle of that class of cases, and looking only to the general principle as to directory trusts, the result will be the same. If a deed or settlement is to be made, as required by the general expressions and provisions of the will, of one-seventh of the estate to a daughter and her children, this can-only be done by conveying, as we claim in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\"><em>B. </em>P. Banney, for E. B. Williams.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">1. The rules for construing the will claimed by plaintiffs are quite correct, and are made complete when it is added that, after looking at the whole will and considering its <em>language </em>in the light of the surrounding circumstances, \u201c the will must speak for itself, and the intention of the testator must be gathered from what appears on its face. To allow the natural import of the words thus ascertained to be varied or contradicted, <em>or omissions </em>supplied, or apparent ambiguities to be removed by parol evidence, would be to repeal the law requiring it to be in writing, and to introduce all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the uncertainty, fraud, and perjury the statute was designed to prevent.\u201d Lessee of Worman <em>v. </em>Teagarden, 2 Ohio St. 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">2. The plaintiff, Euretta, is, <em>very plainly, </em>given but a life estate.. She now seeks a decree enlarging it, upon the <em>presumption </em>that her father would have given her a fee simple, if he had foreseen that she would, <em>up to this date, </em>have no children. To grant it, is not only to make a <em>disposition </em>for her which *the testator has <em>not </em>made, but also directly to contradict the one he has made; while the settled rule is, that <em>intention </em>merely, however clearly expressed, in the absence of an actual disposition of the property, is unavailing. Crane <em>v. </em>Doty, 1 Ohio St. 282; Needles <em>v. </em>Needles, 7 Ohio St. 432; Bane <em>v. </em>Wick, 14 Ohio St. 508; Nickerson <em>v. </em>Bowley, 8 Met. 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">3. There is nothing in the will to show that the testator even <em>desired </em>her to have a fee simple in the event that she had no children, much less anything that can operate as a <em>disposition </em>of a larger estate than that expressly named and described. Everything relied upon is simple <em>conjecture. </em>Who can penetrate the mind of the testator so as to be able to say that, in the event she died unmarried, he-did not desire his1 other children to take that share? Or, if married, and dying without issue, he would not have preferred that they should then take, than that the whole might be squandered by a husband, or diverted outside of his blood altogether? This would, not be an unreasonable <em>conjecture; </em>but upon conjectures <em>pro or con </em>the court is not at liberty to act. The law has provided a definite successor to every interest not effectually disposed of by the will, and to displace this successor, another must be pointed out by the will, with at least equal distinctness, is the universal language of the decisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">The controlling question is stated by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs with great ingenuity, but with very little regard to <em>controlling </em>decisions. \u201cDoes it clearly appear,\u201d they inquire, that the testator intended, if Euretta had no children, that she \u201c should not-be entitled to the whole estate?\u201d By the decisions, it must clearly appear that he intended she should have it. Those who would take property from the heir must make a case affirmatively, and can not require him to prove a negative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">4. The circumstances, in and out of the will, upon which the plaintiffs seem to rely, are: 1. That the whole estate passed to the trustees, and that they must necessarily convey the whole to exe^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cute the trust; 2. The unproductive character of the property; 3. The inference arising from, the provision made in case of the death of any of the children within *the fifteen years; and, 4. The presumed intention of the testator to dispose of his entire estate. Of these in their order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">1. It is perfectly settled that trustees take just such an estate as is necessary to enable them to execute the trust and no more. 2 Redf. on 'Wills, 501, and cases cited in note 50. This will is most explicit upon that point. It devises to the trustees and the survivor of them, <em>without words of perpetuity, </em>the lands, \u201cin trust for the uses and purposes herein specified;\u201d and the last purpose specified is, at the expiration of fifteen years, \u201c to surrender up the control of all my real estate, and release the <em>title hereby vested in them as herein directed, to wit, </em>to my son,\u201d etc. It is certain that they took such title only as would enable them to make just such deeds as the testator <em>specifically </em>directed; that when they made such deeds they divested themselves of all title, and fully executed the trust; and this they did more than twenty years ago.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">2. I see nothing in the condition of the property to throw any light upon the construction of the will. It is certain that the testator considered it productive from the trust expressed as to its use, and, being in and contiguous to a large and growing city, he might well expect it to become rapidly more so. Besides, it gives to the plaintiffs all the estate and interest that it gave to either of his other daughters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\">3. The provision vesting the interest of any one of his children, \u25a0either sons or daughters, in the survivors, who should die within fifteen years, fortifies instead of weakening the proposition of the defendants, that the testator, if he had spqken his wishes upon the subject, would have reserved the contingent reversion in the shares of his daughters to the residue of his children or their descendants, rather than suffer it to go to a husband, or be diverted out of his family.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-11\">4. The testator did dispose of his whole estate \u2014 of every item of property belonging to it \u2014 but he did not provide for the happening of possible contingencies. The demand upon this court to provide a <em>disposition </em>upon such contingencies, is simply asking it to exercise <em>testatorial </em>instead of judicial powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-12\">5. The result of all the authorities upon the distinction between executed and executory trusts, is this: Where the ^testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>has clearly defined the limitations of a trust estate, it is an executed trust, or is to be construed as an executed trust; but where he has left the means to be adopted undefined, and has simply expressed a result, the court has a discretion as to the adoption of the means for reaching that result. In this sense, this is an executed trust, the precise thing to be done by the trustees being clearly defined by the testator, and leaving no power in the court to devise means other than th ose he.has expressly defined. In all the other cases cited, a <em>full </em>estate was given in the first instance, to be diminished by a contingency which did not happen; while here the only grant is of a <em>life estate, </em>with a remainder in fee, contingent upon the birth of children. This contingency not happening, can in no event enlarge the limited estate given to Euretta.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\"><em>8. &amp; 8. JR.

The trusts now in question are not, in any sense known to courts of equity, executory or directory, so as to require or justify a decree directing a conveyance of the interest now in controversy, in any terms, different from those employed by the testator himself, in its original creation; and there is no intention, clearly expressed or fairly to be inferred, which is not fully perfected by the conveyance already made by the surviving trustee.

Suppose it to be admitted, that, for sufficient reasons, the court feels authorized or required to supply a new ^limitation of this trust estate, in view of the contingent remainder to Euretta\u2019s children never vesting, what shall it be? The answer to that must be given, after ascertaining what the testator intended it should be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The plaintiffs contend that it ought to be a limitation in fee to Euretta herself. Waiving the objection to this, that it would defeat the contingent remainder in fee to her children, by the destruction of the particular estate for life of Euretta, by merger, which might be mot, by the interposition of an additional limitation to trustees to j)reserve the contingent remainder, still it is obvious -that such a limitation could never have been intended by the testator. There is no evidence in favor of such a supposition. It is altogether inconsistent with the only intention he has expressed on the subject, for it actually destroys the very estate which he has expressly conferred upon her, and gives her an inheritable estate, which subjects her to that influence and control on the part of her husband which must have furnished the only motive to the testator for making the restrictions he has expressed. The fact that the testator has expressly given to his daughter Euretta an estate for life, is conclusive that his intention was that she should take that estate and no more.

What estate did the trustee take ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">(1.) This will was made before the act of March 3, 1834 (1 Cur-wen, 145), giving all the estate the divisor had, unless the will, \u201c by express words, or manifest intent,\u201d showed that a lesser estate was-intended. Therefore, neither that act nor the present wills act, section 55, have any application to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">(2.) It may be laid down as a general rule, that when an estate is devised to trustees for particular purposes, the legal estate is vested in them as long as the execution of the trust requires it, and no longer, and therefore, as soon as the trusts are satisfied, it will vest in the person beneficially entitled to it. Doe <em>v. </em>Nicholls, 1 B. <em>&amp; </em>Cr. 336; S. C., 8 E. C.

They therefore took an estate for the term of fifteen years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">2.

Williams was the youngest child of the testator, and on or about the 15th of June, 1831, was six years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The real property which the testator possessed when he made his will consisted of a tract of land in Colerain township, about five miles from Cincinnati, of 166 12-100 acres; another tract on Walnut Hills, Mill creek township, near Cincinnati, of 135 acres 2 roods; an out-lot in the city of Cincinnati, No. 40, lying between Twelfth and Thirteenth streets and Race and Yine streets, which was subdivided in the partition; a lot on Walnut and Columbia streets, 91 feet 10 inches on Walnut, and a lot on Main and Columbia streets, about 76 feet on Main and 150 feet on Columbia. Of the land in Colerain township, a part was cleared for cultivation and a part woodland. There was wood on the tract on Walnut Hills, but its chief value was on account of its proximity to the city, and its capability of being used for country or suburban residences and truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>or vegetable gardens. There were no buildings of much value on either tract. The out-lot was unimproved. There were moderate improvements on the other city lots, yielding a rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">After the expiration of the term of fifteen years, prescribed in the will, and the execution of the deed by Burnet, as surviving trustee, a partition was had among the devisees, by judicial proceeding instituted to that effect, by which one-seventh of the testator\u2019s real \u2022estate was allotted to Euretta Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The plaintiffs, in their petition, charge and claim that the circumstances under which said will was made, and the character of the real estate, all which is set out above, in connection with the provisions in said will, show that the testator intended to dispose of all his property, and to die intestate as to \u00f1o part thereof or any interest therein; that in the ^direction to convey to each of his \u2022daughters and secure a provision for her children, he intended that each daughter should have her equal share of his estate, subject \u25a0only to the reservation out of it for her children, and contemplated that this intention should bo effectuated by a proper deed of settlement to be made by the trustees. The plaintiffs, therefore, insist that they are entitled to require from the heirs of the surviving trustee, or from a trustee to be appointed by the court, a |&gt;roper conveyance of the interest of the said Euretta in the estate of her father, by convoying the same to the said Euretta for life, with contingent remainder in fee to her children, and in the event she should have no children, to Euretta in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The claim'of the plaintiffs is based upon two propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">1. That the trust declared by the will, in respect to the property Revised to the trustees, is an <em>executory </em>trust, which, for the purpose -of effecting the intentions of the testator, requires from the trustees .a conveyance of the property, to the beneficiaries, in other terms than those used in the will itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">2. That the terms to be supplied must be such as will secure to Euretta Gilpin, in the event of her having no children, the fee simple of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">In the argument of the case, counsel have expended a large amount of learning and industry in the discussion of the question, whether the trusts created by this will are executory or executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">An executory trust is thus defined in 2 Jarman on Wills, 253*: <em>\u201cA </em>trust is said to be executory or directory where the objects take, not immediately under it, but by means of some further act to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u2022done by a third person, usually him in whom the legal estate is vested. As where a testator devises real estate to trustees in trust to convey it to certain uses. In these cases the direction to'convey \u2022or settle is considered merely in the nature of instructions or heads of a settlement, which are to be executed, not by a literal adherence to the terms of the will, which would render the direction to settle nugatory, but by formal limitations adapted to give ^effect to the purposes which the author of the trust appears to have had in view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">And the rule seems to be the same in the United States. Adams\u2019 Eq. 40*, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Lord Eldon, in Jervoise <em>v. </em>The Duke of Northumberland, 1 Jac. &amp; W. 539, states the law to be, that in those cases of executory trusts, where the meaning of the party who declares the trust is imperfectly expressed, courts of equity take upon themselves so to modify the words as to carry into effect that which, upon the whole, appears to be the meaning of the party, although imperfectly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201c The trust created by this will,\u201d said Sir L. Shadwell, V. Ch., in Stonor <em>v. </em>Curwen, 5 Sim. 264, \u201c is clearly an executory trust, and an executory trust as to which nobody can say that the words which the party who has created the trust has used are so clear as -at once to show what sort of conveyance he meant. And although I apprehend the law to be, that whether the trust be executed or executory, the same construction must be put on the words, yet that means only in those cases where the words which declare the executory trust are so clear in themselves as to point out what the 'trust is to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">An excellent illustration of a case of executory trust, in which, a court of inquiry will depart from the particular language of a testator in order to effectuate his clearly expressed and controlling intention, is afforded by the case of the City of Zanesville <em>v. </em>McIntire\u2019s Adm\u2019rs et al., decided at the present term.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\u201c Where directions are given for the execution of some future conveyance or settlement of trust property, but the particular limitations are not fully or accurately specified, this is an executory trust; and in carrying such a trust into execution, regard must be \u2022had to the general intention rather than to the technical import of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>any particular expressions used.\u201d Hill on Trustees, 328*. But the same author adds: \u201cHowever, in executory trusts created by <em>will, </em>all parties claim equally as volunteers under the bounty of the testator. In these cases, therefore, the words of 'the will receive their *full legal effect, <em>unless it appear from the will itself, that the testator's real meaning would he frustrated </em>by a strict execution of his directions.\u201d lb. 329*.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Now, in the view which we take, and with the understanding which we have, of the language of the testator in the will which we are called upon to construe, and guided by the general principles above laid down \u2014 the correctness of which is, on all hands, conceded \u2014 we do not find ourselves obliged to discuss or to determine the question so laboriously argued by counsel, whether the-trusts created by this will are, or are not, executory; for, be that as it may, these are \u201ctrusts created by will; all parties claim equally as volunteers under the bounty of the testator;\u201d the \u201c words of the will,\u201d therefore, \u201creceive their full legal effect;\u201d and, in our opinion, it does not <em>\u201c </em>appear from the will itself, that the testator\u2019s real meaning would be frustrated by a strict execution of his directions.\u201d Those directions have been strictly executed as respects the plaintiff Euretta, in the conveyance made to her by the surviving trustee ; and we are unable to find in the words of the will, with such aid as the light reflected from surrounding circumstances affords, any satisfactory indications of an intention to vest a reversionary estate in fee simple in his daughters in any event, or on any contingency whatever, but rather significant indications to the contrary. And if we are right in our conclusions in this respect, it follows that the plaintiffs can not be aided in any way by this court. We can not make for the testator a will which, for whatever cause, he himself did not make. And we arrive at these conclusions from the following considerations :</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">1. The language of this will is the language, not of ignorance, but of intelligence \u2014 of legal intelligence. So far as the testator has gone, in the expression of his purpose and desire in respect <em>to </em>the disposition of his estate, his words are apt, direct, and clear; and in the absence of countervailing considerations, this gives rise to the reasonable presumption that he meant what he said, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">2. It is certain that the testator, in the final disposition of his real estate, after the lapse of the first fifteen years limited by him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>did make, and did intend to make, a difference between *his sons and his daughters. He gives, in unequivocal words, to each of his sons an equal share absolutely in fee; and in words equally unequivocal, he gives to each of his daughters a life estate only in a like share, with remainder over to their children, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Grant that this was making an unreasonable difference. He had a right to give to whom he pleased, and with such limitations and on such terms as he pleased, provided the gift did not contravene good morals or public policy. But I am unable to see anything that can properly be characterized as unreasonable, and much less anything unnatural, in the limitations he has imposed on his gifts to his daughters. It is certainly <em>possible </em>that his failure to provide in express terms for the contingency of his daughters having no issue, may have been the result of oversight, and, if this be so, it can make no difference in the case; for we do not know, and are not at liberty to act on mere conjecture, as to what he would have done with the contingent reversion, in case the possible contingency on which the reversion depends had occurred to his mind. But I think it is quite as probable \u2014 and even more so, considering the degree of intelligence in the testator or his scrivener which the will manifests \u2014 that the omission to expressly provide for the contingency mentioned, was the result of design. \"What motives influenced the formation of such design wc may only conjecture, with a view to show that they may have been neither unreasonable nor unnatural. It may have been that he was distrustful in respect to the possible character of his sons-in-law, or that he feared that the weakness of his daughters might subject them to influences which would lead to such a disposition of their patrimony as he could not anticipate with approval; or more likely still, as I think, he may have known, as matter of law, that if his daughters had no issue, their shares, after the termination of their life estates therein, would revert to his own heirs general, and thence his bounty would descend along with the current of his own blood; and so he would have no occasion to make express provision for the contingency named, and one of the'most natural and most .commonly operative of human motives would be gratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">*We thus arrive at the conclusion, that, as to the possible contingent reversion, on the death of the plaintiff Euretta without having had issue, the plaintiff died intestate; and it is urged against this conclusion, that \u201c it is a settled rule of construction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u2022that a testator is never presumed to intend to die intestate, as to any part of his estate to which his attention seems to have been directed, and a court of equity will put such a construction upon equivocal words as to prevent such a result.\u201d Collier <em>v. </em>Collier, 3 Ohio St. 373. But this rule can have no application where there are no equivocal words to be construed; and this, it seems to us, is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"An0\">Again, it is urged in behalf of the plaintiffs, that the testator, in the first place, devises an entire fee-simple estate to his trustees in trust; and yet, if the trustees make no other or further conveyance to the plaintiff Euretta than they have made, and in case she shall die without having issue, then there will still remain in the trustees a reversionary interest undisposed of by the will; and hence, it is argued that the testator intended to dispose by will of his entire estate in every possible contingency. But to this it is, we think, well answered, that it is a general rule of law, that \u201cwhere real estate is devised to trustees, though with words of inheritance, <em>prima </em>facie, the trustees take only so much of the legal estate as the purposes of the trust require \u201d (Hawkins on the Construction of Wills, 143, 144, and cases there cited) ; and that, at the time this will took effect, there was no statutory provision affecting the operation of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The petition will be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-7\">Day, C.
