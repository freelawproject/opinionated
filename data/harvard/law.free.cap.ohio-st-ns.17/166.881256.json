Foster, and for which the note-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>was given, was applied by him and his deceased brother John, in 'building a new house, which cost about $1,000, on the mortgaged premises; that in the lifetime of John and Samuel they were tenants in common, with their sister Ohristena, in the premises; that, on the death of John, his interest therein passed to the other two, as tenants in common; that they occupied that relation when the mortgage was executed; and that Ohristena (intermarried with Alexander Simpson) owns the undivided one-half of the premises in fee simple; and that Samuel, when he executed the mortgage, and at his death, owned the other undivided half, in law and equity, together with the value of the house erected thereon, by him and his brother John, but which was paid for by Samuel. The petition asked relief accordingly. The petition makes Samuel\u2019s administrator and Ohristena and her husband defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-4\">The husband and wife answer: That she owns the real estate in fee simple; that it is not liable to be sold to pay the note executed by Samuel to the plaintiff; that the testatrix, ^Ohristena Reed, owned the premises when she died, and made the will as stated; that the brothers, Robert, James, John, and Samuel died, as stated, unmarried and without issue, and intestate; and that under the third clause of the will, she, Ohristena, as sole survivor, is the owner in foe simple of the premises, and that the mortgage, as against her, is inoperative and void. They also deny that the money loaned by the plaintiff to Samuel, was applied to the erection of the house mentioned in the petition, the house having been built before the money was loaned; or that the plaintiff has any equitable rights, as against the defendant Ohristena, either in the lands or the house which was built when she was a minor, without her consent or consultation with her. These defendants aver that Samuel\u2019s estate in the premises, at the time he executed the mortgage, was a contingent estate liable to bo defeated by his death without issue. They ask also, affirmatively, that the mortgage may be declared void as against said Ohristena, and that the same may be canceled by order of the court; and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">Samuel\u2019s administrator answers, separately, that the note mentioned in the petition is a valid claim against his intestate\u2019s estate; that as to the mortgage, he refers to the answer of the other two defendants for the facts, and that, as administrator, he will abide by the order of the court thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Taylor demurs to the answers of the defendants, as not constituting a defense to his action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">The case being in the district court on appeal by the plaintiff, was therein reserved for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-6\"><em>Hubbarcl </em>&amp; <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Thomas Millildn, </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">1. We claim that the estate vested absolutely in the five children,, at the death of Christena Reed, in 1850.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">By the second item of her will she makes these children her \u201c <em>only heirs,\u201d </em>and then devises all her estate \u201c <em>to them, their heirs and assigns-forever.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-9\">The difficulty arises from the third item of the will, and must be-settled by an answer to the question \u2014 to what period do the words- <em>\u201c die without </em>issue\u201d and <em>\u201c survivors\u201d </em>refer?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-10\">We claim they refer to the period of the death of the testatrix, *when the will took effect. S. &amp; C. Stat. 1627, secs. 18, 56, 505; 1 Jarman on Wills, 726; 2 Ib. 631-33, and cases cited; 2 Williams on Ex\u2019rs, 1254, and cases cited, 1255; 4 Kent, 203, (marg.) note c; 25 Wend. 119; Lawrence v.

At all events, the shares of Eobert Eeed Poster, James W. Poster, and John MeGraw Poster, who died intestate, unmarried, and without issue, prior to the execution of the mortgage, vested at their-deaths in Samuel C. Poster and the defendant Christena Simpson. To that extent Samuel C. Poster was absolute fee simple owner, and. it is held by the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-12\">By the terms of the will, the three children dying without issue, \u201c the share or shares of such decedent or decedents shall be equally divided among the survivors of them.\u201d Suppose we admit that the one-fifth of the estate <em>devised </em>to Samuel C. Poster was defeated by his death without issue, yet such could not be the case with reference to the shares of Eobert, James and John, which at their death, passed by descent to Samuel C. and Christena.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-13\">The word \u201c survivor \u201d qualifies the words \u201c die without issue,\u201d and makes them mean <em>\u201c </em>dying without issue at the time of his death.\u201d Cutler <em>v. </em>Daughty, 23 Wend. 513; 4 Kent, 279, note c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-14\">The construction claimed by defendant is opposed to publie policy and the statute against entailments.

Simpson:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>1. We claim that the will creates and vests in the five children of Jane Foster a fee simple interest in the lands, at the death of the testatrix, with an <em>executory devise or limitation over </em>to the survivors or survivor, in the event of the death, <em>at any </em>time, of one or more of said children, without issue <em>living </em>at such death or deaths. 1 Jarman on Wills (margin), 778, 280, and notes; note 1, and authorities there referred to, 781; 4 Kent Com. (margin) 269, 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">2. The words \u201c survivors \u201d and \u201c die without issue,\u201d as used in the third clause of the will, refer to the death or deaths of *one or more of the legatees, and not to the death of the testatrix. They are used in their \u201c plain, popular and natural meaning.\u201d Parish <em>v. </em>Ferris, 6 Ohio St. 563; 4 Kent Com. (side) 278, 279; 2 Jarman on Wills (margin), 670.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">3. The fee simple which vested by the will in the first taker was <em>inalienable. </em>4 Kent\u2019s Com. (margin) 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">4. The executory devise in this case <em>limits </em>the-entire estate in fee simple absolute to Christena R. Simpson, on the deaths of her four .brothers \u201c without issue,\u201d which has happened, and the mortgage of Samuel C. Foster as against her is <em>void. </em>4 Kent (side), 15, 264-67 ; Hart <em>v. </em>Thompson, 3 B.
