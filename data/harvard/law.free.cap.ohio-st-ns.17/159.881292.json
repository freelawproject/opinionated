But the plaintiffs in error, Ward <em>&amp; </em>Co., answered in bar of the action, and, prior to a second trial of the cause, filed, by leave of the court, a second amended answer, upon which the questions made in this case arise. This answer was substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-10\">That the notes in suit were made and executed by Ward &amp; Co. for the sole accommodation of the payees, W.' &amp; C. F. Porter, who agreed with and promised the makers, to provide for and pay them at maturity. That after said notes were indorsed to Wick Brothers &amp; Co., they indorsed and delivered them to the Bank of Beaver County; and afterward, before the maturity of the notes, the plaintiffs below, then having knowledge of the accommodation character of the notes, on the 29th day of August, 1859, made an agreement with W. &amp; C. F. Porter, by the terms of which Wick Brothers &amp;\" Co. were to \u201c protect and take up said notes, and to give W. &amp; C. F. Porter time for the payment of the amount due on them, beyond the day of their maturity;\u201d Porters agreeing, on their part, to pay the amount of the notes to Wick Brothers &amp; Co., and to cause a mortgage on certain real estate to be made and delivered to the plaintiffs, conditioned for the payment of six thousand dollars, as a security for the payment of said amount, and of other sums owing by said W. &amp; C. F. Porter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to the plaintiffs. That the agreement was made without the knowledge or consent of respondents, and that, in pursuance thereof, such mortgage was thereupon executed and delivered by William Porter to the plaintiffs, who paid and took up the notes shortly after their maturity, though they had not received notice of non-payment and protest in due time to charge them as indorsers, nor been otherwise duly charged as such. *This answer was traversed by a reply, denying nearly all its averments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">The issues thus made were submitted to a jury, and, from a bill of exceptions, it appears that, upon the trial, the plaintiffs in error offered evidence tending to prove all the averments of their amended answer; and the plaintiffs below gave evidence tending to rebut that evidence; and the parties having severally rested, Ward &amp; Co.,, by counsel, asked the court to charge the jury that if they found the several averments in the answer to be true, they should find the issues for the defendants, Ward &amp; Co., and, as to them, against the plaintiffs. But the court refused to charge the jury as requested, and did charge them that, upon the averments of the pleadings,, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against Ward &amp; Co., as well as against W. &amp; C. F. Porter; to which Ward &amp; Co., by counsel,, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">And the jury having, thereupon, returned a verdict against all the defendants, Ward &amp; Co., before judgment, moved the court for' a new trial, on the ground of error in the charge of the court, and in the refusal to charge as requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">This motion was overruled, and judgment entered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">To reverse this judgment, for supposed error in the charge of the court, and in overruling the motion for a new trial, Ward &amp; Co.. filed their petition in error, in the district court of Trumbull county, and the cause was therein reserved for the decision of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-10\"><em>Geo.

If these propositions are not well taken, then the payment by the Wicks to the Beaver County Bank was officious, and extinguished the notes. The Wicks, as indorsers, were only conditionally liable. There was no waiver of the condition, and it was not complied with, so as to charge them as indorsers. No stranger to the notes could obtain any right to sue Ward &amp; Co.; much less to sue them on the notes, by payment of them.

When an indorser takes up a note, whether legally bound to do so or not, it is clear that he does it as indorser, and that it is not a payment and discharge of the note. At all events, there is no presumption of payment or discharge arising from the transaction; and the same rules do not apply in such case as in case of a mere stranger. The Wicks were not strangers, but parties to the notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">Though the holder of the notes had been guilty of laches, as to them, and of which they might have taken advantage, yet it was competent for them to waive the laches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-10\">The proper construction of the answer is, that the Wicks received from the Porters adequate security for the payment of the notes. That being so, notice to the Wicks was not necessary. Story on Prom. Notes, secs. 257, 281, 283, and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-11\">2. The agreement of the' Wicks to protect and take up the notes, was nothing more than what the law implied from their contract of indorsement, and did not change the rights or liabilities of themselves or Ward &amp; Co. It was not meant to release them, or for their benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-12\">3.

The answer does not allege that the agreement relied on as a defense, expressly provided for the discharge of Ward &amp; Co. from their liability as makers of the notes in suit. Nor do we understand the pleader as intending to charge that the parties to that agreement contemplated or designed to provide thereby for such discharge. Had such been the ground of defense, it is.at least strange that we find in this <em>third </em>answer no allegation to that effect, especially as the record shows that' in the first trial of the cause, under the second answer, the defense failed by reason of a charge from the court precisely similar to the one now complained of. To make such an agreement a good defense, it would have-been wholly unnecessary to aver (as this answer does) that it was made \u201c without the knowledge or consent of Ward &amp; Co.\u201d For an agreement, intended to provide for their discharge, would not be less effective in their favor because they were parties consenting to it. It is claimed, however, in argument, that the agreement of Wick Brothers &amp; Co. to \u201cprotect and take up the notes,\u201d imports an obligation to pay the debt which was evidenced by them, so as to discharge all the parties to the paper from further liability thereon. Such might be a fair ^construction of the agreement had it been made by a stranger to the notes. But it was made by Wick Brothers &amp; Co., who were the immediate indorsees of the paper to the parties then holding it; and the agreement was that this indorser should take up the notes and give to prior indorsers further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>time for their payment. It is clear, therefore, that these prior indorsers (the Porters) were <em>not </em>to be discharged from liability; and wo see no ground for the inference that the parties intended by their agreement to affect, in any respect, the rights or obligations of the makers, who were not parties to the agreement, and as to whom nothing was said. As we understand the statements of the .answer, Wick Brothers &amp; Co., having all the rights, and being under all the obligations of indorsers, agreed, as such, to satisfy the \u25a0claim of the holder, and re-obtain the possession and control of the notes for the purpose of enabling them to give further time for their payment to antecedent parties. And this is quite different from an agreement to discharge antecedent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">But the theory of the defense, as disclosed by the answer, seems to be this: That the legal effect of the alleged agreement, and the subsequent acts of the parties pursuant thereto, was to discharge Ward <em>&amp; </em>Co. from their liability as makers of the notes. This effect is supposed to result from the character of the agreement, from the fact that Ward &amp; Co. were known to be accommodation makers, and that the agreement was entered into without their knowledge or consent. It is said the agreement was that Wick Brothers &amp; Co. should take up the notes <em>\u201c </em>and give W. &amp; C. F. Porter time for the payment of the amount due on them beyond the day of their maturity.\u201d Now, if it be conceded that the accommodation character of this paper gave to the Porters, in equity, the position of principals, and to Ward &amp; Co. that\u2019 of sureties, yet, is any valid contract shown to have been made for the extension of the time of payment by the principal so as to discharge the surety ? To have that effect, it must not only be founded on a good consideration, but it must also be definite in its terms; \u201c such a one as the principal debtor could enforce, and which would tic up the hands of the surety; prevent him from paying his principal\u2019s debt, stepping *into the shoes of his creditor, and prosecuting the principal debtor himself.\u201d Jenkins <em>v. </em>Clarkson, 7 Ohio (pt. 1), 72. The agreement here was to give time for payment beyond the day of maturity of the notes. Without such agreements, no action could have been brought on them till after maturity. By its terms, how much longer was the creditor bound to wait ? Such a stipulation is void for uncertainty; it amounts to nothing more than a general promise of indulgence, and can tie up the hands of no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">It is further said, by way of defense, that Wick Brothers &amp; Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>paid these notes shortly after their maturity, without having had their liability as indorsers fixed by notice of dishonor in duo season. But that laches of the holder they might waive, if they thought proper. It was a question between them and the holder, and which did not concern the antecedent parties. As their liabilities could not, by such payment, be revived if previously extinguished, so neither could they be thereby discharged if previously fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">And that the defendants in error took a mortgage from William Porter as a security in part for the payment of these notes, can furnish no reasonable ground of complaint to plaintiffs in error. On the contrary, if compelled to pay the notes, this security will inure to their benefit when seeking reimbursement from the Porters.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We see no error in the charge of the common pleas, and therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-7\">Day, C. J., and White, Welch, and Brinkerhoee, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
