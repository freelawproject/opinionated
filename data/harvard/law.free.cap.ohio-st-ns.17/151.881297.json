Where a person occupies the double relation of administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate and guardian of the minor heirs of such decedent, and it becomes his duty, as such administrator, to pay over a fund in his hands for distributon to himself as guardian of the minor heirs, the law will, in general, presume such payment to have been made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-12\">2. But this legal presumption may be rebutted. And where he charges himself with the fund in his account as administrator, but fails to credit himself in that account with its payment to himself as guardian, and, in an attempted settlement of his account as guardian, refrains from charging himself therein with such fund, the legal presumption of a transfer of the fund is rebutted; and in an action by his former wards on his bond as administrator, for the recovery of the fund, he will be estopped to deny that he still holds the same as administrator.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-14\">Error to the district court of Butler county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-15\">*John Rhea died testate, April 30, 1832.

Wilson, as administrator of John Ehea, deceased, having received, October 6, 1837, $329.44 from the estate of Thomas Lyon, deceased, made an additional settlement, charging himself with that sum, and $37.23 interest thereon to March 6,1838, and crediting himself with $35.75 expenses of administration, leaving a balance of $330.92. The court made the following order in regard to this settlement: \u201c Which, being examined, is approved; showing that there remains in the hands of the administrator the sum of three hundred and thirty dollars and ninety-two cents unexpended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">Previous to this settlement, all the debts of John Ehea had been fully paid, and the sum of $330.92, then found in the *hands of the administrator, together with the balance of $803 shown by the former settlement, constituted the entire personal assets of Ehea\u2019s estate, after the debts were paid, and after the death of Elizabeth Dick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">April 13,1839, Gray, Elizabeth Dick\u2019s executor, repaid to Joseph P.

Wilson, as guardian of his said daughters, filed in the probate court his account for settlement with his wards. In this account he does not charge himself with any portion of the $803 or the $330.92. He charges himself, however, with other moneys that came into his hands as guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The guardian charges himself in the account with $646.20, and credits himself with $1,737.34, leaving a balance of $1,091.14 due him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">Appended to the account is the guardian\u2019s affidavit, in which he states that he kept no regular accounts with his children, and has no regular dates for the charges against himself; that had he kept a regular account against his children, the amount of their indebtedness to him would be much larger; that, from the paternal relation which he bears to his wards, he never anticipated that an account would be brought against him by his children, and that if strict justice and right be done, the wards are largely indebted to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">This account was the only one ever filed by Joseph P. Wilson as guardian, and he never made any settlement in the probate court of his guardianship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">In 1853, the plaintiffs brought suits against Joseph P. Wilson, upon his bond as guardian, to recover the moneys with which he *charged himself in his said account, filed in the probate court; and he defended. The suits were tried and determined by the verdict of a jury, but the $803 and $330.92 were not involved in the suits, and no evidence touching the same were submitted upon the trials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">In 1853, the plaintiffs, Hannah Wilson, Isabella Wilson, and Elizabeth Lawrence, and their husbands, commenced an action in the court of common pleas of Butler county against Joseph P. Wilson, their father, and his surviving surety, Thomas L. Rhea, on the administration bond mentioned, to recover their share (threeeigliths) of said sums of $803 and $330.92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">At the February term, 1854, judgment was given in favor of the plaintiffs, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">At the April term, 1862, of the district court, the case was tried to the court, which found for the defendants on the facts stated, and after overruling a motion of the plaintiffs for a new trial gave judgment against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-12\">To reverse this judgment the plaintiffs filed their petition in error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in this court, assigning for error the giving of judgment, and the refusal to grant a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-4\"><em>Thomas Millikin, </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">The district court erred in bolding that Joseph P. Wilson held the fund in litigation as guardian, and not as administrator:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">The <em>presumption </em>that, as the duty of paying and the right of receiving united in him, he paid it as administrator and received it as guardian, may be rebutted. There is no principle of public policy that requires the presumption to be regarded as <em>conclusive. </em>17 Ohio, 266.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">It is a presumption to be made <em>against </em>the person acting in this double fiduciary capacity, and/or the benefit of <em>cestui que trust. </em>It can not be insisted upon by the trustee for his own benefit, and to the prejudice of his <em>cestui qui trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-8\">The payment must be a reality, not a fiction, and so recognized. The last fiduciary act impressed upon this fund was. its reception by Wilson as administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-9\">*See Conkey <em>v. </em>Dickinson, 13 Met. 51; Hall <em>v. </em>Cushing, 9 Pick. 395.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-10\"><em>James Clark, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-11\">The facts show that Wilson held the fund in litigation as guardian, and not as administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-12\">The two settlements of 1834 and. 1839, it is conceded, embraced everything connected with the administration of Rhea\u2019s estate. No debts remained outstanding, and no assets uncollected. Had another person held the office of administrator, his duties would have been fully performed, with the single exception of paying over the money in his hands to those entitled to receive it; and the person entitled to receive the portion in controversy, would have been the guardian of the infants to whom it belonged; but the same person was both guardian and administrator; and how, in such case, was the latter to discharge the only remaining duty incumbent upon him ? In the case of Grey <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 Richardson, 351, the question is thus answered : <em>\u201c </em>Where the right of receiving a fund as guardian and the duty of paying it as trustee unite in the same person, <em>the law presumes a performance of the </em>duty; <em>and, without further proof, the surety of the person as guardian is liable.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The case of Watkins <em>v. </em>The State, 2 Gill &amp; Johns. 220, is, if possible, still more emphatic. \u201c It was there held, that where a sole executor sustains the two-fold character of executor and guardian, the law will adjudge the ward\u2019s proportion of the property in his hands, to be in his hands in the capacity of guardian, after the time limited by law for the final settlement of the estate, <em>whether a final settlement has been passed by the orphan\u2019s court or not.\u201d'</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alu4\">In further corroboration of the doctrine here contended for, I beg leave to call attention to the case of The State <em>v. </em>Jordan, 3 Harris &amp; McHenry, 179, in which it is laid down that \u201c the nonpayment of a legacy to a grandchild, whether the executor was-named by the will as the guardian of the child, is not a breach of his bond which will render his sureties liable.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A17E\">*Brinkerhoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYPZ\">The action in the common pleas was-against Wilson, the administrator with the will annexed of John Rhea, deceased, and the surviving surety, on his bond as such administrator, for the recovery of a fund of over thirteen hundred dollars remaining in his hands for distribution on the final settlement of his account as such administrator. The plaintiffs are the devisees of this fund under the will. And at the time when this-final settlemant was made, and it became his duty as administrator to distribute the fund to the heirs of the devisees, they were infants, and he was the duly appointed guardian of their persons and property. He, not denying the receipt by him of the fund in his character as administrator, sets up, by answer in defense of' the action, that he holds it as guardian and not as administrator; and so contests his liability on his bond as administrator. And being, at the time of the receipt of the fund, both administrator- and guardian, the question on which the case turns is, in which of these two capacities does he now hold it?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">It is true genei\u2019ally, that where a party acting in a double capacity is possessed of a fund in one capacity which it is his duty (so to-speak) to transfer to himself in another, such transfer will in law; be presumed. But this legal presumption may be rebutted It is-a kind of legal fiction; and is so denominated by the court in Collard\u2019s Administrator <em>v. </em>Donaldson, 17 Ohio, 264; and legal fictions have vitality and effect to promote the ends of justice, but. not to thwart them.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Wilson was not required to go through any such foolish formality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>as taking the fund which he held as administrator from one pocket; and putting it into another as guardian; but there were other and1 more sensible ways of indicating the capacity in which he regarded himself as holding the fund. He might legitimately have-charged himself with it in his account as guardian, and credited-himself with having made payment of it to the guardian in his account as administrator. But he did just the contrary to this. He refrained from charging himself with it as guardian, and thus, it would seem, prevented its forming any element of recovery against him in the former action against him and his sureties on his bond- as guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">*He received and receipted for it as administrator; he charged himself with it as administrator in his account as such; he never credited himself in his account as administrator with any transfer of it to himself as guardian ; and in his account as guardian he never charged himself with it, nor revealed his claim to be holding it as guardian until after the commencement and in the-progress of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We are of opinion that these unequivocal manifestations of intention on the part of the principal defendant, Wilson, effectually rebut the legal presumption which his counsel invoke in his behalf; estop him to deny that he holds the fund in his capacity as administrator.; and that the district court erred in giving judgment for the defendants and in refusing to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded to district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-8\">Hay, C.
