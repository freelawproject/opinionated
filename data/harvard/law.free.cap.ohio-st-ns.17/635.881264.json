The sheriff of the county, falsely claiming to have in Ms hands an order, of sale issued in the cause, obtained from F., who had purchased the equity of redemption, full payment of the decree and costs. A few days thereafter an order of sale was regularly issued and delivered to the sheriff, who indorsed thereon the full payment previously made, but failed to make due return of ' the writ. For this delinquency R. obtained judgment against him and the sureties on Ms official bond for the amount of the debt, and collected the same from <em>W., </em>one of said sureties. <em>W. </em>thereupon brought an action, seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ing to be subrogated to the rights of R. under his decree, and to have an order of sale issued thereon for his benefit.

Fulton, James Porter, Isaac Fowler, Hixon Hunt, <em>A. </em>E. Osborn, Michael Fitzgerald, and Nathaniel Skinner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">The petition, filed August 11, 1862, alleges that Grace, on April 1,1854, made two notes to Richardson for $150 each, and to secure them a mortgage on forty acres of land, and that the notes not having been paid, Richardson, on February 16,1858, filed his petition to foreclose, and, on March 25, 1858, in Perry common pleas \u2022obtained judgment for $224.05 and costs, with an order for the sale \u25a0of the land; that, on November 23, 1858, an order of sale'was issued, which, on the same day, came to the hands of Skinner, then sheriff of the county, and that he wholly neglected and refused to execute it or to return it within sixty days, by reason whereof a night of action accrued in favor of Richardson against the sheriff \u2022and his official sureties to the' amount of the judgment. That on \u2022the second Tuesday of October, 1858, Skinner was elected sheriff for two years, gave bond, etc.; and by the act of the legislature of April 12, 1858, his term was extended to the first Monday in January, 1859, and for the term of this extension, *Wright, the plaintiff, arid Fulton, Porter, Fowler, Hunt, and Osborn became his official sureties; and that he was acting under this extension when his default in not returning the order of sale occurred. That on April \u25a06,1861, Richardson commenced his action against Skinner and his said sureties for not executing and returning said order of sale, and on February 28,1862, recovered judgment against them for $276.70 and $16.47 costs, which Wright had to pay. That Grace paid no part of the original or latter judgment, and that the land has not 'been sold for that purpose. That Skinner is, and was when he received the order of sale, wholly insolvent, and has not procured to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>&lt;be issued for his benefit, against Grace, an order of sale or execution \u25a0on the original judgment, as by statute might lawfully be d one; that the original judgment and decree against Grace is in full force, unreversed and unsatisfied, except by the payment made by Wright as .above. That Fitzgerald claims some interest in the land. The prayer is that the plaintiff, Wright, be subrogated to the rights of Richardson in the land, that it bo sold, and out of the proceeds ho <em>be </em>refunded the amount paid on the judgment as stated, and for other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">Osborn, Porter, Hunt, and Fowler entered their appearance by indorsement of the petition.

No process was issued against Richardson or Fulton, nor did they appear in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\">A demurrer to the petition was sustained and judgment entered Against the plaintiff, and the case was taken to the district court, where the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-7\">\u25a0 On the case coming back to the common pleas, Skinner filed an Answer, stating that while sheriff for the time Wright was one of his sureties, he received of Fitzgerald, who was the owner of the land, the full amount of the notes and mortgage for the use of Richardson, and entered the same upon an order of sale and made due return of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-8\">To this answer Wright demurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-9\">Fitzgerald answered: That he is the owner of the land, and while Skinner was sheriff and Wright was one of his sureties, *he, Fitzgerald, paid to Skinner the full amount of the notes and mortgage ; that he having purchased the land and assumed the payment of the notes and mortgage, the sheriff told him he had. an order of sale duly issued, on which he was authorized to receive the money, and that unless the same was paid, ho would advertise and sell the land as directed by the order; that he took a receipt which, after stating the case, acknowledged the receipt of the money upon an order of \u2018sale issued in the case of Richardson <em>v. </em>Grace, and was signed by Skinner as sheriff, and that the reason the sheriff did not proceed to sell the land, was because he had received the full amount of the judgment from Fitzgerald, who had purchased the land and Assumed the payment of the notes and mortgage. That after the payment, an order of sale was issued to the sheriff in the case, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>wbich he applied and indorsed the money so paid in satisfaction, whereby the judgment was satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">To the answers of Skinner and Fitzgerald, Wright replied as follows : Admits the payment by Fitzgerald to Skinner, November 11, 1858, in full of the judgment, and that Skinner gave a receipt in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-15\">Court of Common Pleas of Perry County,.

The reply demurred to admits that defendant, Fitzgerald, on the 11th day of November, 1858, paid to Skinner, the sheriff, the fall amount of the judgment or decree which had been previously rendered against Grace at the suit of Richardson, and took a receipt in due form therefor from the sheriff. It avers, however, that the sheriff, Skinner, had at that time no order of sale or writ of execution in his hands, none having then been issued in the cause. It is further admitted in the reply that twelve days afterward, on the 23d day of the same month, an order of sale was duly issued in the cause, at the instance of the creditor, Richardson, which on the same day was placed in the hands of the sheriff for <em>execution; </em>upon which writ the sheriff, within thirty days thereafter indorsed the fact that he had received the full amount thereof, with costs, and at *the same time receipted anew to Fitzgerald for the full amount of the decree and costs in the cause in which the writ had been issued. There is no averment that the sheriff had, before the writ came to his hands, converted to his own use or in any way misapplied the money previously and prematurely paid to him by Fitzgerald in satisfaction of the decree. In the absence of any averment of that kind, we are not to presume that he was guilty of any such act of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The sheriff, then, having in his hands the money paid by Fitzgerald in fall satisfaction of the decree, it became his clear duty to apply it as he did when the order of sale came to his hands. He could not honestly do otherwise. And of this proper application of the fands in his hands neither the creditor, Richardson, nor the sureties of the sheriff, have any reason to complain. The plaintiff\u2019s reply does not show that he, or any one else, was prejudiced by payment being made before the sheriff was legally authorized to receive it. And the sheriff having applied the moneys paid by Fitzgerald to the satisfaction of the writ in his hands, by proper indorsement thereon, the decree, under which the writ issued, was thereby fully discharged and satisfied, and Richardson was entitled to no farther process thereon against Grace, the mortgagor, or the mortgaged premises Then owned by Fitzgerald; and as against them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>be has no rights to which the present plaintiff or any one else can be subrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s reply was properly sustained; and the judgment of the court of common pleas must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-6\">Day, C.
