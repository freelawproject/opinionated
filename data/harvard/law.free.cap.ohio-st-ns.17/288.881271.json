That the will gives the residue of the estate and property of the testator, after the. other legacies and costs of administration and debts are paid, to the said Alexander Fuller, and that such residue was specially charged, by the will, with the payment of the testator\u2019s debts, which were thereby made a lien and charge, upon such residue. That the said residue, which the defendant, Alexander Fuller, took and retains possession of as his own, is more than sufficient, after paying all the legacies, costs, and other debts, and which have been paid, to pay the debt due the plaintiff. But that the defendant refuses to pay, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\">The first item of the will reads thus: \u201c It is my will, and I direct, that all my just and lawful debts and liabilities be first paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-11\">Item ten reads thus: <em>\u201c </em>I give and bequeath to my son, Alexander Fuller, all the residue of my property, both real and personal, out of which it is my will that he pay all my just debts,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-12\">This is all the will says about the payment of debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The answer of Alexander Fuller sets up the probate of the \u2666will, the filing of his bond as executor on June 6, 1855, and the publication, on the 13th, of due notice of his appointment; and that, within four years after the date of the bond, he collected all the assets of the estate; that the plaintiff did not bring this suit within that four years; that defendant had no notice of any such note or debt as set up in the petition, u,ntil the fall of 1861, more than six years from the date of the bond; that the claim was never presented to the defendant, and that he was never requested to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The plaintiff demurred to the answer on the ground that it does-\u2019 not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">The demurrer was sustained and judgment entered on the petition for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">The district court affirmed this judgment on proceedings in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">To reverse this judgment of affirmance, the present petition in. error was filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-9\"><em>Geo. M. </em>Tuttle, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-10\">As a debt against the executor, <em>as executor, </em>it is clear that the claim sued upon was barred by the lapse of four years. 1 S. &amp; C. Stat. 585, 586, secs. 103-105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-11\">This statute applies to the executor <em>as devisee. </em>Ang. on Dim. (3 ed.), secs. 169, 170; Clyde <em>v. </em>Simpson, 4 Ohio St. 445, 455, 456;, Id. 512 et seq.; Id. 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-12\">The provisions in question are borrowed from Massachusetts. Per Brinkerhoff, J., in Paine <em>v. </em>Mason, 7 Ohio St. 198, 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-13\">The authorities of that state, therefore, have a peculiar importance. See Brown <em>v. </em>Anderson, 13 Mass. 201, 203; Thompson <em>v. </em>Brown, 16 Ib. 172, 180; Davis <em>v. </em>Shedd, 15 Ib. 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-14\">The liability of the devisee is but the incident to the liability of the estate, and is collateral to it. Such being the case, it can last no longer than the principal liability. Ohio <em>v. </em>Blake, 2 Ohio St. 147, 149; 18 Ohio, 234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-15\">This result is a necessary inference from the further provisions of the statute. Part 9, secs. 1 and 2 (1 Curwen, 753).</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-16\">*The limitation of suits against executors to four years is intended for the benefit of those interested in the estate; and he-needs the protection most, who, by accepting a supposed bounty \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of the testator, becomes liable, when liable at all, not for the mere amount of property received, but for all the debts of the estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>F. E. Hutchins, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">\u2022 The question presented is whether, upon the facts, the plaintiff in error was liable, at the commencement of this action, to pay the debts of the testator, either as executor or as residuary legatee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">\"Without admitting that he was not liable as <em>executor, </em>notwithstanding the expiration of four years from the date of the bond, yet this action is predicated upon his liability <em>under the will, as residuary legatee.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-8\">The defense set up in the answer, if it be a defense at all, is so only as to the liability of plaintiff in. error <em>as executor. </em>It is simply a plea of the statute of limitations applicable to actions against executors, as such. It .does not attempt any defense to his alleged <em>personal </em>liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-9\">By the terms of the will, and by his acceptance and enjoyment of the property, the plaintiff in error was personally charged, and the property given to him was also charged with the payment of all the debts of the testator, including that due to the defendant in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-10\">My proposition is this: Where a testator devises the residuum of his estate, directing the devisee to pay his debts or legacies, and the devisee accepts and takes and enjoys the property, he is personally bound for the payment of the debts or legacies, and the same are also a charge upon the property devised. The devisee in such case takes the property <em>cum onere, </em>and his acceptance is an implied promise to pay as directed. He can not enjoy the benefits and. repudiate the obligations of the devise. Williard\u2019s Eq. 487-489 ; 7 Paige, 421; 11 Id. 334; 15 Conn. 534; 22 Id. 602; 27 Id. 530; 24 N.

(Abbot\u2019s), 693; 6 Id. 201, 588.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-11\">The jfiaintiff in error having thus become <em>personally </em>bound *for the payment of the debt, there is nothing in his answer to show that his liability has ceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-12\">There is no plea of the general statute of limitations; only that relating to executors as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-13\">There is neither authority nor reason for the assumption that this personal liability of the devisee, is but the incident to the liability of the estate, and collateral to it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The liability of the plaintiff in error being personal, it is no more affected by the four year\u2019s limitation applicable to claims against executors, than would be any other personal demand against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">Part IX of the administration act has no application to the present case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-6\">Brinkerhoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlxZ\">The case made by the record brought under review before us, is, in brief, this :</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Alexander Fuller, plaintiff in erz\u2019or and defendant izz the original action, is executor of his father\u2019s will. By the terms of that will he is made the residuaz\u2019y devisee and legatee of his father\u2019s estate, \u25a0and out of such residuary devise and legacy he is directed to pay .all the testator\u2019s just debts. He took possession of, and retains as his own, all the property covered and passing by that legacy, and which is sufficient to pay all the debts of the estate. At the time of the testator\u2019s death, he.was indebted to the plaintiff below on a promissory note, of which the plaintiff below is still the owner and holder, and the amount of which the defendant below refuses to pay. The claim for the amount due on the note was not presented to the executor for allowance and payment within four years after he was duly appointed and qualified as such executor, nor did the defendant below have notice of the existence of such claim until the expiration of six years after he was duly qualified as executor of his father\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The original action is brought against the defendant below, not in his capacity and character of executor of his father\u2019s will; not for the enforcement of the execution of a trust attaching to property bequeathed to him in trust for the payment of the amouut due on the note remaining in the hands of the plaintiff below; but against the defendant below in his individual ^capacity, \u25a0on his promise implied by, and his obligations resulting from, his acceptance of the residuary bequest charged with the payment of all the debts of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">That the plaintiff below might have maintained an action, if prosecuted in due time, against the defendant below as executor of the will, on the note, is .very clear; and that he could have gone into equity and charged the residuary bequests as being held by the defendant below in trust for the payment of the note, is equally clear. Willard\u2019s Eq. 487-489. And it seems to us to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>'In entire consonance with just principles, and now well settled by authority, that he might well do as he has done \u2014 bring his action against the legatee in his individual capacity, on his personal obligation and promise, implied by law from his acceptance of the-bequest charged by the will with the payment of the debts. Gridley <em>v. </em>Gridley, 24 N. Y. 130. And this being the nature of the-action, the statute limiting the commencement of actions against, executors and administrators to four years, has nothing to do with the case, and no other statute of limitation is pleaded. At what, time the action in favor of the plaintiff below did in fact accrue, we are not informed. That would depend on the time when the legacy was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The fact that the defendant below is executor of the will, as well as residuary devisee and legatee under it, has no bearing on this case. His obligations would be the same whether he were or were mot such executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As the case stands, the question whether, if the property passing-by the will to the defendant below were insufficient to pay, in full, the debts of the testator, he would still be personally liable'for the full amount of the debts, is not before us, and, of course, not, decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-8\">Pat, C.
