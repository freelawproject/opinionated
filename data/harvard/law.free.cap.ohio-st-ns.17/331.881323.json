Gray.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-5\">Where a party, claiming and representing himself to be, under letters patent granted by the United States, invested with the exclusive right to make and sell a certain machine within a given territory, enters into a contract with another party purporting to grant to the latter the exclusive right to manufacture and sell such machine within said territory, in consideration whereof the latter agre\u00e9s to pay the former a specified patent fee for each machine which he shall manufacture and sell; and after a number of such machines have been manufactured and sold, a promissory note is executed by the latter to the former for the amount of fees accrued: <em>Heldn-</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-6\">1. In an action on such note by the payee against the maker, an answer simply averring, in substance, that certain third parties named <em>claimed </em>that the manufacture and sale of said machine by the maker of the note was an infringement of prior patented rights to them, is no defense to the action, and bad on general demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-8\">2. A paper, certified under the hand and official seal of the commissioner of patents to be \u201c a true copy from the record of that office, of the specifications in the matter of the letters patent granted EL G., March 21, 1854,\u201d unaccompanied by a duly authenticated copy of the letters patent referred to, is not of itself competent evidence either of the existence, or of the contents of any letters patent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-10\"><em>5. </em>Where a party, claiming to be the owner of a patent right for a machine, licenses another to make and sell such machine within a certain territory, and in consideration of such license the latter agrees to pay the former a given sum by way of royalty on each machine by him manufactured and sold; and a large number of machines being manufactured, a part of which are sold and a part remain on hand, the parties enter into a compromise agreement, whereby the licensee executes to the licensor his promissory note for the amount due under the former contract for the machines sold, but largely reducing the royalty payable for the machines remaining on hand, and those to be thereafter made; and this, after the enjoyment of every privilege which the license purports to grant, undisturbed by owners of conflicting patents or otherwise, and after ample time and opportunity for testing the machine: <em>Held, </em>that in an action by the payee against the maker of the note, the latter is estopped to deny a consideration for said note, either on the ground of the inutility of or the want of novelty in said machine.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-11\">Error to the Superior Court of Montgomery county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-12\">The case is sufficiently stated in the opdnion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABk\"><em>*John Howard &amp; Son </em>for plaintiffs in error;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>1. The plaintiffs in error claim that the contract was procured to be entered into by the false representation that the plaintiff below had a right to make and sell \u201cAtkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower,\u201d when there was, in fact, no such machine patented. The second answer sets up that the <em>machine was not patented </em>and the defendant in error had no right to convey to plaintiffs in error, or any other person the right to make and sell it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">2. That the note sued on was given in consideration of a promise to secure releases from all who had claims, or made claims on the plaintiffs in error, for infringements, and that though such claims were made, defendant in error refused to procure the releases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">This promise was made when a great part of the eight hundred machines were on hand, unsold. The defendant in error agreed that plaintiffs in error should not be annoyed by these claims, and on that promise got the note which is sued on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">It can not be claimed that plaintiffs in error had sold the machines, got their pay, and now refused to pay the patent fees. The whole contract and the whole eight hundred machines must be taken together with the fraud in making of the contract and the fraud in procuring notes to be given for the three hundred and nineteen machines. The notes were given on the promise of defendant in error to procure releases of those who had patents which these machines infringed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The plaintiffe in error made the contract, supposing the machine was patented. They gave the notes on a promise of defendant in error to procure releases, as well for the three hundred and nineteen, as for those remaining unsold. Justice requires that the defendant in error, in such case, should not recover the amount of the note till he complies with the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">The plaintiffs in error are not estopped from setting up the invalidity of the patent, or any failure of consideration. The estoppel does not apply in a case like this.

St. 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">3. The court below erred in excluding the testimony of want of value and utility of the Atkin patent; in excluding the paper \u201cD;\u201d in not allowing other than record testimony to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fact that another patent was used in the Atkin reaper; that the defendant lost by the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">The testimony clearly showed that the machine was useless; and that is a good defense to the note.

This question, we think, has been settled in Ohio, as well as in many of the other states. We refer to the authorities herein cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-9\"><em>Conover &amp; Craighead, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">1. The court below did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the first defense of original answer. The plea is simply of an agreement not performed by defendant in error, but from which plaintiff has suffered neither suit, cost, loss, or damage. The claim is surely not good, even as a <em>counter-claim, </em>and has none of the elements of a <em>defense.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-11\">It does not seem to us necessary to discuss whether there was error in sustaining the demurrer to the second defense of the original answer. <em>That </em>defense is repeated three times in *the amended answer, issue taken upon it, and plaintiffs in error had full benefit of it on the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-12\">2. There was no error in excluding the. paper marked \u201c D,\u201d as proof of the existence of a certain patent. Copies of letters patent, instead of the original, may be used as evidence when properly certified by the commisioner of patents; but the commissioner can not <em>certify </em>to the fact, as a fact, that letters patent issued to a certain person at a certain date. Certainly he can not, by <em>recital </em>of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>fact collaterly, prove that fact, when he could not certify to it directly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-4\">Neither was the parol testimony offered in connection with the paper \u201cD\u201d competent, because it was only an attempt to prove what could only be proven by letters patent or their exemplifications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">3. There is no error in the rulings of the court below excluding evidence as to the invalidity of the Atkin patent; as to the want of value of the <em>right </em>to manufacture and sell the \u201cAtkin reaper and mowerand as to whether the plaintiffs in error made or lost money in such manufacture and sale.

C. Davis &amp; Co., and dated February 1, 1859. The petition is in the usual form.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The defendants below filed two answers and eight amended answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The plaintiff below demurred to the first and second answers and to the first amended answer. These demurrers were sustained by the court below, and this is assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The first answer and the first amended answer are substantially identical, except in this: That the averment contained in\u2019 the last clause of the latter is not found in the former ; and so, if the demurrer to the first amended answer was rightfully sustained, there was no error in the same ruling in respect to the first answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The first amended answer is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">\u201c The note, in the petition mentioned, was given by the defendants to the plaintiff- for patent fees for the pretended right to construct and sell a machine called \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower,\u2019 in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and in certain counties in Indiana, under a contract entered into between the plaintiff, as agent for one John S. Wright, and the defendants, and E. Dutton. The plaintiff represented that it was patented by the United States to Jearum Atkin, and that he had the exclusive right to construct and sell said machine according to a model indicated by him. The defendants and said Dutton relied on his representations, *and in consideration of a conveyance to them of said supposed right, they agreed to construct the same and sell the same in said territory, according to said model, and that they would pay a patent fee of thirty dollars to him for each one which they should make and sell. That Dutton withdrew from the contract, and the defendants succeeded to the same. They made of the same about eight hundred, and sold about three hundred and twenty of them, and, in part payment of the patent fees on them, the defendants gave the note in the petition mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">\u201c The plaintiff says that at the time-of entering into said contract, there were claims by other parties that they had patents on certain attachments used in the construction of said machine, of which the defendants were ignorant. In order to induce the defendants to settle with him, and pay him the patent fees on the machines which they had sold, plaintiff agreed to procure releases to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>obtained from all whose patents were infringed, or alleged to be infringed, by the construction of said machine by the defendants. The defendants, relying on said promise, gave the note sued on. But they say that one Obed Hussey, one Ketchum, and McCormick;; and other persons well known to the plaintiff, claim to have patents on certain parts of the machine which the defendants constructed and sold under said contract, and they claim compensation for the said supposed infringement, and threaten the defendants that unless they pay for said infringements, they will sue the defendants for those sold and enjoin the sale of those on hand; and the plaintiff refuses to procure releases from said persons, as he is bound to do. And the defendants say that the amounts demand-able from them by said parties are greater than the amount claimed by the plaintiff for patent fees on said machines so constructed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We think there was no error in sustaining the demurrer to this answer. The substance of the answer is, that there were outside parties who <em>claimed </em>that in the manufacture and sale of the machine mentioned, there was an infringement of patents belonging to them. There is no allegation of suit, cost, loss, or damage, against or to them; <em>\u00f1on constat </em>that *there ever will be, or that such claim can ever be established. From aught alleged in this answer, it does not appear that even a counter-claim has yet ripened in favor of defendants below, much less a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The second answer is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201c The promissory n\u00f3te, in the petition mentioned, was given by the defendants to the plaintiff for patent fees for the right to make and sell, in certain states and counties in the United States, a machine called by the plaintiff \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower.\u2019 The plaintiff, about the month of October, 1857, represented that he had the exclusive right to make and sell the same in said territory according to a model furnished by himself, and entered into a contract with the defendants and one E. Dutton, conveying to them said pretended right to construct the same in its several parts, as near as might be, like said model, in consideration of which they bound themselves to pay to the plaintiff, as agent, thirty dollars for each machine they should make and sell. Under said contract they made about eight hundred of said machines, and sold about three hundred and twenty of them, the rest remaining unsold. The defendants afterward succeeded said E, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Dutton in said contract, and on a settlement with the plaintiff for the number made and sold, gave him the note in the petition mentioned. But the defendants say that the machine, of which the said plaintiff sold them the pretended right to make and sell, was nol patented to the said Atkin, and the plaintiff had no right to convey to them, or any other person, authority to make or sell the same, as he pretended to do ; and so they say that the consideration for said note has wholly failed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\"Whether the demurrer to this answer was properly sustained by the court below or not, is a question which it is not now material for us to consider, because all the averments of fact which it contains are embraced in amended answers afterward filed by defendants below, on which issues were taken by reply, and so the defendants below had the full benefit of them in the subsequent progress of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The subsequent pleadings in the case are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"Af1u\">Second amended answer : \u201cAnd for a further answer the *defendants come and say that the promissory note, in the petition mentioned, was given by the defendants to plaintiff for patent fees \u2022for the right to make and sell, in certain states and counties in.the United States, a machine called by the plaintiff \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower,\u2019 and which the plaintiff, about the month of \u25a0October, 1857, represented that he had theexclusive right to make and sell the same in said territory according to a model furnished by himself, and represented that the same was patented by Jearum Atkin; and he entered into a contract with the defendants and one R. Dutton, conveying to them said pretended right, and binding them to construct the same in its several parts, as near as might be, like .said model; in consideration of which they bound themselves to pay to the said plaintiff, as agent, thirty dollars as a patent fee for each machine which they should make and sell. Under said contract they made about eight hundred of said machines, and sold about three hundred and twenty of them; the rest remained unsold. The defendants afterward succeeded said R. Dutton in said contract, and on a settlement with the plaintiff for the patent fees for the number made and sold, gave him the note in the petition mentioned. But the defendants say that the machine, of which the said plaintiff sold them the pretended right to make and sell, was not patented to the said Atkin by the United States, and the plaintiff never acquired any right, and had no right to convey to them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u2022or to any other person, authority to make or sell the same, as he pretended to do; and so they say that the consideration for said note has wholly failed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Third amended answer: \u201c The defendants, for a further answer, say that said note was given by the defendants in payment of patent fees, for the right to construct and sell a reaping machine called \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper,\u2019 by virtue of a contract entered into on the 1st of October, 1853, between the plaintiff, as.agent of one John S. Wright, and the defendants and R. Dutton, doing business under the firm name of R. Dutton &amp; Co. The said Dutton afterward withdrew from said contract, and the defendants, with the consent of \u2022the plaintiff, succeeded to the same. Said defendants were *required, by the contract, to construct said reapers according to a model designated by the plaintiff; and they did construct and sell a large number on that model. At the time of entering into said contract, the plaintiff represented that said reaper, so constructed, was patented by the United States to one Jearum Atkin, and that the plaintiff was fully authorized to give to said R. Dutton &amp; Co. the right to construct and sell the same, which representation the defendants and Dutton believed. But the defendants say that said reaper, so constructed, was not patented by the United States to said Atkin, and the plaintiff had no right to contract with said defendants and Dutton for authority to make and sell the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Fourth amended answer: \u201c The said defendants, for a further answer, say that said note was given in payment for patent fees, for the right to construct and sell a reaper known as \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper.\u2019 The plaintiff represented to said defendants that said reaper was patented by the United States to Jearum Atkin, and that the plaintiff was authorized to convey to the said defendants and Dutton the right to make and sell the same, according to a given model, in certain territory in the United States, which representations the defendants and Dutton believed. The plaintiff, by contract, agreed'to convey said right to defendants and Dutton; and, pursuant to said contract, they constructed, according to said model, and sold a large number, and gave their note, in the petition mentioned, for the supposed patent fee for the right to make and sell the same. But the defendants say that the said reaper, constructed according to the model given by the plaintiff, was an infringement upon other valid patents issued by the United States, and said defendants and Dutton did not, by said contract, acquire any right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>make and sell said reaper. And the defendants say that the consideration for said note has entirely failed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Fifth amended answer: The note was given for the right to make a machine called \u201cAtkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower.\u201d The said patent ,is not new and useful, and is void for want of novelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Sixth amended answer: Defendants do not owe said sum nor *any part thereof, because the consideration of said note has entirely failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Seventh amended answer: The note was given pursuant to agreement, by virtue of which defendants were bound to construct said reapers like that made by Dutton for the harvest of 1857. All the machines were made on that model. Said machines were not patented to Atkin; but there were used in its construction certain attachments and jirinciples which were patented to other parties; viz: the open guard to O. Hussey, and other parts and other principles to C. H. McCormick &amp; Co., Ketchum, and to other parties; and the machine would be useless but for such attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Eighth amended answer: The note was given by virtue of the contract to make machines on a given model. The machines were all made on that model, and the note was given for the pretended right to make and sell said machines. The machines were pf no value whatever; wherefore the consideration of said note has failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The several replies of the plaintiff below, to the foregoing amended answers, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">First reply: \u201c And now comes the said plaintiff, Charles M. Gray, and for reply to the second defense in said amended answer set forth, denies that he, at any time, represented to said defendants that the machine called \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower,\u2019 was, in all its parts and appliances, patented by Jearum Atkin; and avers that, at the time said contract was made, defendants well knew that said reaper and mower was not so patented as aforesaid; denies that said promissory note was given for patent fees on said entire machine, and avers that said promissory note was given in part payment of the patent fees for the right to use certain new, useful, and valuable improvements in the construction of reaping machines, which were covered and protected by letters patent issued by the United States. Plaintiff denies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tbe machine, of which he sold defendants the right to make and sell, was not patented to said Atkin; and denies that he had not authority or right to convey to them authority to make and sell said machines; and denies that the consideration of said note has failed, in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">^Second reply: \u201c For a reply to the third defense, in said answer set forth, plaintiff denies that he ever did represent to defendants that the reaper and mower that was designated as a model, was, in all its parts and appliances, patented to said Atkin, and avers that defendant well knew that it was not. Plaintiff avers that, in the construction of said machine, commonly called \u2018Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper,\u2019 certain valuable and new improvements are used; and that it was for the right to use said improvements that the defendants agreed to pay said patent fees; that said improvements were covered and secured by letters patent duly issued by the United States; that plaintiff had full right and authority to convey to defendants the right to use said reaper and mower; and that plaintiff did convey to said defendants said right, and that said defendants .used and enjoyed the same, and realized great profit therefrom. Said plaintiff denies that said contract was entered into on 1st day of October, 1853, and avers that the same was made on the 1st day of October, 1857.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Third reply: \u201c And for reply to the fourth defense, in said answer set forth, plaintiff denies that, at the time the said parties entered into said contract, he represented that the said reaper, in all its parts, was patented to Jearum Atkin, or that he had any authority to give or grant to defendants the exclusive right to make all the several parts, attachments, or appliances, belonging to and connected with said reaper, but avers that the patent foes which the defendants agreed to pay, and for part of which said promissory note was given, were for the right to use certain valuable improvements in reaping machines, which improvements were secured by letters patent duly issued by the United States. Plaintiff denies that, by said contract, said defendants did not acquire any right to make and sell said machine, with the aforesaid valuable improvements thereto attached, and avers that said defendants accepted the conveyance of the same, and used and enjoyed said valuable improvements, and realized great profit therefrom. Plaintiff denies that the consideration for said note failed, in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Fourth reply: \u201cFor reply to the fifth defense, in said answer *set forth, said plaintiff denies that said note was given for patent fees for the right to make and sell said reaper and mower, in all its several parts and appliances; but avers that the same was given for the right to use certain valuable improvements in reaping machines, which had been secured by letters patent duly issued by the United States.

Howard &amp; Co., of Buffalo, N. Y., for alleged infringement of one Ketchum\u2019s patent, in the construction and sale of said machines by said defendants; and for the further consideration, to wit, that the said contract, by which the said defendants bound themselves to pay a patent fee of thirty dollars oil each and every machine by them made and sold under said contract, should then be canceled and abrogated, and the said defendants then released from all further liability or obligation under the same; all of which *was done and performed by the plaintiff, and said sum of money retained by said defendants; and for the right and privilege which was then and there granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the said defendants, and accepted and enjoyed by them, to sell and dispose of 480 of said machiness, then manufactured and in their' possession, at a patent fee of seven (7) dollars each, instead of thirty dollars each, as provided for in said contract, cancelled as aforesaid, then and there did settle and compromise all of said several matters and claims, in the several defenses in said answer set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On this state of pleading, the case was tried to a jury, at the-April term, 1864, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff for* the amount of the note sued on, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Thereupon the defendants moved for a new trial, on the grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">1.

Because the court misdirected the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The motion was overruled, and judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The ruling of the court on the motion for a new trial was duly excepted to, and a bill of exceptions was taken, embodying all the evidence in the case, and the several rulings of the court during the progress of the trial. The evidence is too voluminous to be here set forth <em>in extenso, </em>and I must content myself with stating so-much of its substance as is necessary to show the points made by it, and the rulings of the court thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The defendants below gave in evidence the original agreement, \u201cA,\u201d between the parties, copied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">\u201c This agreement, made this 1st day of October, 1857, by and between Charles M.

Nor is the mere certificate of the commissioner of jiatents, though authenticated by his official seal, that such patent was issued and now remains in force, competent evidence of the facts so certified. The proper evidence of the patent would have been a copy of the <em>patent </em>itself, duly authenticated by the oficial certificate and seal <em>of </em>the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">The defendants' below also gave in evidence the testimony of a large number of witnesses, tending strongly to show that the \u201c self-acting- reaper,\u201d so called, attached to the reaper and mower referred to, unless in very exceptional cases, where the ground was smooth and level, and the grain was standing very evenly and erect, was entirely useless and of no value whatsoever; but tending, at the same time, to show that the reaper and mower alone, divested of the apparatus for raking, was useful, though inferior to some other mowers and reapers in common use.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>On the trial, \"William C.

Gray, <em>Agent.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcWS\">*The defendants below a\u00edso offered to prove that they had derived no profit from the manufacture of said Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower, under said contract, but by reason of the worthlessness of the patent of Jearum Atkin, they lost heavily and sustained no benefit. This proof the .court refused to admit; defendants below excepted; and this is assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We pass this point without remark, as it becomes unimportant by reason of the ruling of the court, hereafter to be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The defendants below having closed their evidence, the plaintiff below moved the court to exclude from the jury all the testimony given by the defendants below which relates to, or tends to prove, the invalidity of the Atkin patent, either on account of its want of value or want of novelty; and also to exclude from the jury all the testimony which tends to prove that the right to make and sell Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower was of no value; which motion the court sustained, and excluded said testimony from the jury; to which ruling of the court the defendants below excepted, .and here assign the same for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The plaintiff below having given in evidence an authenticated \u25a0copy of the letters patent to Jearum Atkin, and the testimony of .several witnesses, in respect to the character and operation of the machine manufactured by the defendants below, ostensibly under that patent, rested their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">And thereupon the court charged the jury, among other things, \u201c that if there were any valid patents on any part of the machine called Atkin\u2019s self-raking reaper and mower which the said John \u00a1S. Wright had not, at the time of the execution of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>marked \u2018A,\u2019 a right or license to use and sell to the defendants, then the title to said reaper and mower would have failed, and the plaintiff would not have a right to recover. But that, under the pleadings, it became the duty of defendants to show the same by certified copies of patents from the patent office, that there were such patents, and that unless defendants did so show the existence of valid patents, for parts of said machines, that defense would fail.\u201d To which ruling, the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">*It seems to us that this charge of the court is, at least, so far unexceptional that the defendants below have no right to complain of it. Letters patent in full are matters of public record;, they are accessible to all, and duly authenticated copies of them are readily attainable by litigants. They themselves afford the best evidence of what is covered by them. It is an elementary principle of the law of evidence that parties are required to produce the best and most certain evidence attainable; and when the defendants below claimed that a part, at least, of the rights ostensibly guaranteed to them by their contract with the plaintiffs below would, if exercised, be an infringement of prior patents, and so a failure of consideration for the contract into which they had entered, there was no hardship and no wrong in requiring them to show the infringement by the production of an authenticated copy of the patent claimed to be infringed. And the burden of proof was on them. <em>Prima </em>facie, they were liable on their pr-omissory note. They set up as a defense, a failure of consideration; they held the affirmative of this issue, and were bound to establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">But the leading and dominant question in the case is that which arises on the action of the court in ruling from the jury the greater part of the testimony given by the defendants below, by means of which they sought to establish a failure of consideration for the note on which they were sued, by proving the practical and substantial worthlessness of the machine they were to manufacture. And in order to understand what seems to have been the view of the court below on this ruling, we must recur to the written contracts between these parties, notice their respective dates, what were their stipulations, and what tvas done under them.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The original contract bears date October 1, 1857, and stipulates for the payment, by the defendants to the plaintiffs below, of a patent fee of thirty dollars on each machine made and sold by the former. Under this contract, and prior to the' execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>second contract by wbicb the first was rescinded, and all claims under it adjusted by the parties, they had manufactured eight hundred machines, three hundred and twenty of which they had sold, and four hundred *and eighty of which remained on hand undisposed of. The second contract bears date February 1, 1859, a period of seventeen months after the date of the first, during which time the defendants below, in their personal testimony on the trial, admit they had ample opportunity to observe, and did observe, the capacity and the actual working of the machine, and actually enjoyed, without interruption, all that purported to be granted to them by the license under which they acted. They entered into the new contract, and into an accord in respect <em>to </em>what was done and due under the old one, with their eyes open. And it is evident that the now contract was the result of a compromise of conflicting or divergent claims ; for, under the old contract, the defendants below were bound to pay a royalty of thirty dollars on each machine manufactured and sold, while, under the new one, this royalty was reduced to seven dollars on the four hundred and eighty machines then on hand, and on all others thereafter to be manufactured and sold. The note sued on was one of the- notes given under, and in pursuance of this last contract. There is in the case neither allegation nor proof that the defendants below ever failed to recover any amount due them for machines sold, or that they were ever made answerable in damages, on warranty or otherwise, by reason of defects in such machines or in their operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Now, on this state of fact \u2014 the defendants below having compromised for the amount due from them under the first contract,, and, by virtue of such compromise, obtained a material reduction of that amount; and having fully enjoyed, without interruption, everything for which they stipulated in the contract under which they proceeded, are they not estopped to deny a consideration for the note given by them on such compromise, <em>after </em>such enjoyment, and after full opportunity.of judging of the character of the machine, and of the value of the privilege which formed the subject-matter of their dealings ? We are of the opinion that they are so estopped. And this view of the case is well sustained by authority. Laws <em>v. </em>Purser, E. L. &amp; E. 48; Cutter <em>v. </em>Bower, 11 Ad. &amp; E. 253; Bowman <em>v. </em>Taylor, 2 Ad. &amp; E. 278; Kinsman <em>v. </em>Parkhurst, 18 How. U. S. 292; Bartlett <em>v. </em>Holbrook, *1 Gray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>114; Wilder <em>v. </em>Adams, 2 W. &amp; M. 329; Kernodle <em>v. </em>Hunt, 4 Blackf. 57. If we are right in this view of the case, there was no error in the ruling out, by the court below, of the evidence as to the want of value and want of novelty of the machine, in respect to which the parties had contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-6\">Day, C.
