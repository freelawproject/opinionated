Dickson </em>and <em>W. Y. Grholson, </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-12\">It has always been supposed that this court went to the verge of the law in holding that, in a civil case, where there *was a charge of an indictable crime, as arson, the proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. If, indeed, upon an examination of the case of Lexington Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Paver, 16 Ohio, 324-332, the court can be considered as having so held, it is contrary to the decision in the case of Munson <em>v. </em>Atwood, 30 Conn. 102, where the difference between a civil and a criminal case is considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-13\">In ordinary civil cases, and we never heard of an exception as to cases involving fraud, a preponderance of proof, and not what is, known as full proof, is all that is required. This is explained in the authority cited, page 106, to which the attention of the courtis respectfully asked.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-14\">The distinction taken in Sinclair <em>v. </em>Jackson, 47 Maine, 102, covers this case, even if a criminal case, for the fraudulent acts are not charged as a crime, in the pleadings, and a preponderance of proof will suffice. In a case there cited, Schmidt <em>v. </em>New York Insurance Co., 1 Gray, 529-533, the distinction is stated, and the difference between civil and criminal cases explained: \u201c In the former, the duty of the jury is to decide according to the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of the evidence. In the latter, all reasonable doubts are to be removed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-5\"><em>Obey, Sayler &amp; Kennon, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">The answer amounts to a charge of receiving money by false pretenses \u2014 to a charge of such systematic false weighing as amounts to an imputation of crime involving moral turpitude and punishable corporeally (S. &amp; C. 429, sec. 97), and ought to have been made out beyond a reasonable doubt.

It was set up as ground of defense, and also in support of a counter-claim to recoup for payment previously' made for middlings, that the plaintiffs below had <em>fraudulently </em>given short weight, or fraudulently charged for more middlings than had been delivered. The case was tried to a jury, and, upon the trial, evidence was given tending to show the alleged fraud, as to the middlings for the price of which the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">After the evidence had closed, the counsel of defendants (plaintiffs in error) asked the court to charge the jury, that if they found there had been a fraudulent and false weighing, or overcharging of the middlings the price of which was sued for, they might then look to the alleged frauds as to the middlings previously paid for, and allow a reclamation to the extent of the fraud. This request the court refused, but gave substantially the instruction asked, with the qualification, \u201cthat fraud must be proven beyond all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>reasonable doubt, either by positive testimony, or by circumstances-so strong as to exclude other conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The only question raised and argued in the case is, whether the-court erred in this refusal and instruction. In other words, whether-a charge of fraud, in a civil action, like a charge of crime, must be proved by evidence excluding all reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We answer the general question in the negative. Where the-fraud charged is a criminal offense, we have no doubt the rule laid down by the court should apply. It seems to be established law-that, in civil as well as in criminal cases, a party can not be found-guilty of a crime, unless upon proof which-excludes all reasonable-doubt. This is the holding of the court in Lexington Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Paver, 16 Ohio, 324. The court in that case sustained a similar charge made by the court below, upon the express ground that the fraud charged and attempted to be proven, was a criminal act. Such is not *the case here. I know the counsel argue that the charge to which the instruction applied in this case, wag. that of obtaining money by false pretenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">But it was not so. The instruction of the court was general, applying as well to the alleged fraud in weighing or overcharging the middlings sued for, as those paid for before. Besides, the fraudulent obtaining of the money, which is the gist of the offense referred to, was not directly charged or put in issue, but was merely inferential. It is not in every case, where, the necessary inference of crime follows the finding of an issue against a party, that it can be said the commission of the crime was put in issue. The <em>perjury </em>of a party might be said to be in issue, in all cases where he is a witness in the cause. If you plead <em>non est factum </em>to an action brought upon your bond, you do not thereby charge the plaintiff with <em>forgery; </em>nor if you plead payment of it, do you thereby charge-him with <em>fraudulently </em>trying to extort the money from you a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Fraud is so multifarious, and involves so many degrees of moral guilt, that it would be unsafe to lay down a general rule requiring-the highest degree of proof in all cases .of its alleged existence. We think the safer and better rule is that established in the case referred to, which is, to require only a preponderance of evidence, unless in cases where fraud amounting to a criminal offense is directly in issue, and there to require proof excluding reasonable* doubt, as in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>We are of opinion, therefore, that the Superior Court in special1, term erred in its instruction to the jury, and that the court in general term erred in affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b585-6\">Day, C.
