On that day an equitable claim, which had been set up by Price to the survey, was adjusted between him and Moncure, and they agreed to make an amicable partition, Moncure taking the southern and Price the northern part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">The survey calls for 400 rods from east to west, and 406 from north to south; but it is, in fact, 424 rods from east to west, and contains some 1,060 acres \u2014 being in the form of a parallelogram.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">The parties executed mutual deeds of release according to the partition agreed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">The deed from Price to Moncure is dated December 28,1850, and describes the land, so released to Moncure, as follows: \u201c Beginning at the southwest corner of the survey; thence with the west line of said survey north 11, west 120 polos, to a stake in said line; thence north 75, east 402 poles, to a stake in the east line thereof; thence south 11, east 140 poles, to the southeast corner of the survey; thence south 79, west 400 poles, with the south line thereof, to the beginning \u2014 containing 325 acres, more or less.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-11\">The deed from Moncure is dated March 1, 1851, and describes the land released to Price as follows: \u201cBeginning at the northeast corner of said survey; thence to the north Hine thereof west 400 poles, to the northwest corner thereof; thence with the west line south 11, east 306 poles, to <em>a stake in said line, corner to a tract of </em>325 <em>acres of said Moncure; </em>thence <em>with the north line of said tract </em>north 75, east 402 poles, to a <em>stake </em>in the east line of the survey, <em>the northeast corner of said Moncure\u2019s tract; </em>thence north 11, west 286 poles, to the beginning \u2014 containing 725 acres, more or less.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-12\">The whole controversy is as to the dividing line between the two tracts thus described in the partition deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-13\">It will be seen that the distances called for in the deed to Price\u2014 306 rods on the west line, and 286 on the east \u2014 extend 20 rods south of the north line of Moncure\u2019s 325 acres; so that the lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>would be made to overlap 20 rods, Including. 50 acres.of land, if we reject the call in the deed to Price for <em>Moncure\u2019s north line, </em>and go by the <em>distances </em>named. The 29 acres in controversy is part of this 50 acres, and the defendant, Calhoun, is in possession thereof, under title derived from Moncurc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">At the time of executing the deeds, there had been no survey of either tract; no stakes had in fact been sot at the northwest and northeast corners of the 325-acre tract, and the north line thereof ha(l never been run or marked. Soon after the execution of the deeds, however, Price located the northwest corner of the 325 acres, and sot a stake, at the place now claimed to be the true corner by Calhoun, 120 rods north of the southwest corner of the survey,\u2019 and 286 rods south of the northwest corner. The place for this corner Price ascertained by actual measurement of the 120 rods, from the southwest corner. Price also, at the same time, surveyed and marked the line eastward from the stake, in the direction called for in the deeds, N. 75 E., more than half-way across the survey. Until lately, this has always been regarded as the division line by both parties, and those claiming under them, and they have conformed their improvements thereto, and regulated their possession and use of the land accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">In the common pleas, the case was submitted to the court upon the petition and answer, making the simple question of title, and was decided by the court in favor of Calhoun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATJ\">*The district court, on petition of Price, reversed the judgment of the common pleas; and now Calhoun files his petition here, for the reversal of the judgment of the district court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-8\"><em>W.

The call in Moncure\u2019s deed to Price, for <em>distance, </em>is definite and certain. No monument or marked lines are found or were ever made to control it. No right or claim of third persons interferes, for the grantor owned the land for 100 poles beyond the call.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-11\"><em>J. B.

To fill the call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>for <em>distance </em>will go 20 polos \u2014 50 acres \u2014 beyond the ideal <em>boundary </em>called for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">The call for boundary should yield to the call for distance, because: 1. No line and no corner, such as called for, had any existence, in fact, and were not monumental, but only imaginary. Moneare being the owner of the whole survey, had no separate tract of 325 acres. The call for distance, being the most certain, should prevail. Galloway <em>v. </em>Brown, 16 Ohio, 428. 2. All ambiguous expressions in a deed must be taken most strongly against the grantor, except in government grants, where the rule is reversed. 1 J. J. Marshall, 447.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-6\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfY\">The case involves but a single question: Which of the disputed lines is established by the deed of Price ? That deed contains two calls for the division line. One of them which is a call for <em>distance </em>\u2014 306 and 286 rods from the *north line of the survey; and, if adhered to, it establishes the southern line, as claimed by Price. The other call is for corners and a line <em>by name </em>\u2014the corners and line of \u201c 325 acres of Moncure \u201d \u2014 and, if it is to prevail, then the northern line, as claimed by Calhoun, is the true boundary lino. These calls are directly repugnant. One or the other must be rejected. Which shall it be ?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It is said that this is a case for the application of the rule, that the words of a <em>deed-poll </em>must be taken strongest against the grantor. I think not. The deed must be construed in the light of its surroundings. One of these surroundings is the deed made two months before, by Price to Moncuro, for the 325 acres. This latter deed is not only a circumstance to be looked to, with other circumstances, as throwing light on the meaning of the parties to the deed to Price, but it is, in effect, referred to in the latter deed, and made part of it by the call for the corners and north line of the \u201c 325-acre tract \u201d described in it. The two deeds must be construed together as an <em>indenture, </em>and not as a deed-poll. They are inseparable, so far as this question is concerned. They are deeds between the same parties, and are, in the strictest sense, deeds <em>in pari materia. </em>We must adopt such a construction of <em>each, </em>as will make the parties consistent with themselves throughout. They had but a <em>single intent </em>as to the location of this dividing line, and that intent must have been the <em>same </em>at the execution of both deeds. They did not intend to fix <em>two </em>lines, or to convey the 50 acres between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>disputed lines <em>twice </em>\u2014 first from Price to Mon cure, and then back again to Price. This is rendered evident by the call, in the deed to Price, for the corners and lino of <em>Moncure\u2019s </em>325 <em>acres. </em>They did not, in other words, <em>change their mincls </em>as to the location of the line, between the execution of the two deeds. They made a mistake, but they never discovered the mistake until after the execution of both deeds : and the simple question now is, in which deed was that mistake made ? Or, assuming it to have been a mistake in the deed to Price, as it must have been, was it a mistake in distance, or a mistake in naming Mon cure\u2019s line?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is to be observed, that there is no repugnancy in the *deed to Moncure. The line in dispute is fixed in that deed with <em>absolute certainty </em>at the distances of 120 and 140 rods, respectively, from the southwest and southeast corners. That is certain which can be made certain; and, therefore, these distances fix the lino with as much certainty as if the deed had called for natural objects upon the line, or for the stakes and marks afterward put upon it by Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Indeed, there is not only nothing in the deed repugnant to these calls for distance, but the call for 325 acres is, in effect, a duplicate call for the same line; for that is the precise quantity in Moncure\u2019s tract, if the dimensions are correctly given in the deed. It is true the deed says 325 acres, \u201c more or less.\u201d The words \u201c more or less,\u201d however, should be referred to the known inaccuracy of original surveys, and not to any supposed uncertainty in so plain an arithmetical calculation, But be that as it may, there is no repugnancy in the deed to Moncure. It is consistent with itself, and, construed by itself, it undeniably covers the fifty acres of land in dispute. Such being its construction, it is only necessary to say that that construction could not be changed by the subsequent execution of a deed to Price. The only effect of the latter deed, so far as the fifty acres were concerned, would be to reconvoy the land to Price. As I have said, that can not be its effect, for it refers to a line and corners <em>of Moncure, </em>which, though still open, were <em>certain </em>as any demonstration in Euclid, and had been so made certain <em>by the parties themselves. </em>They intended to adopt that line, wherever it might fall. If they had simply said so, and said no more, all would have been consistent throughout. But they said one thing more. They undertook to give the <em>distance </em>of that <em>line </em>from the north line of the survey, and, in that, made a <em>mistake </em>of twenty rods. That mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>call for twenty rods must be rejected, and all else in both deeds will stand. If we retain that call, and fix the line by it, then we must reject much more \u2014 the call for Moncure\u2019s line in the same, and both the calls, for distance and for quantity, in the deed to Moncure; or we must come to the absurd conclusion indicated, that the parties meant to convey the same land <em>twice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The case in 1 J: J. Marshall (447), relied upon by counsel for ^defendant, differs from the present case in three essential particulars : 1. The repugnancy'in that case was between a call for distance in locating <em>a, particular </em>line, and the general location of the <em>tract itself. </em>Here the repugnancy is between two calls for the same particular line, one locating it by its <em>distance, </em>and the other by its <em>name. </em>2. The line called for in the case in J. J. Marshall, had not been previously fixed by the <em>parties themselves. </em>Here the line had been so fixed by the deed to Moncure, and is called for <em>eo nomine, </em>as \u201c the line\u201d of the 325-acre tract. It is called for as a <em>still subsisting </em>line, and in a way which as unmistakably'shows it to have been previously agreed upon and fixed by the former deed, as if the fact had been asserted in so many1,words. 3. In the case in J. J. Marshall, the deed merely calls for a line of the adjacent tract, without giving the <em>ownership </em>of the tract. Here the call is for the line and stakes of \u201ca tract of 325 acres <em>of Moncure.\u201d </em>What does that mean? It means that Moncuro <em>still owns </em>up\u2019 to that line. It means that the M\u00f3ncuro line, <em>as heretofore fixed, </em>wherever that line may fall, shall be the dividing boundary: It means that the' parties have already fixed that line, and are <em>still satisfied </em>with 'it, and that the land south of it is still the land \u201cof Moncure.\u201d Under the circumstances, it can not reasonably be held to \u2019mean less.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">This is a stronger case for an' interpretation rejecting the call for distance, than the case of Nash <em>v. </em>Atherton, 10 Ohio, 164. There the call was for a corner of land owned 'by a third person, and, as in the present case, no survey had fixed the corner so called for. Subsequently a survey established the corner at a different place than that at which the parties supposed it to' be, and from which they <em>made their measurement </em>at the date of the deed. Yet the court rejected the call for distance, and held the parties bound by the corner as subsequently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">This decision is not at all in conflict with the case of Galloway <em>v. </em>Brown, 16 Ohio, 428. The syllabus in that case very imperfectly states the opinion of the court. The corner and 'line called for there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>were subsequently removed, and the *court merely held that the parties were not bound to follow them to their new location.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It should be observed, also, that the contemporaneous acts of the parties corroborate the construction we put upon this deed. Immediately upon the execution of the deeds, and for a long time thereafter, they regarded the line marked by Price as the true line. Whether these acts of recognition of that line are of a nature to <em>estop </em>the parties from denying it to be the true line, as counsel have argued, we need not decide. We hold that it is the line fixed by the deed to Price, upon any fair and legitimate construction of that deed, in the light of the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Judgment of the district court reversed, and judgment of the common pleas affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-7\">Day, C. J., and White, Brinkerhoef, and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
