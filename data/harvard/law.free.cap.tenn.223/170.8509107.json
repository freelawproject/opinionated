By demurrer defendants contended this statute barred the action. The Chancellor overruled this contention, but allowed a discretionary appeal. We think the Chancellor erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The original bill admits upon its face the following facts: Complainants entered into a contract dated July 23, 1962 with defendants Thompson and Russell Enterprises, for the purchase of a lot in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, and for the construction of a residence thereon. Thompson and Russell Enterprises is a partnership composed of John B. Thompson and Charles W. Russell. Construction of the residence was completed, complainants began occupancy of the same, and a war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ranty deed executed by Thompson &amp; Russell Builders, a corporation, was delivered to complainants on January 25, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">About six months after the date of delivery of the deed and the occupancy of the premises, complainants noted defects in the residence such as cracks in the walls, window and door frames out of alignment, settling of the foundation and sinking of the house into the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">To recover damages for injury to real property arising out of the contractual relationship of the parties, this action was commenced on July 19, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">From the recital of the facts it is clear the action was commenced more than three years after the execution of the contract; more than three years after the date the residence was completed and occupied by complainants; and more than three years after the date complainants first had knowledge of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Actions for injuries to personal or real property must be commenced within three years from the accrual of the cause of action. T.C.A. sec. 28-305.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The word \u201cactions\u201d as used in this Code section refers to the subject matter of the controversy and not to the remedial procedure. Whether an action for the recovery of damages for injury to personal or r\u00e9al property results from a breach of contract or from a tort, independent of contract, is immaterial. <em>Bodne v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Austin, </em>156 Tenn. 353, 2 S.W.2d 100, 62 A.L.R. 1410 (1928); <em>Hackworth v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>214 Tenn. 506, 381 S.W.2d 292 (1964); <em>Pinkerton &amp; Laws Co. v. Nashville Flying Service, Inc., </em>218 Tenn. 252, 402 S.W.2d 861 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Under these authorities, although complainants\u2019 bill sounds in contract, alleging a breach of an implied warranty in the contract of sale, dated July 23, 1962, in that defendants did not construct the residence in a good and workmanlike manner, the only injury alleged in the bill is physical injury to the residence which allegedly occurred and was known to complainants more than three years prior to commencing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Under these circumstances, it is clear from the cases cited that T.C.A. sec. 28-305 furnishes the period of limitation of the action, and not the six year statute, T.C.A. sec. 28-309, as appellees contend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In <em>Bodne, </em>after the most elaborate and complete consideration of the nature and purpose of our statutes of limitation it was held that although the action sounded in breach of contract, because it sought recovery for injury to the person the one year statute of limitations applying to \u201call actions for * * * injuries to the person\u201d applied. The Court said that this statute \u201chas application whenever the action is one by which it is sought to recover damages for injuries inflicted upon the person, is not only justified by a natural and plausible interpretation of the language employed, but also by what is conceived to be a practical construction heretofore quite generally given to the statute by the profession and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>holdings of trial courts; <em>and further, perhaps, by the probable purpose of the lawmakers to thus limit the bringing of actions, the disposition of which involves the production of evidence in its nature particularly difficult to perpetuate and easy to manufacture, or manipulate, after a lapse of years.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Bodne, </em>in <em>Hackworth v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>supra, which was an action to recover damages for breach of warranty resulting when gas heaters bought from defendant exploded and damaged a large chicken house, this Court dealt with the exact questions presented here, in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cWe think the answer to one question is determinative of this case. The question, put simply, is whether T.C.A. sec. 28-305 or T.C.A. sec. 28-309 is the applicable statute of limitations governing the action in question. <em>More specifically, is an action for breach of implied warranty and resulting property damage governed by our statute of limitations applicable to \u2018actions for injuries to personal or real property\u2019 or governed by our statute applicable to \u2018actions on contracts not otherwise expressly provided forV</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cThis is clearly an action for injury to personal property. Its gravamen is tortious injury to personal property. T.C.A. sec. 28-304 and T.C.A. sec. 28-305 are very similar in form. Each begins with the word \u2018actions\u2019 followed by a description of the type of action and then ends by stating that such type of action must be commenced within a certain time after the cause of action has accrued or be forever barred. T.C.A. sec. 28-304 applies to actions for personal injuries and T.C.A. sec. 28-305 applies to actions for injuries to personal property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>\u201cThe word \u2018action\u2019, as used in the statute, has reference to the subject-matter or nature thereof, not to its form as a matter of remedial procedure. </em>Whether it he in tort or on contract, it is an action to recover damages for injuries to the person, and comes alike under the terms of the statute, since the phrase therein, \u2018no action to recover damages, for injuries to the person,\u2019 refers to bodily injuries, and not to injuries to feelings. <em>[Bodne v. Austin] </em>156 Tenn. at 357, 2 S.W.2d [100] at 101.\u201d <em>Hackworth v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>214 Tenn. 508, 381 S.W.2d 293.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">This holding was again reviewed, and found to he sound in <em>Pinkerton &amp; Laws Co. v. Nashville Flying Service, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Although appellees undertake to distinguish their case from the principle laid down in <em>Bodne, Hackworth </em>and <em>Pinkerton, </em>on the ground they have not alleged tort, and are suing simply because \u201cappellants failed to comply with their contract, which caused the damages sustained\u2019 \u2019 their ease cannot he so distinguished. It is an action to recover damages on account of injury to real property and is controlled by T.C.A. sec. 28-305, as that Code section has been construed in <em>Hackworth </em>and <em>Pinkerton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The decree of the chancery court is set aside and the original bill is dismissed at the cost of the original complainants and their sureties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-8\">Burnett, Chief Justice, and Dyeb, Chattin and Creson, Justices, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> \u201c28-305.
