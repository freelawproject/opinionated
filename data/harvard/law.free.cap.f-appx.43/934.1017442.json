Johnson\u2019s brief on appeal makes no mention of a claim of hostile work environment, and, as the district court did, we construe Johnson\u2019s Title VII claim as alleging discrete discriminatory acts, rather than hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">This court has consistently held that to make a prima facie case of discrete acts discrimination, the plaintiff must present some evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that he suffered a materially adverse employment action. <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt. Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 885 (6th Cir.1996); <em>Wilson v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>932 F.2d 510, 514 (6th Cir.1991). After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs and counsels\u2019 arguments, we are convinced that the district court did not err in finding that the plaintiff failed to identify any facts tending to prove that he suffered a materially adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Because the district court\u2019s opinion carefully and correctly sets out the law governing the issues raised, and clearly articulates the reasons underlying its decision, issuance of a full written opinion by the court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\">. Johnson did not plead any specific claims under either of these statutory sections. Rather, his complaint alleges that \"Defendants conduct was in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\u201d The district court construed this count in the complaint as raising claims under both \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983, and granted summary judgment to the defendants on both. Johnson\u2019s brief on appeal makes no mention of the \u00a7 1983 claim, and presents no argument whatsoever with regard to the \u00a7 1981 claim, mentioning only that he presented sufficient evidence in response to the motion for summary judgment \u201cto give rise to genuine issues of material fact as to Appellant\u2019s Title VII and Section 1981 claims.\u201d We therefore consider them abandoned. <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Com's, </em>85 F.3d 257, 259 (1996) (noting that issues not raised in appellant's opening brief will not be considered on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
