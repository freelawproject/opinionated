EM Potter Coal Co., </em>Decision and Order, 00-0347 BLA (Jan. 11, 2001). As explained below, we deny the petition for review and affirm the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">After working as a coal miner for over twenty-one years and experiencing cardiovascular and pulmonary health problems, John Hensley retired in October of 1973. On January 17, 1974, he filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, contending that he suffered from pneumoconiosis, i.e., black lung disease, as a result of his work in Virginia\u2019s coal mines. After initially denying his claim for benefits, the appropriate authority in the Department of Labor, in September 1979, made an initial finding that Hensley was eligible for black lung benefits. Over the next two decades, the parties engaged in exhaustive procedural wrangling, during which Hensley, on February 14, 1986, passed away. Following multiple hearings, various decisions, and several remands, an Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d), on August 27, 1998, issued a final Decision and Order on the merits of Hensley\u2019s claim. <em>Hensley v. Edd Potter Coal Co., </em>Decision and Order on Remand Awarding Benefits, 1993-BLA-405 (Aug. 27, 1998) (the \u201cALJ Opinion\u201d). Based on her review of the extensive medical evidence relating to Hensley\u2019s claim, much of it conflicting, the ALJ found that Hensley became totally disabled, due to pneumoconiosis, in September 1974. As such, the ALJ awarded black lung and survivor\u2019s benefits to Hensley\u2019s widow, Bernie J. Hensley. Edd Potter then sought reconsideration and, on November 16, 1999, the ALJ issued a lengthy decision reaffirming the ALJ Opinion. <em>Hensley v. Edd Potter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Coal Co., </em>Order Granting In Part Employer\u2019s Motion For Reconsideration, 1993-BLA-405 (Nov. 16, 1998). Edd Potter thereafter appealed to the BRB, which, on January 11, 2001, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits. Edd Potter has now petitioned for our review of the BRB\u2019s decision, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (incorporated by reference into 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In our review of a decision of the BRB, we must affirm an award of black lung benefits \u201cif it is in accordance with the law and is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 756 (4th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla; it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207-08 (4th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). Under the Administrative Procedure Act (the \u201cAPA\u201d), an ALJ\u2019s opinion must state the \u201cfindings and conclusions, and the reasons or bases therefore, on all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Edd Potter raises two contentions in its petition for review. First, it asserts that the ALJ violated the APA by failing to provide a sufficient rationale for crediting the medical evidence which was positive for pneumoconiosis, rather than crediting the evidence to the contrary. Secondly, Edd Potter contends that, if Hensley\u2019s widow is entitled to benefits, due process precludes liability being assigned to it because of the extraordinary delay in the resolution of Hensley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Prolonged exposure to coal dust has subjected thousands of our nation\u2019s coal miners to pneumoconiosis, prompting Congress to create a federal benefits program for victims of this terrible disease. Because Hensley worked in the coal mines for more than ten years, and because his claim was filed prior to 1978, his claim is governed by what are commonly known as \u201cthe interim regulations,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 727.1-727.405. Pursuant thereto, an interim presumption may arise under certain circumstances, and a miner is \u201cpresumed to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis ... [if] a chest roentgenogram (X-ray), biopsy, or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 203(a)(1). This presumption may be rebutted, however, if, inter alia, \u201c[i]n light of all relevant evidence it is established that the individual is able to do his usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work,\u201d or if \u201c[t]he evidence establishes that the total disability or death of the miner did not arise in whole or in part out of coal mine employment....\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(2) &amp; (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">In determining whether Hensley qualified for the interim presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>total disability due to pneumoconiosis, the ALJ reviewed and analyzed thirty-two separate x-ray readings of Hensley\u2019s condition taken between 1977 and 1984. ALJ Opinion at 4-7. In so doing, she observed that twelve of the x-ray readings were positive for pneumoconiosis while twenty of the readings were negative. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The ALJ further observed that seven of the positive readings were offered by Board-certified radiologists and B-readers, while nineteen of the negative readings were offered by individuals of similar qualifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Edd Potter contends that the ALJ failed to provide an explanation for crediting the positive x-rays over the negative ones. To the contrary, the ALJ offered such an explanation, stating that she found it significant that six different dually qualified physicians offered seven positive readings for pneumoconiosis. <em>Id. </em>In substance, she concluded that the possibility of six qualified doctors making erroneous positive readings of pneumoconiosis was highly unlikely. And we have previously observed, the APA \u201cneither burdens ALJs with a duty of long-windedness nor requires them to assume that we cannot grasp the obvious connotations of everyday language.\u201d <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>137 F.3d 799, 803 (4th Cir.1998). Faced with multiple x-rays from various qualified physicians, we are perfectly capable of understanding the ALJ\u2019s focus on the \u201ccorroborative nature of these [positive] readings.\u201d ALJ Opinion at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Edd Potter similarly contends that the ALJ failed to satisfactorily explain her decisi\u00f3n not to credit its rebuttal evidence. The ALJ, however, discussed at length the medical reports submitted by Edd Potter, and she offered her reasons for discrediting them. For example, the ALJ discounted the report of one Edd Potter physician because he had not reviewed all of the evidence in the record, and she discredited the report of another such physician because he changed his opinion after receiving correspondence from the company. ALJ Opinion at 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In context, the ALJ provided a sufficient explanation for applying the interim presumption of pneumoconiosis and for discounting Edd Potter\u2019s rebuttal evidence. Having complied with the APA and the applicable legal principles, we conclude that the ALJ Opinion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Edd Potter also contends that, due to the extraordinary twenty-eight year delay in resolving Hensley\u2019s black lung claim, it would contravene due process to require it to pay his widow the benefits awarded to her. As such, it maintains that the benefits should be paid by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of this contention, Edd Potter points to our decision in <em>Lane Hollow, </em>in which we found a due process violation when the Department of Labor failed to notify a mine operator of a black lung claim until seventeen years after the miner had filed the claim. Hensley\u2019s claim, however, is mark<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>edly different than the one addressed in <em>Lane Hollow. </em>Edd Potter received timely notice of Hensley\u2019s claim, and its physicians were provided the opportunity to (and in fact they did) examine Hensley prior to his death. Indeed, Edd Potter has vigorously litigated this case since its inception nearly three decades ago. As Judge Michael cogently explained in <em>Lane Hollow, </em>\u201c[t]he Due Process Clause does not create a right to <em>win </em>litigation; it creates a right <em>not to lose </em>without a fair opportunity to defend oneself.\u201d 137 F.3d at 807 (emphasis in original). Edd Potter has been accorded such an opportunity, and assigning it liability for Mrs. Hensley\u2019s benefits award does not contravene any of its due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing, the petition for review is denied and the decision of the Benefits Review Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED AND AWARD AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. Although 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 203(a)(1) refers to a single x-ray, \"it in fact requires the ALJ to weigh all available x-ray evidence to determine whether it preponderates in favor of a finding of pneumoconiosis.\u201d <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>137 F.3d 799, 803 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-16\">. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b), there are four bases capable of rebutting the interim presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis. The parties agree, however, that two of those bases, found in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(1) and (4), are not applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\">.
