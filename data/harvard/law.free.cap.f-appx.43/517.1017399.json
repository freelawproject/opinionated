Miller\u2019s use of Choice Hotel\u2019s trademark without its consent violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. It found that Miller\u2019s use of the Clarion mark was likely to deceive as to the connection between Miller\u2019s hotel and Choice Hotels in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). The court also held Miller individually liable for his acts of infringement because no \u201cspecial or contractual relationship is required\u201d to hold an individual liable for acts of infringement Because Miller failed to maintain and produce accurate records of his profits and losses, the court exercised its discretion under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) to award Choice Hotels $100,000.00 as profits. The court also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) because it found that Miller\u2019s conduct constituted knowing and willful infringement. Miller now appeals. He contends in numerous issues that the District Court erred both in awarding damages and attorneys fees to the Appellee. .</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">We apply plenary review to the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law with respect to the Lanham Act claim. <em>Express Servs., Inc. v. Careers Express Staffing Servs., </em>176 F.3d 183, 185 (3d Cir.1999). We review factual findings regarding the Lanham Act violations for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We review the District Court\u2019s finding that this was an \u201cexceptional case,\u201d and thus merited an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom, Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir.2000). The method by which attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded is a question of law to which we apply plenary review. <em>Loughner v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, </em>260 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.2001). We review the District Court\u2019s award of equitable remedies for an abuse of discretion. <em>Voes-Alpine Trading USA Corp. v. Vantage Steel Corp., </em>919 F.2d 206, 211 (3d Cir.1990)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As noted, this is an action for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and unfair competition under state law. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The facts and procedural history are well known to the parties, and we see no benefit in recounting them in any detail greater than necessary to explain our decision to the parties. We note at the outset that Miller\u2019s first argument seems to confuse the issue of liability with the issue of damages. He argues that there was no proof of loss, which is a damages issue, and that there was no proof of confusion, which is a liability issue. The answer, however, is in the text of the statute itself, which does not require the actual confusion be proved for an award of damages. Use of a mark which is \u201clikely to cause confusion\u201d is all that is required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Miller next argues that Choice failed to prove actual damages, and that absent evidence of actual damage, there is no right to an award of damages or profits. Miller\u2019s argument again falls before the language of the statute. It is clear from the statute itself that an award of profits is not conditioned upon an award of damages. The statute clearly provides that a prevailing party can recover three distinct types of awards which are enumerated as \u201c(1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.\u201d There is no statutory language limiting awards of profits only to those situations where damages are also awarded. Miller\u2019s argument that \u201c[ajbsent evidence of actual damage, there is no right to an award of damages or profits\u201d is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Next, section 1117(a) of the Lanham Act permits a district court to award attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin exceptional cases.\u201d Miller challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that this is one of those \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d Considering that we review its findings for clear error and its award for an abuse of discretion, we only need note that the record overwhelmingly supports the District Court\u2019s award. Without recapitulating all the facts, we merely note that (1) Miller received numerous letters from Choice informing him of his infringing conduct, but he ignored them; and (2) Miller failed to comply with the District Court\u2019s temporary restraining order within the appropriate time period. Under these circumstances, the District Court\u2019s finding that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d is more than amply supported. After an extensive review of the record, we conclude that each of the District Court\u2019s findings is supported, and that the District Court\u2019s fee decision is within the limits of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">In sum, after thoroughly examining the issues, hearing oral argument on the cause, and following an extensive review of the record, we conclude that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>merit to any of Appellant\u2019s issues, and will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
