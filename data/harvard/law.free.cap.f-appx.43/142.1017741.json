We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by section 309(c) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Because the BIA\u2019s decision incor* porated that of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), we review the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir.1996). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that Syed\u2019s testimony regarding his fear of persecution was not credible because Syed\u2019s testimony contained numerous material inconsistencies. <em>See Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Syed was not eligible for asylum. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 571-72 (9th Cir.1990). Because Syed did not meet the standard for asylum, he cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation, and the IJ did not err in not explicitly addressing this claim. <em>See Valderrama, </em>260 F.3d at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Syed is not eligible for suspension of deportation because Syed failed to satisfy the continuous physical presence requirement. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">Syed\u2019s due process rights were not violated. The BIA may adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995). There is no indication in the record that the IJ was biased against Syed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">Because Syed has not raised the issue of his eligibility for relief based on his marriage to a United States citizen before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.1999). To present this claim, Syed must file a motion to reopen with the BIA. <em>Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1098 (9th Cir.2000). We stay the mandate for a period of ninety days to allow Syed the opportunity to file a motion to reopen with the BIA for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen. <em>See Ortiz, </em>179 F.3d at 1156; <em>Oli</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>var v.
