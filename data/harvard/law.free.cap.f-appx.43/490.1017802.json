The Tallmans\u2019 son, Jason, died after being restrained at a residential school at which he had been placed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the IDEA, and the Tallmans contend that violations of the IDEA and implementing regulations were proximate causes of his death. Jason\u2019s death was a tragedy, but we are compelled to conclude that summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Jason Tallman, then 12 years old, died in May 1993 as a result of injuries suffered while a student at Wiley House, a highly structured residential school in Pennsylvania for troubled youth. Although blessed with a high I.Q., Jason had a long history of disruptive behavior and had been diagnosed as suffering from hyperactivity, dysgraphia, metal toxicity, and emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Jason attended a public elementary school in Barnegat, New Jersey, through the third grade, but he exhibited behavioral problems. In the fall of 1990, Jason\u2019s parents enrolled him in a Catholic school in Toms River, where his behavior was at times highly inappropriate and threatening. He composed a rhyme that culminated in blowing his teacher\u2019s head off with a bazooka, and he threatened to kill his teacher and bomb the school. <em>See </em>App. 340. After Christmas, he was asked to leave the school and was again enrolled in the Barnegat public school system, where his behavioral problems, including running away and threatening the vice-principal, continued.. <em>See </em>App. 365-70, 845-48. Jason was evaluated, and during the following summer it was recommended to the Tallmans that they consider a classification of emotionally disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Instead, the Tallmans again removed Jason from the Barnegat school system and enrolled him in the fall of 1991 in Admiral Farragut Academy in Pine Beach, New Jersey. In January 1992, he was asked to leave Admiral Farragut.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The Tallman family then admitted themselves for treatment at the Philadelphia Guidance Center. App. 380. During his first three days at the Center, Jason\u2019s medication was changed and, according to his mother, he became \u201c[ejxtremely wild, totally out of control.\u201d App. 383. He was then admitted to the Horsham Clinic. <em>See id. </em>at 384. There, according to a physician\u2019 report, Jason \u201cwas extremely uncooperative with the examiner\u201d and \u201cwas often aggressive with his mother and required her to keep him in constant restraint. He kicked and hit her several times, and at one point tried to trash [the doctor\u2019s] office\u201d and \u201ccaused significant damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. At one point, Jason, who was then 10 years old, \u201chad to be escorted out of the office by security and mental health technicians because he was extremely aggressive and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">In March 1992, the Tallmans once again enrolled Jason in the Barnegat public school system, and he was classified as emotionally disturbed. He was assigned temporarily to home instruction, while the Tallmans and staff of the Barnegat Board of Education and New Jersey\u2019s Division of Youth and Family Services (\u201cDYFS\u201d) began a largely cooperative search for a school outside the Barnegat district where Jason could be placed at public expense. At first, they applied only to day schools. Only one day school accepted Jason\u2019s application, but the Tallmans found that school, Archway, unacceptable, primarily because it \u201cdid not take in the educational, the giftedness along with disabilities.\u201d App. 392. The search then widened to include in-state residential schools, but Jason was rejected from the all those to which his application was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">The search was expanded further to include out-of-state residential institutions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and this time the Wiley House in Pennsylvania offered to take Jason. Contemporaneously, the Tallmans, acting independently, secured a place for Jason at the Grove School in Connecticut. The Barnegat team visited both schools and decided that Wiley House was \u201csuperior.\u201d App. at 998. The Grove School soon rescinded its offer to Jason, after a DYFS staffer provided the school with records from the Horsham Clinic suggesting (incorrectly, according to the Tallmans) that Jason had started fires. Thus, after the Tallmans and the Barnegat defendants together undertook three rounds of an ever-widening search, Wiley House was the only residential school still willing to take Jason.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Tallmans initially resisted placing Jason at Wiley House, contending that the Grove School better served Jason\u2019s needs because its structure was less rigid and its environment was more suited for gifted students. Because of this disagreement over which school was more appropriate, Mrs. Tallman did not sign the Individual Education Program<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cIEP\u201d) that she and the Barnegat Child Study Team had jointly drafted. The Tallmans requested a due process hearing, and one was scheduled before Administrative Law Judge Joseph Martone (\u201cthe ALJ\u201d). Before the hearing, however, the parties entered into a settlement on January 28, 1998, and on February 1 the ALJ approved the settlement. Under this settlement, Jason would enter Wiley House, but the question whether permanent placement there was appropriate would be postponed until after Jason was admitted and evaluated at Wiley House. Thus, Jason finally entered Wiley House on May 11, 1993, but without a completed IEP. The next day, a staff member at Wiley House, while breaking up a dispute between Jason and another student, physically restrained and fatally injured Jason. Jason died within a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The procedural history of this litigation begins in 1995, when the Tallmans, proceeding in their individual capacities and as administrators ad prosequendum of Jason\u2019s estate, filed a complaint for money damages pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, the CM Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 (HCPA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e), and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g. <em>See </em>App. at 25. The complaint named as defendants the State of New Jersey, its Departments of Education (DOE) and Human Services (DHS), Jason\u2019s DYFS case worker (Cheryl Golden), and a DOE representative (Jeffrey Osowski). Also named were the Barnegat Board of Education, Jason\u2019s Child Study Team (Jill Stanick, Anne Sterner, and Joan Heleine), the director of special education (Gayle Gunning), and Bamegat\u2019s superintendent (Robert Horbelt). (We will refer to this latter group of defendants collectively as \u201cthe Barnegat defendants.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">In January 1996, the District Court dismissed some of the Tallmans\u2019 claims, <em>viz., </em>their \u00a7 1983 claims against the State of New Jersey and its departments, their FERPA claims, and their direct claims under the IDEA against DHS and Golden. In September 1997, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the State, DOE, DHS, and Cheryl Golden on the remaining claims against them. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Court also granted summary judgment in favor of the Barnegat defendants on the claims under the Rehabilitation Act and FERPA. In March 1998, the District Court \u201cremanded\u201d the case to ALJ Mar-tone for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Barnegat defendants had violated the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The ALJ expressed doubt about his jurisdiction to conduct a hearing and make determinations in this action, but he proceeded in accordance with the District Court\u2019s directions and considered eight violations of the IDEA alleged by the Tail-mans: (1) \u201cexploring day placements and placing [Jason] on home instruction without the benefit of an IEP,\u201d (2) \u201cfailing to provide [Jason] with a continuum of alternative placements,\u201d (3) \u201cplacing [Jason] on home instruction for the 1992-93 school year, this being the most restrictive placement,\u201d (4) \u201cplacing [Jason] in [a] non-approved placement,\u201d (5) \u201cfailing to recognize the unsegregability of [Jason\u2019s] disabilities,\u201d (6) \u201cviolating the child find requirements,\u201d (7) \u201cfailing to assess all areas of suspected disability,\u201d and (8) \u201cfailing to include the parents as joint and equal participants in the IEP process.\u201d App. 127. The ALJ rejected all but two of these alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The first violation found by the ALJ was that the Barnegat defendants had violated the IDEA by placing Jason on home instruction without the benefit of an IEP during the period from March to May of 1992 (one year before his death). The Barnegat defendants contended that an initial IEP had probably been prepared in March before the period in question, but Mrs. Tallman disagreed, and the earliest IEP produced by the defendants was prepared in May. The ALJ accordingly found that the Barnegat defendants had \u201cviolated the IDEA by placing [Jason] on home instruction without the benefit of an IEP from March until May 1992.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The second violation found by the ALJ was that the Barnegat defendants made \u201cthe determination to place [Jason] in either a day placement, or subsequently, in a residential placement, without the benefit of an IEP.\u201d App. 130. He credited the testimony of the director of the child study team that the procedure in cases such as Jason\u2019s was to find a placement and prepare a conforming IEP later, and he concluded that this clearly violated the IDEA and implementing regulations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The ALJ went on to observe that the entire proceeding should be dismissed because the parties had settled all IDEA issues at the time of Jason\u2019s placement at Wiley House. \u201cAt that time,\u201d the ALJ wrote, \u201cit was agreed that [Jason] would become a resident of Wiley House based on the agreement that Wiley House was a more appropriate placement tha[n] home instruction, and that there would be an independent evaluation of [Jason]. At that time, petitioners had the opportunity to pursue any claims they may have had that the [district] violated the procedural requirements of the IDEA [in any of the ways alleged] but that they \u2018chose not to do so\u2019 and instead to settle the matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Apparently as a means to appeal the AL J\u2019s decision, the Tallmans filed a second complaint in federal court in March 2000. This second action made virtually identical claims as the 1995 action. It asserted violations of the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, HCPA, FERPA, and \u00a7 1983. However, instead of naming the DHS or DYFS as defendants, the new complaint named the State of New Jersey Office of Administrative Law (OAL) and the Commissioner of the DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In November 2000, the District Court reinstated the 1995 action and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>most of the claims in the 2000 complaint under <em>res judicata. </em>The Court dismissed the claims against the OAL on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and on the ground of judicial immunity. App. 144-47. Finally, in May 2001, the Court granted the Barnegat defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the claims asserted in the 1995 complaint. The Court accepted the ALJ\u2019s findings that there had not been strict compliance with the IDEA in two respects, but the Court held that these were \u201ctechnical\u201d and not \u201cactual\u201d violations. <em>Id. </em>at 158. In addition, the court found that \u201cthe technical violations by the Barnegat defendants\u201d did not constitute a proximate cause of Jason\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>The Court also granted Wiley House\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Barnegat defendants\u2019 claim for indemnification and contribution. The Tallmans then took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We first address the question whether the District Court erred in 1998 by remanding the case to the ALJ for an evidentiary hearing on whether the defendants had violated the IDEA. Most IDEA actions do not seek damages and are filed in federal district court only after administrative proceedings that often result in the creation of an exhaustive administrative record. The remand ordered by the District Court sought to place this damages action in the same procedural posture as conventional IDEA actions, and we therefore have no difficulty seeing why the District Court found this procedure to be attractive. In addition, the District Court observed that neither party had objected to the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The Tallmans now argue, however, that this procedure constituted legal error for two reasons \u2014 because the ALJ lacked jurisdiction and because they were entitled to a jury trial on their damages claims. The Tallmans take the position that the District Court\u2019s error in remanding the case to the ALJ should invalidate the District Court\u2019s subsequent reliance on the ALJ\u2019s findings that the only IDEA violations were the two mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">We are inclined to agree that \u201cremand\u201d to the ALJ was improper. Neither the District Court nor the defendants have offered a persuasive legal basis for this procedure. We also note that the administrative remedial scheme could not provide the damages sought by the Tallmans. <em>See W.B. v. Matulo, </em>67 F.3d 484, 495 (3d Cir.1995) (\u201cwhere the relief sought in a civil action is not available in an IDEA administrative proceeding, recourse to such proceedings would be futile\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">However, we see no reason why we cannot view the testimony of the various witnesses at the hearing before the ALJ as the equivalent of depositions submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). At oral argument, counsel for the Tallmans conceded he had no objection to our taking this view of the testimony before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">We now turn to the central issue in this appeal: whether the record is sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the Tail-mans\u2019 IDEA claims for damages. Under the IDEA, states receive federal funds for special education programs on the condition that they implement policies to assure a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d for all of its disabled children. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(a). New Jersey fulfills its IDEA obligations through a complex statutory and regulatory scheme currently codified at N.J.S.A. \u00a7 18A:46-1 <em>et seq. </em>and N.J.A.C. \u00a7 6A:14-1 <em>et seq. </em>(formerly codified at N.J.A.C. \u00a7 6:28-1 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has summarized the statutory definition of a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d as consisting of \u201ceducational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child \u2018to benefit\u2019 from the instruction.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 188-89, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982); <em>see also </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. In <em>Ridgewood Board of Ed. v. N.E., </em>172 F.3d 238 (3d Cir.1999), we elaborated that an IEP, in order to meet this standard, must provide \u201csignificant learning\u201d and confer \u201cmeaningful benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. While an IEP need not maximize the potential of a disabled child, the benefit must be more than \u201ctrivial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247 (citing <em>Polk v. Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, </em>853 F.2d 171 (3d Cir.1988)). Our Court, unlike some other courts of appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has held that a claim for a violation of the IDEA may be brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See W.B. v. Matulo, </em>67 F.3d 484 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">As previously noted, the District Court accepted the ALJ\u2019s factual finding that defendants violated the IDEA when they placed Jason on home instruction without the benefit of an IEP from March until May 1992 and when they made the determination to place him in either a day or residential placement without the benefit of an IEP. App. 130. Nevertheless, the District Court held that these violations were \u201ctechnical\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive\u201d and thus not \u201cactual violation[s] of IDEA.\u201d App. at 156-58. Besides the two matters identified by the ALJ, the Tallmans continue to assert the same additional violations that they pressed before the ALJ. Specifically, they allege that the Barnegat defendants violated the IDEA by sabotaging Jason\u2019s chance to enter the Grove School, by instead placing him inappropriately at Wiley House (for fiscal reasons), by failing to provide him with a continuum of placement options,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by failing to consider all Jason\u2019s disabilities, by attempting to exclude the Tallmans from the IEP process, and by refusing to provide Jason with an education in the least restrictive environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The Barnegat defendants mount two lines of defense. First, they argue that, contrary to the findings of the ALJ, they did not commit even \u201ctechnical\u201d IDEA violations. Second, they maintain that even if the technical IDEA violations cited by the ALJ did occur, they \u201cwere no[t] the bad faith type of violation that the IDEA targets.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 25. The Barnegat defendants emphasize that the IEP required by the IDEA constitutes \u201conly a basic floor of opportunity,\u201d which was satisfied by placement at Wiley House. <em>Id. </em>They argue that the IDEA does not require the optimal services or additional benefits, which the Tallmans allege that the Grove School offered. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Christen G. v. Lower Merion School Dist., </em>919 F.Supp. 793, 813 (E.D.Pa.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">We have carefully reviewed all of the alleged violations of the IDEA, both those accepted and those rejected by the ALJ, and we see no ground for reversing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the grant of summary judgment. We begin with the Tallmans\u2019 argument that the failure to adopt an IEP prior to Jason\u2019s placement in Wiley House proximately caused his death. See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 55-56. The Tallmans claim that if an IEP had been developed before Jason was placed at Wiley House his death would have been prevented in two ways: (1) the IEP would have shown that Wiley House was inappropriate for Jason so he would not have been placed there in the first place and (2) if a psychiatrist\u2019s treatment plan had been attached to Jason\u2019s IEP, it \u201cwould have recommended against negative means of holding Jason down\u201d because he would \u201crespond to positive reinforcements.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">This argument flies in the face of the settlement into which the Tallmans entered prior to Jason\u2019s placement at Wiley House. The settlement agreement provided for Jason to be placed at Wiley House but also ordered an independent evaluation immediately upon placement. The issue of whether Wiley House was an appropriate placement was held in abeyance pending the completion of the independent evaluation. <em>See </em>App. at 731; Appellants\u2019 Br. at 17. Having agreed to Jason\u2019s temporary placement at Wiley House, the Tallmans cannot argue that his placement there without an IEP violated the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The Tallmans note that after the settlement was reached and approved by the ALJ, there was a further dispute about certain forms that Wiley House required the Tallmans to sign as a condition of admission. However, none of the disputed issues can possibly be viewed as a proximate cause of Jason\u2019s death shortly after arriving at Wiley House.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Some of the other violations alleged by the Tallmans also center on Jason\u2019s placement at Wiley House, and accordingly the settlement dooms these allegations as well. In addition, these allegations suffer from other flaws. The Tallmans argue strenuously that the Barnegat defendants violated the IDEA because Jason\u2019s placement at Wiley House was inappropriate. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 35-37. The Tallmans recount Mrs. Tallman\u2019s opposition to Jason\u2019s placement at the Archway School because it did not consider Jason\u2019s \u201cgiftedness along with the disabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. The Tallmans also note the observations of a member of the child study team that the Archway students were \u201cstreetwise\u201d and \u201ctough.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Tallmans then argue that the Barnegat defendants nevertheless placed Jason in Whey House, which they claim was similar to Archway. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37. This discussion fails to show that placement at Wiley House violated the IDEA. As noted, in order to comply with the IDEA, a placement need not provide the maximum possible benefit but must provide \u201csignificant learning\u201d and confer \u201cmeaningful benefit.\u201d <em>Ridgewood Board, </em>172 F.3d at 247. The Tallmans\u2019 argument does not show that Wiley House would not have done this.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Moreover, the Tallmans fail to connect the features of Wiley House to which they object with the events leading to Jason\u2019s death. If the curriculum at Wiley House would not have accommodated Jason\u2019s intellectual gifts, that can hardly be viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>as a proximate cause of his death within a short time after arriving at the school. As for the character of the other students at Wiley House, it could be argued that character of the other students at Wiley House precipitated the fight that led to the physical restraint that caused Jason\u2019s death, but the Tallmans have not pointed to evidence in the summary judgment record supporting this chain of inferences. Jason had engaged in violent episodes in other settings, and we have not been shown evidence from which a trier of fact might reasonably infer that he would not have gotten into an altercation with another student if the students at Wiley House had not been \u201cstreetwise\u201d and \u201ctough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The Tallmans complain at length that the Barnegat defendants \u201csabotaged\u201d Jason\u2019s placement at the Grove School by providing the school with records from the Horsham Clinic suggesting that Jason had been involved in starting fires. See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 16-17, 48-53. However, the only provision of law cited by the Tallmans in their discussion of this matter is a New Jersey regulation providing that each district board of education shall develop and adopt written policies and procedures to prevent \u201cneedless <em>public </em>labeling of pupils with educational disabilities.\u201d N.J.A.C. 6:28-1.4(a) (emphasis added) (former codification scheme). Putting aside the question whether a violation of this state regulation may be asserted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we do not see how privately providing records to a school that specializes in the education of students with disabilities can be viewed as a violation of this provision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ observed: \u201cTo claim that the reports of facilities at which [Jason] was treated for . his disability and illness should not be made available to a prospective placement is illogical and inconceivable.\u201d App. at 131. Without supporting authority other than that cited to us by the Tallmans, we must likewise conclude that the disclosure of the Horsham Clinic records did not violate the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The Tallmans have thus failed to show on appeal that the Barnegat defendants acted improperly in connection with the Grove School\u2019s decision to withdraw its offer to enroll Jason, and this failure logically dooms two of the Tallmans other claims, i.e., (1) that the Barnegat defendants violated several New Jersey regulations by placing Jason in a more restrictive school (Wiley House) rather than a less restrictive one (the Grove School) and (2) that the Barnegat defendants favored Wiley House over Grove School for financial reasons. Unless the Barnegat defendants acted improperly in disclosing the Horsham Clinic records to the Grove School, they cannot be faulted for failing to place Jason in a school that refused to accept him.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">With respect to the remaining violations alleged by the Tallmans, the summary judgment record is insufficient to establish that the alleged violations were proximate causes of Jason\u2019s death. Proximate cause is an essential element of a claim seeking to establish liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>445 U.S. 920, 100 S.Ct. 1285, 63 L.Ed.2d 606 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>proximate cause must often be submitted to the trier of fact, summary judgment is proper if the record cannot reasonably support a finding of proximate cause, and in prior \u00a7 1988 cases, we have upheld summary judgment on this basis. <em>See Best v. Essex County, </em>986 F.2d 54 (3d Cir.1993) (no causal link between prison overcrowding and assault of plaintiff-detainee by a fellow detainee); <em>Commonwealth Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Russell, </em>825 F.2d 12 (3d Cir.1987) (applying <em>Martinez </em>and finding insufficient causation between conduct of prison and county officials and the murder committed by a recently escaped inmate).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">With respect to many of the violations asserted by the Tallmans, the lack of proximate cause is glaring. Several of the alleged violations occurred more than a year before Jason was placed at Wiley House, and the Tallmans have not satisfactorily explained how these alleged violations can reasonably be viewed as even but-for causes of Jason\u2019s death. These alleged violations include the following: the failure to develop an IEP prior to Jason\u2019s placement in homebound instruction in March 1992 (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 34-35); the failure to provide a residential placement, rather than homebound instruction, during the 1991-92 school year <em>(id. </em>at 37-40); and the failure of the Barnegat Defendants to take necessary steps to identify Jason\u2019s disabilities before the time when they were finally identified and evaluated in March 1992 <em>(id. </em>at 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Other alleged violations also have no apparent connection to Jason\u2019s death. For example, the Tallmans complain that the Barnegat defendants failed to recognize that Jason had \u201cproblems with written language and medical problems\u201d but that the Barnegat defendants \u201conly addressed his behavior.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 40. Jason\u2019s death, however, resulted from steps taken by a Wiley House employee to deal with a perceived behavioral problem, and thus it is hard to see how the alleged failure of the Barnegat defendants to recognize Jason\u2019s other problems could be even a but-for cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The same is true of the Tallmans\u2019 argument that the Barnegat defendants did not include them as joint and equal participants in the IEP process because the Barnegat defendants did not, among other things, support the Tallmans\u2019 desire that vitamin therapy be included as part of Jason\u2019s IEP. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 41-42. How the inclusion of such therapy might have prevented Jason\u2019s death the Tallmans do not explain. In sum, we hold that none of the violations alleged by the Tallmans provide a basis for recovering damages for Jason\u2019s death or injuries suffered at Wiley House.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We come, finally, to the Tallmans\u2019 argument that the District Court should not have dismissed their second complaint and their new claim against the OAL. The Tallmans argue that the second complaint and the OAL claim challenged \u201cthe OAL and Department of education\u2019s failure to provide [them] with the procedural safeguards required by the IDEA.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 58. However, because we have not relied in any way on any determination made by the ALJ, we cannot see how the Tallmans can possibly have been harmed by any action taken by the ALJ, the OAL, or the DOE in connection with the remand. In any event, we see no merit in the Tallmans arguments regarding this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We have the greatest sympathy for loss that the Tallmans have suffered and can well understand their belief that the educational authorities collectively should have done something to prevent the death of a gifted but troubled 12-year-old boy. However, after carefully considering all of the Tallmans\u2019 arguments, we see no ground for reversing the order of the District Court. If Jason\u2019s death was wrongful, the proper remedy is provided by state tort law, not the IDEA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">For the reasons explained above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment to the Barnegat defendants. As a result, we need not determine whether the third-party defendants are subject to indemnification and contribution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">. An IEP is a detailed instruction plan developed for each child classified as disabled. The basic components of the IEP are mandated by \u00a7 1414(d) of the IDEA.

A federal regulation promulgated under the IDEA requires that the state provide a continuum of placement options for the child. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.551. A corresponding state regulation requires that the child must be placed in the \"least restrictive\u201d environment along this continuum, as befits his or her disability. N.J.A.C. \u00a7 6A:14-l.l(b)2 (formerly at \u00a7 6:28-1.l(b)l).

The Tallmans have not adduced evidence showing that the Barnegats knew that the information in the Horsham Clinic records was incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. Courts have generally found that proximate cause under \u00a7 1983 simply incorporates the causation principles of common-law torts. <em>See Stevenson v. Koskey, </em>877 F.2d 1435 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Parrett v. City of Connersville, </em>737 F.2d 690 (7th Cir.1984); <em>but see Doe v. Rains County Indep. Sch, Dist., </em>66 F.3d 1402 (5th Cir.1995) (adopting \"a heightened standard of proximate cause\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">. Seeking to circumvent the lack of evidence showing that IDEA violations were proximate causes of Jason\u2019s death, the Tallmans argue that they are also seeking damages for intangible injuries stemming directly from those violations. The Tallmans argue that these IDEA violations proximately caused Jason to lose something in addition to his life, namely, \"the loss of a statutory right to a free appropriate public education\u201d while he was still alive. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">However, the alleged violations that are not based on Jason's placement at Wiley House\u2014 for example, the failure to develop an IEP prior to Jason's placement in homebound instruction from March to May 1992 \u2014 are so insubstantial that they are not actionable. <em>See Doe v. Alabama State Dept., of Educ., </em>915 F.2d 651, 662 (11th Cir.1990) (because the IEP-related violations at issue \"had no impact on the [parents\u2019] full and effective participation in the IEP process and because the purpose of the procedural requirement was fully realized, ... there has been no violation in this case which warrants relief\u201d); <em>Tice v.
