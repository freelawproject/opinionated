We issued a certificate of appealability, and have jurisdiction over this appeal. This case was previously before us on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1085, 119 S.Ct. 833, 142 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999), <em>post-conviction relief denied, </em>Civ. A. 99-2878, 1999 WL 717114 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 10, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-23\">Dent contends that the District Court erred in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion without a hearing on his allegations that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>failing to properly advise him about the maximum penalties that could be imposed in the event that he proceeded to trial and was found guilty. More specifically, Dent alleges that his attorney went over the agreement with him and advised him that he would be classified as a career offender due to two previous felony convictions and that he would receive a sentence of 21-27 years whether or not he accepted the plea offer; he claims that this frightened him into not accepting the plea, and that he did not find out that he would not be classified as a career offender until he received the pre-sentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The government notes that the District Court properly accepted as true Dent\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim that he would have accepted the government\u2019s plea offer if counsel had not told him that he was a career offender, and that it then concluded from the record without conducting an evidentiary hearing under <em>United States v. Day, </em>969 F.2d 39 (3d Cir.1992), that trial counsel\u2019s statements did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of Dent\u2019s extensive criminal history involving drug trafficking crimes. The government, citing an apparent acknowledgment by trial counsel, which was not disclosed in the District Court, then notes that the appellant was not fully aware of the details surrounding the appellant\u2019s prior conviction, and acknowledges that Dent \u201chas raised certain factual matters which appear to necessitate an evidentiary hearing.\u201d The government goes on to state that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">agrees that in an abundance of caution, the appellant\u2019s case should be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the sole issue for which a certificate of appealability was granted, that is, \u201cwhether counsel was ineffective in failing to properly advise Dent about the proposed plea agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We agree that this is the proper course to follow. Accordingly the order of the District Court will be vacated and the case remanded for a hearing and factfinding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
