Jones appeals the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment in her civil action against her former employer, Duke Energy Corporation (Duke), in which she alleged that Duke violated the North Carolina Equal Employment Practices Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 143-422.2 (1999) (NCEEPA) by engaging in retaliation, subjecting her to a hostile work environment and general disparate treatment because of her race, and constructively discharging her. She further alleged that Duke violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2002) (ERISA), by failing to furnish her with documents relating to other employees\u2019 monthly contribution amounts under medical insurance plans offered by Duke. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Duke.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The provisions of the NCEEPA do not explicitly provide a private cause of action for violation of the stated public policy, nor have North Carolina courts recognized such a private cause of action arising independently out of the statute. <em>Smith v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>202 F.3d 234, 247 (4th Cir.2000). While Jones recognizes this to be the case, she claims that the narrow exception to the employment-at-will doctrine for wrongful discharge carved out by North Carolina courts demonstrates a shifting of the tide toward private action rights under the statute, and she argues there is no \u201crational distinction\u201d between claims for constructive discharge and wrongful discharge claims. We disagree. As the district court found, North Carolina courts and federal courts applying North Carolina law have made that very distinction, by finding repeatedly that no private cause of action exists for retaliation, hostile work environment, disparate treatment, or constructive discharge in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We decline to expand the provisions of the NCEEPA, as Jones requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Jones also asserts that the district court erred in finding that Duke did not violate ERISA\u2019s disclosure provisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by refusing to send her a comparison \u201ccost scale\u201d showing the required contribution amounts payable by other individuals for retiree medical coverage. Specifically, Jones requested Duke to produce \u201cscenarios of Retirement Medical Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>monthly premiums\u201d for people eligible in all groups. We find the district court properly rejected Jones\u2019 ERISA claim based upon the undisputed fact that no integrated \u201ccost scale\u201d or \u201ccomparison chart\u201d showing monthly contribution amounts for all groups of participants by age and eligible service at retirement ever existed during the time period at issue. Duke cannot be in violation of \u00a7 1024(b)(4), for its failure to disclose a document it did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Accordingly, we find that summary judgment was proper. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\">. <em>See, e.g., Smith, 202 </em>F.3d at 247 (no cause of action for sexual harassment under the NCEEPA); <em>McFadden v.
