Defendants sought to dismiss Plaintiff Saundra Martin\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that Officer Williamson used excessive force when arresting her for disorderly conduct. For the reasons set forth below, we DISMISS the appeal for- lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">The instant action arises from events that occurred in Silverton, Ohio on the night of March 18, 1999. Defendant Timothy Williamson, a City of Silverton police officer, was on routine patrol when, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>time after 11:00 p.m., he noticed a man sitting for over twenty-five minutes in a green Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the empty parking lot of a closed business. Continuing on his patrol, Officer Williamson decided to run the car\u2019s license plate through his computer and learned that the car was registered to Enrico Martin (Plaintiff Saundra Martin\u2019s son), and that his driving license had been suspended. Just as he returned to the empty parking lot to question Enrico Martin, Officer Williamson saw him leave and travel northbound on Silver-ton Avenue. Officer Williamson followed Enrico Martin, who parked in front of 6947 Silverton Avenue, where he lived with his mother. At that point Officer Williamson activated his rear lights to initiate a traffic stop. Officer Williamson then approached Enrico Martin to ask him about the status of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Upon seeing Officer Williamson talking with her son, Plaintiff appeared on the porch and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on and what\u2019s the problem.\u201d Enrico Martin responded by saying, \u201cMom, just go back in the house, everything is fine.\u201d Plaintiff then shouted, \u201cAre they harassing you again?\u201d According to Officer Williamson, he did not respond to Plaintiff; according to Enrico Martin, Officer Williamson stated, \u201cMa'am this doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d After Officer Williamson warned Enrico Martin not to drive the car until he cleared up his suspension, or else he would have to impound the vehicle, he left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Immediately after Officer Williamson left, Plaintiff called a police supervisor of the Silverton Police Department to complain that Officer Williamson and other police officers in Silverton were continually harassing her son by repeatedly stopping him for questioning without issuing citations. Plaintiff also called the City of Silverton Police Department and requested to speak with Deputy Plummer to complain about the repeated stops of her son and the stop conducted that night. Plaintiff spoke with the dispatcher, telling her that Officer Williamson was harassing her son because he refused to sell his vintage car to the officer and that she wanted to report the officer to the Hamilton County Sheriffs Department for harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Thereafter, Officer Williamson was called by the dispatcher, Claire Gibson, and returned to the police station. At the station, Officer Williamson was informed by Gibson that Plaintiff had called to complain about his traffic stop of Plaintiffs son. Officer Williamson then decided to return to Plaintiffs house presumably to explain to her why he stopped her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">In the meantime, Plaintiff, after concluding the phone conversation with the police department dispatcher, went outside and sat in her car to await the return of her son, who had left with an acquaintance. Plaintiff then observed a police cruiser passing by her house with a bright spotlight shining on her house, as well as on her neighbors\u2019 houses. According to Officer Williamson, he shined a spotlight on the houses so that he could locate Plaintiffs house. Plaintiff stated that after the police cruiser passed by a second time, Officer Williamson stopped and approached her, shining a flashlight in her eyes. According to Officer Williamson, he heard Plaintiff before he saw her, when she shouted at him, \u2018What the f \u2014 \u25a0 do you want now?\u201d At that point, Officer Williamson saw Plaintiff sitting in her white Nissan, parked in front of her house, with the engine running.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">Plaintiff and Officer Williamson\u2019s gave widely divergent accounts of what happened next. According to Plaintiff, Officer Williamson immediately said, \u2018You are under arrest, [because] you called my boss and tried to get me in trouble.\u201d In response, Plaintiff stated that \u201cI am not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>doing anything [illegal] by sitting here with my car running.\u201d According to Plaintiff, the officer then replied by saying that \u201cyou don\u2019t call my boss reporting on me\u201d and that \u201cI tried to do your son a favor and give him a break, now you\u2019re trying to cause trouble. Get out of the car, you are under arrest.\u201d According to Plaintiff, she did not yell or curse at the officer. When she attempted to use her cell phone to call the Hamilton County Sheriffs Department to report Officer Williamson for harassment, he told her to \u201cput the damn phone down.\u201d Plaintiff testified that Officer Williamson was constantly checking to make sure that there were no bystanders present. Plaintiff told the officer that she would not get out of her car because she had not committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">According to Plaintiff, Officer Williamson then reached into the car, attempting to grab the keys to the car. When he saw the headlights of an oncoming car, Officer Williamson left the keys in the ignition. Noticing that her son was a passenger in the oncoming car, Plaintiff felt that it was safe to leave her car. As Enrico Martin approached them, Officer Williamson stated that \u201c[Plaintiff] was under arrest for yelling and cursing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Plaintiff also testified that in the course of the ensuing altercation, Officer Williamson called for assistance. When Officer Jeff Hagy of the Deer Park Police Department arrived on the scene, he approached and pulled his gun on Plaintiffs son. At that point, Plaintiff, begging her son not to move, received permission from Officer Williamson to hand her purse and cell phone to her son, which allowed the officer to handcuff her. Upon being handcuffed by Officer Williamson, Plaintiff remarked that \u201cwhat you are doing is wrong, you are totally wrong.\u201d According to Plaintiff, Officer Williamson, after shoving her against the car, grabbed both of her handcuffed arms and then slammed her against the car, telling her that \u201cI am arresting you for resisting.\u201d When Plaintiff then asked the officer \u201cwhy he did that,\u201d Officer Williamson took one step back and sprayed her in the face with mace. According to Plaintiff, Officer Williamson then said, \u201cHow do you like that you black bitch?\u201d Afterwards, Officer Williamson told Plaintiffs son \u201cthat he was sorry he had to do that, however, she was trying to cause trouble for him with his boss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Officer Williamson gave a much different version of the altercation. According to the officer, when he got out of his car, he tried to explain to Plaintiff that he had simply given her son a warning and had not issued a citation. Plaintiff responded by telling the officer to \u201c[g]et that damn light out of my face.\u201d According to Williamson, Plaintiff proceeded to become \u201ctotally belligerent, gesturing, yelling at the top of her lungs, you guys are always harassing my f-ing son.\u201d At that point, Williamson noticed that people in the neighborhood were beginning to come out onto their front porches. Although Williamson tried to explain to Plaintiff why he had stopped her son, Plaintiff constantly interrupted him. After Williamson warned Plaintiff that if she did not quiet down, he would arrest her for disorderly conduct, Plaintiff remained \u201cvery loud, very rude and very turbulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Williamson stated that at this point, Plaintiffs son returned home. When Williamson saw Enrico Martin get out of the vehicle and head toward the white Nissan, which still had its engine running, he called for police back-up assistance. According to Williamson, Plaintiff continued to be loud, belligerent and profane. Plaintiff then refused Williamson\u2019s repeated requests that she turn off her engine and get out of her car. In response, Plaintiff shouted, \u2018You can\u2019t arrest me. You ain\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>got a reason to arrest me.\u201d Plaintiff also refused to comply with Williamson\u2019s request that she quiet down. Given Plaintiffs repeated refusals to comply with his requests, Williamson reached into her vehicle, turned off her engine and took her keys, placing them on top of the car. It was only after Enrico Martin approached that Plaintiff got out of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">At about the same time, Officer Hagy arrived on the scene as back-up. According to Hagy, Williamson and Plaintiff, who was \u201cgesticulating in an angry manner,\u201d were involved in an altercation. According to Williamson, he repeatedly told Plaintiff to put her hands behind her back and advised her that she was under arrest for disorderly conduct. Plaintiff responded by continually saying that \u201cYou ain\u2019t arresting me. You can\u2019t arrest me.\u201d When Plaintiff refused to submit to being arrested, Williamson \u201cgrabbed her wrists to turn her around, and she would not \u2014 and she started to fight me off.\u201d At that point, according to Hagy, \u201cMiss Martin did put both of her hands on Officer Williamson\u2019s chest and push him away as she\u2019s saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not arresting me.\u2019 \u201d Hagy further testified that Williamson responded with force when Plaintiff pushed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">During this altercation, Williamson claimed that Plaintiff tried to swing at him with her purse. When that happened, Williamson took about two steps back from Plaintiff, pulled out his mace and \u201cgave her one short burst to the face.\u201d As Plaintiff\u2019s arms dropped to her side, Williamson clapped the handcuffs on her and walked her to his police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Plaintiff was then transported to the police station, charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, and placed in a holding cell. Plaintiff was eventually transported to a hospital in Kenwood, Ohio for medical attention to her eyes, where she was treated and released. Subse-</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">quently, Plaintiff was convicted of disorderly conduct following a criminal trial on October 1, 1999 in the Hamilton County Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Plaintiff filed suit in federal district court on April 11, 2000 against the City of Silverton, Silverton Police Officer Timothy Williamson, the City of Deer Park and Deer Park Police Officer Jeff Hagy claiming excessive force, inadequate training and supervision, and deprivation of her rights and privileges under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as state law claims for abuse of process. On March 29, 2001, Defendants City of Deer Park and Officer Hagy moved for summary judgment on all allegations presented in Plaintiffs complaint. Defendants City of Silverton and Officer Williamson also moved for the same on April 2, 2001, alleging qualified immunity. Plaintiff filed her response to both motions for summary judgment on May 14, 2001. On June 5, 2001 and June 14, 2001, Defendants City of Deer Park and Officer Hagy and Defendants City of Silverton and Officer Williamson filed their respective reply memorandums. Thereafter, on July 24, 2001 and August 3, 2001, Defendants City of Deer Park and Officer Hagy and Defendants City of Silverton and Officer. Williamson, respectively, filed their notice of supplemental authority in support of their motions for summary judgment, citing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">On August 15, 2001, the district court granted Defendants City of Deer Park and Officer Hagy\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but denied Defendants City of Silverton and Officer Williamson\u2019s motion for the same, finding that Officer Williamson was not entitled to the defense of qualified immunity on Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>claim that he used excessive force when arresting her. Defendants City of Silver-ton and Officer Williamson filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">As a preliminary matter, we must address whether this Court has jurisdiction over the present appeal. Generally, a district court\u2019s denial of a claim of summary judgment is not considered to be an appealable final decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Phelps v. Coy, </em>286 F.3d 295, 298 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 309, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)). However, a denial of a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity may be deemed \u201ca final appealable order\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 if the appeal presents \u201ca neat abstract issue of law\u201d rather than a question of whether the record demonstrates a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson, </em>515 U.S. at 317, 319-20). In this case, it does not appear that we have jurisdiction over this appeal because it does not present a \u201cneat abstract [issue] of law,\u201d but rather a question of whether the record demonstrates a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Accordingly, we dismiss the instant appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
