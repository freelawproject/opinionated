Arora appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for the district court judge to recuse himself and authorizing the Government to dispose of Arora\u2019s files. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant Arora\u2019s motion to file a corrected brief, deny his motion for summary judgment, and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Arora, </em>Nos. CR-98-72-1; CA-01-305-7 (W.D.Va. Oct. 11, 2001). We deny Arora\u2019s motion for reimbursement of the filing fee. Arora <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>also filed two motions for relief, alleging violations of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. We deny these motions without prejudice to his right to file for such relief in his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West 2001) action pending in the district court. We also deny Arora\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
