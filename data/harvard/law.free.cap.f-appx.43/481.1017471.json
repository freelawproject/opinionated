The record is extensive, but the parties are fully familiar with it and with the various legal contentions advanced on appeal, hence we limit our discussion to our ratio decidendi.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">It is not disputed that Bordeaux suffers from a number of ailments including diabetes, osteoarthritis, discogenic disease, and depression. However, the ALJ found that, notwithstanding diabetes and musculoskeletal impairments, Bordeaux was capable of performing a limited range of unskilled sedentary work in jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. The ALJ also found that Bordeaux\u2019s depression was not severe because it did not significantly limit her capacity to perform basic work activities, and because it did not satisfy the durational requirement of the Act. We agree with the District Court that these determinations are supported by substantial evidence. Bordeaux\u2019s diabetes is controlled with medication. Her musculoskeletal impairments are not marked in their effect, and the reports of the mental health professionals were consistent with a mental and emotional state that would permit her to relate to others and perform work in the national economy. Bordeaux\u2019s depression does not meet or equal the requirements of Section 12.04 of the Listing of Impairments because her depression was not severe, and she did not meet the 12 month durational requirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also does not appear that Bordeaux\u2019s condition interfered with her ability to engage in the activities of daily living.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Bordeaux strongly presses the alleged flaws in the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the functional capacity assessment of her long-time treating physician Dr. Edward James, which, if credited, would have rendered her disabled. We have read Dr. James\u2019 many reports and agree with the ALJ and the District Court that this one assessment is totally inconsistent with his observations in his many other visits, and his clinical findings. Accordingly, the ALJ was entitled to reject Dr. James\u2019 assessment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">Finally, we conclude that the vocational expert\u2019s opinion was a proper basis for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as to the type of work that plaintiff could perform. Bordeaux remonstrates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">Whether or not the jobs identified by the vocational expert were the same as the particular jobs in the DOT to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Bordeaux refers in her brief, the ALJ\u2019s determination of her RFC assessment eliminates the jobs that were identified at the time of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We find this position without merit, for the vocational expert identified unskilled, sedentary jobs existing in significant numbers in the national and regional economies which accommodated the specific limitations the ALJ identified, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. It id true that Dr. Solai prescribed medication for \"moderate major depression\u201d but he described this as \"single episode\u201d and did not recommend follow-through.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\">. as the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">Dr. James examined the plaintiff a total of ten times and on each occasion he indicated that she was normal. Record at 222. Furthermore, Dr. James\u2019s clinical findings indicate that the plaintiff had no paravertebral muscle spasm; no muscle atrophy; normal sensation, reflexes, and motor power in all her extremities; normal range of motion throughout her spine; normal gait and station; and a normal straight leg-raising test. Record at 223. Dr. James also stated that the plaintiff's prognosis was good. Her diabetes was controlled with medication and she had no sequelae of the condition.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
