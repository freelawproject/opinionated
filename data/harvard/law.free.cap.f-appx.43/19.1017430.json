No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (Sept. 30, 1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cAs to cases in which a final deportation or exclusion order was filed after October 30, 1996, and which were pending before April 1, 1997, IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rales apply.\u201d). Immigration proceedings were initiated against Uy in November of 1993, well before IIRIRA\u2019s effective date of April 1, 1997. The BIA\u2019s final order of deportation was issued on July 25, 2001, well after October 30,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section 212(c), 212(h), 212(i), 244, or 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act [sections 1182(c), 1182(h), 1182(i), 1254, or 1255 of this title] (as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996]).\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 historical and statutory notes (1999) (square brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u201cHowever, we retain jurisdiction to review whether the BIA applied the correct discretionary waiver standard in the first instance.\u201d <em>Cervantes-Gonzales v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). \u201cWe continue to have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists[.]\u201d <em>Amgorir-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 849 (9th Cir.2000). The court also has jurisdiction over due process challenges. <em>Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">As for suspension of deportation, the only issue is \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d which is a discretionary decision. <em>See Kalaw, </em>133 F.3d at 1152 (\u201cDetermination of ... \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 is clearly a discretionary act.\u201d). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">As for due process, the IJ did not violate due process in limiting Uy\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony, which would have been relevant only to determining whether deportation would cause extreme hardship to Uy (not to her sister). <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (1994) (repealed). As the BIA found, even if the IJ should have allowed Uy\u2019s sister to testify, there was no prejudice because the BIA presumed emotional hardship to Uy and accepted that the two were particularly close. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring a showing of substantial prejudice). The BIA indicated it nevertheless would not have found extreme hardship. Although the BIA incorrectly mentioned that Uy\u2019s sister was not legally in the United States (the sister having adjusted her status after the hearing), this change was never includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ed in the administrative record. We therefore may not properly consider it in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) (\u201cTo the extent our prior decisions may be interpreted as authorizing us to take judicial notice of information not part of the administrative record or nor previously submitted to the Board, they are overruled as inconsistent with the Act and prior precedent.\u201d). Finally, the IJ did not violate due process by \u201cassuming the role of the trial attorney.\u201d <em>See Antonio-Cruz, </em>147 F.3d at 1131 (holding that the Due Process Clause does not preclude an Immigration Judge from engaging in vigorous questioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b48-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
