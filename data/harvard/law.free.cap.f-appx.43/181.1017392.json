R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Donaciano Hernandez-Escarsega, a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega is incarcerated on several charges related to his involvement in a marijuana distribution scheme as explained in <em>United States v. Hernandez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d 1560, 1563 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1003, 110 S.Ct. 3237, 111 L.Ed.2d 748 (1990). Of particular relevance to this appeal, the United State District Court for the Southern District of California sentenced Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega to thirty-five years<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imprisonment for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">On direct appeal, Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega challenged the district court\u2019s jury instruction on the continuing criminal enterprise count. <em>Hernandez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d at 1572. He argued the district court \u201ccompromised his constitutional right to a unanimous verdict by failing to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on what three acts satisfied section 848\u2019s continuing series requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In considering the appeal, the Ninth Circuit did not reach the issue of whether there was instructional error, because \u201cthe facts support the conclusion that the jury unanimously agreed on three predicate offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the continuing criminal enterprise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1573. Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega appealed to the Supreme Court but was denied a writ of certiorari. <em>HernaNdez-Escarsega v. United States, </em>497 U.S. 1003, 110 S.Ct. 3237, 111 L.Ed.2d 748 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega began his attempts for habeas relief approximately seven years after his conviction and sentence were final. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California dismissed his first habeas petition, brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because it was not filed within the one-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). This petition did not assert any claim involving the continuing criminal enterprise jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Over a year later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999). <em>Richardson </em>held \u201ca jury in a federal criminal case brought under \u00a7 848 must unanimously agree not only that the defendant committed some \u2018continuing series of violations\u2019 but also that the defendant committed each of the individual \u2018violations\u2019 necessary to make up that \u2018continuing series.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815, 119 S.Ct. 1707.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega then sought permission to file a second \u00a7 2255 petition based on the <em>Richardson </em>decision. The Ninth Circuit denied the request holding he had not made a prima facie showing of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the defendant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega then filed the \u00a7 2241 petition that is the subject of this appeal, again challenging the continuing criminal enterprise jury instruction. The United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, dismissed the petition. The district court first found Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241 because he \u201cha[d] not presented evidence of actual innocence but [was] really arguing legal innocence.\u201d In the alternative, the court held the \u00a7 2241 claim should be dismissed on the merits because \u201cthe appellate court on direct appeal found that any error committed by the trial court was harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of [Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega\u2019s] habeas corpus petition de novo.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). We agree Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241. Typically, \u201c[a] petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity.\u201d <em>Haugh v. Booker, </em>210 F.3d 1147, 1149 (10th Cir.2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast, \u201c[a] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition attacks the legality of detention.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By arguing the trial court gave an incorrect jury instruction, Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega is challenging the validity of his sentence. Section 2241 \u201cis not an additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega can only challenge the validity of his sentence with a \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>petition if he shows \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega argues \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective because \u201c(1) <em>Richardson </em>was decided after his first \u00a7 2255 Motion; (2)[he] was denied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 certification to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 Motion; [and] (3)[he] is entitled to judicial review of his <em>Richardson </em>claim.\u201d We have held \u201c[failure to obtain relief under [\u00a7 ] 2255 does not establish that the remedy so provided is either inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. Furthermore, \u201cthe mere fact [Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega] is precluded from filing a second \u00a7 2255 petition does not establish that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir.1999). Mr. Hernandez-Ecarsega argues <em>Caravalho </em>is not applicable because there the court was not faced with an intervening change in the law. However, we have applied <em>Caravalho </em>in a similar instance when a prisoner was seeking \u00a7 2241 relief due to the intervening <em>Richardson </em>decision. <em>Myers v. Booker, </em>No. 00-3232, 2000 WL 1595967 (10th Cir. Oct.26, 2000) (unpublished decision).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For us to consider Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, he must show something more than the fact he was not permitted to file a successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega argues he should be able to present his \u00a7 2241 claim because he is \u201clegally and factually innocent.\u201d Other circuits allow \u201ca federal prisoner who is \u2018actually innocent\u2019 of the crime of conviction, but who never has had \u2018an unobstructed procedural shot\u2019 at presenting a claim of innocence, may resort to \u00a7 2241 if the possibility of relief under \u00a7 2255 is foreclosed.\u201d <em>Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2000) (describing construction of federal habeas statutes in other jurisdictions). We have not adopted such a construction of the habeas statues, and do not need to decide whether to embrace that construction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Assuming, without deciding, actual innocence would merit our consideration of his \u00a7 2241 petition, Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega has not made the requisite showing. In order to invoke the actual innocence exception, other circuits require the petition to show factual innocence rather than legal innocence. <em>See, e.g., Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 379-80 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cTo establish actual innocence, petitioner must demonstrate that, in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[T]he core idea is that the petitioner may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903. Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega argues he is innocent \u201cbecause he was not convicted of the three (3) predicate offenses required to render a guilty verdict on [the continuing criminal enterprise count].\u201d This is an argument for legal innocence rather than factual innocence. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir.) (holding petitioner\u2019s argument he was \u201c \u2018actually innocent\u2019 under <em>Richardson </em>because the jurors were never instructed that they had to unanimously convict him on each of the specific violations that made up the alleged continuing series of violations\u201d did not amount to a claim of actual innocence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 476, 151 L.Ed.2d 390 (2001). Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>quently, Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega has filed a motion to amend his prayer for relief. Because we conclude Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega is not entitled to any relief, this motion is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Lastly, we consider Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis. To proceed in forma pauperis, he \u201cmust show a financial inability to pay the required filing fees and the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991). Because Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega\u2019s petition presents only frivolous legal arguments in support of his assertions, we deny his request to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">For these reasons we AFFIRM the district court opinion dismissing Mr. Escarsega\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and deny his motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-18\">. The district court originally sentenced Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega to forty years on the continuing criminal enterprise charge, <em>Hernandez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d at 1563, but later reduced the sentence to thirty-five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. We would not have jurisdiction over a \u00a7 2255 petition filed by Mr. Hernandez-Escarsega as \u00a7 2255 must be filed in \"the district that imposed the sentence.\u201d <em>Haugh, </em>210 F.3d at 1149. We do however, have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition properly \"filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">. We recognize <em>Myers </em>is not binding precedent under Tenth Circuit Rule 36.3. Nevertheless, it shows the consistency of our decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
