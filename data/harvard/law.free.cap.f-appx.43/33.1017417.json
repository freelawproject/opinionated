We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">Wieck did not object prior to sentencing to the trial judge\u2019s alleged failure to adequately inquire into the allegations that Wieck\u2019s trial counsel had a potential conflict of interest. Therefore, we review this matter for plain error. <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-22\">Wieck argues that the trial court was required to initiate an inquiry once it knew that a potential conflict existed. A review of the record illustrates that the trial judge did make an inquiry into the alleged conflict and Wieck\u2019s new counsel wanted to proceed with sentencing. He made no objections based on the alleged conflict. If Wieck thought his counsel did not adequately represent him during the sentencing phase, he should have complained to the trial court but failed to do so. In absence of such a complaint and in light of the adequate inquiry made by the trial court, this Court cannot say that it was plain error for the trial court to proceed with sentencing nor that the trial court had a sua sponte duty for further inquiry into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b61-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
