Following the barring of the justification defense, Paige entered a guilty plea but reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling on the defense. Paige contends on appeal that the District Court erred in ruling that his offer of proof on the affirmative justification defense was insufficient as a matter of law. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-21\">Paige was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His response to the indictment was that he was legally justified in possessing the firearm because of a threat of danger to his person. In <em>United States v. Paolello, </em>951 F.2d 537 (3d Cir.1991), we adopted a four prong test to consider the adequacy of a justification defense. Following the <em>Paolello </em>test, the District Court case required Paige in advance of trial to submit evidence to support his justification claim. The District Court found that the proffered facts failed to support a justification defense and granted the government\u2019s motion to bar the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">We conclude that Paige did fail to meet the second and third elements of the <em>Paolello </em>test. He did not demonstrate that he had not recklessly placed himself in the situation which led to the criminal act, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>second <em>Paolello </em>element. In addition, he did not show that he had no reasonable legal alternative both to the criminal act and to the situation which caused the threat of harm, the third <em>Paolello </em>element.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The District Court found that Paige fell \u201cfar short\u201d of proving these elements that at a minimum he acted recklessly and that this created the situation which led him to acquire the firearm rather than to choose from a number of alternative courses of action. The District Court did not err as a matter of law in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
