In addition, Mr. Manis filed, again pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, a \u201cPetition for Habeas 2241 Relief,\u201d which asserted various due process violations. In particular, Mr. Manis sought \u201can order directing [Oklahoma] to correct their jury selection process, and records, and produce evidence that state withheld from defense counsel,\u201d and he made vague allegations that his prison sentence was being improperly administered. (R.O.A. Vol.I, Doc. 1.) In this same petition Mr. Manis also suggested that prison officials had denied him access to legal materials <em>(id.); </em>in related documents Mr. Manis complained about small prison cells, a lack of air conditioning, and a \u201creduction of medical, law library, and housing health hazards\u201d at the Mack Alford Correctional Center, where his is imprisoned. <em>(Id., </em>Doc. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The district court liberally construed Mr. Manis\u2019s pro se filings, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), though it struggled with the tremendous lack of clarity in Mr. Manis\u2019s pleadings, as well as Mr. Manis\u2019s failure to present documents supporting his arguments. Ultimately, the court concluded that Mr. Manis should have presented his claims through either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and denied Mr. Manis relief. (February 7, 2002 Order at 2-3.) The court also declined to grant a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 866-67 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">On appeal, Mr. Manis renews his request for a COA and, in cursory fashion, alleges that \u201c[\u00a7 ] 2254 form is in adequate. [Section] 2241 must be used.\u201d (Aplt. Br. at 15.) Having carefully reviewed the record on appeal and Mr. Manis\u2019s pleadings, we agree substantially with the reasoning of the district court. Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Manis\u2019s renewed application for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AI1\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
