We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Intercontinental Travel Mktg., Inc., v. F.D.I.C., </em>45 F.3d 1278, 1282 (9th Cir.1994), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The district court properly concluded that Grace lacked standing to request the award of medals because Grace did not show he would inherit those medals or that his family\u2019s honor was damaged by the lack of medals. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-63, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Grace\u2019s claim to recover his father\u2019s lost service records because there is evidence that the relevant agencies conducted searches that were reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. <em>See Zemansky v. United States E.P.A., </em>767 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Grace\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b104-28\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
