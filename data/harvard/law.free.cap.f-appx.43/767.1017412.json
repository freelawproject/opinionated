This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">In 1997, Thrower pleaded no contest to housing code violations. He was required to pay a fine and repair his property. He was not incarcerated. Thrower appealed the conviction and sought review by the Housing Appeals Board. He was denied relief at all levels. Thrower filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in October, 2001, naming the City of Akron, Ohio, and the Akron Health Department as respondents. He claimed that, as a result of his no contest plea, he is subject to future fines and inspection fees of a draconian nature. The district court summarily dismissed the petition under Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, holding that Thrower had not satisfied the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of a habeas petition. The court also denied Thrower\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">In his timely appeal, Thrower argues that: (1) the district court should have granted a certificate of appealability; (2) thq district court erred by dismissing the petition before it was served; and (3) the district court should have construed the petition as requesting a writ of error co-ram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in habeas corpus actions and reviews its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lucas v. O'Dea, </em>179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Upon review, we affirm the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court. An applicant for habeas corpus relief must be \u201cin custody\u201d when the \u00a7 2254 petition is filed in order to vest the district court with jurisdiction over his petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 43-44, 115 S.Ct. 1948, 132 L.Ed.2d 36 (1995); <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-92, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). A monetary fine is not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement. <em>See Lillios v. New Hampshire, </em>788 F.2d 60, 61 (1st Cir.1986). Nor does potential future incarceration for failure to pay such a fine provide the requisite subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Dremann v. Francis, </em>828 F.2d 6, 7 (9th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court properly held that it lacked jurisdiction over Thrower\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Thrower\u2019s arguments on appeal are without merit. First, the issue of a certificate of appealability is moot because we are deciding the appeal on the merits. Second, the district court properly denied the petition before it was served because \u201cit plainly appears from the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases. Finally, the district court did not err by failing to construe Thrower\u2019s petition as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis because Thrower did not claim an error of fact that would have altered the outcome of his prosecution for housing code violations. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>237 F.3d 751, 755 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
