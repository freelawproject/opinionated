Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On appeal, King contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the pretrial and in-court identifications of John and Sun Jung. A district court\u2019s decision to admit eyewitness testimony, as any evidentiary ruling, is entitled to substantial deference and may only be reversed if the court clearly abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1168 (4th Cir.1995). Because we find the identification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive, <em>see Holdren v. Legursky, </em>16 F.3d 57, 61 (4th Cir.1994), and the Jungs\u2019 identifications were rehable under the totality of the circumstances, <em>see Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), we find the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the contested testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">King next contends the district court gave the jury a coercive <em>Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), charge. Because King failed to object at trial, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Finahy, King challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him, alleging that without the Jungs\u2019 identification testimony, no reasonable jury could find the Government sustained its burden of proof. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find a reasonable trier of fact could have found the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Accordingly, we affirm King\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
