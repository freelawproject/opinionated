Duggan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b789-9\">KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The defendant-appellant Francisco Moreno (\u201cMoreno\u201d or \u201cthe defendant\u201d), a Mexican citizen, has contested his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) imposed pursuant to his conditional plea of guilty to possessing approximately fifteen kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute, arguing that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the narcotics evidence against him, all of which had been seized from inside his vehicle following a traffic stop. The defendant has contended that the arresting officer had illegally stopped his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">On the afternoon of March 9, 2000, Memphis Police Detective Brady Valentine (\u2018Valentine\u201d) was operating a stationary radar device from inside his patrol car while it was parked on the median strip of Interstate Highway 240 within the Memphis, Tennessee municipal boundaries. Around 12:30 p.m., Valentine observed a maroon Chrysler Town and Country minivan which had \u201cdarkened\u201d or \u201ctinted\u201d side windows. Both a Tennessee statute (Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 55-9-107) and a Memphis ordinance (Section 21-338) criminalized the operation of some motor carriages having colorized or \u201ctinted\u201d windows. However, as developed below, the two enactments have dissimilar elements. Valentine stopped the Chrysler minivan to enable his further investigation of a suspected \u201cwindow tint\u201d violation. A video camera mounted inside Valentine\u2019s squad cruiser recorded the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">The officer observed North Carolina license plates affixed to the target vehicle, and two persons seated therein, as he approached its passenger side. The passenger (and van\u2019s owner), defendant Moreno, lowered its right front window. Through that portal, Valentine requested the driver\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s permit, and informed both Moreno and the driver Paul Ramirez (\u201cRamirez\u201d) that he had stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>their motorcar because he suspected that its darkened side windows violated Tennessee standards. However, at that juncture, the constable\u2019s focus shifted immediately from the investigation of a possible window tint infraction to suspected narcotics trafficking, because he instantly detected a pungent familiar \u201cacidic\u201d scent emanating from inside the van\u2019s passenger compartment which he associated with past cocaine trafficking arrests. Additional \u201cplain view\u201d indicia of probable narcotics transporting, including the presence of four or five odor-masking coconut air fresheners, two vehicle security devices (namely a \u201cclub\u201d steering wheel lock and an after-market alarm), various tools, and the passenger\u2019s evident nervousness, prompted Valentine to request permission to search the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Both occupants verbally authorized a vehicular search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately, the peace officer discovered a clandestine metal compartment welded onto the minivan\u2019s undercarriage. After prying it open with a screwdriver found inside the passenger carriage, Valentine located fifteen one-kilogram bricks of cocaine concealed within. Following the arrests of Moreno and his traveling companion, the detective field-tested the tinting on the minivan\u2019s side windows by using a state-issued \u201ccomparison card.\u201d He concluded that those windows were darker than permitted by Tennessee law.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Following a March 15, 2000 two-count federal indictment which charged the defendant with conspiracy to possess approximately fifteen kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute (count one) and possession of approximately fifteen kilograms cocaine with intent to distribute (count two), Moreno moved to suppress the cocaine evidence seized from the Chrysler minivan, arguing <em>inter alia </em>that the initial traffic stop was illegal because (1) the vehicle\u2019s windows did not offend the Tennessee window tinting statute, and (2) the Memphis window tinting ordinance was either void under the United States Constitution or pre-empted by inconsistent state law. On August 21, 2000, a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation which advised denial of the defense\u2019s suppression motion. Following objections by both the defendant and the government, the district court, on September 28, 2000, rejected the defendant\u2019s objections, sustained the government\u2019s objections, and adopted the Report and Recommendation with the sole exception of a single footnote opposed by the U.S. Attorney which is not germane to the subject appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">On October 5, 2000, Moreno and the United States executed a plea agreement whereby, among other things, the defendant pledged to plead guilty to count two of the indictment, and the prosecution promised to dismiss count one. On October 11, 2000, with the trial court\u2019s approval, the defendant and the government agreed, in writing, to preserve Moreno\u2019s right to challenge the lower court\u2019s adverse resolution of his suppression motion. On February 26, 2001, the trial judge journalized judgment against Moreno on count two, and sentenced him to seventy months in a federal penitentiary, to be followed by three years of supervised release should the government fail to deport him upon the conclusion of his imprisonment. On March 1, 2001, Moreno initiated a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>A trial court\u2019s denial of evidence suppression is fundamentally a legal ruling examined <em>de novo, </em>although affiliated findings of historical fact are reviewed for clear error in the light most favorable to the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>918 F.2d 647, 650 (6th Cir.1990). On review, Moreno has asserted that the district judge should have suppressed the cocaine located inside his vehicle because the predicate traffic stop was allegedly \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which averredly contaminated that evidence as excludable \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v.

Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123-26, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing, <em>inter alia, Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The existence of \u201cprobable cause\u201d or \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d on a particular set of facts poses a <em>de novo </em>legal issue. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 751, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>289 F.3d 392, 396 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Initially, Moreno has contended that Detective Valentine lacked the requisite \u201cprobable cause\u201d or \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to justify the stop of the minivan for <em>any </em>length of time. At the inception of the subject traffic stop, the officer informed Moreno and Ramirez that he suspected that their vehicle\u2019s windows violated the Tennessee state statute controlling window tinting. That enactment posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af4\">It is unlawful for any person to operate, upon a public highway, street or road, any motor vehicle registered in this state, in which any window, which has a visible light transmittance equal to, but not less than, that specified in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 205, has been altered, treated, or replaced by the affixing, application or installation of any material which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">(A) Has a visible light transmittance of less than thirty-five percent (35%); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">(B) With the exception of the manufacturer\u2019s standard installed shade band, reduces the visible light transmittance in the windshield below seventy percent (70%).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 55-9-107(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">The defendant has asserted that the patrolman knew or should have known, prior to his initial contact with the occupants of the Chrysler, that section 55-9-107(a)(l) did not proscribe the operation of Moreno\u2019s minivan in Tennessee irrespective of its darkened windows, allegedly for at least three reasons: (1) the vehicle displayed North Carolina license plates, whereas section 55-9-107(a)(l) reached only motorcars registered in Tennessee; (2) the Tennessee statute averredly implicated only \u201cafter-market\u201d tinting, whereas the van\u2019s windows allegedly lacked any label(s) identifying an \u201cafter-market\u201d tint application;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) the Tennessee law bans the operation of vehicles having side windows darkened to a degree which permits less than 35% of visible light to penetrate into the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment (or, stated differently, which reflects more than 65% of visible light), whereas the minivan\u2019s windows allegedly were obviously not darkened to that comparatively extreme degree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>However, during trial court proceedings, Detective Valentine testified that, as a Memphis police officer, he primarily enforces Memphis city ordinances; and that most Tennessee criminal statutes are identically replicated via parallel Memphis municipal ordinances. Furthermore, he repeatedly testified he had believed that the Tennessee \u201cwindow tint\u201d law was substantively uniform with the parallel Memphis ordinance. The city regulation at issue pronounces:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway, street or road, which has been altered, treated or replaced by the affixation, application or installation of any material which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">(1) Reduces the light transmittance in both front windows below eighteen (18) percent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">(2) Causes the reflectance of any window to be more than thirty-five (35) percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Memphis City Code \u00a7 21-338(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Accordingly, <em>unlike </em>the previously-quoted Tennessee statute, which governs <em>only </em>vehicles registered by that state, the implicated city ordinance applies to <em>all </em>vehicles moving on public thoroughfares within the Memphis municipal borders. Furthermore, whereas the state regulation forbids the <em>\u201ctransmittance </em>\u201d of less than 35% of visible light by vehicle windows, the municipal ordinance prohibits the <em>\u201creflectance\u201d </em>of more than 35% of ambient light by vehicular windows (or, in other words, the <em>transmittance </em>of 65% or less of visible light into the passenger compartment). Thus, the reach of the Memphis ordinance is significantly broader than that of the state statute, in that it (1) embraces vehicles having comparatively lightly-tinted windows (2) irrespective of their state of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Therefore, considering the undisputed proof that the defendant\u2019s van\u2019s side windows were tinted to <em>some </em>optically discernable degree, which Officer Valentine had adjudged to appear violative of a controlling legal standard, he had, at minimum, a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that Moreno\u2019s vehicle may have violated the relatively far-reaching <em>Memphis ordinance </em>when he stopped that automobile for further investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even assuming, without deciding, that, as argued by the defendant, (1) the Memphis ordinance should be construed to banish from that city\u2019s roadways only vehicles having \u201cafter-market\u201d window tinting, and (2) the subject vehicle\u2019s windows lacked \u201caftermarket\u201d stickers, Detective Valentine was nonetheless justified in pursuing an <em>investigation </em>of a possible transgression of the Memphis window tint ordinance, because, for any of numerous possible reasons or causes, \u201cafter-market\u201d window decals may have been subsequently removed, or never initially attached, following post-manufacture tinting.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">At bottom, any confusion on Valentine\u2019s part about the origin of the law which he was enforcing \u2014 that is, whether it was a state statute or a municipal ordinance \u2014 is, in the final analysis, immaterial. The ultimate dispositive uncontroverted fact is that he correctly concluded that an extant regulation which he was sworn to enforce within the Memphis municipal limits may have illegalized the movement of the subject minivan on the public byways because of its side window tinting, thus warranting his further, investigation to ascertain whether that vehicle\u2019s windows complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>with or impinged that stricture. Hence, the predicate vehicular stop, and Valentine\u2019s initial verbal interactions with the occupants of the minivan, for that purpose, were \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19. Immediately thereafter, as developed above, the officer perceived plainly evident indicators of possible narcotics trafficking, which legitimated his priority shift from an investigation of a suspected window tint violation to an inquiry into the potential unlawful presence of controlled substances within that vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>195 F.3d 258, 264 (6th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1176, 120 S.Ct. 1207, 145 L.Ed.2d 1110 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Accordingly, Officer Valentine\u2019s stop of the subject motorcar was authorized by his \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that its side windows may have violated the Memphis tint ordinance. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s postulate that the predicate vehicular stop constituted an \u201cunreasonable seizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment, which vitiated the subsequent consent search of that vehicle, was misconceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Additionally, Moreno has contended that the Memphis \u201cwindow tint\u201d ordinance violated the United States Constitution, for two reasons. Primarily, he has alleged that the Memphis enactment contravened Congress\u2019 sole plenary power to regulate interstate commerce. <em>See Dennis v. Higgins, </em>498 U.S. 439, 446, 111 S.Ct. 865, 112 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991). Secondarily, the defendant has posited that the ordinance averredly erected an unreasonable local impediment to the movement of persons between and among the several states. <em>See United States v. Guest, </em>383 U.S. 745, 758-59, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966). Both constitutional arguments were rooted in the peculiar equipment requirements imposed by the ordinance upon passenger vehicles traveling interstate while they are temporarily transient within the jurisdiction of Memphis, Tennessee. Alternatively, Moreno has assailed the subject Memphis ordinance as allegedly void by reason of its incongruence with the more narrowly circumscribed Tennessee \u201cwindow tint\u201d statute. <em>See Southern Railway Co. v. City of Knoxville, </em>223 Tenn. 90, 442 S.W.2d 619, 621 (Tenn.1968); <em>Bernard v. Sharp, </em>481 S.W.2d 782, 783 (Tenn.Ct.App.1972). The defendant has hypothesized that, if the Memphis ordinance is repugnant to either the federal Constitution or Tennessee statutory law, Detective Valentine\u2019s stop of the minivan to enforce, or to investigate a possible transgression of, that null ordinance, should be judicially deemed unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">That ill-formulated argument must be rejected. The peace officer had no objective reason to question the vitality of Memphis City Code \u00a7 21-338(c). Facially, that ordinance was a commonplace automotive equipment safety regulation of the kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>which fits neatly into the traditional \u201cpolice power\u201d of state and local governments to regulate the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the community. <em>See, e.g., Triplett Grille, Inc. v. City of Akron, </em>40 F.3d 129, 134 (6th Cir.1994). A constable of the peace, unschooled in the jurisprudence of constitutional federalism and state law pre-emption, is entitled to presume that a duly adopted city ordinance which he was sworn to enforce comports with the American Constitution and superior state law, absent facial invalidity or a contrary controlling judicial decree. <em>See, e.g., Aronson v. City of Akron, </em>116 F.3d 804, 809 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cLegislative enactments carry a strong presumption of constitutionality.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Painter v. Robertson, </em>185 F.3d 557, 571 n. 21 (6th Cir.1999) (explaining that judges and prosecutors, not policemen, are equipped to address complex questions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Therefore, because Officer Valentine\u2019s invocation\u201d of the Memphis ordinance as authorization for the subject traffic stop was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d that stop is unassailable <em>even if </em>the ordinance is judicially voidable by reason of conflict with the federal Constitution or the law of Tennessee. <em>See Illinois v. Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 349-50, 107 S.Ct. 1160, 94 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987) (remarking, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[u]n-less a statute is clearly unconstitutional, an officer cannot be expected <em>to </em>question the judgment of the legislature that passed the law.\u201d). Consequently, because the ultimate validity or invalidity of Memphis City Code \u00a7 21-338(c) is not material to the cause <em>instanter, </em>this reviewing court has no occasion to resolve that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">This reviewing court has carefully considered the trial court record, the controlling law, and the briefs and arguments of counsel, and has concluded that the defendant\u2019s contentions were each ill-conceived. Accordingly, the faulted traffic stop was justified as incident to Officer Valentine\u2019s good faith enforcement of Memphis City Code \u00a7 21-338(c), and thus did not transgress the Fourth Amendment. Hence, the lower court correctly rejected Moreno\u2019s petition to suppress evidence discovered inside the minivan following that stop. Moreno\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. On review, the defendant has not assailed his and his cohort Ramirez\u2019s voluntary approval of the search, nor has he faulted the conduct of Valentine\u2019s narcotics investigation <em>per se. See generally United. States v. Drayton, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-5\">.

On \"abuse of discretion\u201d review, legal issues are examined <em>de novo, </em>whereas factual findings are tested for clear error. <em>See Romstadt v. Allstate Ins.

Therefore, the defendant\u2019s protests (1) that Valentine did not test the darkness of the windows with his state-issued \"comparison card\u201d until <em>after </em>he had searched the vehicle and arrested its occupants; (2) that the officer may have erroneously concluded that the van windows were tinted to a degree disallowed under <em>state </em>law; (3) that the patrolman\u2019s Tennessee \"comparison card\u201d may have been inaccurate and misleading; and (4) that neither occupant of the automobile was subsequently charged with any \"window tint\u201d infraction, were each immaterial to the action <em>sub judice. </em>Because, for the reasons evolved herein, Valentine\u2019s <em>initial stop </em>of the vehicle, and his affiliated brief questioning of its occupants, were lawful, and because <em>events immediately subsequent </em>to the permissible stop supplied the officer with sufficient reasonable suspicion to shift the object of his investigation to the suspected carriage of illegal contraband, the existence or nonexistence of an <em>actual </em>\"window tint\u201d violation under either state or municipal law was ultimately <em>irrelevant </em>to the prosecution in controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
