Harris was sentenced to sixty-three months in prison and three years of supervised release. We affirm. Harris argues the district court erred when it gave a jury instruction regarding flight. The district court\u2019s decision to give the jury instruction and the content of the instruction are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>971 F.2d 1098, 1107 (4th Cir.1992). Generally, a consciousness of guilt may be deduced from evidence of flight, and a jury\u2019s guilty finding may be supported by consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Obi, </em>239 F.3d 662, 665 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 86, 151 L.Ed.2d 49 (2001). In order for a flight instruction to be appropriate, the evidence must establish all the supporting inferences that link the flight to consciousness of guilt for the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the evidence must establish that the defendant fled or attempted to flee, and the evidence must support \u201cinferences that (1) the defendant\u2019s flight was the product of consciousness of guilt, and (2) his consciousness of guflt was in relation to the crime with which he was ultimately charged and on which the evidence is offered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We have reviewed the evidence in light of these considerations and find no abuse of discretion. We therefore affirm Harris\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
