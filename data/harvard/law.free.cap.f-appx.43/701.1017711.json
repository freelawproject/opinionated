We have reviewed the administrative records and the Board\u2019s decisions and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying these motions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) (2002); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Accordingly, we deny both petitions for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Sadiq v. INS, </em>No. A72-418-396 (B.I.A. May 28, 1998 &amp; Feb. 20, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
