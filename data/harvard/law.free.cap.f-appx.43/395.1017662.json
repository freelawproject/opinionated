Although he has since been released from prison, he wishes to bring a damages action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to obtain redress for various constitutional violations that allegedly tainted that criminal proceeding. Under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), however, he cannot do so unless and until one or more of his underlying convictions have been invalidated. <em>Accord, e.g., Figueroa v. Rivera, </em>147 F.3d 77, 80-81 (1st Cir.1998). Recognizing this fact, Forte has filed a multitude of actions in state and federal court seeking to accomplish that task-all without avail. A recent such effort consisted of a petition for declaratory relief which the state court denied in 2001 on statute-of-limitations grounds. Claiming that he is entitled under <em>Heck </em>to a state-court adjudication of his constitutional claims <em>on the merits </em>(as a foundation for a future \u00a7 1983 action), Forte now seeks a federal court injunction compelling the state court to undertake such review. The district court dismissed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">As we understand his argument, Forte apparently believes that \u00a7 1983 and <em>Heck </em>and the Due Process Clause, in concert, create a federal right to have constitutional challenges to a conviction heard on the merits in state court-a right enforceable by injunctive relief in federal court. That belief would seem clearly misplaced. <em>Cf. Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (rejecting view \u201cthat a \u00a7 1983 action for damages must always and everywhere be available\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we need not decide the point, inasmuch as Forte <em>did </em>obtain substantive review of his claims as part of the collateral proceeding brought under Mass. R.Crim. P. 30. <em>See Forte v. Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 1019, 1020, 711 N.E.2d 880 (1999) (rescript) (so noting).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no conceivable basis for an injunction here designed simply to provide Forte with a second round of such review. His complaint thus fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. We note that there has been no suggestion here of any \"illegal blocking [of] access to state post-conviction remedies.\u201d <em>Hoard v. Reddy, </em>175 F.3d 531, 533 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 970, 120 S.Ct. 411, 145 L.Ed.2d 320 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-21\">. Forte's failure to obtain review by the state's highest court in that regard was due to his own dereliction. <em>See Forte, </em>429 Mass. at 1020, 711 N.E.2d 880 (\"Although he could have applied for further appellate review, he did not do so.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
