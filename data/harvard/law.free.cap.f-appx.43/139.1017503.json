Corrigan appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment for defendants in his civil rights action alleging violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights arising from two relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ed encounters with two San Bernardino County welfare fraud investigators (the \u201cInvestigators\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and, after de novo review, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The district court properly concluded that the Investigators had authority to stop Corrigan for speeding. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16, 830.35, 836 (a welfare fraud investigator is a peace officer authorized to arrest a person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has committed an infraction in the officer\u2019s presence); Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22348(a), 40000.1 (speeding is an infraction). The district court also properly concluded that the Investigators\u2019 request to see Corrigan\u2019s driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, at a second encounter that was initiated by Corrigan, did not' violate his constitutional rights. <em>See Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Corrigan\u2019s contention on appeal that the summary judgment violated his right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment is without merit. <em>See Etalook v. Exxon Pipeline Co., </em>831 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Corrigan\u2019s contention that the magistrate judge and district judge were biased is not supported by the record. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a).'</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The magistrate judge did not err in declining to consider Corrigan\u2019s untimely opposition to summary judgment, which arrived after the magistrate judge issued the Report and Recommendation. ; <em>Cf. Carpenter v. Universal Star Shipping, S.A., </em>924 F.2d 1539, 1547 (9th Cir.1991) (district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider late submission of expert deposition in opposition to summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b167-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
