UNITED STATES of America, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b385-17\">No. 02-8032.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b385-18\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b385-19\">Aug. 6, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b385-20\">Before KELLY, McKAY, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b385-21\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b385-22\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The underlying action from which this appeal stems was filed in state court framed as a quiet title action attacking a lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs\u2019 objections, it was properly removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 because it was against federal officers or agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">After reviewing Plaintiffs\u2019 many pleadings and claims, the trial court properly determined that the case was simply an attempt to challenge the validity of federal tax assessments and resulting liens. The trial court properly concluded that Plaintiffs had not satisfied the necessary prerequisites to qualify for the limited waiver of federal sovereign immunity provided for in tax refund cases by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). The trial court was also correct in concluding that Plaintiffs could not rely on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a) because they failed to allege exhaustion of administrative remedies. Likewise, it properly held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410 does not permit a taxpayer to collaterally attack the merits of a tax assessment. The trial court\u2019s final obviously correct blow to Plaintiffs\u2019 action was its holding that the case should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, bars injunctive relief as to the collection activities of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The claims on appeal are various ways of raising the same claims. Therefore, after full review, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and its denial of a variety of post-judgment motions are correct. Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 Conditional Petition for Declaratory Relief is denied. The trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
