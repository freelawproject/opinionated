Louis Corrigan, Jr. appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the defendants in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that his rights were violated when a Las Vegas police officer and casino security guards took him into custody following a citizen\u2019s arrest for pouring a drink on a casino patron\u2019s head. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Frost v. Agnos, </em>152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-23\">Summary judgment on Corrigan\u2019s First Amendment claims was proper because Corrigan failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his conduct constituted speech protected by the First Amendment. <em>See NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (holding that the Constitution does not protect expressive conduct characterized by violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">Summary judgment on Corrigan\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims was proper because Corrigan failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the citizen\u2019s arrest was made without probable cause, <em>see Marschall v. City of Carson, </em>86 Nev. 107, 464 P.2d 494, 498 (Nev.1970), or whether Officer Jaeger was entitled to qualified immunity, <em>see Hutchinson v. Grant, </em>796 F.2d 288, 290 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Summary judgment on Corrigan\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim was proper be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cause Corrigan failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of the defendants were personally involved in the alleged deprivations. <em>See Jones v. Williams, </em>286 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Corrigan\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s summary judgment violated his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial lacks merit. <em>See Sengupta v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc., </em>804 F.2d 1072, 1077-78 n. 3 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does not pi\u2019eclude summary judgment where there is no genuine issue of material fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The district court properly dismissed Corrigan\u2019s pendent state claims without prejudice. <em>See Jones v. Community Redevelopment Agency of City of Los Angeles, </em>733 F.2d 646, 651 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Jaeger\u2019s claim for attorney fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is denied without prejudice to renewal. <em>See </em>Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Horseshoe Operating Company\u2019s \u201cMotion for Leave to Join in Brief and Arguments Put Forward by Appellee Jaeger in his Answering Brief\u2019 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b97-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
