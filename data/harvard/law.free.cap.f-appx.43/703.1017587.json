In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Gray raises two issues, neither of which were preserved in the district court. Accordingly, they are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>viewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1355 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Gray first suggests that the district court erred in applying a two-point enhancement for possession of a firearm within the scope of the drug distribution scheme. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2000). The uncontradicted evidence, as recounted in the presentence report, clearly indicates that Gray carried a firearm during the course of the distribution scheme. Accordingly, it was not plain error for the district court to assign two points pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Gray next claims that the district court erred in its assignment of a four-point enhancement for Gray\u2019s role as a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Our review of the record supports the court\u2019s finding that there were at least five participants involved in the distribution scheme. Additionally, although the scheme was a loosely organized cooperative venture between several narcotics dealers, it is clear from the record that Gray played a central role in the scheme, with other participants regularly referring customers to Gray. Consequently, it was not plain error for the district court to assign the four-point enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
