We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Sommatino v. United States, </em>255 F.3d 704, 707 (9th Cir.2001), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The district court correctly concluded that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint are insufficient. The complaint does not allege the number of employees employed by the American Diabetes Association and thus does not include all of the factual allegations necessary to establish jurisdiction pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17. However, it is not clear that the court lacks jurisdiction. Therefore, the district court erred by dismissing the complaint without providing Dull with an opportunity to amend. <em>See Jones v. Cmty. Redevelopment Agency, </em>733 F.2d 646, 651 n. 6 (9th Cir.1984); <em>May Dep\u2019t Store v.
