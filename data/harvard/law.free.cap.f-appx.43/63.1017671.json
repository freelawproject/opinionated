We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Begay contends that the district court improperly enhanced his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3 by two levels for restraining his victims during the commission of the offense. According to Begay, the two-level enhancement amounted to impermissible double counting because it was assessed for conduct already accounted for in the district court\u2019s four-level enhancement for the use of force during a sexual assault under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(1). We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>215 F.3d 951, 968 n. 11 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Because restraint of the victim is not an element of the offense of aggravated sexual abuse, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, was not incorporated in the aggravated sexual abuse offense guideline applied here, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2A3.1, and was not otherwise taken into account in calculating Begay\u2019s base offense level, the district court did not err by increasing Begay\u2019s base offense level two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3 comment. 2; <em>United States v. Parker, </em>136 F.3d 653, 654 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
