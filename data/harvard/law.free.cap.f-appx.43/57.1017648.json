We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">We review de novo whether a statute is facially constitutional, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>231 F.3d 508, 513 (9th Cir.2000), and a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996). We review for plain error a defendant\u2019s contention that a district court erred under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) when he did not raise the issue below. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 568 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed a firearm during the commission of a narcotics offense, <em>United States v. Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d 712, 714 (9th Cir.1998), and its determination that a defendant was not a minor or minimal participant, <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1342, 152 L.Ed.2d 245 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-21\">We have already rejected the contention that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is facially unconstitutional. <em>See Buckland, </em>289 F.3d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>We also reject Reid\u2019s contention that his sentence should be vacated under <em>Apprendi </em>because, to calculate it, the district court relied on drug quantities not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. A district court does not err under <em>Apprendi </em>where, as here, it sentences a defendant within the statutory maximum permissible for stacked consecutive sentences. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>291 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Buckland, </em>289 F.3d at 570-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Nor did the district court err by adopting the presentenee report\u2019s recommended base offense level of 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (setting base offense level at 32 for trafficking in 1000 to 3000 kilograms of marijuana). A preponderance of the evidence supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that Reid was involved in joint criminal activity with others whose conduct, i.e., distributing over 1000 kilograms of marijuana, he could reasonably foresee. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a) (holding defendant accountable for all relevant conduct, including \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d); <em>United States v. Gil, </em>58 F.3d 1414, 1424 (9th Cir.1995) (holding district court properly estimated drug quantity based on a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Because a firearm was found in Reid\u2019s possession, to avoid an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), he bore the burden of proving it was clearly improbable that he possessed the weapon in connection with his 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 offense conduct. <em>See United States v. Restrepo, </em>884 F.2d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.1989). After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by finding Reid had not met this burden. <em>See Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d at 715 (holding that, for \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) to apply, defendant need not be carrying firearm upon arrest-rather, the inquiry is whether he possessed it during the course of criminal conduct giving rise to the arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Reid\u2019s contention that he was entitled to application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (\u201cthe safety valve\u201d) fails because the statute under which Reid was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), carries no mandatory minimum sentence, and he was sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines. The safety valve can provide relief only if the statutory minimum sentence exceeds that which would result from application of the Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a) (explaining safety valve\u2019s purpose is to permit sentencing, under specified circumstances, under the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cwithout regard to any statutory minimum sentence.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Brinton, </em>139 F.3d 718, 721 (9th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Finally, because Reid admitted to possessing with the intent to distribute a total of 400 pounds-181.4 kilograms-of marijuana over multiple transactions, the district court did not clearly err by denying Reid a minor-role reduction under \u00a7 U.S.S.G. 3B1.2(b). <em>See Murillo, </em>255 F.3d at 1179 (\u2018Where drugs are present in significant quantities, that in itself is sufficient to deny a sentencing reduction [for minor role].\u201d); <em>United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 727 (9th Cir.2001) (upholding denial of minor-role adjustment based on fact that defendant had supplied kilogram-quantities of cocaine on multiple occasions).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
