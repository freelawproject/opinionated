Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-28\">D\u2019Amario contended that he was falsely arrested in September 1998 on a fugitive from justice warrant and subsequently \u201cfalsely imprisoned\u201d during court-ordered psychiatric evaluations in retaliation for his bringing of the <em>Dufort </em>lawsuit. He claims that both were \u201cproceedings\u201d that \u201cterminated in his favor\u201d and that, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, these claims were not encompassed within the <em>Dufort </em>release, but had been specifically reserved. Even if not barred by the <em>Dufort </em>release, however, these contentions fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>and, thus, dismissal pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The classification of fugitive from justice does not constitute a substantive criminal offense and, thus, D\u2019Amario\u2019s characterization of the resolution of this status as a \u201cproceeding\u201d which was resolved in his favor (because that fugitive warrant was dismissed) is dubious. The fugitive warrant was simply used to secure D\u2019Amario\u2019s attendance at court proceedings intended to determine whether D\u2019Amario had violated the Sellers\u2019 protective order. Rather than \u201cterminate in his favor,\u201d the fugitive warrant was presumably dismissed when he, in fact, appeared. Similarly, that D\u2019Amario was determined to be competent, in terms of both ability to stand trial on, and criminal responsibility for, charges of violating the Sellers\u2019 protective order, is also hardly a termination in his favor. Moreover, the proceedings <em>did not </em>terminate in D\u2019Amario\u2019s favor; he was convicted of violating that protective order and placed on probation. From aught that appears, D\u2019Amario was validly convicted of violating the Sellers\u2019 protective order. He, thus, suffered no injury as a result of a conspiracy to retaliate against him for filing the <em>Dufort </em>lawsuit. <em>See Haddle v. Garrison, </em>525 U.S. 121, 124-25, 119 S.Ct. 489, 142 L.Ed.2d 502 (1998) (plaintiff must allege an injury by defendants in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2)). D\u2019Amario \u201cdoes not state a cause of action by merely adding a subjective assertion that the conduct [which is constitutionally unobjectionable] was improperly motivated.\u201d <em>Lyons v. Sullivan, </em>602 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 876, 100 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed.2d 104 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">D\u2019Amario also alleged that the February 1999 search of his apartment was conducted without probable cause. He argues that this claim is not barred by <em>Heck </em>because he is not challenging his federal felon-in-possession conviction. Assuming, <em>dubitante, </em>that this claim is not barred by <em>Heck, </em>D\u2019Amario nonetheless does not prevail. He raised the issue of probable cause in his criminal appeal. We rejected that claim then, concluding there was probable cause for the warrant, <em>United States v. D\u2019Amario, </em>2 Fed.Appx. 25, 2001 WL 120055 (1st Cir.2001) (unpublished per curiam), and D\u2019Amario may not relitigate it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We have considered the rest of the arguments raised by D\u2019Amario in his appellate brief. They have no merit and do not warrant further mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The motion for recusal is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The renewed motion for counsel is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
