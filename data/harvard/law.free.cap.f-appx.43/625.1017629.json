Cheatham acknowledges he violated the terms of his supervised release but asserts his sixty-month sentence was excessive and plainly unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We review the reasonableness of a revocation sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The recommended guidelines range for Cheatham\u2019s sentence was eight to fourteen months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manuel </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">We find, however, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Cheatham to the statutory maximum sentence of sixty months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). The sentencing ranges contained in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines are \u201cnon-binding, advisory guides to district courts in supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642. Once a district court considers Chapter Seven\u2019s policy statements, the court is free to exercise its discretion to reject the suggested sentence and impose the statutorily authorized sentence it deems appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 642-43. Because the district court considered the relevant factors in sentencing Cheatham, we find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Cheatham\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
