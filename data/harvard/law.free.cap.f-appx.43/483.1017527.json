When a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under \u00a7 404 is synonymous with a claim for benefits under a plan, however, the plaintiff must exhaust remedies available under the plan before bringing a claim in federal court. <em>See Harrow v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 244 (3rd Cir.2002). Plaintiffs in this case, a class of current and former employees of AT&amp;T vested in the company\u2019s pension plan, appeal from an order dismissing their lawsuit against the administrators of AT&amp;T\u2019s pension plan. They claim the District Court erred when it found that their claim under \u00a7 404 was a claim for benefits. For the reasons stated below, we find the District Court correctly found that the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit is a claim for benefits and will affirm its order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims rest on allegations that the plan fiduciaries knowingly miscalculated a type of pension benefit. Plaintiffs claim that the plan fiduciaries knew that defendant AT&amp;T was providing the plan with inaccurate data about the \u201cpension includable differentials\u201d earned by the plaintiffs. Those \u201cpension includable differentials\u201d were used to calculate the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csupplemental monthly pension benefits.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the inaccurate \u201cpension includable differentials\u201d made the plan miscalculate them \u201csupplemental monthly pension benefits.\u201d This knowing miscalculation of benefits, plaintiffs claim, is a breach of the fiduciaries\u2019 duties under \u00a7 404 to administer the plan with care, skill, prudence and diligence. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104. As relief for these alleged violations of \u00a7 404, plaintiffs request an injunction ordering the appointment of a new fiduciary to administer the plan and repayment of any underpaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The District Court dismissed these claims on the basis of collateral estoppel. It found that plaintiffs\u2019 Second Complaint was virtually identical to their First Complaint, which the District Court dismissed because it was a claim for benefits under the plan and because plaintiffs had not exhausted plan remedies. On appeal, plaintiffs contend that their Second Complaint is unlike their First Complaint because it is not a claim for benefits. On that basis they argue that collateral estoppel should not apply and that they should not be required to exhaust plan remedies before bringing suit. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The claims in plaintiffs\u2019 Second Complaint are clearly claims for plan benefits. Their entire lawsuit is based on allegations that the defendants knowingly miscalculated benefits by using inaccurate \u201cpension includable differentials.\u201d To evaluate those allegations, a court would have to determine whether AT&amp;T properly reported \u201cpension includable differentials,\u201d which would require it to interpret and apply the plan itself. Because the resolution of the claim rests on an interpretation of the plan, the plaintiffs have made a claim for benefits and must exhaust the plan remedies before coming to federal court for relief. <em>See Harrow, </em>279 F.3d at 254 (stating that a claim for benefits is one \u201cwhere the resolution of the claim rests upon an interpretation and application of an ERISA-regulated plan, rather than upon an interpretation of ERISA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Plaintiffs counter with several arguments. First, they claim that they are only alleging that the defendants violated \u00a7 404, not the terms of the plan. But, their claims that the defendants violated \u00a7 404 are inextricably linked to an interpretation of the plan <em>Harrow </em>thus requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>us to find that plaintiffs have made a claim for plan benefits. Plaintiffs also contend that their claim cannot be a claim for benefits because they are requesting injunctive as well as monetary relief. But, the relief they seek does not alter the fact that they are seeking benefits under the plan. It is the nature of claim, not the type of relief, that defines a claim for benefits. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Because the plaintiffs\u2019 have brought a claim for benefits, the District Court correctly found that they have to exhaust plan remedies before bringing suit in federal court. The District Court also correctly found that collateral estoppel barred the Second Complaint. As a result, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
