R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Richard Joseph Lucero pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing and transferring a maehinegun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o), reserving his right to appeal on constitutional grounds. He appealed. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Richard Joseph Lucero sold to an undercover agent two rifles that had been converted to fire in semiautomatic and fully automatic mode. Because of this conversion, the rifles are \u201cmachineguns\u201d for purposes of the federal laws prohibiting the possession and transfer of certain firearms. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(28); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b). Lucero was indicted on two counts of possessing and transferring a maehinegun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">Lucero filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the statute as applied violated his Second Amendment rights, and the district court denied this motion. Lucero then entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges, reserving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court sentenced Lucero to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release. Lucero appealed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-18\">Lucero appeals his conviction on the basis that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o), as applied to him, violates his right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment of the Constitution. The Second Amendment states: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. II. We review a constitutional challenge to a statute de novo. <em>Johnston v. Cigna Corp., </em>14 F.3d 486, 489 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-19\">Lucero contends that the Second Amendment confers an individual right on him, as a member of an unorganized militia, to possess a firearm of a type that has a reasonable military use. He relies primarily on <em>United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law that outlawed interstate transport of an unregistered firearm, where the defendant convicted under the statute had not shown that the type of firearm at issue \u201cha[d] some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, an expert testified that maehineguns have reasonable military uses and are in fact used by the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Lucero\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our prior decision in <em>United, States v. Haney, </em>264 F.3d 1161 (10th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2362, 153 L.Ed.2d 183 (2002). In <em>Haney, </em>we rejected a similar challenge to section 922(o). We held that \u201ca federal criminal gun-control law does not violate the Second Amendment unless it impairs the state\u2019s ability to maintain a well-regulated militia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1165; <em>see also United States v. Baer, </em>235 F.3d 561, 564 (10th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cthe circuits have consistently upheld the constitutionality of federal weapons regulations like section 922(g) absent evidence that they in any way affect the maintenance of a well regulated militia\u201d). We further held in <em>Haney:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">As a threshold matter, [a defendant asserting a Second Amendment claim] must show that (1) he is part of a state militia; (2) the militia, and his participation therein, is \u201cwell regulated\u201d by the state; (3) maehineguns are used by that militia; and (4) his possession of the maehinegun was reasonably connected to his militia service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">264 F.3d at 1165. Lucero argues that he is part of an unorganized militia by virtue of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 311, which defines the \u201cmilitia of the United States\u201d as consisting of \u201call able-bodied male[ ]\u201d citizens 17 to 45 years old. We emphasized in <em>Haney, </em>however, that a defendant challenging section 922(o) must show that he is \u201cpart of the Veil regulated\u2019 militia, that is, a \u2018militia actively maintained and trained by the states.\u2019 \u201d 264 F.3d at 1166 (quoting <em>United States v. Wright, </em>117 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.1997)); <em>see also United States v. Oakes, </em>564 F.2d 384, 387 (10th Cir.1977) (\u201cTo apply the amendment so as to guarantee appellant\u2019s right to keep an unregistered firearm which has not been shown to have any connection to the militia, merely because he is technically a member of the Kansas militia, would be unjustifiable in terms of either logic or policy.\u201d). Lucero has made no such showing. Unlike the defendants in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Haney, </em>Lucero has presented evidence that a maehinegun has a reasonable military use. Nonetheless, he falls far short of satisfying <em>Haney </em>\u2019s four requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">We therefore hold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o) is constitutional as applied in this case, and we AFFIRM the appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">We DENY the United States\u2019 motion, filed June 24, 2002, to modify the argument in its answer brief regarding the scope of the Second Amendment. All other motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b329-13\">LUCERO, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">I concur in the result reached by the majority opinion, and would affirm. Even were we to accept the proposition that the defendant has an individual right under the Second Amendment \u201cto keep and bear Arms\u201d in order to serve in \u201c[a] well regulated Militia\u201d subject to call by a \u201cfree State,\u201d I am not persuaded that the semiautomatic and fully automatic \u201cmachine-guns\u201d which defendant sold to federal agents, and which have been outlawed by federal legislation, are the type of arms subject to Second Amendment protection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>For that reason I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">I would grant the government\u2019s motion to modify its answer brief regarding the scope of the Second Amendment and allow the parties to supplementally brief this issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
