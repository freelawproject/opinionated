(\u201cMattel\u201d) and Realtoy International, Limited\u2019s (\u201cRealtoy\u201d) packaging of similar toy car products.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-23\">In 1998, Mattel discovered that Realtoy, a Hong Kong based business, was marketing products with packaging very similar to Hot Wheels packaging. On May 11, 1998, Mattel filed suit in the district court, seeking damages arising out of Realtoy\u2019s sales of the \u201cAction City Parking Garage\u201d and other toys using packaging that infringed upon Mattel\u2019s rights, as well as injunctive relief preventing further acts of infringement. The parties entered into a settlement and the district judge entered the Stipulated Final Judgment on December 16,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-24\">On December 7, 2000, under the first suit\u2019s case number, Mattel filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause why Realtoy should not be held in contempt. In its application, Mattel alleged that Realtoy, \u201cin clear violation of the Judgment, continues to sell toy vehicle products that employ product packaging that is confusingly similar to the HOT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>WHEELS packaging trade dress.\u201d The court held a hearing on February 26, 2001, and denied the application on the ground that Mattel had failed to meet the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Mattel did not appeal the district court\u2019s ruling, but instead filed a new complaint on March 8, 2001, alleging trade dress infringement. The matter was transferred to the same district judge who had presided over the initial suit, entered the Stipulated Judgment, and ruled on the contempt proceeding. Realtoy filed a timely motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The district court granted Realtoy\u2019s motion to dismiss the second suit, stating that contempt was the exclusive remedy to enforce a consent decree, and citing <em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>402 U.S. 673, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971), <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>864 F.2d 434, 439 (7th Cir.1988), and <em>Florida Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Bush, </em>246 F.3d 1296, 1298 (11th Cir.2001). The district court explained that although Mattel\u2019s complaint was not barred by res judicata, it was barred by \u201ccontractual principles\u201d related to the consent decree. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Upon reviewing the Stipulated Judgment in the first lawsuit, we find that Mattel is not precluded from filing a suit for trade dress violations which arose after the initial suit was resolved. This is not a case of res judicata, as the district court correctly noted in its order granting Realtoy\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, because the present lawsuit is based on conduct which occurred after the entry of the prior judgment. <em>See Lawlor v. Nat\u2019l Screen Serv. Corp., </em>349 U.S. 322, 328, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122 (1955). The claims therefore were not \u201cbrought\u201d and did not \u201carise out of the same facts as those\u201d brought in the previous case. <em>Int\u2019l Techs. Consultants, Inc. v. Pilkington PLC, </em>137 F.3d 1382, 1387 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Dismissal was not justified by the language of the Stipulated Judgment. \u201cA consent decree in a private action imposes no more on the party to be bound than that party agreed to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>402 U.S. 673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971)). The Stipulated Judgment provided that the same court \u201cwill retain jurisdiction to the extent necessary to enforce this Judgment and to determine any contempt issues which may arise concerning this Judgment.\u201d There is no explicit covenant not to sue over later conduct, but only an agreement that contempt issues would be determined by the same court. Mattel\u2019s complaint sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief could be granted and the district court erred by granting Realtoy\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b79-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
