Del Real-Ordones seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Defendant\u2019s application for a COA is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Del Real-Ordones was convicted of possession with intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) on December 7, 1998, and sentenced to a prison term of 121 months. He was discovered with the methamphetamine when he was traveling from Los Angeles, California, to Dodge City, Kansas, on an Amtrak train. During the train\u2019s stop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Del Real-Ordones was approached by Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agent Michael Mans, who questioned defendant, searched his baggage after obtaining his consent, and discovered a sizeable quantity of methamphetamine hidden in a laundry detergent box.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Defendant appealed his conviction, alleging insufficient evidence to support a \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d jury instruction. We concluded there was sufficient evidence for the instruction and affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Delreal-Ordones, </em>213 F.3d 1263 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">On October 12, 2000, Del Real-Ordones filed his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court dismissed with prejudice. Defendant seeks a COA to address his claims that (1) DEA agent Mans illegally seized defendant; (2) defendant\u2019s consent to search his baggage was not voluntary because it followed an illegal detention; (3) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress; and (4) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate whether one of the DEA agents had access to defendant\u2019s baggage key and searched the bags when defendant was not present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Because Del Real-Ordones failed to raise the first two issues on direct appeal, he is barred from raising them in this \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless he can establish cause excusing the procedural default and prejudice from the error or that there will be \u201ca fundamental miscarriage of justice if the claim is not considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>88 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996). Although defendant does not allege a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he does claim trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the evidence discovered in defendant\u2019s baggage and for not investigating possible Fourth Amendment violations. Success on defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims could provide cause excusing the procedural default, so we now turn to these claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Del Real-Ordones must show that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and review de novo whether counsel\u2019s performance was legally deficient and whether the deficiencies prejudiced defendant. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 392 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Appellant contends that he was illegally detained by Agent Mans, such that any consent he may have given to Agent Mans to search his baggage was not voluntary. The district court noted that Del RealOrdones testified twice at trial that he consented to the search of his baggage, and defendant concedes in his opening brief that he provided consent. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at xiii.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Finding that defendant consented to Agent Mans\u2019s search of his baggage, the district court concluded that counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress or raise additional Fourth Amendment issues during the trial. However, the district court did not address defendant\u2019s claim that his consent was involuntary because it followed an illegal detention. We therefore remand for consideration of this specific claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not express any opinion on the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Del Real-Ordones\u2019s second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate whether one of the DEA agents had access to defendant\u2019s baggage key and searched the baggage when defendant was not present. <em>(Id. </em>at 13-16.) In order for counsel's failure to investigate to constitute ineffective assistance, Del Real-Ordones must demonstrate prejudice \u2014 that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s [failure to investigate], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. Defendant has not satisfied this burden; he asserts only that had counsel conducted an investigation and discovered that a DEA agent had a key to defendant\u2019s baggage \u201cwithout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>defendant\u2019s knowledge for a significant period of time and that the contents of the luggage had been disturbed, it would raise an issue of a warrantless search without consent.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16.) Defendant does not state how raising the issue-of a warrantless search without consent would have changed the result of the proceeding. Consequently we are left to speculate as to the prejudicial effect of counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate. As a result defendant has not established \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claim[ ] debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We therefore decline to issue a COA on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Because the district court failed to analyze Del Real-Ordones\u2019s allegation that any consent given to Agent Mans to search his baggage was involuntary because it followed an illegal detention, we GRANT his application for a COA on the issue of whether counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress and REMAND for consideration of this claim. Because the disposition of this issue will affect the disposition of Del Real-Ordones\u2019s claims that he was illegally seized and his consent was involuntary because it followed an illegal seizure, we REMAND these two issues for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We DENY defendant\u2019s application for a COA on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on a failure to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-15\">. Del Real-Ordones\u2019s Motion for a COA raises additional issues; he has waived those claims however by failing to raise them in his opening brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), 28(a)(9); <em>see also Pino v. Higgs, </em>75 F.3d 1461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>1463 (10th Cir.1996) (concluding that an issue raised in the preliminary docketing statement, but not argued in the opening brief, is waived). Del Real-Ordones\u2019s pro se Motion for a COA was filed before the opening brief, which was prepared and filed by counsel. Consequently the need to construe his pro se pleadings liberally is not implicated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>-U.S. --, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002), does not dispose of this issue because the trial court\u2019s focus on the existence of consent did not address defendant's claimed involuntariness of such consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
