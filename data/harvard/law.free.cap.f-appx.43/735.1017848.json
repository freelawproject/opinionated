He also moves the court for leave to proceed as a pauper. The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In 1989, a jury found Nelson guilty of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), possession with intent to distribute cocaine in or near schools in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a), and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court sentenced him to a total of 210 months of imprisonment. A panel of this court affirmed Nelson\u2019s convictions and sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>922 F.2d 311 (6th Cir.1990). Research reveals that Nelson has since filed three unsuccessful motions seeking \u00a7 2255 relief and that he has filed at least one unsuccessful motion for authorization to file an additional \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In these timely consolidated appeals, Nelson argues that the district court erred by denying his motions. He also moves the court for leave to proceed as a pauper. The government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over Nelson\u2019s appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and that, in any event, both motions lacked merit. Both parties have filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">As an initial matter, we reject the government\u2019s jurisdictional argument. The government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 3582 motion because Nelson failed to file a timely notice of appeal within ten days of the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. The government concedes that Nelson filed a motion styled as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion, seeking reconsideration of the denial, but it contends that this motion could not serve to toll the time limit for filing a notice of appeal because the motion was based on a <em>civil </em>rule, rather than a <em>criminal </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">The styling of Nelson\u2019s motion as a civil 59(e) motion is simply not determinative. <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 7-8, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">The record reflects that the district court denied Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion in a marginal order entered on March 23, 2001. Ten business days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> later, on April 6, 2001, Nelson moved the court to reconsider the denial through a motion captioned as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. The court denied the motion to reconsider on April 10, 2001, and Nelson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">We have jurisdiction over this matter because the timely filing of Nelson\u2019s motion for reconsideration reset the time for complying with Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). <em>United States v. Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 78, 84 S.Ct. 553, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964). The Supreme Court held in <em>Healy </em>that a rehearing petition, at least when filed within the original period for review, may also extend the time for filing a petition for certiorari. <em>Id. </em>This rule also applies to the time limit for filing appeals in criminal matters. <em>See United States v. Ibarra, </em>502 U.S. 1, 6 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (holding that would-be appellants who file a timely motion for reconsideration are entitled to the full time period for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>noticing the appeal after the motion to reconsider has been decided); <em>Dieter, </em>429 U.S. at 7-9 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3; <em>United States v. Carmouehe, </em>138 F.3d 1014, 1016 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Although we have jurisdiction, we conclude that the district court properly denied Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Review is under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Nelson claimed that he was entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c) modification of his sentence because an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered his sentencing range. Section 3582(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The text of this provision clearly indicates that in order for a district court to invoke \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a sentence, the defendant\u2019s sentencing range must have been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and the contemplated sentence reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">In November 2000, application note one to USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 (Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations) was amended to resolve a circuit split. Amendment 591 makes clear that the enhancement of an offense level under \u00a7 2D1.2 \u201capplies only in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a statutory violation of drug trafficking in a protected location ...\u201d USSG Manual, Supp. To App. C (Nov. 1, 2000) at 30. The relevant policy statement, \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s., includes Amendment 591 among those amendments that the Sentencing Commission has determined should be applied retroactively; nevertheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Nelson\u2019s motion. Nelson was convicted of possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute within 1000 feet of a public school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845a(a) (now codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860). Thus, Amendment 591 is inapposite, whether given retroactive application or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">The district court did not err by denying Nelson\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 12 motion. The motion was untimely, and the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The undisputed facts that form the basis of Nelson\u2019s claim follow: In January 1989, Nelson pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count against him, but he subsequently moved to withdraw the guilty plea. At Nelson\u2019s March 1989 sentencing hearing, the district court denied the motion to withdraw and sentenced Nelson to 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">A few months later \u2014 upon a motion for reconsideration filed by Nelson \u2014 the district court allowed Nelson to withdraw the plea, and the case proceeded to trial. Due to an oversight, the prior judgment was not vacated. Following the jury trial, Nelson received 30 more months of imprisonment than he received in the original proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">Upon learning that the prior judgment had not been vacated, the district court corrected the error pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. This rule provides: \u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court <em>at any time </em>and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Nelson seized upon the district court\u2019s mechanical error as a possible basis for relief. He filed a motion to vacate the second judgment (with the 210-month sentence) pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2), claiming that the district court\u2019s correction of the judgment did not cure the jurisdictional defect that <em>must have </em>infected the second judgment because of the outstanding and uncorrected first judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Motions under Rule 12(b) are pretrial motions, and are generally waived if not raised in a timely manner. Nelson\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment is based in part on the district court\u2019s alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction to enter the second judgment. He relies upon the general rule that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time; however, that rule actually holds that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised \u201cat any time <em>during the pendency of the proceedings.\u201d United States v. Adesida, </em>129 F.3d 846, 850 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (emphasis added)); <em>see also United States v. Giraldo-Prado, </em>150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1998). The mandate was issued in the appeal of Nelson\u2019s ultimate judgment more than ten years ago, thus rendering his criminal conviction final and signaling an end to those proceedings. Therefore, the district court properly denied the motion, as it lacked jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Although confined to the correction of clerical errors, oversights, and omissions, <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>918 F.2d 627, 630 (6th Cir.1990), a judgment may be corrected under Rule 36 at any time. It is clear that the error was due to oversight and was \u201cof the sort that a clerk or amanuensis might commit, mechanical in nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Burd, </em>86 F.3d 285, 288 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation omitted). The district court\u2019s correction of this error provides no viable claim for relief to Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Leave to proceed as a pauper is granted, and we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 45, rather than Fed. R.App. P. 6, governs the computation of time in this context, <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>60 F.3d 1142, 1143 (5th Cir.1995); thus, the intervening Saturdays and Sundays are excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
