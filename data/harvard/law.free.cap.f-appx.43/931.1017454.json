Defendants Carlos Long, Kevin Murrell and Andre Nathaniel appeal their sentences from convictions for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) as violating <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Finding that there was no double counting and that, in light of <em>Harris v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">A grand jury for the Western District of Tennessee returned a four-count indictment against all four of these defendants on June 15, 2000. Count one charged them with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for the attempted robbery of the Bank of Mason in Mason. Tennessee. Count two charged them with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for using and carrying a firearm during the Bank of Mason robbery. In count three they were charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for the robbery of the Bank of Piperton in Piperton, Tennessee. In count four they were charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for their use and carrying of firearms during the Bank of Piperton robbery. Each of the defendants entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to counts one, three, and four, and the Government agreed to dismiss count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">The district court sentenced Long, Murrell, and Nathaniel to sixty-three months for counts one and three to run concurrently. The district court sentenced Lewis to seventy months on each count to run concurrently. Finding that firearms were discharged during the robbery of the Bank of Piperton, the robbery charged in count three, the court sentenced each defendant to a consecutive term of 120 months on count four under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">\n<em>Defendant Lewis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">Lewis argues that the imposition of a six-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) for count one was unconstitutional given the sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) violation charged in count four because the enhancement impermissibly counted the same conduct twice. Lewis also makes a perfunctory, two-sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>claim in his appellate brief that his \u00a7 924(c) sentence should not be consecutive to the sentence on count one, and \u2014 for the first time, and only in his reply brief\u2014 raises an <em>Apprendi </em>objection to the \u00a7 924(c) sentence. Because neither of the latter two objections has been properly raised,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we will address only his objection to the sentence on count one. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law concerning the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>73 F.3d 1414, 1416 (6th Cir.1996). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>237 F.3d 625, 626 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Our recent opinion in <em>United States v. Griffis, </em>282 F.3d 443 (6th Cir.2002), controls this issue and requires us to reject Lewis\u2019s argument. Griffis argued that the consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(c) for conduct occurring during one of his three bank robberies, where the other two sentences for robbery convictions were enhanced pursuant to the Guidelines, constituted double counting. <em>Id. </em>at 446. We ruled, in accord with all other circuits to address the issue, that \u201ca brandishing enhancement and \u00a7 924(c) count are not cumulative punishment when assessed for separate offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447. Following <em>Griffis </em>we conclude that Lewis\u2019s sentence includes no double counting because the six-level enhancement was applied to count one while the \u00a7 924(c) charge was based on the conduct charged in count three. This assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">\n<em>Defendants Nathaniel, Murrell and Long</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">These three defendants raise only an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to their sentences. None of them, however, raised any <em>Apprend\u00ed </em>objection prior to entering a guilty plea. None of them entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving the right to raise on appeal the claim that whether a weapon was discharged during the offense, the fact which would be the basis for an increased mandatory minimum sentence for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense, was not contained in the indictment. Each of them did, however, raise the issue at sentencing. In <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), the Court confirmed that the law remains well-settled that indictments can be amended only on resubmission to a grand jury, and that objections to the indictment must be timely raised in the district court. But the Court has yet to address the appropriate standard of review for an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge that follows a guilty plea where no timely objection was made to the indictment\u2019s failure to include the facts that would increase the penalty beyond the statutory maximum. We need not resolve this question here because the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Harris </em>is dispositive of the claims of all three of these defendants regardless of what standard of review we apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">The defendants, citing to <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348 (6th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Flowal, </em>234 F.3d 932 (6th Cir.2000), argue that since their convictions following their guilty pleas were for violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) which did not specify the particular subsection, they are subject only to the statutory minimum penalty of five years. Because they were sentenced under the subsection of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) that requires a ten-year mandatory minimum, based on the district court\u2019s finding by a prepon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>deranee of the evidence that a firearm was discharged during the robbery, the defendants argue their sentences violate the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>The Supreme Court has now definitively held that \u201c[18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single offense. The statute regards brandishing and discharging as sentencing factors to be found by the judge, not offense elements to be found by the jury.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 122 S.Ct. at 2414. Further, four members of the Court have explicitly said that facts affecting only a statutory minimum \u2014 but not a statutory maximum \u2014 sentence need not be charged in the indictment or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but are facts that may be found by the judge. <em>Id. </em>at 2418-19 (plurality opinion). A fifth justice, while not joining in that plurality opinion, opined that in his view, the Sixth Amendment does not even require the result the Court reached in <em>Apprendi, </em>much less that facts affecting the statutory minimum sentence be included in the indictment and found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 2420-21 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Finally, the majority of the Court reaffirmed <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 </em>U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986) (upholding the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute that mandated a minimum sentence of five years for certain felonies where the judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant visibly possessed a firearm during the crime) and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AId\">employing the approach outlined in <em>[McMillan </em>], ... conclude[d] that the federal provision at issue, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii), is constitutional. Basing a 2-year increase in the defendant\u2019s minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-6\">... We hold only that the Constitution permits the judge to [find the facts giving rise to the minimum sentence].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-7\"><em>Hams, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 122 S.Ct. at 2420.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to a minimum sentence based on the sentencing court\u2019s finding of the facts affecting the statutory minimum will no longer lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. A party\u2019s failure to raise an issue before the district court generally operates to waive that issue, <em>see Taft Broad. Co. v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 240, 244 (6th Cir.1991); and issues raised only in a perfunctory manner are waived, <em>see United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 566 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
