R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Dennis Walkner, a prisoner incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, filed this action against several prison officials seeking compensation for the loss of three paintings, which he valued at $600. According to Mr. Walkner, a corrections officer removed the paintings from his cell during an institution-wide \u201cshake-down\u201d on December 12, 1998. Rec. doc. 1 (Compl. filed Jan. 28, 2000). Prison officials told Mr. Walkner that they would mail the paintings to a person whom he designated. However, that person never received the paintings.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">The district court read Mr. Walkner\u2019s complaint as asserting a cause of action for negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon the Attorney General\u2019s certification that the named individual defendants were acting in the scope of their employment, the district court then substituted the United States as a defendant pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The court then dismissed Mr. Walkner\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court reasoned that, although the FTCA acts as a waiver of sovereign immunity pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the exception to that general waiver set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) was applicable to Mr. Walkner\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">Section 2680(c) excepts from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity <em>\u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of </em>the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or <em>the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by </em>any officer of customs or excise or <em>any other law enforcement officer </em>....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) (empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>sis added). The Supreme Court has construed section 2680(c) broadly. In <em>Kosak v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 852-53, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), the Court rejected the argument that \u00a7 2680(c) exempts from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \u201conly claims [] for damage caused by the detention itself\u2019 and that the FTCA waiver thus does not apply to the negligent destruction of property. Following <em>Kosak, </em>\u201c[t]he courts have interpreted section 2680(c) to bar claims premised on essentially any injury to property sustained during its detention.\u201d <em>United States v. Bein, </em>214 F.3d 408, 415 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In the instant case, the district court reasoned that \u201cprison officials allegedly confiscated paintings from [Mr. Walkner], The confiscation was a detention of goods.... [Mr. Walkner\u2019s] claim for the allegedly lost paintings arises out of the detention of the goods.\u201d Rec. doc. 26, at 3-4 (Order, filed June 26, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis. In order for the exception set forth in \u00a7 2680(c) to apply in these circumstances, the court must find: (1) that the claim arose \u201cin respect of ... the detention of ... goods, merchandise, or other property\u201d and (2) that the detention was by a \u201claw enforcement officer.\u201d Both elements are established here.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">First, Mr. Walkner\u2019s claim arises \u201cin respect of ... the detention of ... properfy,\u201d as that phrase has been construed by the Supreme Court. <em>See Kosak, </em>465 U.S. at 852-53 (construing \u00a7 2680(c) to apply to the negligent destruction of property). Second, the prison officials whom Mr. Walkner alleges to have lost his paintings are \u201claw enforcement officerfs]\u201d under the statute. <em>See Hatten v. White, </em>275 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir.2002) (applying \u00a7 2680(c) to bar a claim against prison officials for mishandling property); <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, Weighing Approximately 154,121 Pounds, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1490-91 (10th Cir.1984) (applying \u00a7 2680(c) to property seized by the Department of Agriculture); <em>see also Halverson v. United States, </em>972 F.2d 654, 656 (5th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (holding that Immigration and Naturalization Service Border Patrol agents were law enforcement officers under \u00a7 2680(c)); <em>Schlaebitz v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>924 F.2d 193, 194-95 (11th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (applying \u00a7 2680(c) to a United States Marshall).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Walkner\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\">. In his complaint, Mr. Walkner invoked not only the FTCA but also the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. However, on appeal, Mr. Walkner has not challenged the district court's treatment of his allegations as a claim for negligence under the FTCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\">. Section 2679(d)(1) provides: \"Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a United States district court shall be deemed an action against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-19\">. Section 1346(b)(1) permits an action \"for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. We agree with the district court that Mr. Walkner\u2019s claim is properly characterized as asserting that prison officials acted negligently in failing to send his paintings to the designated address. Thus, we do not read his allegations as advancing a claim pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), that federal officials deprived him of his property in violation of his due process rights. Such a claim must be based on allegations that prison officials acted intentionally or recklessly in depriving the plaintiff of his property and then failed to provide an adequate post-deprivation remedy. <em>See Sterling v. United States, </em>85 F.3d 1225, 1227-28 (7th Cir.1996) (discussing the differences between FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>claims for the loss or destruction of property); <em>Webber v. Mefford, </em>43 F.3d 1340, 1343 (10th Cir.1994); (stating that \"a government official violates an individual\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights by injuring his or her life, liberty, or property interest with deliberate or reckless intent\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
