Conducting <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm entirely on the basis of <em>Younger </em>abstention. <em>See Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Bd. (In re Mitchell), </em>209 F.3d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Green v. City of Tucson, </em>255 F.3d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>al history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">As a threshold issue, we must consider <em>sua sponte </em>our jurisdiction over Franceschi\u2019s appeal. <em>See Lievsay v. W. Fin. Sav. Bank (In re Lievsay), </em>118 F.3d 661, 662 (9th Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction only if the BAP incorrectly determined that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing Franceschi\u2019s complaint was interlocutory. <em>See id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review <em>de novo </em>the BAP\u2019s decision that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order was not final, <em>Alexander v. Compton (In re Bonham), </em>229 F.3d 750, 761 (9th Cir.2000), and conclude that the decision was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u201c28 U.S.C. section 158(d) affords a more liberal finality standard than does 28 U.S.C. section 1291.\u201d <em>Bonner Mall P\u2019ship v. U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. (In re Bonner Mall P\u2019ship), 2 </em>F.3d 899, 904 (9th Cir.1993). \u201cOrdinarily, a final decision is one that \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Bonham, </em>229 F.3d at 761 (quoting <em>Elliott v. Four Seasons Props. (In re Frontier Props., Inc.), </em>979 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir.1992)). The bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing Franceschi\u2019s complaint was final because it terminated the litigation and left nothing for the court to do but enter judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Dominguez v. Miller (In re Dominguez), </em>51 F.3d 1502, 1506 (9th Cir.1995). Thus, the BAP had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (c), and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Citing <em>Contractors\u2019 State License Bd. of Cal. v. Dunbar (In re Dunbar), </em>245 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir.2001), Franceschi argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s abstention under <em>Younger </em>was improper because abstention is fundamentally incompatible with federal bankruptcy power and would frustrate bankruptcy courts\u2019 jurisdiction to discharge debts. We have two responses to this argument. First, <em>In re Dunbar </em>is immaterial to the instant case because abstention was not involved in that case. Second and more importantly, we have applied <em>Younger </em>abstention in the context of bankruptcy proceedings, thereby rejecting the claim that such abstention is incompatible with federal bankruptcy jurisdiction. <em>See Superior Court v. Heincy (In re Heincy), </em>858 F.2d 548, 549 (9th Cir.1988) (\u2018We recognize that a bankruptcy court has the power to enjoin state criminal proceedings, but <em>Younger v. Harris ... </em>defines the standard for the entry of such an order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\"><em>\u201cYounger </em>applies only when the relief the plaintiff seeks in federal court would \u2018interfere\u2019 with the ongoing state judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Green, </em>255 F.3d at 1098. Franceschi seeks to interfere with the California State Bar\u2019s disciplinary proceedings by requesting (1) a declaration that three of the charges against him violate the bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order, and (2) a permanent injunction enjoining the prosecution of those three charges in the State Bar Court. <em>See id. </em>at 1094-98; <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 431-32, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Thus, we must determine whether <em>Younger </em>abstention was required because the state disciplinary proceedings (1) were ongoing and judicial in nature, (2) implicate important state interests, and (3) provide Franceschi an adequate opportunity to litigate federal claims. <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 432; <em>Hirsh v. Justices of the Supreme Court of the State of Cal., </em>67 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">State proceedings are deemed \u201congoing\u201d if the state-court suit was pending at the time of the federal suit\u2019s filing. <em>Columbia Basin Apartment Ass\u2019n v. City of Pasco, </em>268 F.3d 791, 801 (9th Cir.2001). Under California law, attorney disciplinary proceedings in the State Bar Court commence with the filing of a notice of disciplinary charges. <em>See </em>Cal. State Bar R.P. 50 <em>&amp; </em>101(a). Because Franceschi brought his federal action after the State Bar had filed its notice of disciplinary charges against him, the state disciplinary proceedings were ongoing for <em>Younger </em>purposes. These proceedings were also judicial in nature. <em>See Hirsh, </em>67 F.3d at 712; <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 433-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u201cThe State ... has an extremely important interest in maintaining and assuring the professional conduct of the attorneys it licenses.\u201d <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 434. California\u2019s attorney disciplinary proceedings implicate important state interests. <em>Hirsh, </em>67 F.3d at 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">California\u2019s attorney disciplinary proceedings provide Franceschi with sufficient opportunity to raise federal claims for <em>Younger </em>purposes. Although the California Constitution, Article III, section 3.5 declares that administrative agencies may not \u201crefuse to enforce a statute on the basis that federal law or federal regulations prohibit the enforcement of such statute,\u201d Cal. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 3.5(c), this constitutional provision does not prevent Franceschi from raising his federal claims in the State Bar Court in order to preserve them for review in the California state courts. <em>See Delta Dental Plan of Cal. v. Mendoza, </em>139 F.3d 1289, 1296 (9th Cir.1998); <em>S. Pac. Transp. Co. v. Public Utils. Comm\u2019n of Cal., </em>716 F.2d 1285, 1290-91 (9th Cir.1983). In his response to the disciplinary charges, Franceschi may provide \u201csuch ... facts by way of defense as may be relevant,\u201d Cal. State Bar R.P. 103(c)(2)(i), and Franceschi may seek review of the State Bar Court\u2019s decision in the California Supreme Court or a California Court of Appeal. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 6082. This opportunity for judicial review of Franceschi\u2019s federal claims in the California courts satisfies the final requirement of <em>Younger. See Hirsh, </em>67 F.3d at 713; <em>Kenneally v. Lungren, </em>967 F.2d 329, 332 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Sch. Inc., </em>477 U.S. 619, 629, 106 S.Ct. 2718, 91 L.Ed.2d 512 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">We conclude that all of the <em>Younger </em>factors are present, and that none of the exceptions to the doctrine apply. Franceschi does not allege, and there is no evidence of, bad-faith prosecution, harassment, a biased state forum, or other extraordinary circumstances, and the California statutory provisions under which Franceschi has been charged are not blatantly unconstitutional. <em>See Hirsh, </em>67 F.3d at 713-715; <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 437 (citing these narrow exceptions to the <em>Younger </em>doctrine). The bankruptcy court properly abstained from exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>jurisdiction over Franceschi\u2019s federal' action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b116-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\">. In deciding that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order was interlocutory, the BAP relied on the fact that the court had failed to comply with the requirement of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9021 that a judgment must be set forth on a separate document. However, this reliance by the BAP was unfounded because we have held that the \"failure to comply with the separate-document requirement has no bearing on the question whether the court\u2019s judgment or order is final and appeal-able.\u201d <em>In re Bonham, 229 </em>F.3d at 761 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-17\">. Although Franceschi raises the merits of his federal claims on appeal, weodo not reach them because federal courts enjoy no discretion to decide the merits of a case once the requirements of <em>Younger </em>are met. <em>See Green, 255 </em>F.3d at 1093.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
