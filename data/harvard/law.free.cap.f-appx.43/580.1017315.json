Cade\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Cade has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising the following claims: (1) the search pursuant to a warrant violated his right to due process; (2) the prosecutor acted vindictively in prosecuting the case; and (3) counsel was ineffective for failing to consider an appeal. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We have considered Cade\u2019s issues raised in the supplemental brief and find them without merit. We therefore affirm Cade\u2019s convictions and sentence. We require that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
