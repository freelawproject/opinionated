R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-24\">Robert Louis Jones, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks leave to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) in appealing the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. Given Mr. Jones\u2019 pro se status, we construe his contentions liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). We ultimately conclude, however, that, because Mr. Jones has failed to present a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts\u201d in support of the issue he raises on appeal, <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991), we must deny IFP status and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Mr. Jones\u2019 petition suggests the following procedural facts. In 1994, Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (carjacking) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The district court sentenced Mr. Jones to 145 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Jones filed a direct appeal, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Mr. Jones thereafter challenged the validity of his conviction and sentence by filing, in the Western District of Texas, a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The relevant district court denied Mr. Jones\u2019 \u00a7 2255 petition and the Fifth Circuit, on at least one occasion, declined to grant Mr. Jones leave to a file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Mr. Jones next filed, in the District of Colorado (the district in which Mr. Jones is presently incarcerated), a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In this petition, Mr. Jones once again sought to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence. The district court denied the \u00a7 2241 petition, and Mr. Jon\u00e9s brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In his appeal, Mr. Jones challenges only the validity of his carjacking conviction. Mr. Jones argues that the carjacking conviction is invalid because, given the holding and reasoning of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), the government was required to prove (and failed to do so) that the vehicle stolen by Mr. Jones was involved in interstate commerce \u201cat the ... time petitioner attempted to take the vehicle.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Mr. Jones attacks the validity of his carjacking conviction. Challenges to the validity of one\u2019s conviction ordinarily must be brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a judgment ..., unless it is inadequate or ineffective, is that provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255____ A petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity ... \u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). This distinction is significant, in part, because \u00a7 2255 petitions must be filed in the district court that rendered the contested conviction, whereas \u00a7 2241 petitions must be filed in the district in which the petitioner is confined. <em>See Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166 (\u201cA 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition ... must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence.... A petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 ... must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Ordinarily, then, we would be required to dismiss Mr. Jones\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition in order that he might re-file that petition, correctly captioned as a \u00a7 2255 petition, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Recognizing this obstacle, Mr. Jones endeavors to invoke the exception, alluded to in <em>Bradshaw, </em>by which a petitioner may utilize a \u00a7 2241 petition rather than a \u00a7 2255 petition in those situations in which the \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of his claim that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective, Mr. Jones alleges that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has refused to address his argument absent the payment of a one hundred dollar \u201cfine.\u201d Rec. doc. 9, at 2 (Response to Order to Show Cause, filed Jan. 30, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Mr. Jones\u2019 argument fails to suggest that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. As we held in <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177 (10th Cir.1999), and as noted by the district court below, a habeas petitioner\u2019s inability to obtain leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition fails to render the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Caravalho, </em>177 F.3d at 1179 (\u201cThe mere fact that [a habeas petitioner] is precluded from filing a second \u00a7 2255 petition does not establish that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate.\u201d). In order, then, to attack the validity of his carjacking conviction, Mr. Jones is limited to pursuing leave, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to file, in the appropriate federal district court, a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Because Mr. Jones has failed to present a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument\u201d in support of his contention that his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective, <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991), we DENY Mr. Jones\u2019 motion to proceed IFP and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
