Appellant challenges: (i) the district court\u2019s grouping of offenses, and the resulting aggregation of related dollar amounts, under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3D1.2(d); (ii) the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s pretrial motions; and (iii) the district court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure. We affirm with regard to claims (i) and (ii) and dismiss the claim regarding the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Following the denial of his pre-trial motions, appellant pled guilty to Count One of the indictment, charging conspiracy to commit mail fraud and tax fraud. The plea agreement contained stipulations concerning the loss amounts resulting from appellant\u2019s mail and tax fraud offenses and stipulations concerning application of the Sentencing Guidelines, including an acknowledgment of a two-level enhancement under the tax evasion guideline, \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), for the failure to report income in excess of $10,000 derived from criminal activity. There was no agreement on whether or how the mail and tax fraud offenses should be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">At sentencing, the district court grouped appellant\u2019s mail and tax fraud offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to which the loss amounts applicable to the two offenses were aggregated and applied, under \u00a7 3D1.3(b), to the more stringent of the applicable sentencing tables. This resulted, after various adjustments, in a final offense level of 19, which the court reduced to 18 so as to reflect the agreement reached by the parties at the time of the plea. Appellant\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on his health and family circumstances was denied, and he was sentenced to twenty-seven months of imprisonment, the lowest sentence within the offense level 18 sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"Arg\">Appellant argues that his mail fraud and tax evasion offenses should be grouped, not under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), but rather under \u00a7 3D1.2(e), which would avoid the aggregation of loss amounts and result, after various adjustments, in an offense level of 16. Appellant claims that grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) leads to \u201cdouble counting\u201d of offenses, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22, because the mail fraud dollar amounts are aggregated for initial sentence calculation purposes, and then an additional two-point sentence enhancement is added under the tax evasion guideline, \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(1), for failure to report criminally-derived income in excess of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The government contends that the district court was correct to group the offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), arguing, first, that \u00a7 3D1.2(c) simply does not apply to appellant\u2019s offenses by its own terms, and, second, that the district court was precluded from grouping appellant\u2019s offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) by our decisions in <em>United States v. Fitzgerald, </em>232 F.3d 315, 320 21 (2d Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>237 F.3d 119, 124-25 (2d Cir.2000). Both <em>Fitzgerald </em>and <em>Petrillo, </em>in the government\u2019s view, direct us to group mail fraud and tax evasion under \u00a7 3D 1.2(d), rather than \u00a7 3D1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Appellant in return urges us to revisit <em>Fitzgerald </em>and <em>Potrillo </em>and clarify that these two decisions merely allow the grouping of fraud and tax offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), but do not direct us to do so. Thus, appellant argues, <em>Fitzgerald </em>notwithstanding, the district court still had the option of grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Since argument, however, we rendered a decision in <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>291 F.3d 181 (2002). For the reasons stated therein, appellant\u2019s mail and tax fraud offenses were properly grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines. See <em>id. </em>at 191-93; <em>see also id. </em>at 198 (Newman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">While we acknowledge a degree of ambiguity as between the text of the Sentencing Guidelines, which in our view provides for grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), and a 1992 staff advisory opinion issued by the sentencing commission and cited by appellant, which indicates that grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) would be appropriate, the text of the Sentencing Guidelines must take precedence over a nonbinding advisory opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Nor can we conclude that the underlying purpose of \u00a7 3D1.2(c), avoiding \u201cdouble counting\u201d of offense behavior, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, cmt. n. 5, would be significantly served in this particular case by a grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(c). First, the loss associated with the mail fraud offense greatly exceeds the $10,000 threshold required to trigger the two-point enhancement for tax fraud under \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), and any \u201cdouble counting\u201d would be limited to $10,000 of the approximately $456,000 mail fraud loss. Indeed, under the approach proposed by appellant, the portion of the loss in excess of $10,000 would not be reflected at all in the sentence. Minimal double counting would be avoided, therefore, only at the expense of proportionality. Second, the two-point enhancement under \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l) for failure to report criminally derived income was actually based not on income from the approximately $456,000 mail fraud, but on income from the separate $600,000 check-cashing scheme pleaded to by appellant. Therefore, the $10,000 double counting is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Moreover, putting \u00a7 3D1.2(d) aside, we do not believe the applicable text of \u00a7 3D1.2(c) \u2014 -that grouping shall occur where one count \u201cembodies conduct\u201d that is treated as an \u201cadjustment to\u201d the guideline for another count, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(e) \u2014 can reasonably be read to require grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) in this case. The failure to report or to correctly identify the source of income ... from criminal activity, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), is not embodied in the mail fraud count. The failure to report occurs after the mail fraud has been carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In any event, we have held definitively that the text, structure, and commentary of the Sentencing Guidelines, as currently in force, require the grouping of mail fraud and tax fraud offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), even where the same funds are the object of both the mail fraud and the tax fraud, and even where \u00a7 3D1.2(c) might otherwise apply. <em>See Gordon, </em>291 F.3d at 192-93 (noting that application of \u00a7 3D1.2(d) is appropriate where both mail fraud and tax evasion \u201cinvolve the same funds,\u201d and that \u201cthe Guidelines suggest that crimes falling within the special category of quantifiable-harm offenses <em>require </em>treatment under \u00a7 3D1.2(d)\u201d (emphasis added)). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grouping of appellant\u2019s offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">With regard to appellant\u2019s challenge of the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial , motions, we hold that by entering a knowing, voluntary, and unconditional plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>guilty, appellant waived his right to contest the pretrial rulings. <em>See Lebowitz v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 207, 209 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cThe settled rule is that a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily enters a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdietional defects in the prior proceedings.\u201d). After a judgment of conviction has been entered upon a defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, the defendant is limited to attacking the voluntary and knowing character of the guilty plea. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Finally, because appellant does not allege that the denial of his departure motion was based on an error of law or on the district court\u2019s misapprehension of the court\u2019s departure authority, the denial of the downward departure is unreviewable. We review district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a downward departure only where \u201cthe guidelines were misapplied\u201d or \u201cthe court misapprehended its authority or imposed an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993). Appellant did not produce clear evidence that the district judge misapprehended the scope of his departure authority. <em>See United States v. Stephenson, </em>183 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir.1999). We therefore lack appellate jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and we find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
