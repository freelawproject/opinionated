Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court prematurely dismissed McEvily\u2019s claim that his prison\u2019s substance abuse treatment program violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. We have previously held that standing to assert an Establishment Clause claim requires direct contact with the offending practice, but that a plaintiffs change in conduct so as to avoid the offensive practice does not serve to negate standing. <em>Suhre v. Haywood County, </em>131 F.3d 1083, 1086-88 (4th Cir.1997); <em>cf. Taylor v. Rogers, </em>781 F.2d 1047, 1048 n. 1 (4th Cir.1986) (noting that transfer of inmate moots only claims for declatory and injunctive relief). On the present record, we are unable to conclude that the district court correctly found that McEvily lacked standing to assert this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-21\">We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion dismissing McEvily\u2019s remaining claims and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny McEvily\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing McEvily\u2019s Establishment Clause claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and remand for further proceedings on that claim, and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing McEvily\u2019s remaining claims on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See McEvily v. Ordile, </em>No. CA-01-297-7 (W.D.Va. June 13, 2001; Jan. 31, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
