Grandberry and Randall E. Cobb pled guilty to aiding and abetting each other in the possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base. Defendants appeal the application of USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 in determining their offense levels based on the district court\u2019s finding that defendants distributed drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. In addition, Grandberry appeals the admission of the testimony of a witness at the sentencing hearing in violation of the rule of sequestration. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">Defendants Grandberry and Cobb pled guilty to aiding and abetting each other in the possession with intent to distribute and distribution of 20.1 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. At defendants\u2019 sentencing hearings, the district court made the factual finding that defendants distributed drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. Based on that finding, it increased each defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.2. It sentenced Grandberry to 108 months and Cobb to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-19\">1. \u00a7 2D1.2 Increase</p>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 authorizes a two-level increase of the offense level \u201capplicable to the quantity of controlled substances directly involving a protected location.\u201d Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a), within 1,000 feet of a school is a \u201cprotected location.\u201d Neither defendant challenges the district court\u2019s factual finding that the drug transaction took place within 1,000 feet of a school, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>both raise various arguments against the application of \u00a7 2D1.2. The district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Hamilton, </em>263 F.3d 645, 651 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Defendants assert that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2D1.2 to determine their base offense levels required that they be charged and convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860, an argument we rejected in <em>United States v. Clay, </em>117 F.3d 317 (6th Cir.1997). In <em>Clay, </em>we observed that the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.2 lists 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859, 860, and 861 as the applicable statutory provisions but does not expressly limit its application to convictions under those statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 319. In determining the offense guideline most applicable to the offense of conviction, it is \u201c \u2018appropriate that the court consider the actual conduct of the offender, even when such conduct does not constitute an element of the offense.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting USSG \u00a7 1B1.2 comment, (n.3)). \u201cThus, while \u00a7 2D1.2 certainly applies to offenses like those described in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859, 860, 861, where the involvement of minors or proximity to their schools is an element of the offense, it also applies in cases involving conviction for other offenses (including convictions under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841), if the conduct of the offender brings him within the scope of \u00a7 2D1.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, under the law of this circuit, the application of \u00a7 2D1.2 does not require indictment and conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">According to defendants, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), and <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), require that the fact that the drug transaction occurred with 1,000 feet of a school must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. These cases established that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 sentences are invalid under <em>Apprendi </em>only if the district court\u2019s factual finding that defendants distributed drugs within 1,000 feet of a school resulted in their receiving sentences in excess of the maximum statutory penalty for the crime to which they pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Defendants pled guilty to aiding and abetting each other in the possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The type and quantity of drugs triggered the statutory mandatory sentencing provisions set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), specifically, not less than five years and not more than forty years. After applying \u00a7 2D1.2 to determine the offense level, the district court sentenced Grandberry to 108 months and Cobb to 96 months. Neither defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>dant\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum of forty years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the fact supporting the application of \u00a7 2D1.2 \u2014 that the drug transaction took place within 1.000 feet of a school \u2014 was not required to be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Finally, Grandberry contends that he did not know that a school was less than 1.000 feet away from the transaction and that determining the distance between the location of the drug deal and the school would require \u201ccomplex mathematical calculations.\u201d Whether defendant knew that his drug transaction occurred within 1,000 feet of a protected location is immaterial. <em>See United States v. Cross, </em>900 F.2d 66, 69 (6th Cir.1990) (holding that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845a, the precursor to \u00a7 860(a), does not require <em>mens </em>rea).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">2. Sequestration Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Grandberry asserts that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Officer Ken Jones to testify at his sentencing hearing when he had been present in the courtroom during Lieutenant Rick Kelly\u2019s testimony in violation of the rule of sequestration. The district court\u2019s decision to allow a witness who violated the rule of sequestration to testify is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>675 F.2d 825, 835 (6th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">At Grandberry\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government invoked the rule of sequestration prior to calling its first witness. The government then called Kelly to testify about his measurements and calculations relating to the distance between 316 North Home Street, the house outside of which the drug transaction took place, and Central Elementary School, a school around the block. On cross examination, Kelly admitted that he was not present when the drug transaction took place and that the transaction could have occurred \u201canywhere up and down Home Street.\u201d After Kelly testified, the government called Jones, who purchased the drugs from defendants. Jones had entered the courtroom for another case during Kelly\u2019s testimony. Grandberry\u2019s counsel objected to Jones\u2019s violation of the rule of sequestration. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-13\">Well, there was potentially a violation of the Rule. The purpose of the Rule is to keep one witness from hearing the testimony of another witness so that he won\u2019t change his testimony to meet that of the other. However, it appears to be an innocent violation of the Rule. There was no intent to prep Mr. Jones, who apparently came in unbeknownst to Mr. Pham [the Assistant United States Attorney]. So, I\u2019ll overrule the objection and let Mr. Jones testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">Jones then testified that the deal occurred in the driveway adjacent to 316 North Home Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">The purpose of the rule of sequestration is \u201cto preclude coaching or the influencing of a witness\u2019 testimony by another witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Rugiero, </em>20 F.3d 1387, 1392 (6th Cir.1994). Violation of the rule does not automatically bar the testimony of a witness; rather, the court has broad discretion to exclude the testimony under particular circumstances. <em>Gibson, </em>675 F.2d at 835-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">At oral argument, Grandberry\u2019s counsel conceded that the rule of sequestration was not violated purposefully. Because the circumstances indicate that Officer Jones did not violate the rule with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u201cconsent, connivance, procurement or knowledge\u201d of the government, <em>id. </em>at 836, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. Effective November 1, 2000, the commentary to USSG \u00a7 2D 1.2 was amended to state that \"[t]his guideline applies only in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a statutory violation of drug trafficking in a protected location ... or in a case in which the defendant stipulated to such a statutory violation.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 comment, (n. 1) (2001). Defendants may seek the benefit of this amendment through the procedure set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-11\"><em>. </em>In his plea agreement, Grandberry stipulated to at least 20.1 grams of cocaine base.
