We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">Walton contends that his appellate counsel was ineffective for filing a no-issues brief, pursuant to <em>People v. Wende, </em>25 Cal.3d 436, 158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071 (1979), because counsel did not raise on direct appeal the issue of whether the trial court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding possible ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ror bias or misconduct. Based on our reading of the juror\u2019s letter to Walton and the attorney\u2019s affidavit relating the juror\u2019s statements, we conclude that the California state courts would not have allowed an evidentiary hearing regarding possible juror bias or misconduct. <em>See People v. Hedgecock, </em>51 Cal.3d 395, 272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260, 1272 (1990) (holding that a trial court may conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding juror misconduct only if it is \u201cnecessary to resolve material, disputed issues of fact\u201d); <em>see also </em>Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 1150(a) (prohibiting evidence, upon an inquiry as to the validity of a verdict, \u201cto show the effect of [any] statement, conduct, condition, or event upon a juror\u201d). In this case, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise meritless issues on appeal. <em>Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 872 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Therefore, Walton has not demonstrated that the California state courts\u2019 decision rejecting his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application, of Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (holding that the proper standard for evaluating claim that appellate counsel was ineffective in neglecting to file a merits brief is whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and whether it prejudiced his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b159-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
