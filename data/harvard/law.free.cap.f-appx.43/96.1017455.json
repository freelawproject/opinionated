We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand. As the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the case, we will not repeat them here except as necessary. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Botosan v. Paul McNally Realty, </em>216 F.3d 827, 830 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">The ADA requires the Anaheim Hilton to install roll-in showers in fifteen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of its 1,572 rooms only if the hotel\u2019s current lack of roll-in showers (1) constitutes an \u201carchitectural barrier\u201d (2) whose removal is \u201creadily achievable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The district court based its partial grant of summary judgment on the conclusion that there was no architectural barrier. However, it is undisputed that the lack of rooms with roll-in showers at the Anaheim Hilton makes it impossible for D\u2019Lil to utilize an essential element of the hotel room \u2014 namely, the bathing facilities. It is no answer for the hotel to say that the tub is accessible to those who can use a lifting device. The problem is that bathing is impossible for those who cannot; persons like D\u2019Lil require roll-in showers. Recognizing that an otherwise accessible bathroom may still pose a barrier to certain wheelchair-bound patrons, the ADAAG guidelines require new hotels with more than fifty rooms to provide rooms with roll-in showers, not merely rooms with so-called handicapped-accessible bathtubs. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A at 9.1.2. It is true that, as a general proposition, ADAAG applies only to new construction and to buildings undergoing alterations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12183. However, ADAAG\u2019s requirement of roll-in showers in new buildings demonstrates that the <em>lack </em>of roll-in showers is both a barrier and the kind of barrier the ADA was intended to overcome. Otherwise, ADAAG would not require roll-in showers at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>But that doesn\u2019t end the matter. Public accommodations are required to remedy only those architectural barriers whose removal is \u201creadily achievable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The ADA defines \u201creadily achievable\u201d as \u201ceasily accomplish-able and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense,\u201d and lists four factors to assist \u201c[i]n determining whether an action is readily achievable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181(9). The parties agree that the installation of a roll-in shower will cost $8,696.64 per room, or $130,449.60 for fifteen, and they entered into a stipulation below stating that \u201c[a]s to a readily achievable defense ... defendants will not claim lack of financial ability to install roll-in showers at Anaheim Hilton &amp; Towers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Anaheim Hilton urges us to affirm on the basis that the installation of fifteen roll-in showers is not readily achievable. Although the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, they did not furnish the district court with all the information it would need to decide whether the installation of roll-in showers at the Anaheim Hilton is readily achievable as a matter of law. By virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181(9), that question involves more than just knowing that the defendants will not claim lack of financial ability. Genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the installation is readily achievable. Therefore, we reverse the partial grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\">. Section Nine of the ADAAG guidelines, \u201cAccessible Transient Lodging,\u201d contains a fable showing the number of rooms with roll-in showers required, depending on the total number of rooms in the facility. 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A at 9.1.2. A facility with 150 rooms, for example, is required to provide two roll-in showers, while the Anaheim Hilton would be required to have fifteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
