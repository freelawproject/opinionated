The sole issue on appeal is whether he was competent to stand trial. He contends that the district court applied the wrong legal standard for competency and that even if the correct standard was applied, the decision was clearly erroneous. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Defendant was indicted on May 19, 1999. Noting Defendant\u2019s history of schizophrenia and his disorientation in conversation, defense counsel promptly moved for an evaluation of mental competency. On June 2 the magistrate judge ordered the evaluation, which was conducted by Susan B. Cave, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist. She reported that while \u201cthe irrational process of a thought disorder is still present in his thinking,\u201d Defendant had a \u201crational as well as factual understanding of the charges against him\u201d and the \u201cpresent ability to consult with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d Defense counsel did not challenge the report. On August 25, 1999, District Judge John E. Conway found Defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">This was not Judge Conway\u2019s first exposure to questions of Defendant\u2019s competency. In 1995 and 1996, in a prior case, Judge Conway twice found Defendant in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>competent and committed him to the United States Medical Center for Prisoners (USMCFP) for treatment to restore him to competency. After the second commitment Judge Conway found Defendant competent and accepted his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Returning to the present case, Defendant\u2019s mental competency became an issue again when on April 4, 2000, defense counsel filed a Second Unopposed Motion to Determine Mental Competency of Defendant. The motion stated that it was precipitated by Defendant\u2019s \u201cdisruptive and bizarre\u201d behavior at a pretrial hearing. On April 19, 2000, Judge Conway entered an order requiring a report responding to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">1. Does [Defendant] now have a rational as well as a factual understanding of-the charges against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">2. Does [Defendant] now have sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of factual understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">3. [I]s there a substantial probability that [Defendant] will attain these capacities in the foreseeable future?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Catherine H. Klee, Ph.D., performed the evaluation and reported that Defendant was \u201ccompetent and able to understand legal proceedings and to properly assist in his own defense\u201d despite \u201chis occasional delusional verbalizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">This time, however, defense counsel disputed the report. At the competency hearing on June 28, 2000, he called Defendant as a witness. After Defendant engaged in several incoherent and disruptive outbursts, both the prosecutor and Judge Conway agreed that Defendant was not competent. The court entered an order stating that \u201chaving observed and addressed [Defendant] in open court ... [t]his court FINDS by a preponderance of the evidence that [Defendant] is suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to assist properly in his defense.\u201d The court committed him \u201cto the custody of the Attorney General for hospitalization and treatment ... to determine whether there [was] a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future\u201d he would become competent. Defendant was sent to the USMCFP, where he was treated by Dr. James K. Wolfson.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Dr. Wolfson issued a thorough 24 page report, which summarized not only' his care and observations of Defendant but also Defendant\u2019s legal and psychiatric history. Dr. Wolfson reported that by the end of treatment at the facility, which included administration of an antipsychotic medication that Defendant had not previously taken, Defendant \u201cwas able to stay on the topic for much longer periods of time,\u201d \u201ctolerate sitting and listening to things he did not wish to hear,\u201d \u201ccommunicate and articulate his views relatively clearly,\u201d \u201cgrasp and manipulate information presented to him,\u201d and \u201cmake rational decisions when he cho[se].\u201d Dr. Wolfson wrote: \u201c[Defendant\u2019s] illness may ... somewhat distort his approach to the case,\u201d yet \u201c[Defendant] can now demonstrate an understanding of the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him ... [and] there has been a substantial improvement in his capacity to assist counsel.\u201d He concluded \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty, that [Defendant\u2019s] illness has been brought into sufficient remission that he has been restored to competence to stand trial____\u201d Accordingly, the warden of the USMCFP certified on March 28, 2001, that Defendant was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The court conducted a competency hearing on May 1, 2001. Defense counsel again called Defendant as a witness. Direct, focused questions about the case received reasonable answers. For example, when counsel asked if he had seen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>superseding indictment, Defendant responded: \u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen it. I understand it. It means more charges.\u201d In contrast, however, when counsel asked Defendant to describe the voices in his head or to describe how God spoke to him, he began to ramble incoherently. Once defense counsel finished direct examination, the prosecutor asked whether Defendant thought he could \u201csit quietly\u201d when the prosecution presented its case. Defendant answered: \u2018Yeah. Yes I do. I just want to get \u2014 go ahead and get \u2014 because the evidence points in my direction, so I\u2019d like to get it taken care of.\u201d The prosecutor then asked \u201cif [your counsel] told you he thought it would be better for you not to testify as a witness in your trial, could you respect his decision on that?\u201d Defendant answered \u2018Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">After Defendant\u2019s testimony, defense counsel stipulated to the admissibility of the Wolfson Report. In ruling on Defendant\u2019s competency, Judge Conway stated that, though \u201c[h]e\u2019s a little irrational on some things ... from the record I\u2019ve got, from what he said today, he\u2019s competent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The court then arraigned Defendant on a superseding indictment. At one point during the arraignment, Defendant said, \u201c[M]aybe I should get a different lawyer. ...\u201d In response to this suggestion, the following exchange took place between the court and Defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">Court: As far as I\u2019m concerned, [your attorney] is one of the very best lawyers in the state of New Mexico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">Defendant: How many jury trials has he had in his record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">Court: Oh, probably 50 to a hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">Defendant: 50 to a hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">Court: At least. So, not as many as I\u2019ve had but he\u2019s had a lot. He is \u2014 as I say, one of -the most ... he\u2019s one of the most competent attorneys we\u2019ve got. He\u2019ll do everything he can and you\u2019ll be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">Defendant Okay, he\u2019s fine. If that\u2019s which one you want me to work with, I\u2019ll work with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">The written order on the competency hearing and arraignment stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">[T]he court ... finds the defendant competent to proceed to trial. The defendant is cognizant of the charges which have been filed against him, and he has indicated that he is ready to proceed to trial. Therefore, IT IS ORDERED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">1. That the defendant is fully able to understand the charges filed against him and is competent to proceed to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The trial began on June 26, 2001. Presentation of evidence continued the next day and the jury returned its verdict on June 28. Although defense counsel and Judge Conway both observed at the close of the first day of trial that Defendant was \u201ctalking to himself all the time,\u201d Defendant engaged in only one outburst. When his attorney completed cross examination of the final government witness, Defendant exclaimed: \u201c[H]e forgot to ask a question I asked him to ask, to interpret. Interpret test tube babies.\u201d The court ignored Defendant and allowed the government to proceed to redirect examination. Following dismissal of the jury, Defendant continued to argue that defense counsel should have asked a question concerning \u201ctest tube babies.\u201d Defense counsel stated that despite reserved behavior during the trial, this outburst was a \u201cwindow\u201d into Defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d and that he was \u201cnot able to consult with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d Nevertheless, counsel made no request for reconsideration of whether Defendant was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The jury convicted Defendant on one count and was unable to reach a verdict on three counts relating to a separate fire. After the jury returned the verdict and Defendant was removed from the room, Judge Conway explained to the jury that the marshals in the courtroom during trial were there as a precaution because of pri- or disruptive behavior by Defendant. He then outlined Defendant\u2019s past mental instability and said: \u201cWhat you have to do is be competent to understand what\u2019s going on, and he\u2019s competent to understand what\u2019s going on. He may be a little off on some other things or have these other strong feelings about stuff, but he\u2019s competent to understand what\u2019s happening here in the courtroom, and that\u2019s the standard we go by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">A. <em>Competency Standard Used by District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We first address Defendant\u2019s contention that the district court employed the wrong legal standard in assessing his competency. The test of a defendant\u2019s competency is \u201cwhether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Dusky v. United </em>States, 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Defendant claims that the district court focused solely on the second prong of the test, whether Defendant can understand the proceedings, while ignoring the first prong, whether Defendant can adequately consult with counsel. This argument rests primarily upon the court\u2019s May 1, 2001 order. Defendant asserts that the order \u201cstates that the finding [of competency] is based on the fact that [Defendant] is \u2018cognizant of the charges which have been filed against him, and he has indicated he is ready to proceed to trial.\u2019 \u201c Defendant also points to the judge\u2019s post-verdict comment to the jury: \u201c[H]e\u2019s competent to understand what\u2019s going on here in the courtroom, and that\u2019s the standard we go by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">We are not persuaded. Although the court did not explicitly mention the capacity to consult with counsel in either the order or the post-verdict comment, the balance of the record demonstrates that it applied the correct standard when it used the word \u201ccompetent\u201d in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Judge Conway\u2019s order for a local competency examination stated both prongs of the competency test. All three of the ordered reports discussed both prongs. The second sentence of USMCFP\u2019s three-sentence certificate of competency states the two-prong test. Judge Conway\u2019s order for a commitment and evaluation at the USMCFP does not mention the second prong but states that Defendant is \u201cunable to assist properly in his defense.\u201d We think it reasonable to presume that a judge knows a requirement of the law when he issues two orders stating the requirement and the sole documents presented for his review set forth the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Such a presumption can, of course, be rebutted by the record. But that is not the case here. We disagree with Defendant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s misunderstanding of the test for competency is shown by the court\u2019s order entered after the competency hearing and arraignment. The order states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">THIS MATTER came before the court for a competency hearing regarding [Defendant], After hearing testimony of the defendant and argument from counsel, and having reviewed the psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>chological report provided to the court by the [USMCFP], the court agrees with the conclusions of the report and finds the defendant competent to proceed to trial. The defendant is cognizant of the charges which have been filed against him, and he has indicated that he is ready to proceed to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az8\">Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">1. That the defendant is fully able to understand the charges filed against him and is competent to proceed to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">2. The defendant is arraigned on the superseding indictment which was filed on April 19, 2001 (Doc # 56).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">3. Jury selection and jury trial shall be scheduled for Tuesday, June 26, 2001 at 8:30 a.m. [at the United States Courthouse].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Defendant reads paragraph 1 to say, \u201c[T]he defendant is fully able to understand the charges filed against him and <em>therefore </em>is competent to proceed to trial.\u201d But the word \u201ctherefore\u201d does not appear in the order. Perhaps the court\u2019s repeated mention that Defendant understood the charges is the consequence of Defendant\u2019s having been arraigned on a superseding indictment at the same proceeding. In any event, of greater importance is the court\u2019s statement that it \u201cagrees with the conclusions of the [USMCFP] report,\u201d which set forth both prongs of the competency test. No doubt the order could have been drafted to eliminate any ambiguity, but there was no reason for the district court to anticipate the present challenge to its ruling. It was enough for the court simply to find Defendant \u201ccompetent to proceed to trial,\u201d using the single word \u201ccompetent\u201d to encompass both prongs of the competency test that was well-known to the court. We note that neither party sought clarification of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">As for the court\u2019s post-trial comment to the jury, we give little weight to an impromptu oral remark to a lay audience uttered eight weeks after the competency hearing. In sum, we are confident that the experienced trial judge applied the proper test for competency. <em>Cf. Bratcher v. Bray-Doyle Independent School Dist. No. 12, </em>8 F.3d 722, 724 (10th Cir.1993) (appellate court presumes that district court knew what was required by de novo review); <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1320 n. 6 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cwe do not assume that the district judges do not know the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">B. <em>Factual Basis for Competency Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Alternatively, Defendant contends that even if the district court applied the proper test for competency, the competency finding was in error because he could not meaningfully interact with counsel. (Defendant concedes that he possessed a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.) \u201cCompetency to stand trial is a factual determination that can be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Boigegrain, </em>155 F.3d 1181, 1189 (10th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The very thorough USMCFP report explained in detail the basis of its conclusion that Defendant could consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding. The report described how Defendant could \u201cstay on the topic,\u201d \u201ctolerate ... listening to things he did not wish to hear,\u201d \u201ccommunicate and articulate his views relatively clearly,\u201d \u201cgrasp and manipulate information presented to him,\u201d and \u201cmake rational decisions when he chooses.\u201d These expert conclusions, supported by five months of observation, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>vide a firm foundation for the district court\u2019s May 1, 2001 findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Defendant\u2019s behavior at the competency hearing causes concern but does not undermine the court\u2019s ruling. His incoherent comments were elicited primarily by general questions that had little to do with his ability to cooperate with counsel. Although these comments reveal aspects of Defendant\u2019s persistent mental illness, \u201c[t]he presence of some degree of mental disorder in the defendant does not necessarily mean that he is incompetent to ... aid and assist in his own defense.\u201d <em>Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F.3d 1459, 1472 (10th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court, which had previously rejected a mental evaluation of Defendant and found him incompetent based on his conduct at a competency hearing, was in a far better position than we to evaluate the significance of Defendant\u2019s behavior in the courtroom. <em>See United States v. Mackovich, </em>209 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that defendant\u2019s demeanor and comportment in court are proper factors in assessing competency).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Defendant also argues that his conduct at trial demonstrated an inability to \u201cconsult with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d Yet his conduct at trial was less disruptive than anticipated by the district court, and his one outburst was no more incoherent than his remarks at the competency hearing. Despite noting persistent psychoses that could affect his approach to the case, all three competency reports stated that Defendant could still consult with his attorney with a rational degree of understanding. If anything, Defendant\u2019s relatively good behavior at trial would confirm the court\u2019s prior evaluation of his competency. The court was not presented with any specific instances of an inability of Defendant to communicate satisfactorily with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u201cObviously we must rely heavily on the discretion of the district court in applying [the mental competency] standard to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Parsons, </em>967 F.2d 452, 455 (10th Cir.1992). The exercise of that discretion in this case was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. Also, we grant Defendant\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Supplement the Record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
