Turner\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Turner\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea but stating that in his opinion there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Turner has filed a pro se brief challenging the validity of his guilty plea, arguing his counsel provided ineffective assistance, and asserting other substantive challenges to the validity of his conviction and sentence. The Government has moved to dismiss Turner\u2019s appeal because Turner waived his right to appeal in Ms plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law, which this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to appeal contained in a valid plea agreement is enforceable if it is \u201cthe result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forego the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). We have reviewed Turner\u2019s plea agreement and the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and conclude Turner knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. Further, we have reviewed Turner\u2019s pro se claims challenging the validity of the plea agreement due to counsel\u2019s actions and find them to be without merit. Thus, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based on the waiver provision in the plea agreement as to all claims except for Turner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, which are not precluded by the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Turner argues counsel failed to investigate, failed to challenge the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information, and failed to protect his interests. Turner also argues his appellate counsel was ineffective because counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief when Turner had meritorious issues for appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). To allow for adequate development of the record, the presumptive rule is that ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be pursued in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. A review of the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective. Accordingly, Turner\u2019s claim must be brought, if at all, in a collateral proceeding, and we affirm as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to all claims except Turner\u2019s ineffective assistance claims; as to those claims, we affirm. We deny Turner\u2019s motion for substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
