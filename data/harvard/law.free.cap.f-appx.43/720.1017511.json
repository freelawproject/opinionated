On appeal, Lassiter raises two issues. First, Lassiter argues the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Lassiter\u2019s challenge is meritless. The testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses established Lassiter knowingly possessed a firearm as a convicted felon, and that he knowingly possessed marijuana. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (2000); 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 844 (2000); <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Second, Lassiter argues the district court erred in admitting evidence obtained from a police search of a car in which Lassiter was a passenger. Lassiter has waived this issue by his failure to file a pre-trial suppression motion in district court. <em>United States v. Ricco, </em>52 F.3d 58, 62 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Lassiter\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
