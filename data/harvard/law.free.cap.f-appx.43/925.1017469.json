Wilkey, Jr. claims that John Argo, a Dayton, Tennessee police officer, used excessive force against him. The district court granted Argo\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding as a matter of law that the degree of force that Argo used against Wilkey was objectively reasonable under the circumstances of their encounter. For the reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Wilkey\u2019s encounter with Argo has its origin in a domestic dispute. On the evening of Saturday, January 23, 1999, Wilkey, who had been drinking, insisted that his wife Debra drive him from their house in rural Rhea County, Tennessee to a fast-food restaurant located about 30 miles away. Debra acquiesced to his demands after arguing with him for approximately ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">On their return drive, Wilkey instructed Debra to stop the car, at which point he removed a gun from the car\u2019s glove compartment and fired it into the air several times. The couple returned to their house without further incident. But once they arrived home, Debra heard her husband firing a gun near their garage while she was getting ready for bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">After the shooting stopped, a Rhea County deputy sheriff, Ralph Dillard, arrived at the Wilkeys\u2019 house to investigate \u2022the gunshots. Debra told Dillard that her husband had been shooting a gun, was intoxicated, needed assistance, and should be taken to jail. Dillard, who had worked with Wilkey during Wilkey\u2019s former employment as a Rhea County deputy sheriff, told Debra that he could not do that to \u201chis ole\u2019 buddy,\u201d and apparently took no action other than talking with Wilkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">The next morning Debra went to the Rhea County Hospital, where she worked as a paramedic. Because she did not want to speak with or see Wilkey, Debra told the receptionist not to let Wilkey into the hospital if he came to visit. Debra then called Wilkey\u2019s father and told him about her husband\u2019s behavior the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Later that morning, Wilkey called Debra at the hospital. Wilkey asked her why she had called his father, and told Debra that her conversation was \u201cworrying his parents to death.\u201d Debra told her husband that she was not trying to upset his parents, at which point Wilkey stated that \u201cmaybe someone needs to show you how it feels.\u201d He also told Debra that he intended to drive to the hospital to see her.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Following her conversation with Wilkey, Debra called the Rhea County central dispatch to inform the police that her husband was on his way to the hospital, and that he might be carrying a gun behind his back or between the seats of his truck. Debra then exited the hospital. Before leaving the hospital\u2019s parking lot, she met Argo, who inquired about her report to the dispatch office. She told Argo about her argument with Wilkey and warned him that her husband might be carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">Argo left the hospital to get lunch after his conversation with Debra. During his lunch, Argo received a report that Wilkey had arrived at the hospital. Argo asked Bill Cranfield, a police officer with whom he was eating, to meet him at the hospital. He then left to investigate Wilkey\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Prior to Argo\u2019s arrival at the hospital, Wilkey had asked the hospital\u2019s receptionist if he could speak to his wife. Both the receptionist and another hospital employee told him that Debra was busy and did not want to speak with him. Wilkey then exited the hospital without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">When Argo arrived at the hospital, Wilkey was walking toward his truck in the parking lot. Argo asked Wilkey to stop walking so that he could ask Wilkey a few questions. Wilkey slowed his pace but did not stop, telling Argo that they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>need to talk, that he was on his way home, and that he had not done anything wrong. At that point, Cranfield arrived at the scene, which caused Wilkey to stop walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Argo informed Wilkey that he was investigating an official call and that he had been advised that Wilkey was present at the hospital \u201cto cause trouble\u201d and would probably be carrying a gun. Wilkey told Argo that he did not have a gun with him, but that he had one in his truck. Argo then asked if he could \u201cpat down\u201d Wilkey, and Wilkey consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Although the frisk did not reveal a gun, Argo felt an object in Wilkey\u2019s back pocket that aroused his suspicion. Argo asked Wilkey what the object was. Rather than telling Argo that it was a six or seven-inch-long stinger flashlight, Wilkey removed the object from his pocket and displayed it for a few seconds. Argo then accused Wilkey of carrying an ASP baton, an expandable nightstick that can be used as a weapon. Wilkey did not directly respond to Argo\u2019s comment, but instead placed the flashlight back into his pocket .and informed Argo that he had a right to carry it. At no time did Wilkey threaten Argo with the flashlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Argo then reached around Wilkey to remove the object from his pocket. According to Argo, Wilkey pushed Argo\u2019s hand away. Wilkey, in contrast, denies doing so. Argo proceeded to grab Wilkey by the shirt and collar and spin him around onto Cranfield\u2019s Jeep, which was about six to eight feet behind them. Wilkey claims that Argo then climbed on the Jeep and forced Wilkey\u2019s head, neck, and shoulders against the hood. Argo pinned Wilkey on the hood by placing his forearm under Wilkey\u2019s chin. While Wilkey was restrained in this manner, Argo told him to go home, calm down, and work things out with his wife. After about 20 seconds, Argo released Wilkey and allowed him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">Wilkey eventually received medical treatment for the back pains that he experienced following his encounter with Argo. He was diagnosed with two ruptured disks in his spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">This lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee in January of 2000. Wilkey asserts claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 for violations of his First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. More specifically, the complaint alleges that Argo, who was sued in his individual and official capacities, used excessive force against Wilkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">Argo filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the degree of force that was used against Wilkey was objectively reasonable under the circumstances and, in the alternative, that Argo was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted Argo\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that no reasonable juror would find that Argo used excessive force against Wilkey. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A0o\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In considering such a motion, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number><em>Zenith Radio Corp., 475 </em>U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The central issue is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it. is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">B. Excessive force claim</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Wilkey brings this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He must therefore establish \u201cthat (1) a person, (2) acting under color of state law, (3) deprived [him] of a federal right.\u201d <em>Berger v. City of Mayfield Heights, </em>265 F.3d 399, 405 (6th Cir.2001) (setting forth the requirements of a \u00a7 1983 claim). The sole issue in the present case is whether Argo violated any of Wilkey\u2019s federal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Wilkey alleges that Argo violated the Fourth Amendment by using excessive force when he pinned Wilkey against the hood of Officer Cranfield\u2019s Jeep and restrained him there. Argo concedes that his actions constituted a \u201cseizure\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (explaining that \u201c[a] seizure triggering the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections occurs only when government actors have, by means of physical force or show of authority, ... in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, Wilkey\u2019s claim is analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 395 (holding that \u201call claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force\u2014 deadly or not \u2014 in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \u2018seizure\u2019 of a free citizen should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">\u201cDetermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted). This analysis \u201crequires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Where factual disputes exist as to these considerations, summary judgment is not appropriate. <em>Kain v. Nesbitt, </em>156 F.3d 669, 673 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201cIf plaintiffs version as to the nature and degree of force used is credited, which the district court failed to do, a jury question is created as to whether the force used was excessive.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Santos v. Gates, </em>287 F.3d 846, 855 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cIn light of the factual disputes regarding the amount of force used, the circumstances under which it was applied, and the extent of the plaintiffs injuries, the question is properly for the jury whether the force applied by the officers was objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d); <em>Breen v. Garrison, </em>169 F.3d 152, 153 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam) (\u201cThe issue of excessive force also was for the jury, whose unique task it was to determine the amount of force used, the injuries suffered, and the objective reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be assessed \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396. This perspective allows \u201cfor the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97. Nevertheless, the applicable standard is an objective one: \u201c[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilkey was not carrying a gun, thereby considerably reducing the severity of any threat that Wilkey might have presented to Argo and Cranfield or to members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Argo\u2019s search of Wilkey, however, did result in the discovery of an object that Argo believed to be an ASP baton. Because Wilkey refused to confirm or deny Argo\u2019s accusation, but instead claimed that he had a right to carry the object and placed it back into his pocket after briefly displaying it, Argo was justified in taking some form of investigatory action to determine whether his suspicion about the object was correct. But we believe that a jury could reasonably conclude that Argo\u2019s actual reaction to Wilkey\u2019s placing the flashlight back into his pocket was not an objectively reasonable response. <em>Santos, </em>287 F.3d at 854 (holding that where the plaintiffs evidence supported a finding that the defendants had applied force to restrain him, \u201cthe jury must determine not only whether the officers were justified in using force at all, but, if so, whether the degree of force actually used was reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">This court has recognized that even where some degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. <em>Phelps v. Coy, </em>286 F.3d 295, 297, 301-02 (6th Cir.2002) (recognizing the necessity of analyzing Officer Coy\u2019s use of force against Phelps \u201cin segments\u201d where Coy arrested Phelps, placed him in handcuffs, took him to the police station for booking, and then beat him after he raised his leg in a manner that Coy perceived to be a threat to another police officer); <em>Santos, </em>287 F.3d at 853 (explaining that \u201ceven where some force is justified, the amount actually used may be excessive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Applying the above principle to the present case, Wilkey\u2019s account of his encounter with Argo, when viewed in the light most favorable to him, would permit a jury to conclude that Argo\u2019s reaction to Wilkey\u2019s placing the flashlight back into his pocket constituted the gratuitous application of force, rather than an objectively reasonable response to Wilkey\u2019s conduct. A jury could reasonably find that Argo\u2019s actions were neither commensurate with the threat that Wilkey presented nor consistent with a desire to determine whether Wilkey was indeed carrying an ASP baton. In fact, the record does not indicate whether Argo ever removed the flashlight from Wilkey\u2019s pocket to assess whether it was a dangerous weapon. Argo instead forced Wilkey\u2019s head, neck, and shoulders onto the hood of Cranfield\u2019s Jeep and then immobilized Wilkey by applying a forearm beneath his chin. This restraint lasted about 20 seconds, during which time Argo told Wilkey that he needed to go home, calm down, and work matters out with his wife. These instructions had no relationship to any danger that Wilkey might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>presented to either Argo or Cranfield. Nor did these comments relate to Wilkey\u2019s possession of an object that Argo thought might be an ASP baton.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the record in the present case, when viewed in the light most favorable to Wilkey, would permit a jury to find that Argo used excessive force against Wilkey in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. The district court therefore erred in concluding as a matter of law that Argo\u2019s use of force was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Our decision does not, however, prevent the district court from considering on remand whether Argo was entitled to qualified immunity, an affirmative defense that Argo raised as an alternative basis for summary judgment. The district court did not address the availability of qualified immunity and the parties did not brief the issue on appeal. We therefore decline to rule on whether Argo was entitled to qualified immunity. Nevertheless, we believe that a few remarks on the availability of qualified immunity in the present case would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\u201cQualified immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). To overcome an officer\u2019s claim of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must establish (1) that the facts alleged demonstrate that \u201cthe officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. The latter inquiry, which is necessary only if the plaintiffs allegations establish the violation of a constitutional right, involves a determination of \u201cwhether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Despite the linguistic similarity between the \u201cobjective reasonableness standard\u201d for evaluating excessive force claims, on the one hand, and the \u201creasonable officer\u201d inquiry involved in the qualified immunity analysis, on the other, the two standards are not coterminous. <em>Id. </em>at 202-04 (rejecting the position, which was based upon a belief that \u201cqualified immunity is merely duplicative in an excessive force case,\u201d that qualified immunity is not available if a material issue of fact exists as to an excessive force claim). Unlike the former question,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-8\">[t]he qualified immunity inquiry, on the other hand, has a further dimension. The concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct. It is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts. An officer might correctly perceive all of the relevant facts but have a mistaken understanding as to whether a particular amount of force is legal in those circumstances. If the officer\u2019s mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable, however, the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 204. This distinction between the \u201cobjective reasonableness standard\u201d and the qualified immunity inquiry exists so as to \u201cprotect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force and to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">As noted above, we express no opinion as to whether Argo would be entitled to qualified immunity. The district court, however, is not precluded from considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>that issue on remand as an alternative to conducting a trial on the merits of Wilkey\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
