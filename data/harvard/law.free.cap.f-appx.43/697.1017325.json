Fisher\u2019s affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact with respect to counsel\u2019s advice regarding the contested matters. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Accordingly, a hearing was required to resolve the credibility disputes created by the parties\u2019 conflicting affidavits. Rule 8, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings; <em>Davis v. Zahradnick, </em>600 F.2d 458, 460 (4th Cir.1979); <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1970). The district court did not conduct such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Fisher\u2019s claim relating to the sufficiency of counsel\u2019s advice regarding a guilty plea, the application of the Guidelines, and Fisher\u2019s sentencing exposure. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-13\"> The district court's order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on the docket on September 7, 2001. The court never entered its judgment on a separate document, contrary to the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 58. As a result, the time limit for noting an appeal never began to run. See <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 384-85, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978). We accordingly deem the <em>appeal timely.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
