After pleading guilty, while released on bond, Lynch committed two criminal offenses in Florida, driving under the influence and petit retail theft, pleading guilty to both crimes. The district court denied Lynch an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and sentenced him to 210 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. Lynch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On appeal, Lynch asserts the district court erred in denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility based on his unrelated criminal conduct. The district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility is factual, and we review it with great deference for clear error. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5) (2000); <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Lynch\u2019s claim is meritless; his failure to voluntarily withdraw from criminal conduct establishes the district court did not err in denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Lynch\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
