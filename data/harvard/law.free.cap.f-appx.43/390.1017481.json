Dept. of Defense Dependent Schools, </em>814 F.2d 1549, 1552 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We discern no error in the Board\u2019s decision or in the procedures followed; the decision that Ms. Megatulski had not satisfied the performance criteria was supported by substantial evidence, and comports with the legal requirements for removal on that ground. Ms. Megatulski has not identified any errors in the Board\u2019s rejection of her reprisal or disability discrimination defenses, and we discern none. The Board\u2019s decision is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
