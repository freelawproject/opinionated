In his claim, Ferrer alleged that he was injured by an unnecessary and improperly performed medical procedure conducted while he was in the Green Haven Correctional Facility. The District Court dismissed Ferrer\u2019s claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required under the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The court\u2019s order was issued on September 6, 2001, based upon a decision rendered on the record by Judge Pauley on September 5, 2001.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Santiago Ferrer v. Glenn S. Goord, Commissioner, NYS-DOCS, et al, </em>01-CV-4171 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2001). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b470-19\">The District Court cited a concession in the complaint that Ferrer had failed to exhaust administrative remedies, a fact that Ferrer concedes again on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated on the record by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-14\"> The transcript of the reasons for the dismissal included in the record on appeal is dated December 5, 2001, rather than September 5, 2001. The court presumes this to be a typographical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
