He contends that the district court failed to make sufficient findings prior to enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice, erred in also imposing sentence at the high end of the guideline range based on his obstruction of justice, and increased his sentence based on a finding made by the court and not the jury, in violation of the rule in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">Prior to applying the two-level obstruction enhancement,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the sentencing court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the defendant gave \u201cfalse testimony,\u201d (2) \u201cconcerning a material matter,\u201d and (3) \u201cwith the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). The court\u2019s findings at Kanga\u2019s sentencing clearly satisfy the first and third elements. The court adopted the probation officer\u2019s recommended finding that Kanga \u201cwillfully provided false testimony during his trial.\u201d The court also noted that Kanga denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>being in a Social Security office assisting others to obtain documents, when \u201cat least four witnesses positively identified him as being in social security offices and different offices.\u201d The remaining required finding is that the testimony \u201cconeern[ed] a material matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201cmaterial matter\u201d is one that \u201cwould tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). Where the materiality of perjured testimony is clear as a matter of law, the lack of an explicit finding on materiality does not require remand for additional findings. <em>United States v. Haas, </em>171 F.3d 259, 268 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 372 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The relevant testimony was clearly material. Kanga denied being present in the Social Security offices in spite of the testimony of four Social Security Administration employees identifying him as the person who was present and acting as the leader or interpreter for persons seeking to obtain social security numbers by presenting false documents. Kanga\u2019s testimony, if believed, would have resulted in an acquittal as to counts two through eighteen (aiding and abetting) of the second superceding indictment. This meets the test for materiality. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.6); <em>Romer, </em>148 F.3d at 372. Accordingly, we find that the sentencing court\u2019s findings as to Kanga\u2019s perjury were sufficient under <em>Dunnigan </em>and therefore affirm the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Kanga\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s consideration of his obstruction of justice in determining where, within the applicable guideline range, to impose a sentence is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). Therefore we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Kanga\u2019s last claim is that his sentence was imposed in violation of the rule announced in <em>Apprendi, </em>because the court increased his offense level by six levels based on the court\u2019s findings as to the number of documents involved, rather than submitting the issue to the jury. He argues that the maximum sentence for an offense is that set by the Sentencing Guidelines, and not the statutory maximum. Thus, he asserts that the maximum sentence to which he was exposed under the guidelines was 14 months. <em>See </em>USSG Chapter 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table). However, we recently held that <em>\u201cApprendi </em>does not apply to a judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion within a statutory range, [therefore] the current practice of judicial factfinding under the Guidelines is not subject to the <em>Apprendi </em>requirements \u2014 at least so long as that factfinding does not enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). Kanga contends that our <em>Kinter </em>decision was in error and invites us to reconsider it here. We decline to do so. <em>See United States v. Guglielmi, </em>819 F.2d 451, 457 (4th Cir.1987) (only an en banc court, not a subsequent panel, has authority to over-turn a previous panel\u2019s published decision); <em>Karpel v. Inova Health Sys. Servs., </em>134 F.3d 1222, 1227 (4th Cir.1998) (issue raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered, unless refusal to consider issue would be plain error or result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice). Because Kanga\u2019s thirty-seven month sentence does not exceed the sixty-month statutory maximum, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1002, the sentence was properly determined by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>In conclusion, we dismiss the portion of the appeal in which Kanga challenges the district court\u2019s determination of where, within the applicable guideline range, to impose sentence, and affirm in all other respects. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-14\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
