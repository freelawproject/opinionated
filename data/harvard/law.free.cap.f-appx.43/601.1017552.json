(\u201cToll\u201d), and (2) Toll\u2019s claims brought against Ryan. Both requests for arbitration stem from disputes over Ryan\u2019s performance of contracts to construct for Toll a golf course in Ashburn, Virginia. And both requests for arbitration were based on a clause within Article 5 of the construction contracts, pertaining to \u201cMechanics\u2019 Liens and Claims,\u201d which requires arbitration of disputes \u201cfor work performed [for] which payment has not been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">We conclude that, because Ryan\u2019s claim was for work performed on the golf course, it fits within Article 5\u2019s arbitration clause. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s first order. But we conclude that Toll\u2019s claims against Ryan are not arbitrable because we construe the clause to apply only to claims held by Ryan against Toll. Therefore, we affirm the second order.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Toll, a Pennsylvania corporation, hired Ryan, a Florida corporation, in 1999 to construct a golf course at the Belmont Country Club in Ashburn, Virginia. The scope of Ryan\u2019s work was defined by three contracts, referred to as \u201cthe Golf Course Contract,\u201d \u201cthe Earthwork Contract,\u201d and \u201cthe Landbay H-l Contract.\u201d And for this work, Toll agreed to pay Ryan a total lump sum of approximately $17.6 million plus compensation for any design changes initiated by Toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">All three of the contracts between Ryan and Toll contained a clause in \u201cArticle 5. Mechanics\u2019 Liens and Claims,\u201d providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">No liens will be filed for work not performed, or for work that the Subcontractor [Ryan] has received payment. Furthermore, no lien will be filed for disputed amounts without providing the Contractor [Toll] and the Subcontractor [Ryan] a 30 day period in which to reasonably try to resolve the dispute. If after this resolution period the disputed amount is not resolved, then the Subcontractor may file a lien for the disputed amounts for work performed which payment has not been made. <em>The Contrae</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>tor [Toll] and Subcontractor [Ryan] agree that any nonpaid disputed amounts will then be arbitrated, and both parties agree to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator. </em>Should the Contractor [Toll] prevail in the arbitration, the Subcontractor [Ryan] will promptly release any liens previously filed relating to the unpaid, disputed amounts. Should the Subcontractor [Ryan] prevail in the arbitration, the Subcontractor [Ryan] shall promptly release any liens previously filed relating to the unpaid disputed amounts upon receipt of payment for amounts determined by the arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">(Emphasis added). This clause represents the parties\u2019 only contemplation of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The project took longer than expected, and, not unexpectedly, there were a number of changes initiated by Toll. Although the contracts required Ryan\u2019s price for changes to be negotiated before Ryan commenced work on them, the parties were unable to reach a quick agreement, and Ryan undertook the work on the changes without an agreed-upon price. Then, at the end of the project, on July 27, 2001, Ryan submitted a claim for over $10 million for the work performed pursuant to Toll\u2019s changes. The claim included 19 previously submitted change orders that had yet to be resolved, totaling $1.6 million, as well as a request for additional compensation due to Toll\u2019s alleged design and survey errors and alleged interference by Toll in Ryan\u2019s performance of the work, totaling over $8.7 million (\u201cRyan\u2019s delay and interference claim\u201d). Ryan alleged that Toll\u2019s actions forced Ryan to perform work out of sequence, requiring Ryan to maintain labor and equipment on the project for an extra 215 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Ryan and Toll failed to settle Ryan\u2019s claims, in part because Toll maintained that Ryan\u2019s claims violated the contracts\u2019 \u201cNo-Damage-for-Delay\u201d clause, which provided that Ryan\u2019s sole remedy for delay was an extension of time for performance and an accompanying reduction in the liquidated damages Toll could assess. Ryan accordingly sought arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in Article 5 of the contracts. Initially, Toll agreed to an arbitration that was to be held in September 2001 and suggested using the interim period pending arbitration to discuss settlement. When settlement discussions foundered, however, Toll took the position that only the 19 change order requests submitted before July 27, 2001 were arbitrable and that Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Thus, Ryan commenced this action under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 to compel arbitration of its delay and interference claim. The district court denied Ryan\u2019s claim on the ground that Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim was a claim for consequential damages and therefore did not fall within the class of arbitrable claims, which was limited to claims for work performed for which Ryan had not yet received payment. Ryan\u2019s first appeal is from the district court\u2019s order denying arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Shortly thereafter, Toll commenced an independent action against Ryan, seeking liquidated damages for delay, damages for alleged defects in Ryan\u2019s work, and a declaratory judgment that Ryan\u2019s claims were contractually barred. Ryan moved to dismiss this action or to stay it, again seeking to have Toll\u2019s claim arbitrated by virtue of Article 5. The district court also denied this motion, ruling that Toll\u2019s claims did not involve compensation due to Ryan for work performed. Ryan\u2019s second appeal is from this order. Ryan\u2019s two appeals were then consolidated in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we now reverse the order in the first appeal and affirm the order in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The arbitrability of Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim and Toll\u2019s delay claims against Ryan are \u201cmatter[s] of contract interpretation.\u201d <em>Am. Recovery Corp. v. Computerized Thermal Imaging Inc., </em>96 F.3d 88, 92 (4th Cir.1996). \u201c[S]inee contract interpretation is a question of law,\u201d our review of \u201cthe district court\u2019s conclusions [is] <em>de novo.\u201d Hendricks v. Cent. Reserve Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 507, 512 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">To determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate these claims, we begin with the language of Article 5, the central portion of which reads, \u201cThe Contractor and Subcontractor agree that any nonpaid disputed amounts will <em>then </em>be arbitrated.\u201d (Emphasis added). The word \u201cthen\u201d refers to the end of a progression that is initiated by a \u201c30 day period in which to reasonably try to resolve the dispute\u201d and is followed by an opportunity for Ryan to \u201cfile a lien for the disputed amounts for work performed which payment has not been made.\u201d Completing this progression, it becomes clear that the parties intended to arbitrate only claims that could not be resolved through negotiation, for <em>\u201cdisputed amounts for work performed </em>which payment has not been made.\u201d (Emphasis added). Our focus, therefore, must be directed to whether the claims in this case fall within that class of disputes, as only those are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The district court followed the same reasoning and found a distinction between Ryan\u2019s first 19 change order claims, which it concluded fell \u201csquarely ... within the arbitration clause,\u201d and Ryan\u2019s claim for delay and interference, which it concluded fell outside that clause\u2019s scope. We are, however, unable to find support under Virginia law for this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Virginia law would treat Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim as one for an \u201cunpaid disputed amount,\u201d and it would not distinguish that claim from Ryan\u2019s other change order claims. Despite the fact that Ryan\u2019s alleged damages were a consequence of Toll\u2019s alleged breach of contract \u2014 i.e., Toll\u2019s alleged errors and interference \u2014 they are not classified under Virginia law as \u201cconsequential damages.\u201d Unlike consequential damages, which \u201carise from the intervention of \u2018special circumstances\u2019 not ordinarily predictable,\u201d Ryan\u2019s claimed damages were alleged simply to be the extra costs for labor and equipment brought on by having to perform work out of sequence and thus were the \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d result of Toll\u2019s alleged breach of contract. <em>Roanoke Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc., </em>215 Va. 796, 214 S.E.2d 155, 160 (Va. 1975); <em>see also R.K. Chevrolet, Inc. v. Hayden, </em>253 Va. 50, 480 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Va.1997); <em>Morris v. Mosby, </em>227 Va. 517, 317 S.E.2d 493, 497 (Va.1984). Indeed, Virginia law expressly treats \u201cextended financing costs,\u201d brought on by \u201cdelay in completion\u201d of large contracts, as direct damages. <em>Roanoke Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>214 S.E.2d at 160-61. As such, Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim is no different than any other claim for a \u201cdisputed amountf ] for work performed which payment has not been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">We therefore hold that Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim falls within the class of claims contemplated by Article 5 and therefore is arbitrable. In so concluding, however, we do not imply, one way or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>other, whether the claims are permitted by the contract or justified by the facts. Those issues should be resolved in the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Unlike Ryan\u2019s delay and interference claim, however, Toll\u2019s claims against Ryan cannot be characterized as claims for \u201cdisputed amounts for work performed which payment has not been made,\u201d and therefore they fall outside the scope of Article 5. To begin with, Toll\u2019s claims are in the nature of a refund of payment; Toll did not perform any work for which it had to be paid. Moreover, Article 5 sets forth a progression for Ryan as the contractor to follow when it has a claim against the owner Toll.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no suggestion in Article 5 \u2014 or anywhere else in the contracts \u2014 that the same progression applies when Toll, as the owner, has a claim against the Ryan as the contractor. As Article 5 applies only to claims by the contractor against the owner, Toll\u2019s claims against Ryan are clearly outside Article 5\u2019s scope. Accordingly, even to the extent that Toll\u2019s claims are preemptive defenses to Ryan\u2019s claims, there is no basis in the contracts for concluding that the parties intended for those claims to be resolved by arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Ryan\u2019s petition to compel arbitration of its delay and interference claim, but was correct in denying Ryan\u2019s motion to stay litigation of Toll\u2019s claims pending arbitration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">No. <em>01-2509 </em>\u2014 REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">No. <em>02-1147 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">. The contract actually refers to Toll as the contractor and Ryan as the subcontractor. But for contractual purposes, they are functioning as owner and contractor, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-14\">. As the Declaration of Reza Nikain, PE, PMP, is not relevant to our analysis, we deny as moot Ryan\u2019s March 19, 2002 Motion to Correct Record on Appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b633-10\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">I concur in the resolution of No. 02-1147, affirming the district court\u2019s order denying Ryan\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Toll\u2019s claims, for the reasons stated by the majority. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s resolution of No. 01-2509, reversing the district court\u2019s order denying Ryan\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of its \u201cdelay and interference claim.\u201d I would affirm the district court. The majority is correct that the \u201cdelay and interference claim\u201d is a claim for direct, not consequential damages. But I believe that the arbitration clause was intended to resolve disputes over amounts due for work performed, not damage claims arising from breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">As the majority apparently recognizes, at least a portion of Ryan\u2019s claim is for breach of contract. To be sure, Ryan also argues (confusingly) that the contract was somehow modified by Toll\u2019s \u201cdelay and interference.\u201d But, ultimately, Ryan\u2019s claim is that Toll breached the contract by violating its contractual \u201cduty to cooperate and not to interfere with, hinder, or prevent Ryan\u2019s performance.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 9. This breach, Ryan argues, gives rise to a legal claim for direct damages, measured by increased expenses as well as lost profits. J.A. 526-608.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">The majority also appears to recognize that the arbitration clause relates to claims that could be enforced by a mechanic\u2019s lien. The clause requires a thirty day negotiation period, after which, if the disputed amount for work performed is not paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Ryan may file a lien. Under Virginia law, \u201c[a]lthough [ ] a lien is a creature of statute, the lien must have its foundation in a contract, with which the lien must correspond.\u201d <em>First American Bank of Virginia v. J.S.C. Concrete Construction, Inc., </em>259 Va. 60, 523 S.E.2d 496, 497 (Va.2000); <em>Sergeant v. Denby, </em>87 Va. 206, 12 S.E. 402, 402 (Va.1890). A mechanic\u2019s hen is a statutory mechanism to enforce an owner\u2019s obligation to pay the agreed upon price. <em>See </em>12B Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence, <em>Mechanic\u2019s Liens </em>\u00a7 28 (1992 &amp; 2001 Supp.) (\u201cThe lien of a contractor is for the contract price or other compensation agreed upon.\u201d). A mechanic\u2019s hen is not the equivalent of a common law suit for breach of contract. \u201c[T]he object of the [mechanic\u2019s hen statute] is to give those who, by their labor and material, have enhanced the value of the building the security of a hen thereon to the extent they have added to its value[.]\u201d <em>United Masonry, Inc. v. Jefferson Mews, Inc., </em>218 Va. 360, 237 S.E.2d 171, 182 (Va.1977). In contrast, Ryan\u2019s breach of contract claim is for costs, incurred by Ryan, associated with Toll's alleged interference with Ryan\u2019s contractual performance. The claim is not for value-enhancing \u201cwork performed\u201d of the type that would give rise to a mechanic\u2019s hen, but rather for damages resulting from Ryan\u2019s inability to perform work. Because Ryan claims that it was damaged by Toll\u2019s delay and interference, and is not simply seeking to enforce Toh\u2019s promise to pay the agreed upon price, the district court was correct in holding that the claim was not arbitrable<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">I concur in the resolution of No. 02-1147. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s decision, in No. 01-2509, to reverse the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\"> As the above indicates, the distinction between direct and consequential damages is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
