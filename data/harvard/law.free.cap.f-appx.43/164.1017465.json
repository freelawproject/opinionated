Barber Gems, Inc. (\u201cBarber\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Brink\u2019s Diamond <em>&amp; </em>Jewelry North America, et al., (\u201cBrink\u2019s\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">Barber contends the district court erred in finding that Jodhani\u2019s alleged conversion of diamonds was not the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Brink\u2019s delivery of the diamonds without first collecting payment. As a preliminary matter, the district court correctly held that the agreement between Barber and Brink\u2019s was a carriage contract, not a C.O.D. contract. <em>See Cermetek, Inc. v. Butler Avpak, Inc., </em>573 F.2d 1370, 1382 (9th Cir.1978). Under a C.O.D. contract, a carrier must strictly comply with its duty to collect, and is liable to the shipper for loss or damage caused by its failure to collect the price before delivery. <em>See </em>13 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 489 (2000). However, carriers under a general carriage contract have no duty to act as a collection agent; instead, they are bound by common law duties, including duties to receive, transport, care for, and deliver goods. <em>Cermetek, </em>573 F.2d at 1375; <em>see also </em>4 Witkin, Summary of California Law: Personal Property \u00a7 134 (9th ed.1987) (common carrier or bailee under the lesser standard of ordinary care). In the context of carriage contracts, consequential damages for misdelivery are recoverable only when they are the natural and probable consequence of the carrier\u2019s breach of contract. <em>See Contempo Metal Furniture Co. v. East Tex. Motor Freight Lines, Inc., </em>661 F.2d 761, 765 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">In actions for breach of contract, it is essential to establish a causal connection between the breach and the damages sought. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3300. \u201cProximate cause is that cause which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>injury [or damage complained of] and without which such result would not have occurred.\u201d <em>State of California v.Super. Ct., </em>150 Cal.App.3d 848, 857, 197 Cal.Rptr. 914 (1984) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The district court concluded, and we agree, that Brink\u2019s failure to confirm payment was not the proximate cause of the loss suffered by Barber because Jodhani\u2019s alleged tort of conversion was an intervening event sufficient to break the chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Barber nevertheless argues that this case presents a simple chain-of-causation scenario. At most, however, Brink\u2019s breach amounts to a \u201cbut for\u201d cause for the loss, which is not determinative of proximate cause. As the district court correctly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">For Plaintiffs loss to have been the proximate cause of Brink\u2019s breach, it must have been foreseeable that: (a) Jodhani would refuse to pay for the goods on the basis o[f] their non-conformity to the invoice; (b) Plaintiff would enter into a settlement acknowledging the non-conformity and extinguishing Jodhani\u2019s obligation to pay for the goods; (c) in lieu of returning the goods pursuant to the settlement, Jodhani would substitute inferior diamonds of lesser quantity. While Plaintiff is correct that Brink\u2019s failure to comply with the shipping instructions \u201cset the stage\u201d for what followed, it cannot be said that this concatenation of events was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Brink\u2019s failure to follow such instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">While the issue whether an intervening force is superseding is often a question of fact for the jury to decide, \u201clike proximate cause generally, it is a matter of law where only one reasonable conclusion may be reached.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Teano, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1035, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 348 (1995). Therefore,-the district court correctly concluded the such alleged conduct was not reasonably foreseeable to Brink\u2019s at the time it entered into contract, and that it broke the chain of causation between Brink\u2019s act and Barber\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Barber next argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the written contract between the parties did not create an insured/insurer relationship. However, the express agreement between Barber and Brink\u2019s belies this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACk\">Brink\u2019s is not an insurer hereunder. Brink\u2019s shall obtain and maintain, at all times during its performance of this contract, insurance payable to Brink\u2019s in such amounts and against such risks as shall adequately cover the liability assumed by Brink\u2019s under the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT4\">The terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous. Plaintiffs alleged belief regarding insurance is immaterial, as \u201c[a] party\u2019s subjective expectations as to policy coverage are irrelevant in determining whether an insurance policy is ambiguous.\u201d Justice H. Walter Croskey, Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, et al., California Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation \u00a7 4:118.5 (Rutter Group 2001) (citing <em>Havstad v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>58 Cal.App.4th 654, 661, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d 487 (1997)). Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Brink\u2019s on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Given our resolution of these issues, we need not address any of the other arguments raised by Barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b193-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b194-12\">BERZON,</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">First, I am not at all sure that there was not a C.O.D. agreement between the parties. C.O.D. stands for \u201ccollect on delivery.\u201d <em>See </em>Blacks Law Dictionary (6th ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>1991) (\u201cThese letters import the carrier\u2019s liability to the consignor to collect the cost of the goods from the consignee, and, if not collected, to return the goods to the consignor.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Oxford English Dictionary (2d Ed. 1989). Even though C.O.D. delivery generally requires a turning over of cash or a check to the carrier, in today\u2019s world it makes sense to treat a contract requiring the collection of proof of a wire transfer as analogous to a C.O.D. contract. There is no substantial difference between collecting a check, which is simply a piece of paper telling a bank to give someone money, and collecting a piece of paper confirming an electronic payment that has already occurred. The fundamental purpose of the transaction here is the same as in any C.O.D. agreement \u2014 to assign to the carrier not only the task of delivery but also the task of assuring that the product is paid for before it is placed in the hands of the customer. The precise manner in which that payment is to be made should not matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In any event, I do not see why it matters whether there was a C.O.D. contract with Brink\u2019s. Whatever kind of contract it was, there is no dispute that it was breached when Brink\u2019s negligently failed to assure the wire transfer of the money before allowing the customer to retain the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The majority argues that the damage resulting from Brink\u2019s breach of its contract with L. Barber Gems was not foreseeable. This is contrary to the facts. Barber specifically contracted with Brink\u2019s to confirm payment prior to delivery for the very reason that he feared nonpayment by the recipient. That a customer who is not required to pay before accepting the goods might never pay at all is precisely why sellers insist on payment before delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In contrast to the majority, I see Barber\u2019s injury as occurring at the moment the delivery took place without confirmation of payment, rather than when Jodhani much later substituted inferior diamonds for the original ones delivered by Barber. The unlikely chain of events that concerns the majority was simply Barber\u2019s attempt to mitigate his damages. Barber was under an obligation to mitigate his damages. If he had failed to do so, his damages would have been reduced accordingly. <em>See, e.g., Spurgeon v. Drumheller, </em>174 Cal.App.3d 659, 220 Cal.Rptr. 195 (1985). That Barber\u2019s mitigation effort went astray should not affect Brink\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Brink\u2019s breached its contract and damages were foreseeable. I would therefore reverse the District Court and allow Barber\u2019s case to proceed. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
