We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-23\">Javier-Lopez first contends that the district court erred by including criminal history points based on prior state convictions where a court certified interpreter was not used during attorney-client meetings. Because Javier-Lopez\u2019 challenge to his prior convictions is not based on a claim of a failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant, <em>see Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), he cannot collaterally attack his prior convictions on this ground. <em>See Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 490-97, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994) (holding that a defendant has no right to collaterally attack his prior convictions in federal sentencing proceedings, unless it is based on the denial of his right to have appointed counsel); <em>United States v. Ricardo, </em>78 F.3d 1411, 1417 (9th Cir.1996) (recognizing that the <em>Custis </em>holding applies in cases involving sentence enhancements under the federal Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Javier-Lopez also contends that the court erred under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by sentencing him in excess of the statutory maximum sentence for \u00a7 1326(a), based on a prior conviction not alleged in the indictment. As Javier-Lopez concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001) (recognizing that <em>\u201call </em>prior convictions \u2014 not just those admitted on the record \u2014 were exempt from <em>Apprendi </em>\u2019s general rule and, under <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>may continue to be treated as sentencing factors\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b144-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
