For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court and remand the case to the Commissioner for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite here only those necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">All of Ter-Oganova\u2019s four treating and examining mental health specialists and two of her treating general practitioners found that she suffered from mental impairments. The ALJ\u2019s decision to reject the uncontroverted medical opinions of Ter-Oganova\u2019s physicians is not supported by \u201cclear and convincing reasons.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">The ALJ rejected the evaluation of Dr. Jones because he found Dr. Jones\u2019 conclusion that Ter-Oganova was depressed to be internally \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the evidence in Dr. Jones\u2019 report, but failed to identify a specific inconsistency which would constitute a clear and convincing reason for rejecting the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">The ALJ also impermissibly rejected Dr. Vintas\u2019 diagnosis of major, recurrent depression because that conclusion was (1) not supported by \u201cpositive objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tive findings,\u201d and (2) inconsistent with Dr. Vintas\u2019 conclusion that Ter-Oganova was a poor and vague historian. These are not \u201cclear and convincing reasons\u201d because (1) the ALJ may not reject Dr. Vintas\u2019 diagnosis of mental illness solely for lack of objective findings, <em>see Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 421 (9th Cir.1988), and (2) the ALJ did not give clear and convincing reasons for finding inconsistent Dr. Vintas\u2019 conclusions that Ter-Oganova was both depressed and a poor and vague historian. Indeed, a poor memory is often a symptom of depression. <em>Cf. Polny v. Bowen </em>864 F.2d 661, 664 (9th Cir.1988) (noting that impaired claimants will necessarily appear non-credible due to impairment, and urging careful distinction between faked complaints and \u201cphysical and psychological conditions beyond [a claimant\u2019s] control\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Finally, the ALJ rejected the opinion of Dr. Van Zak because he only treated Ter-Oganova once and never made any effort to follow-up with the patient. The ALJ did not explain why this was a reason for rejecting Dr. Van Zak\u2019s otherwise supported diagnosis that Ter-Oganova suffered from serious mental and physical impairments. \u201cParticularly in a case where the medical opinions of the physicians differ so markedly from the ALJ\u2019s, it is incumbent on the ALJ to provide, detailed, reasoned, and legitimate rationales for disregarding the physicians\u2019 findings.\u201d <em>Embrey, </em>849 F.2d at 422. The ALJ failed to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The ALJ also erred by rejecting the opinions of Ter-Oganova\u2019s physicians solely on the basis of the non-examining medical advisor\u2019s testimony, because no evidence in the record supported the medical advisor\u2019s opinion. \u201cIn the absence of record evidence to support it, the nonexamining medical advisor\u2019s testimony does not by itself constitute substantial evidence that warrants a rejection of either the treating doctor\u2019s or the examining psychologist\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is also not supported by clear and convincing reasons. <em>See id. </em>at 834. The ALJ disbelieved Ter-Oganova\u2019s testimony because she (1) provided inconsistent information concerning the date she last worked; (2) was a poor historian; and (3) was not receiving continuous treatment for her mental problems. The ALJ did not, however, explain why these characteristics justify rejecting Ter-Oganova\u2019s testimony that she suffered from mental impairments-testimony that was supported by all of her physicians. Because the ALJ has not provided \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the disbelief,\u201d <em>Rashad v. Sullivan, </em>903 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir.1990), it was legal error for the ALJ to discredit Ter-Oganova\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The ALJ also committed legal error by relying on the vocational expert\u2019s opinion because that opinion was based on legally inadequate hypothetical questions. To be legally relevant, hypothetical questions must \u201cset out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant.\u201d <em>Embrey, </em>849 F.2d at 422 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf the record does not support the assumptions in the hypothetical, the vocational expert\u2019s opinion has no evidentiary value.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 517 (9th Cir.2001). The ALJ\u2019s hypotheticals included only <em>physical </em>limitations but did not include any of the <em>mental </em>limitations diagnosed by Ter-Oganova\u2019s examining and treating physicians. These hypotheticals were, therefore, legally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED, and this case is REMANDED with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for a new hearing so that Ter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Oganova can pursue her claim for SSI benefits based on mental disability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\"> The Honorable Anthony W. Ishii, District Judge for the Eastern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>See Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir. 2001). The decision of the Commissioner must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>See Pagter v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001). \"The court must consider both evidence that supports and evidence that detracts from the ALJ's conclusion; it may not affirm simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 993, 995 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
