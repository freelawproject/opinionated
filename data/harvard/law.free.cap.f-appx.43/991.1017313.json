He now argues that his sentence is so extreme given the lack of seriousness of his criminal history that it violates the Eighth Amendment. He alleges that most of the prior offenses underlying the district court\u2019s placing him in criminal history category VI were for minor traffic offenses (driving with a revoked license) or for minor drug charges (possession of drug paraphernalia or marijuana). But sentences prescribed under the sentencing guidelines and within the statutory maximum (here, life imprisonment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)) generally are not considered to be \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>973 F.2d 1354, 1365 (7th Cir.1992). Branch\u2019s case is not exceptional. <em>E.g., United States v. Cavender, </em>228 F.3d 792, 803 (7th Cir.2000) (420-month sentence for various crack-cocaine offenses); <em>Saunders, </em>973 F.2d at 1365 (2621-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute thirteen ounces (360 grams) of cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-19\">Branch\u2019s only other argument is that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. We lack jurisdiction to consider this challenge, however, because the district court was not operating under the mistaken belief that it lacked the discretion to depart. <em>See United States v. Zaragoza, </em>117 F.3d 342, 345-46 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
