This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">The circumstances underlying this bankruptcy appeal are adequately set forth in the bankruptcy court\u2019s March 2, 2001, order and will be reiterated herein only to the extent necessary to resolve this appeal. On June 9,1999, the Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee was ordered to sell the residential property in question, which was co-owned by Marve and his ex-wife, subject to, <em>inter alia, </em>Marve\u2019s $16,150.00 exemption in the property. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(1). The trustee -listed the home for sale with realtor Diane Burdgiek. On March 9, 2000, Marve was ordered to vacate the home by no later than March 13, 2000, because he was interfering with the trustee\u2019s ability to sell the property. In May 2000, the trustee approved a proposed sale of the home. The bankruptcy court approved that sale by order of June 15, 2000. The sale was completed on June 30, 2000, generating a net return of $38,050.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">On July 18, 2000, Marve filed a motion for disbursement of his $16,150.00 exempt share of the net proceeds. The trustee countered that the bankruptcy court should surcharge Marve\u2019s exempt share for the debts the bankruptcy estate incurred from Marve\u2019s post-petition conduct in delaying the sale of the home. The bankruptcy court found that Marve intentionally misrepresented conditions of the home to potential purchasers on December 19,1999, in an effort to prevent the trustee from selling the home, violating the duty of the debtor under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(3) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>\u201ccooperate with the trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the trustee\u2019s duties under this title.\u201d The bankruptcy court also determined that Marve\u2019s failure to cooperate continued to impede the trustee\u2019s efforts to sell the home for another 86 days, until March 13, 2000, when Marve moved out of the home under court order. The bankruptcy court found that the trustee incurred total additional carrying costs over the 86-day period of $1,689.85. The bankruptcy court erred in its original calculation. The calculation actually yields a result of $1,649.48. The bankruptcy court also honored an August 29, 2000 state court order entered in the divorce proceedings which required Marve vis-a-vis the trustee to pay Marve\u2019s ex-wife an additional $6,612.47 share of Marve\u2019s exemption. The bankruptcy court ordered the trustee to disburse $7,847.68 to Marve, calculated as the $16,150.00 exemption, less the $1,689.85 surcharge, less $6,612.47 to be paid to Marve\u2019s ex-wife pursuant to the state court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, in part, as to the finding that Marve should be surcharged for interfering with the trustee\u2019s duty to sell the property. However, the district court reversed, in part, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the extent that the bankruptcy court found that Marve misrepresented the home\u2019s condition on December 19, 1999. The district court held that neither the record, Burdgick\u2019s testimony, nor other record evidence support a finding that Marve made any type of representation on December 19, 1999. The court decreased the surcharge amount from $1,689.85 to $1,515.22 (based on a 79-day delay from December 26, 1999 to March 13, 2000). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determinations of law made in reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>See Investors Credit Corp. v. Batie (In re Batie), </em>995 F.2d 85, 88 (6th Cir.1993). The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Mfr. \u2019s Hanover Trust v. Ward (In re Ward), </em>857 F.2d 1082, 1083 (6th Cir.1988). \u201c\u2018A finding [of fact] is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Upon review, this court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that the bankruptcy court was mistaken in finding that Marve intentionally failed to cooperate with the trustee\u2019s efforts to sell the Otis-ville home. The Bankruptcy Code specifically provides that the role of the debtor is to cooperate with the trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform his duties. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(3). A bankruptcy court may sanction a debtor for violating the debtor\u2019s statutory duty to cooperate with the trustee. <em>See In re Stinson, </em>221 B.R. 726, 729 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1998) (citing <em>Mapother &amp; Mapother, P.S.C. v. Cooper (In re Downs), </em>103 F.3d 472, 477 (6th Cir.1996)); <em>In re Swanson, </em>207 B.R. 76, 80 (Bankr.D.N.J.1997). Here, Realtor Burdgick\u2019s testimony established that, in December 1999, Marve stopped cooperating with the trustee by failing to return repeated telephone calls and failing to appear for scheduled home inspections. Burdgick specifically testified that, from December 26, 1999 until after Marve moved out of the home on March 13, 2000, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have access at all to the house.\u201d When considering whether findings of fact should be set aside, \u201cdue regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>nesses.\u201d Fed. R. Bank. P. 8013. Given the foregoing, we conclude that ample evidence supports the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Marve violated his duty to cooperate with the trustee from December 26,1999 to March 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order affirming in part, and reversing in part, the bankruptcy court\u2019s March 2, 2001 order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
