Henson was sentenced to 235 months incarceration and four years supervised release. McCormick was sentenced to 168 months incarceration and four years supervised release. Marine was sentenced to 70 months incarceration and four years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-25\">On appeal, the Appellants argue the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence obtained from a search of a residence in Baltimore, Maryland. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on a suppression motion de novo, and the court\u2019s underlying factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). The Appellants\u2019 challenge is meritless; the district court did not err in concluding the search warrant application, viewed under the appropriate standard, established probable cause to issue a search warrant for the residence. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988); <em>United States v. Walton, </em>56 F.3d 551, 554-56 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-26\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Appellants\u2019 suppres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>sion motions, and we affirm the Appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
