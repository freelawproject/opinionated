Martin, <em>Judge). </em>D\u2019Amato sought relief from a final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security finding him not disabled during the eighteen month period from March 24, 1995 to September 24, 1996 and denying his application for Social Security Act benefits during that period. On appeal, D\u2019Amato again challenges the Commissioner\u2019s decision claiming that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) demonstrated bias by offering a settlement before the hearing and that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-19\">This Court affirms the district court\u2019s denial of D\u2019Amato\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and grant of the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for substantially the reasons stated by the district court. We further affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ\u2019s refusal to recuse did not violate D\u2019Amato\u2019s Due Process rights, finding no evidence of bias in the ALJ\u2019s offer of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
