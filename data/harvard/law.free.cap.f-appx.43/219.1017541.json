R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Kevin Charles Gwinn, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in order to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. Because he fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we deny his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Mr. Gwinn pleaded guilty to drug possession charges on January 1, 1997 and was sentenced to three years of probation. He was also given a three-year term of post-sentence \u201cmandatory parole\u201d as required by statute in Colorado. In April 1998, Mr. Gwinn\u2019s probation was revoked, the result being that he was required to finish serving his three-year sentence in prison. Mr. Gwinn, given credit for the portion of his sentence served prior to April 1998, served the remainder of his sentence. He was subsequently released on mandatory parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">While on his conditional release Mr. Gwinn failed a urinalysis test. As a result, he was re-incarcerated under the terms of Colorado\u2019s mandatory parole scheme. After having served two of his three years of mandatory parole, Mr. Gwinn filed this petition challenging the constitutionality of his re-incarceration. The district court denied Mr. Gwinn\u2019s request and subsequently denied him a COA, and Mr. Gwinn now seeks to appeal those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">As an initial matter we note that although both Mr. Gwinn and the district court treated his habeas corpus petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition, because Mr. Gwinn is challenging the implementation of his sentence rather than the validity of the underlying conviction, his petition is properly characterized as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir.2000). In order for Mr. Gwinn, a state prisoner, to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, he must obtain a COA. <em>See id. </em>at 868-69. To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Gwinn must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">Because Mr. Gwinn is representing himself on appeal, his pleadings are construed liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). Nevertheless, this panel will not act as Mr. Gwinn\u2019s advocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>by raising arguments not included in his request for a COA. <em>Cf. Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991) (noting that a pro se inmate retains \u201cburden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In his request for a COA, Mr. Gwinn asserts a denial of due process and equal protection, violation of separation of powers, and violation of his plea agreement. Most of these issues are raised without clear connection to his situation. The core of Mr. Gwinn\u2019s argument, however, is ascertainable. He essentially argues that his present incarceration is unconstitutional because his plea agreement limits the total possible term of his incarceration to three years \u2014 the maximum sentence actually imposed by the trial court \u2014 regardless of Colorado\u2019s post-sentence mandatory parole scheme. Mr. Gwinn suggests that because he is now being required to serve up to an additional three years\u2019 incarceration under the revocation of his post-sentence mandatory parole, his continued incarceration violates his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Mr. Gwinn admits he agreed to a sentence of three years of probation with the Department of Corrections to be followed by another three years of mandatory parole upon his completion of the initial three year term. He nevertheless asserts two bases for challenging his re-incarceration, neither of which has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">First, Mr. Gwinn contends that \u201cMandatory Parole was meant to be served outside a prison ... [and re-incarceration for violation of parole can] only [be] for a short period of 180 days or less.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 3. Although re-incarceration is limited to 180 days when the parolee is sent <em>to </em>a \u201ccommunity corrections program,\u201d <em>see </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17-2-103(ll)(b)(II)(B) (1998), a parolee may also be re-incarcerated in a prison for a length up to the full term of the mandatory parole period. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 17-2-103(ll)(b)(II)(A); <em>Martin v. Colorado, </em>27 P.3d 846, 858 (Colo.2001) (\u201cThis new period of confinement is limited only by the [parole] board\u2019s statutory authority, and is not related to the offender\u2019s original sentence to incarceration.\u201d). Therefore, Mr. Gwinn\u2019s argument on this point fails. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Second, Mr. Gwinn argues that the word \u201cparole\u201d means \u201crelease\u201d and therefore that the phrase \u201cmandatory parole\u201d refers to where the parole is to be served \u2014 i.e., that it is mandatory that he serve parole outside of incarceration. This argument, while imaginative, lacks support and misconstrues the nature of parole. Someone convicted of a crime who is paroled is <em>conditionally </em>released from incarceration prior to the completion of his or her sentence. <em>See </em>59 Am.Jur.2d <em>Pardon and Parole </em>\u00a7 6 (1987). Violation of the terms of parole can result in the person\u2019s re-incarceration. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 17-2-103(ll)(b)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Mandatory parole is a system of conditional release mandated by the Colorado legislature that all criminals convicted of class two through six felonies must serve.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-1-105(l)(a)(V)(A) (1998). \u201c[E]ven a prisoner who serves every single day of his or her prison sentence must remain subject to the conditions of parole for the additional mandatory period.\u201d <em>Craig v. Colorado, </em>986 P.2d 951, 958 n. 3 (Colo.1999). Thus, violation of the terms of mandatory pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>role may require that a person be re-incarcerated, even though this results in the parolee being confined after completion of his or her initial sentence. As implicitly acknowledged by the Colorado Supreme Court in <em>Craig, </em>mandatory parole does not mandate that a parolee serve the entire mandatory period outside of incarceration; rather, mandatory parole requires that a parolee\u2019s release after completing his or her initial sentence be conditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Because Mr. Gwinn\u2019s arguments on the topic of mandatory parole are without merit, and because he provides no other basis for asserting a due process, equal protection, or other constitutional claim, his request fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. Therefore, this panel must deny a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In his request for a COA Mr. Gwinn cites 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) in requesting that the court appoint counsel. Section 1915(e) gives the court discretion to appoint counsel to represent indigent petitioners; however, since Mr. Gwinn did not file a request to proceed <em>informa pawperis </em>and because his arguments are without merit, we deny his request for appointed counsel. We also deny Mr. Gwinn\u2019s motion for \u201crelease pending review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we DENY a COA, DENY Mr. Gwinris other motions, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><em>. </em>\"Mandatory parole,\u201d in being imposed by a judge at sentencing rather than by prison officials or other members of the executive branch of government after an inmate\u2019s incarceration has begun, looks more like traditional probation than true parole. Regardless, violation of the terms of parole, probation, or Colorado\u2019s mandatory parole can lead to the re-incarceration of the parolee/probationer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
