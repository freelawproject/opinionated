Bradford was sentenced to 300 months in prison and five years of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">Bradford argues that the district court erred when it interrupted the testimony of a government witness, Christopher Gendreau, and then permitted the Government to recall witness Jeff Hensley in order to lay the appropriate foundation for Hensley\u2019s co-conspirator statements under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Under Fed.R.Evid. 611(a), the district court has broad authority to exercise reasonable control over the interrogation of witnesses and the presentation of evidence. We review the district court\u2019s control over the presentation of witnesses for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Tindle, </em>808 F.2d 319, 328 (4th Cir.1986). We have reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm Bradford\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
