Honorable Susan Oki Mollway, United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Plaintiff-Appellant Wanda Briscoe-King (\u201cBriseoe-King\u201d), formerly employed by the California Department of Corrections (the \u201cCDC\u201d), sued her former supervisors under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they had fired her in retaliation for her having made protected statements. Specifically, she alleges that she was fired for having complained about racial discrimination, and for having reported misuse of state vehicles. The district court denied Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and Defendants timely appealed, arguing that there is no triable issue of fact concerning the causal connection between BriseoeKing\u2019s race discrimination complaints and her firing, and that Defendants are qualifiedly immune from suit on the vehicular misuse retaliation claim. The parties are familiar with the facts and proceedings in the district court, which are recited here only as necessary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">Initially, we examine our jurisdiction to review these issues. Under the collateral order doctrine, we may review the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity, but only to the extent that appellants raise purely legal questions. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <em>Manhattan Beach Police Officers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Manhattan Beach, </em>881 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir.1989). We lack pendent jurisdiction to consider the race discrimination causation issue, as it is not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the qualified immunity issue. <em>See Cunningham v. Gates, </em>229 F.3d 1271, 1285 (9th Cir.2000). The race discrimination issue is not so intertwined with the immunity issue that we must decide the causation issue to decide the immunity issue, and resolution of the latter issue does not necessarily resolve the former. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we review on this appeal only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the denial of qualified immunity, insofar as it presents issues of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We review the denial of qualified immunity <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Briscoe-King. <em>See Moran v. Washington, </em>147 F.3d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1998). Our first inquiry is whether, taken in the light most favorable to Briscoe-King, the facts alleged show Defendants\u2019 conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). If a violation is made out, we ask if the right was clearly established. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Taken in the light most favorable to Briscoe-King, the facts alleged show that Defendants did violate Briscoe-King\u2019s First Amendment right not to be terminated as a government employee \u201cbecause of [her] speech on matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee County, Kan. v. Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. 668, 675, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843(1996). To show a violation of that right, BriscoeKing must demonstrate that her speech was constitutionally protected and that it was a substantial or motivating factor in her termination. <em>See Pool v. Vanrheen, </em>297 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir.2002). If she makes these showings, then Defendants can escape liability by showing that they would have taken the same action even absent the protected speech. <em>See Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. at 675, 116 S.Ct. 2342. We consider on this appeal only the purely legal issue of whether her speech was protected. <em>See Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 148 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). We lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s ruling as to the remaining parts of the test, which involve factual inquiries. <em>See Collins v. Jordan, </em>110 F.3d 1363, 1370 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Briscoe-King\u2019s speech was constitutionally protected if it touched on a matter of public concern and if Briscoe-King\u2019s interest in expressing herself outweighed Defendants\u2019 interest in preventing potential workplace disruption. <em>Moran, </em>147 F.3d at 846. Briscoe-King\u2019s speech touched on \u201cthe misuse of public funds, wastefulness, and inefficiency in managing and operating government entities,\u201d matters of public concern. <em>See Roth v. Veteran\u2019s Admin., </em>856 F.2d 1401, 1405 (9th Cir.1988); <em>see also Chateaubriand v. Gaspard, </em>97 F.3d 1218, 1222-23 (9th Cir.1996). A report written pursuant to an internal investigation is not devoid of First Amendment protection. <em>See Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (citing <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consol. School Disk, </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979)); <em>Chateaubriand, </em>97 F.3d at 1223. Her speech went beyond a \u201cpersonal employment dispute\u201d and was not \u201cprecipitated by adverse actions of [her] supervisors pertaining to [her own] employment.\u201d <em>See Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Briscoe-King\u2019s interest in expressing herself outweighed the CDC\u2019s interest in preventing workplace disruption. This balancing test, first enunciated in <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), presents a legal question. <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1407. Defendants claim that Briscoe-King disrupted the workplace by impairing discipline, eroding relationships premised on loyalty and confidentiality, compromising her job performance, and disrupting office routine. But \u201cit would be absurd to hold that the First Amendment generally authorizes corrupt officials to punish subordinates who blow the whistle simply because the speech somewhat disrupted the office.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1407-08 (quoting <em>Czurlanis v. Albanese, </em>721 F.2d 98, 107 (3d Cir.1983)). Defendants have no legitimate interest in covering up wrongdoing. <em>Johnson v. Multnomah County, </em>48 F.3d 420, 427 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Hyland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Wonder, </em>972 F.2d 1129, 1138 (9th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Briscoe-King\u2019s right not to be terminated for her protected speech was clearly-established before she was fired in 1998. Briscoe-King\u2019s statements clearly concerned matters of public concern, even if made to staff and superiors rather than the general public. <em>See Chateaubriand, </em>97 F.3d at 1223; <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1406. The law was also clear that Briscoe-King\u2019s First Amendment interest in whistleblowing outweighed workplace disruption. <em>See Multnomah County, </em>48 F.3d at 427; <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1407-08. This is \u201cone of those rare instances in which <em>Pickering </em>rights are, despite balancing, clearly established.\u201d <em>Brewster v. Board of Educ. of the Lynwood Unified School Dist., </em>149 F.3d 971, 980 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Bollinger argues that he is nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity because he was not involved in the decision to terminate Briscoe-King. Briscoe-King asserts otherwise. As Briscoe-King\u2019s allegation is taken as true, Bollinger is not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Not all public employees who investigate wrongdoing by other employees will automatically overcome the qualified immunity bar. The results will depend on the particular facts of each case. Taken in the light most favorable to Briscoe-King, the facts here fail to establish entitlement to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-15\">.
