After careful consideration, we affirm the denial of the motion for appointment of counsel, vacate the remainder of the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-23\">On October 11, 2000, while his direct appeal was still pending, Tanner filed a \u201cMotion/Request for Correction of Sentence.\u201d Below the heading of this motion, Tanner noted, \u201cThis is <em>not </em>a petition under 28 U.S.C. 2255[sic].\u201d On November 27, the Government filed a motion to dismiss Tanner\u2019s motion, arguing that the motion should be construed as one under \u00a7 2255. Two days later, in an order dated November 29, the district court denied Tanner\u2019s motion, stating only that \u201c[t]he motion filed by petitioner to correct sentence is without merit and is denied.\u201d On January 9, 2001, this court affirmed Tanner\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-24\">On July 23, Tanner filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion. The Government moved to dismiss, arguing that Tanner\u2019s motion was second or successive and had been filed without proper authorization from this court. Tanner responded, objecting to the characterization of his first motion as one under \u00a7 2255, since the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>failed to explicitly so state in its brief dismissal order. On November 14, the district court denied the motion as successive, finding that it had previously construed Tanner\u2019s first motion as one under \u00a7 2255 \u201cbecause Petitioner had no other avenue for relief from this Court at the time that that motion was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On January 8, 2002, Tanner filed a Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration and a request for appointment of counsel. He contended that (1) the district court was without jurisdiction to rule on a \u00a7 2255 motion while his direct appeal was pending and (2) the district court\u2019s brief order denying his first motion did not state that the motion was construed under \u00a7 2255. On March 5, the district court summarily denied Tanner\u2019s motion, finding that \u201c[e]ach argument in his Request for Reconsideration has been fully addressed previously, and Petitioner raises no new issues or facts that merit reconsideration.\u201d Tanner then timely appealed from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In its November 14, 2001 order, the district court stated that it had previously construed Tanner\u2019s original motion as one under \u00a7 2255. However, a \u00a7 2255 motion should not be heard where a direct appeal is pending, except in exceptional circumstances. <em>Bowen v. Johnston, </em>306 U.S. 19, 26-27, 59 S.Ct. 442, 83 L.Ed. 455 (1939). Neither the district court in any of its orders nor Tanner in his motion presented anything suggesting the existence of any exceptional circumstance warranting deviation from this established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">In addition, the district court\u2019s November 29, 2000 order gave Tanner no notice that his original motion had been construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, and Tanner had explicitly stated in his motion that it was <em>not </em>a \u00a7 2255 motion. Moreover, Tanner did not have an opportunity to respond to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss his original motion, because the district court decided the motion to dismiss two days after receiving it. Further, the district court failed to give notice to Tanner that it intended to recharacterize his motion or to provide an opportunity to object, as required by <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Nonetheless, even if we were to determine that the district court erred in construing Tanner\u2019s first motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, Tanner did not appeal either the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to correct sentence or the court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Instead, Tanner timely appealed from only the denial of his motion for reconsideration. <em>In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 3 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that, in an appeal from a Rule 60(b) denial, the appellate court may not review the merits of the underlying order; it may only review the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">We review the denial of Tanner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Burnley, </em>988 F.2d at 3. Under Rule 60(b), the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final order for the following reasons: (1) excusable' neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; or (6) any other reason justifying relief. An abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion occurs when the court fails or refuses to exercise its discretion or when the court\u2019s exercise of discretion is flawed by an erroneous legal premise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">As discussed above, Tanner\u2019s claims in his motion for reconsideration have some legal and factual support. Nevertheless, the district court did not explicitly address the issues at any time during the proceeding, and we find that the district court\u2019s failure to offer more than a cursory explanation for its decision precludes meaningful appellate review. Thus, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying Tanner\u2019s motion for reconsideration without analyzing his potentially meritorious claims. <em>See James, </em>6 F.3d at 239 (holding abuse of discretion occurs when decision is made arbitrarily).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We, therefore, grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying Tanner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and we remand for further consideration of Tanner\u2019s claims. We express no opinion as to whether Tanner\u2019s claims are either timely raised or meritorious. We affirm the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying Tanner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> We recognize that the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Emmanuel </em>at the time Tanner\u2019s original motion was denied. We express no opinion on whether <em>Emmanuel </em>is retroactively applicable to Tanner\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
