Ferguson\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although Ferguson was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, he has not done so. His attorney raises two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">First, Ferguson challenges the district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). We find this argument to be without merit. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Ferguson next contends the district court was required to give him credit for time previously served on post-release supervision when it sentenced him. At the time of Ferguson\u2019s conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988 &amp; Supp. V.) authorized the court to revoke a term of supervised release and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on post-release supervision upon finding a violation. Thus, the district court had the authority under \u00a7 3583 to sentence Ferguson to a period of incarceration without regard to the amount of time Ferguson previously served on post-release supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>found none. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Ferguson\u2019s supervised release and the ensuing sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
