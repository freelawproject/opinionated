We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment, <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Frazier\u2019s sexual harassment claim because she failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. <em>See Ellison v. Brady, </em>924 F.2d 872, 875-6 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Frazier\u2019s retaliation claim because Frazier failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to that claim. <em>See Ong v. Cleland, </em>642 F.2d 316, 318 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Frazier\u2019s discriminatory failure to hire claims because Frazier failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was qualified for the position for which she applied. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Frazier\u2019s disparate impact claim because she failed to present any evidence that the defendant\u2019s hiring practices had a significantly discriminatory impact upon a protected class. <em>See Conn, v. Teal, </em>457 U.S. 440, 446, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">Frazier\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal are deemed waived because she did not raise them before the district court. <em>See Dodd v. Hood River Cty., </em>59 F.3d 852, 863 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b152-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
