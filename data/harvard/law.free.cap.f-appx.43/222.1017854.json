We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">In its order affirming the bankruptcy court, the district court noted issues argued by plaintiffs which they failed to raise to the bankruptcy court, <em>see </em>D. Ct. Feb. 7, 2000, Mem. Dec. at 9, 10, as well as then-reliance on evidence that was not introduced in the bankruptcy court, <em>id. </em>at 11. On appeal, plaintiffs have presented us with what can only be described as a wholly inadequate appendix which they apparently expected us to make some sense of notwithstanding it failed to include numerous items from the record below specifically required by our rules, and as a result has no rhyme or reason that we can make sense of.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the appellant has the obligation to prepare and file an appendix to the brief containing relevant portions of the record sufficient for us to consider and decide the issues raised on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 30(a)(1); 10th Cir. R. 30.1(A)(1), 10.3(A). \u201cDocuments should be arranged in chronological order according to the filing date; ... transcript excerpts should be at the end.\u201d 10th Cir. R. 30.1(C)(2). \u2018When sufficiency of the evidence is raised, the entire relevant transcript must be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>R. 10.1(A)(1)(a). In addition, Tenth Circuit Rule 10.3(D) requires that \u201c[w]hen the appeal is from an order disposing of a motion or other pleading, the motion, relevant portions of affidavits, depositions and other supporting documents filed in connection with that motion or pleading must be included in the record.\u201d 10th Cir. R. 10.3(D)(2); <em>see also id. </em>(C)(3). Plaintiffs have violated each of these rales.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Moreover, we have long held that we will not consider material submitted on appeal that was not before the court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>when it made its decision. <em>See, e.g., Aero-Medical, Inc. v. United States, </em>23 F.3d 328, 329 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994). While plaintiffs maintain we should ignore defendants\u2019 objection on this point because plaintiffs asserted in their summary judgment brief below \u201cthat it was supported by \u2018all pleadings, documents and transcripts on file in the above captioned case and in the above-captioned adversary proceeding,\u201d\u2019 Reply Br. of Cascade Energy at 1, \u201c \u2018judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in [records].\u2019 \u201d <em>Gross v. Burggraf Const. Co., </em>53 F.3d 1531, 1546 (10th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunkel, </em>927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir.1991) (per curiam). <em>See also Craven v. Univ. of Colo. Hosp. Auth., </em>260 F.3d 1218, 1226 (10th Cir.2001). We decline to review material not <em>specifically </em>directed to the attention of the bankruptcy court. Nor will we consider arguments not made to the court below. <em>See generally Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., </em>928 F.2d 966, 970-71 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Plaintiffs ignore our rules at their peril. <em>See Dikeman v. Nat\u2019l Educators, Inc., </em>81 F.3d 949, 955 (10th Cir.1996); <em>Deines v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., </em>969 F.2d 977, 979 (10th Cir.1992). It is not our duty to attempt to review plaintiffs appeal based on an inadequate record that is virtually impossible to follow. While an appellee may remedy defects in the record on appeal, it is not required to do so. Although appellees here have submitted a supplemental appendix, they nevertheless continue to object to plaintiffs\u2019 cavalier attitude about this appeal and their failure to follow the rules. Given the history and length of this litigation, see Brief of Appellees at ii-v, we decline to reward plaintiffs\u2019 completely irresponsible approach to this appeal simply because appellees chose to supplement the record in an abundance of caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Based on our review of plaintiffs\u2019 appendix, the briefs, and relevant legal authority, and applying the appropriate standards of review to the issues, we are not persuaded the bankruptcy court erred either in granting summary judgment for defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 equitable subordination claim or in awarding sanctions. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants and its award of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3. After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
