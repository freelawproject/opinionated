The plaintiff now moves to dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal or otherwise. The defendant opposes the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The plaintiffs claim against the defendant is based on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116 (Ohio 1999). There is currently a split in the Northern District of Ohio on whether <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>type cases are \u201cdirect action[s] against the insurer of a policy or contract of liability insurance\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1). <em>See Fellows v. Genesis Ins. Co., </em>201 F.Supp.2d 795, 798 (N.D.Ohio 2002) (discussing district split). In the present case, the district court concluded that diversity jurisdiction did not exist because the plaintiffs claim constituted a direct action under \u00a7 1332(c)(1). Section \u00a7 1332(c)(1) states, in relevant part, that an \u201cinsurer shall be deemed a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen, as well as of any State by which the insurer has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business .... \u201d Having determined that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking, the district court remanded the plaintiffs case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), which requires that \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) bars review of remand orders to state courts when the order \u201cfall[s] into either category of remand order described in \u00a7 1447(c) ... lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defects in removal procedure.\u201d <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). <em>See Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 346, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976); <em>Zuniga v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>52 F.3d 1395, 1400 (6th Cir.1995). The defendant claims, however, that the district court did not remand the case for lack of jurisdiction but to reheve congestion of its docket. In <em>Thermtron, </em>the district court entered an order remanding a properly removed case out of concern for an overburdened docket. The Supreme Court reviewed the order because it was not based on grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c) and held that the district court had exceeded its statutorily defined power by remanding the case \u201con grounds ... not recognized by the controlling statute.\u201d <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 351. In those district court cases which hold that <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>type lawsuits are \u201cdirect actions\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1332(c)(1), the courts have sometimes observed that \u00a7 1332(c)(1) was intended by Congress to remedy the docket problems resulting from \u201cdirect action statutes [which] tend to expand diversity jurisdiction by doing away with an injured party\u2019s obligation to join an insured who is a resident of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>same state.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins. Co. v. Greene, </em>606 F.2d 123, 125 (6th Cir.1979). <em>See, e.g., Kormanik v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>208 F.Supp.2d 824 (N.D.Ohio 2001). According to the defendant, this runs afoul of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>The'tvntron. </em>The defendant is mistaken. A district court does not exceed its statutorily defined power merely by considering why Congress enacted a particular statute. So long as a remand is authorized by statute, as it was in the present case, the prohibition in <em>Thermtron </em>is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Neither can it reasonably be argued, as the defendant does, that \u201c[t]he proper construction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c) is an issue that is separate and apart from any jurisdictional conclusions that result therefrom, and therefore is subject to review by the Sixth Circuit in this matter.\u201d Under the \u201csubstantive decision\u201d exception to \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s bar to appellate review established in <em>City of Waco, Tex. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934), \u201ca remand order is reviewable on appeal when it is based on a substantive decision on the merits of a collateral issue as opposed to just matters of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Regis </em>Asso<em>ciates v. Rank Hotels (Management) Ltd., </em>894 F.2d 193, 194 (6th Cir.1990). <em>See Anusbigian v. Trugreen/Chemlawn, Inc., </em>72 F.3d 1253, 1256 (6th Cir.1996). The district court in this case looked at the proper construction of \u00a7 1332(c)(1) solely for the purpose of determining subject matter jurisdiction. The court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs claim was governed by \u00a7 1332(c)(1) had no relevance independent of its determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Excimer Associates, Inc. v. LCA Vision, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir.2002). Moreover, review is barred even if the district court\u2019s conclusion was in error. Section 1447(d) \u201cprohibits review of all remand orders issued pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) whether erroneous or not and whether review is sought by appeal or by extraordinary writ.\u201d <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The defendant additionally argues that in <em>Northbrook Nat. Ins. Co. v. Brewer, </em>493 U.S. 6, 110 S.Ct. 297, 107 L.Ed.2d 223 (1989), the Supreme Court \u201caccepted <em>certiorari </em>of the precise issue of whether a particular action constitutes a \u2018direct action\u2019 under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c).\u201d However, in <em>Northbrook </em>the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation action was brought in federal court. There was no removal based on diversity of citizenship or remand pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c); therefore, \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s bar to appellate review was inapplicable. For the same reason, the cases cited by the defendant in support of its constitutional claims are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The plaintiffs motion to dismiss is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
