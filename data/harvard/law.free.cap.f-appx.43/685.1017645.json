The district court denied both motions in an order dated November 5, 2001. Winestock timely appealed. For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss in part and vacate and remand in part for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Winestock\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion asserted claims under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 573, 151 L.Ed.2d 445 (2001). We therefore deny Winestock\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability as to his appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and dismiss the appeal from the portion of the district court\u2019s November 5, 2001, order denying relief on Winestock\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Winestock filed a motion for return of property dated December 20, 2000. The government administratively forfeited the property in 1991. Notification of the forfeitures was sent to the Baltimore City Jail and two other addresses, and was published in the <em>Washington Times. </em>However, Winestock was residing at a halfway house from January 14,1991, until April 10,1992, and asserted that he did not become aware of the forfeitures until 1996. The district court noted that Winestock may not have received adequate notice, but concluded that his action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">As the district court correctly noted, the applicable limitations period for an action seeking return of forfeited property is six years. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) (1994); <em>United States v. Minor, </em>228 F.3d 352, 359 (4th Cir.2000). To decide whether Winestock filed his action outside the six-year limitations period, it is necessary to determine when the cause of action accrued. The cause of action accrues and the limitations period begins to run on the date when the movant first becomes aware that the government declared the property forfeited or when, through an inquiry he reasonably could have been expected to make, he would have been aware of the forfeiture. <em>Minor, </em>228 F.3d at 359. In this case, the record is not sufficiently developed to determine when the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">We therefore vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on the motion for return of property and remand to the district court for a determination of when the cause of action accrued and whether Winestock\u2019s motion was timely filed. If the motion was timely, Winestock may proceed with his action and we further direct the court to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the government gave Winestock adequate forfeiture notice in light of <em>Minor </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dusenbery v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 161, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597, 70 U.S.L.W. 4044 (U.S. Jan. 8, 2002) (No. 00-6567). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">. As to Winestock\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for return of property, no certificate of appealability is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
