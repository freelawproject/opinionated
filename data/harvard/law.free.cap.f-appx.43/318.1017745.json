(Leaniri Tree), filed this diversity action alleging that defendant Thiele Technologies, Inc. (Thiele), breached a commercial contract for the design and manufacture of an automated carton-packing machine. Following a bench trial, the district court found in favor of Leaniri Tree and ordered Thiele to repay Leaniri Tree the amounts it had paid pursuant to the contract, as well as part of the consequential damages sought by Leaniri Tree. Thiele appeals, asserting that (1) it was entitled to judgment based upon its defense of commercial impracticability, and (2) in any event, the parties\u2019 written agreement precluded Leanin\u2019 Tree from recovering consequential damages. Leanin\u2019 Tree has filed a cross-appeal chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>lenging the district court\u2019s refusal to award all consequential damages sought at trial. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Leaniri Tree, a Colorado corporation, manufactures, distributes, and sells greeting cards and other miscellaneous gift products. Leaniri Tree has regularly hired seasonal personnel to assist in the process of packaging greeting cards in clear plastic cartons for retail display and sale. In 1995, Leaniri Tree began exploring the possibility of automating its process of packaging cards to save expenses and reduce the necessity of hiring seasonal workers. After exploring various options, Leaniri Tree entered into a written agreement with Thiele in late March or early April 1998 whereby Thiele agreed to design and manufacture a \u201ceartoner\u201d (i.e., an automated carton-packing machine). Thiele specializes in the design and manufacture of cartoning equipment and, at the time of the agreement, had considerable experience in designing and manufacturing equipment that utilized cardboard cartons, but very little experience in designing and manufacturing equipment that utilized plastic cartons, such as those used by Leaniri Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Prior to entering into the agreement, Leaniri Tree provided Thiele with samples of the plastic cartons it normally used for packaging cards. At no time prior to the agreement did Thiele express concerns about the cartons or its ability to design a machine that could accommodate the cartons. In fact, according to Leaniri Tree, Thiele expressed confidence that it could design and produce such a machine. On September 11, 1998, Thiele wrote to Leaniri Tree setting forth various \u201cspecifications concerning the manufacture of [the] cartons.\u201d Aplee. App. at 317. The letter stated that if Leaniri Tree\u2019s \u201csuppliers w[ould] follow the enclosed specifications, then Thiele w[ould] be able to successfully erect, fill and close the carton.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The parties revised their agreement on several occasions between late 1998 and May 1999 to allow for various design changes (e.g., addition of peripheral equipment). According to the final revised agreement, the machine was to be completed and shipped to Leaniri Tree on June 30, 1999, at a total price of $468,682. Despite the agreed-upon shipping date, and despite its previous assurances to Leaniri Tree that it could design and produce a fimctioning machine, Thiele was unable to get the eartoner to operate properly. Specifically, the carton set-up portion of the machine, which was designed to take stacks of flat unfolded cartons (essentially individual sheets of shaped and scored plastic) and allow cards to be inserted inside, was not functioning effectively. Thiele did not meet the agreed shipping date and, in July 1999, informed Leaniri Tree of the problems. Although the parties thereafter agreed to modify the design (e.g., by pre-breaking and by double-scoring the cartons), those modifications did not solve the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">In late November or early December 1999, Thiele decided to stop working on the eartoner. Even though the carton setup portion of the machine was still not functioning properly,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thiele informed Leaniri Tree that, in its opinion, the car-toner was finished and its obligations under the agreement were fulfilled. Thiele further informed Leaniri Tree that any problems with the eartoner were the result of Leaniri Tree\u2019s failure to provide an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>acceptable carton design and were Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s responsibility. At the time of its decision, Thiele\u2019s costs in designing and producing the machine were in the neighborhood of $750,000, more than $250,000 above the contract price, and more than $350,000 above Thiele\u2019s anticipated costs of design and production.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On December 17, 1999, after sending a representative to observe the cartoner at Thiele\u2019s facility (and confirming that the cartoner was not working properly), Leanin\u2019 Tree formally rejected the cartoner \u201cbased on its failure to conform to the [parties\u2019] agreement.\u201d ApltApp. at 46. On that same date, Leanin\u2019 Tree filed this diversity action against Thiele asserting a single claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Thiele moved for partial summary judgment, asserting that a clause in the parties\u2019 written agreement prohibited Leanin\u2019 Tree from recovering consequential damages arising out of the alleged breach of contract. The district court denied Thiele\u2019s motion. The case was tried to the district court in February 2001. At the conclusion of the evidence, the district, court found in favor of Leanin\u2019 Tree on its breach of contract claim. The district court found that, prior to building the car-toner, Thiele had failed to conduct an adequate investigation regarding the plastic cartons used by Leanin\u2019 Tree, and had failed to take into account the unique properties of those cartons (as compared to cardboard containers) in designing the car-toner. The district court further found, contrary to Thiele\u2019s assertions, that additional changes or modifications to the plastic cartons would not have remedied the problems. After directing the parties to file supplemental pleadings on the issue of damages, the district court awarded Leanin\u2019 Tree: (1) $283,669, an amount equal to the payments it had made to Thiele under the written agreement, plus prejudgment interest; and (2) consequential damages in the amount of $146,508.22 (to cover costs incurred by Leanin\u2019 Tree on the cartoner project). The district court rejected Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s request for damages to cover the extra labor costs it incurred in 1999 and 2000 for hand-packing its greeting cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\n<em>Thiele\u2019s Appeal (Case No. 01-1229)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\n<em>Commercial impracticability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Thiele contends the district court erred in concluding that it breached the terms of its written agreement with Leanin\u2019 Tree. Thiele asserts that \u00a7 4-2-615 of the Colorado Uniform Commercial Code \u201cexcuses a seller whose performance has been rendered impracticable by the failure of a contingency that both parties expected to be satisfied.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 23. According to Thiele, such a contingency occurred here when the manufacturer hired by Leanin\u2019 Tree to produce the plastic cartons failed to \u201csupply production cartons equal in quality to the samples it supplied [to Leanin\u2019 Tree and Thiele] in August 1998.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. More specifically, Thiele contends the cartons did not contain score lines running to the ends of the cartons, which made it difficult for the cartoner to erect them properly (Thiele also suggested in the district court that the production cartons were not properly glued). Thiele suggests these carton problems made performance under the agreement impracticable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 4-2-615 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to section 4-2-614 on substituted performance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">(a) Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency, the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">(b) Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section affect only a part of the seller\u2019s capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">(c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be a delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b) of this section, of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-2-615 (1996). There are no Colorado cases construing \u00a7 4-2-615. However, because the statute is derived directly from the Uniform Commercial Code, there are cases from other jurisdictions that provide adequate guidance. \u201cThe rationale for the defense of commercial impracticability is that the circumstance causing the breach has rendered performance so vitally different from what was anticipated that the contract cannot be reasonably thought to govern.\u201d <em>Waldinger Corp. v. CRS Group Engineers, Inc., </em>775 F.2d 781, 786 (7th Cir.1985) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cBecause the purpose of a contract is to place the reasonable risk of performance upon the promisor, ... it is presumed to have agreed to bear any loss occasioned by an event that was foreseeable at the time of contracting.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Int'l Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Llano, Inc., </em>770 F.2d 879, 886 (10th Cir.1985) (construing New Mexico\u2019s version of UCC \u00a7 2-615 in a similar fashion); <em>Parrish v. Stratton Cripple Creek Mining &amp; Dev. Co., </em>116 F.2d 207, 209-10 (10th Cir.1940) (applying pre-UCC doctrine of commercial frustration to diversity action governed by Colorado law). Generally speaking, three conditions must be satisfied before a seller\u2019s performance under a commercial contract is excused as commercially impracticable: \u201c(1) a contingency has occurred; (2) the contingency has made performance impracticable; and (3) the nonoccurrence of that contingency was a basic assumption upon which the contract was made.\u201d <em>Waldinger, </em>775 F.2d at 786 (applying Illinois\u2019 version of UCC \u00a7 2-615). The establishment of each factor is a question of fact, subject to review by this court for clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 788.(describing issue of foreseeability under \u00a7 2-615 as a factual issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In rejecting Thiele\u2019s \u00a7 4-2-615 defense, the district court found that neither the second nor third factors had been established by Thiele. More specifically, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>They [Leanin\u2019 Tree] were given [carton] specs [by Thiele] which they tried their best to follow; and, indeed, as pointed out by counsel, there were no specifications about full scoring or full gluing ... and the Court thinks this is a red herring anyway. I don\u2019t think the full scoring and the full gluing would have made this machine work. I think [Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s expert witness] Mr. Luciano has it right that it takes a lot more than that. You would have to have this over-break with the pressure on them to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Aplt.App. at 112-13.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Well, as far as Leanin\u2019 Tree was concerned, there wasn\u2019t any contingency. They had been using these plastic cartons for years, hand-packing them. They were willing to do whatever Thiele wanted them to do, but they certainly weren\u2019t told about scoring to the very edge or gluing to the very edge as a spec that they had to meet in order to make this work as a contingency. And, indeed, that didn\u2019t come in till later. And, indeed, the Court is convinced that that wouldn\u2019t have made any difference in making this machine work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 113-14.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">[The scoring and gluing specifications] certainly should have been within the contemplation of the expert in the machinery, Thiele. Leanin\u2019 Tree didn\u2019t even think about whether you needed scoring all the way or gluing all the way and really didn\u2019t have to. They weren\u2019t experts in cartoning machinery or in the requirements for what it needed, what was needed to erect or fill or close these.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">So 615 really doesn\u2019t help the defendant. Thiele knew that they had to try to make a machine to work with the cartons of Leanin\u2019 Tree. They did not do the investigation, the homework, that they should have done before entering into this contract. Probably making the scores up to the edge may very well result in tearing, which is not going to make these cartons work. As Mr. Luciano indicated, making the scores better or making the glue better may not be possible, and Thiele should have found out about these problems at the very beginning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">The district court\u2019s findings are not, in our view, clearly erroneous. Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s expert witness, consulting engineer Robert Luciano, opined that the alleged carton scoring problems pointed to by Thiele as a contingency could not have been corrected by the carton manufacturer and, even if capable of correction, would not have resulted in the cartoner working properly. Instead, Luciano opined, the plastic cartons needed a 180-degree \u201cover-break\u201d to allow them to work properly in the cartoner. Leanin\u2019 Tree also presented the testimony of Greg Fulkerson, Thiele\u2019s director of applications engineering, who admitted that: (a) the sample cartons provided by Leanin\u2019 Tree were not run through any test machines, but instead were examined by hand by Thiele personnel and deemed to be \u201cmachineable\u201d; (b) Thiele had no significant experience in designing and manufacturing machines that worked with plastic cartons, and had little understanding of the unique properties of plastic (as compared to the cardboard cartons with which it typically worked) when it agreed on an initial carton design and confirmed machinability; (c) prior to actual production of the cartoner, Thiele did not direct Leanin\u2019 Tree to have the cartons scored or glued to any specific lengths; and (d) by producing the cartoner without successful pre-production tests, and without an adequate understanding of plastics, Thiele severely limited the options avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>able for making the machine work (effectively limiting the available options to changing the cartons themselves). In light of this testimony, we conclude the district court\u2019s rulings were well within the evidence when it found that the alleged problems with the cartons did not render Thiele\u2019s performance under the agreement impracticable, the parties\u2019 agreement contained no basic assumptions regarding the design of the cartons, and Thiele should have foreseen the carton problems identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><em>Contract provision </em>\u2014 exclusion <em>of consequential damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Thiele contends that even if its defense of commercial impracticability is rejected, the district court\u2019s judgment awarding consequential damages must be reversed because, under the terms of the parties\u2019 written agreement, Leanin\u2019 Tree was precluded from recovering consequential damages. Because Thiele\u2019s contention requires us to interpret the parties\u2019 written agreement, we review the issue de novo. <em>See Bank of Okla. v. Muscogee (Creek) Nation, </em>972 F.2d 1166, 1171 (10th Cir.1992); <em>Ad Two, Inc. v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>9 P.3d 373, 376 (Colo.2000); <em>see also Salve Regina College v. Russell, </em>499 U.S. 225, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991) (holding that issues governed by state law are reviewed de novo by appellate court); <em>Key Youth Servs., Inc. v. City of Olathe, </em>248 F.3d 1267, 1274 (10th CJir. 2001) (holding that, on appeal from a bench trial, this court reviews the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In <em>Ad Two, </em>the Colorado Supreme Court outlined the general principles of contract interpretation that we must apply to resolve the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">The primary goal of contract interpretation is to determine and give effect to the intent of the parties. The intent of the parties to a contract is to be determined primarily from the language of the instrument itself. In ascertaining whether certain provisions of an agreement are ambiguous, the instrument\u2019s language must be examined and construed in harmony with the plain and generally accepted meaning of the words employed. Written contracts that are complete and free from ambiguity will be found to express the intention of the parties and will be enforced according to their plain language. Extraneous evidence is only admissible to prove intent where there is an ambiguity in the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">Terms used in a contract are ambiguous when they are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Absent such ambiguity, we will not look beyond the four corners of the agreement to determine the meaning intended by the parties. The mere fact that the parties may have different opinions regarding the interpretation of the contract does not itself create an ambiguity in the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">9 P.3d at 376-77 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">Thiele argues the terms of the parties\u2019 contract limited its exposure to damage liability. Thiele points to language contained in a form entitled \u201cTHIELE ENGINEERING COMPANY STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SALE\u201d (standard conditions of sale) that was attached to the parties\u2019 written agreement. Aplt.App. at 36. The relevant paragraph of the form, Paragraph 4 entitled \u201cLimitation of Liability,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-14\">The equipment being sold by Seller to Buyer is complex equipment. Seller has advised Buyer the equipment requires trained maintenance, upkeep and monitoring by trained members of Buyer\u2019s staff during operation. Buyer has been advised by Seller that the equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>should not be used in production until Buyer, in its sole discretion, determines that the equipment, product and Buyer\u2019s staff are ready. Buyer, as a sophisticated entity, has understood and accepts Seller\u2019s advisory. Seller has priced the equipment upon the understanding that Seller will not be responsible or liable for any form of consequential, incidental, or indirect damages of whatever kind or type arising from any type of commercial, business, environmental, tort, warranty, contract, strict liability, or other cause(s) arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with the equipment and/or its use. Not by way of limitation, Seller shall not be liable for any losses to Buyer based on down time, spoilage, lost production or lost profits. It is the intention of the parties that this provision be construed by a court as being the broadest limitation of liability consistent with applicable law. In [no] event shall Seller be liable for damages which exceed the monies paid by Buyer to Seller for the equipment less the value of the benefits received by Buyer and the value of the equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 36. In ruling on Thiele\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the district court concluded this provision did not limit Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s ability to recover consequential damages from Thiele under the circumstances presented. The court noted that the sentence purporting to limit Thiele\u2019s liability for consequential damages was placed immediately after the opening language of the provision discussing the complexity of the equipment and advising Leanin\u2019 Tree that the equipment was to be used by trained personnel. The district court concluded that, \u201c[i]n the context of the paragraph, Seller [Thiele] appears to be seeking protection from liability for any problems that could arise in connection with the equipment once Buyer [Leanin\u2019 Tree] possesses and/or uses it.\u201d ApltApp. at 68. The court therefore agreed with Leanin\u2019 Tree \u201cthat the language \u2018arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with the equipment and/or its use\u2019 [could not] apply to situations where there [wa]s no equipment in the buyer\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s interpretation. As noted by the district court, and undisputed by the parties, the equipment at issue was never delivered to Leanin\u2019 Tree. Although much of the key sentence is worded broadly (e.g., referring to \u201cany type of commercial, business, environmental, <em>tort, </em>warranty, contract, strict liability, or other cause(s)\u201d), the final clause of the sentence (\u201carising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with the equipment and/or its use\u201d), in our view, is limited to occurrences that might arise after the buyer (Leanin\u2019 Tree) takes possession of a functioning machine from the seller (Thiele). In other words, the sentence at issue, particularly when construed in light of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d provision as a whole, operates on the assumption that a functioning machine either has been or will be delivered by the seller (Thiele) to the buyer (Leanin\u2019 Tree), and focuses on the types of liability and damages that might arise thereafter. <em>See generally Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Adams County v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>40 P.3d 25, 35 (Colo.Ct.App.2001) (\u201cWords and phrases should be interpreted by examining the contract as a whole.\u201d); <em>Hallmark Bldg. Co. v. Westland Meadows Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>983 P.2d 170, 172 (Colo.Ct. App.1999) (\u201cIn determining whether provisions of a document are ambiguous, its language must be construed in harmony with the plain, ordinary and commonly accepted meaning of the words employed and reference must be made to all provisions of the document.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Our conclusion is bolstered by examining the remainder of the standard conditions of sale document, as well as the entire written agreement to which the standard conditions of sale document was attached. Paragraph 3 of the standard conditions of sale, entitled \u201cSeller\u2019s Warranty,\u201d purports to limit Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s remedies to having defects in the cartoner repaired or defective parts replaced. Aplt. App. at 36 (\u201cNo claim by Buyer for damages, labor and installation charges will be allowed.\u201d). That remedy, however, expressly applies only after \u201cthe date of shipment by Seller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As for the parties\u2019 written agreement, the opening paragraph entitled \u201cProject Overview\u201d states that the cartoner to be manufactured by Thiele \u201cwill function as part of a larger system to manufacture and package greeting cards.\u201d Aplt.App. at 20. Numerous other paragraphs of the agreement outline, in detail, how the cartoner will operate (e.g., operating speed, carton set-up, product loading, carton closure, carton discharge). The agreement further provides that the car-toner \u201cwill be tested at Thiele\u2019s assembly plant prior to shipment to the customer\u2019s facility,\u201d and \u201call capabilities of the machinery will be demonstrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Lastly, the agreement outlines how the cartoner will be shipped from Thiele to Leanin\u2019 Tree and how the cartoner is to be installed by Leanin\u2019 Tree at its facility. <em>Id. </em>In sum, both the standard conditions of sale and the parties\u2019 agreement assume delivery of a properly functioning machine to Leanin\u2019 Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In a fail-back argument, Thiele asserts that the last sentence of Paragraph 4 of the standard conditions of sale, which provides that \u201c[i]n [no] event shall Seller be liable for damages which exceed the monies paid by Buyer to Seller for the equipment less the value of the benefits received by Buyer and the value of the equipment,\u201d independently operates to limit its liability to the amount of the purchase price.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the sentence might, if construed in isolation, produce the result desired by Thiele, Colorado law requires it to be construed in light of Paragraph 4 and the agreement as a whole. <em>See Rogers v. Westerman Farm Co., </em>29 P.3d 887, 898 (Colo. 2001) (\u201cin contract law ... language should be construed as a whole, and specific phrases or terms should not be interpreted in isolation\u201d); <em>Town, of Silverton v. Phoenix Heat Source Sys., Inc., </em>948 P.2d 9, 11 (Colo.Ct.App.1997) (\u201cThe meaning of a contract is found by examining the entire instrument, not by viewing clauses or phrases in isolation.\u201d). In our view, this is particularly appropriate since the opening phrase of the sentence, \u201cIn no event,\u201d appears to relate to the preceding sentences of the paragraph. Applying such a construction, we conclude that Paragraph 4 is focused on limiting Thiele\u2019s liability for situations arising after delivery of a functioning machine. Because that never occurred here, the damage limitations do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">For these reasons, we agree with the district court that the parties\u2019 written agreement did not prohibit Leanin\u2019 Tree from obtaining consequential damages arising out of Thiele\u2019s failure to deliver a functioning cartoner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\n<em>Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s Cross-Appeal (Case No. 01-1239) </em>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In its cross-appeal, Leanin\u2019 Tree contends the district court erred in refusing to award it consequential damages for the extra costs it incurred ($124,000) in handpacMng Christmas cards in the late summer and fall of 1999 and 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court concluded that such an award \u201cwould amount to a double recovery for Leanin\u2019 Tree,\u201d since it \u201cwould have had to carton its Christmas cards by hand, as it had in the years prior to its contract with Thiele, if it had never ordered a cartoner.\u201d Aplt.App. at 124. According to Leanin\u2019 Tree, these damages were allowable under Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-2-711 as the direct result of Thiele\u2019s non-delivery of the carton-er. Leanin\u2019 Tree further argues there would be no double recovery because, if it \u201c \u2018covers\u2019 by buying another automatic car-toner ..., receives its deposit back and recovers the additional labor costs for 1999 and 2000, [it] is in the same position it would have been had the contract been performed.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 37. Because this is a mixed question that appears to primarily involve the consideration of legal principles under Colorado\u2019s UCC, it is reviewed by this court de novo. <em>See Naimie v. Cytozyme Lab., Inc., </em>174 F.3d 1104, 1111 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Under Colorado law, \u201c[d]amages are awarded in order to make the non-breaching party whole.\u201d <em>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Chemco, Inc., </em>833 P.2d 786, 791 (Colo.Ct.App.1991). \u201cThe general measure of damages for a contract case [under the Colorado UCC] is that amount which places the non-defaulting party in the same position he would have been in had the breach not occurred.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-1-106(1) (\u201cThe remedies provided by this title shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The question posed by Leanin\u2019 Tree directly implicates three sections of Colorado\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code. The first, \u00a7 4-2-711, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">(1) Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance, then, with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract ..., the buyer may cancel, and whether or not he has done so, may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">(b) Recover damages for nondelivery as provided in this article (section 4-2-713).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-2-711 (1996). The second section, expressly referenced in the first, is \u00a7 4-2-713. That section, entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cBuyer\u2019s damages for nondelivery or repudiation,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">[T]he measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this article (section 4-2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller\u2019s breach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-2-713(1) (1996). The final section, expressly referenced in the second, is \u00a7 4-2-715. That section, entitled \u201cBuyer\u2019s incidental and consequential damages,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions in connection with effecting \u201ccover\u201d and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(a) Any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(b) Injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4-2-715 (1996). \u201cSubsection (2) operates to allow the buyer, in an appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the seller\u2019s breach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Comment 2. \u201c[T]he seller is liable for consequential damages in all cases where he had reason to know of the buyer\u2019s general or particular requirements at the time of contracting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Applying these sections to the circumstances at issue, I conclude that the extra labor costs incurred by Leanin\u2019 Tree readily fall within the category of \u201cconsequential damages\u201d allowable under \u00a7\u00a7 711, 713, and 715 for Thiele\u2019s nondelivery of the cartoner. Thiele does not dispute that, at the time the parties entered into their agreement, it knew Leanin\u2019 Tree was purchasing the cartoner to automate its card-packaging operations and reduce the necessity of hiring seasonal labor. When Thiele failed to deliver a functioning machine as promised, Leanin\u2019 Tree was unable to cover (i.e., by purchasing a carton-er from another manufacturer), and was forced to hire seasonal labor to perform the intended task. Thus, the extra labor costs expended by Leanin\u2019 Tree (i.e., the difference between the cost of the seasonal labor and the costs Leanin\u2019 Tree would have expended if Thiele had provided a functioning cartoner), which were entirely foreseeable to Thiele, fall readily within the scope of consequential damages as defined in \u00a7 4-2-715(2)(a). <em>E.g. Plastic Moldings Corp. v. Park Sherman Co., </em>606 F.2d 117, 119 (6th Cir.1979) (affirming award of consequential damages \u201cfor increased production costs caused when [the buyer] was forced to use hand labor to assemble the usable parts rather than machines\u201d); <em>Carl Beasley Ford, Inc. v. Burroughs Corp., </em>361 F.Supp. 325, 328, 335 (E.D.Pa.1973) (allowing buyer to recover consequential damages for overtime pay and expenses incurred in hiring accountants to reconstruct accounting records where computer equipment and accounting software failed to perform properly), <em>aff'd, </em>493 F.2d 1400 (3d Cir.1974); <em>General Elec. Capital Corp. v. Rauch, </em>970 S.W.2d 348, 358 (Mo.Ct.App.1998) (affirming award of consequential damages to buyer under Missouri\u2019s version of UCC \u00a7 2-715 for \u201cla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>bor expenses [that] allowed Buyer to output a finished product as originally contemplated by the parties\u201d); <em>Antz v. GAF Materials Corp., </em>719 A.2d 758, 761 (Pa.Super.Ct.1998) (\u201cConsequential damages can include replacement labor costs.\u201d); <em>Cricket Alley Corp. v. Data Terminal Sys., Inc., </em>240 Kan. 661, 732 P.2d 719, 725 (Kan.1987) (concluding that, where computerized cash registers failed to perform with other computerized equipment as warranted, consequential damages could include increased labor costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Although Thiele complains that awarding such damages to Leanin\u2019 Tree places it in a better position than it would have been if it had taken delivery of a functional machine, I disagree. As noted by Leanin\u2019 Tree, it is still without a cartoner and must rely on hand-packing (and the extra labor costs associated with that process) until it can obtain a cartoner. Thus, all of the refunded purchase price (and perhaps more) will be required to purchase a new cartoner. Moreover, as pointed out by Leanin\u2019 Tree, if it is not awarded damages for the extra labor costs incurred in 1999 and 2000, it will not be placed in the same position as if the breach had not occurred. Instead, it will be placed in the position that it held prior to entering into the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">For these reasons, I would remand to the district court with directions to award Leanin\u2019 Tree an additional $124,000 in consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. Because Thiele was unable to get the carton set-up portion of the machine to function properly, it was unable to test the loading and closing features of the machine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Leanin' Tree asserts that Thiele has waived this affirmative defense by failing to raise it timely in the district court. <em>See generally Harriscom Svenska, AB v. Harris Corp., </em>3 F.3d 576, 580 (2d Cir.1993) (characterizing defense of \"commercial impracticability\u201d under UCC \u00a7 2-615 as an affirmative defense). Although it is true that Thiele\u2019s answer con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tained no reference to \u00a7 4-2-615, it did state that \"Leanin\u2019 Tree has not provided Thiele with cartons suitable for operation in the Automatic Cartoner.\u201d Aplt.App. at 51. Further, Thiele asserted its \u00a7 4-2-615 defense at trial and the district court rejected it on the merits. Accordingly, we assume the defense has not been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\">. It is unclear from the record whether the argument was raised by Thiele in the district court. Although Thiele\u2019s appendix includes a copy of its actual motion for partial summary judgment (on the issue of consequential damages), it does not include a copy of the supporting memorandum. Nor does the appendix include a copy of Leanin' Tree\u2019s response to Thiele\u2019s motion. The district court\u2019s order, although contained in the appendix, makes no mention of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\">. Having reached this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to address Leanin' Tree's assertion that the agreement's limited remedy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>repair or replacement failed its essential purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.

In arriving at the $124,000 figure, Leanin\u2019 Tree calculated its total labor costs for hand-packing in 1999 and 2000 and deducted the costs and expenses it would have incurred if Thiele had delivered a working cartoner. For example, for the year 2000, Leanin' Tree expended $169,000 in labor costs for hand-packing. From this amount, they deducted \"[t]he depreciation expense and the personal property taxes\u201d that would have been associated with the cartoner had it been delivered in working order and arrived at a figure of approximately $64,000 in \"additional expense\u201d incurred \"in the year 2000\u201d as a result of not having a working cartoner.

Upon the facts of this case, and limiting my concurrence to the facts of this case, it is my considered opinion that on the issue of consequential damages the district court\u2019s disposition was correct. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4-2-715 cmt. 4 (\u201cLoss may be determined in any manner which is reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d); <em>Eccher v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>643 F.2d 1388, 1391-92 (10th Cir.1981) (\u201cWe will not disturb the district court\u2019s determination of damages unless clearly erroneous.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Reviewing the record before us, I cannot say that the district court\u2019s grant of some consequential damages, and rejection of others, is unreasonable under the circumstances and thus clearly erroneous. For that reason I would affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">I note that because there is a lack of a majority supporting remand, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b357-13\">BRORBY, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">I agree with the majority\u2019s well reasoned argument rejecting Thiele\u2019s commercial impracticability defense. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s reading of the contract. Because I would limit Leanin\u2019 Tree\u2019s recovery to the purchase price of the equipment, in my view, the cross-appeal seeking damages for labor costs is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Initially, I agree the contract language that purports to eliminate \u201cany form of consequential ... damages\u201d may reasonably be interpreted to contemplate only situations arising after delivery of the equipment. When applying Colorado law, we strictly construe contractual ambiguity against the drafter \u2014 in this case, Thiele. <em>United States Fidel. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Bud</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>get Rentr-A-Car Sys., Inc., 842 </em>P.2d 208, 211 (Colo.1992) (en banc). Therefore, I agree Thiele has not successfully limited all liability prior to delivery of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Nevertheless, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s reading of the purchase price damage cap found in the last sentence of paragraph four. In my view, the contextual arguments relied upon by the majority are not sufficient to override the unambiguous language \u201c[i]n no[ ] event shall Seller be liable for damages which exceed the monies paid by Buyer to Seller.\u201d Courts resolving Uniform Commercial Code disputes between sophisticated parties have consistently enforced damage caps preceded with the language \u201cin no event.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Computrol, Inc. v. Newtrend, L.P., </em>203 F.3d 1064, 1070-71 (8th Cir.2000) (holding contract which stated liability \u201cshall <em>in no event </em>exceed the amounts actually paid\u201d was unambiguous and enforceable) (emphasis added); <em>Global Octanes Texas, L.P. v. BP Exploration &amp; Oil Inc., </em>154 F.3d 518, 521-23 (5th Cir.1998) (enforcing contractual damage cap which read <em>\u201c[i]n no event </em>shall the liability of either party under this Agreement ... exceed $500,000\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In this case, the majority asserts the clause \u201c \u2018[i]n no event,\u2019 appears to relate to the preceding sentences of the paragraph,\u201d and therefore \u201cis focused on limiting Thiele\u2019s liability for situations arising after delivery.\u201d According to the majority, both the broader limitation of all direct and indirect damages as well as the purchase price damage cap apply only after delivery of the equipment. This reading appears to make the damage cap irrelevant, since if the equipment were delivered, no damages would have been available anyway. However ambiguous the contract may be, it certainly does not permit a reading where there are no circumstances in which liability could be limited to the purchase price. I do not dispute the contract assumes the equipment will at some point be delivered. It would be a strange equipment sales contract which did not provide for delivery. What I cannot follow is the logical leap from this assumption to the conclusion the contractual damage cap is only operative after delivery. Even if the \u201cin no[ ] event\u201d clause \u201crelates\u201d to the preceding sentences, I believe it is sufficiently broad to cap Thiele\u2019s pre-delivery liability to the purchase price of the equipment. The majority\u2019s reading of the contract comes perilously close to inserting the phrase \u201cexcept for non-delivery of the equipment\u201d after the words \u201cin no event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">For these reasons I would reverse and remand on the question of damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
