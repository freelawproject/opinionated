We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">On June 14, 2000, Latevola pleaded guilty to four counts of defrauding his employer, the Menorah Federal Credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Union (\u201cMenorah\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. The United States Probation Office recommended that Latevola be sentenced at an adjusted offense level of 23 with a criminal history category I. The resulting recommended guideline range of imprisonment was 37 to 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Starting with a base offense level of 6, the Probation Office recommended (1) an increase of 9 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(J) because the loss exceeded $350,000; (2) an increase of 2 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2) because the offense involved more than minimal planning; (3) an increase to level 24 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(7)(A) because the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution; and (4) a decrease of 3 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) based on Latevola\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. Latevola objected to the 9-level enhancement for causing a loss in excess of $350,000 and to the enhancement to level 24 for substantially jeopardizing the safety and soundness of a financial institution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Latevola also requested a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.16, for having voluntarily disclosed his criminal conduct to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The United States presented three witnesses at the sentencing hearing held on September 8, 2000: Robert Weltman (\u201cWeltman\u201d), Banita Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d), and Carmelo D\u2019Agostino (\u201cD\u2019Agostino\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Weltman testified that, over a span of approximately twenty-five years starting in or about 1966, he had served as Menorah\u2019s treasurer, director, director emeritus, and president. After he turned the presidency over to Allen Goodman (\u201cGoodman\u201d) in 1992 or 1993, Weltman \u2014 an attorney- \u2014 continued to serve Menorah in a consulting legal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">In 1998, Weltman was advised by Goodman that Latevola, Menorah\u2019s manager since sometime in 1993, had embezzled a large amount of money from Menorah. Weltman testified that Latevola\u2019s actions not only resulted in losses to Menorah well in excess of $350,000 but they also left Menorah in a \u201cvery bleak\u201d financial condition. J.A. at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">After spending at least portions of approximately two years inspecting Latevola\u2019s fictitious loans, family-related loans, and bad faith loans, Weltman assisted in presenting Menorah\u2019s bond claim to the bonding company. The bonding company ultimately settled the claim for $457,000, an amount which \u2014 according to Welt-man \u2014 covered only a portion of the credit union\u2019s total losses. Weltman explained that had the bonding company not come through with the settlement monies when it did, Menorah would have been forced to close its doors. Even with the settlement monies, Menorah was thereafter given the weakest possible rating by the governing body for federal credit unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">D\u2019Agostino, a federal credit union examiner, testified that he was in the process of examining Menorah when Latevola\u2019s embezzlement was discovered. He said that, during the course of his examination, he at first became concerned about a number of cheeks made out to \u201cBarbara Zaeharyaez\u201d that were cashed at a check cashing service by Latevola\u2019s wife. When D\u2019Agostino asked Latevola about the checks, he was told that Latevola\u2019s wife knew the woman and was \u201cjust trying to help her out.\u201d J.A. at 61. When D\u2019Agostino discovered still more questionable checks made out to \u201cBarbara Zaeharyaez\u201d involving disbursements from the accounts of other members, he again asked Latevola for an expla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>nation. Latevola replied that the woman was good Mends with other members of the credit union as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Latevola\u2019s puzzling explanations led D\u2019Agostino to a review of Menorah\u2019s membership cards. Discovering a few cards that appeared to be questionable, D\u2019Agostino decided to investigate by visiting the homes of two applicant members. When he found that one of the two members lived in a low income high-rise, the other in a home that was \u201cnot in real good condition,\u201d both in the lower west side of the city, D\u2019Agostino questioned Latevola about how these people became members of Menorah. Latevola indicated that there were other organizations that could join Memo-rah and that these people belonged to those other organizations. At this point, having also discovered questionable checks that Latevola said were payments made by his wife on a loan, D\u2019Agostino called his supervisor and explained that he was feeling very uncomfortable about the situation. D\u2019Agostino then asked Latevola if he had anything more to tell him. Latevola soon after called Goodman and arranged to meet with him. At that meeting, Latevola apparently confessed to having embezzled from the credit union.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">When asked what impact Latevola\u2019s embezzlement had on Menorah, D\u2019Agostino testified that it hurt the credit union \u201csignificantly.\u201d When asked whether, as a result of Latevola\u2019s actions, Menorah was placed in jeopardy of becoming insolvent, D\u2019Agostino answered: \u2018Tes.\u201d He explained that, if the losses had been entered on the books, the credit union was in fact insolvent \u201cduring the period of time from the embezzlement until probably all the way up until the bonding company actually paid off.\u201d J.A. at 68. D\u2019Agostino added that even after the bonding company made payment, Menorah\u2019s position remained very weak, albeit solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Banita Taylor took over Latevola\u2019s duties as manager of Menorah after Latevola\u2019s embezzlement was discovered. Taylor testified that the amount Latevola claimed he embezzled \u2014 $227,000\u2014was not accurate, that the actual figure was well in excess of $350,000. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-7\">[W]e were closer to half a million dollars, and we are still incurring additional losses by having to take these loans off the books, because all along we were borrowing money to meet the fictitious loan demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">So not only did we pay other credit unions and tak[e] money from our depositors to meet what we thought \u2014 what they thought was the outstanding loan demand, in addition to that, these loans now have to be written off our books, and so we are not getting anything on these either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">J.A. at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">When asked whether, as a result of Latevola\u2019s embezzlements, the credit union was placed in jeopardy of becoming insolvent, Taylor answered: \u201cIt was.\u201d J.A. at 87. She said that if the bonding company had not come through with payment by August 2, 2000, \u201cit was over.\u201d J.A. at 87. She also said that Menorah was forced to reduce and/or eliminate some important benefits to its members in order to cut costs, that board members and employees had to spend long hours over a long period of time in an effort to straighten out the embezzlement-related \u201cmess\u201d caused by Latevola, and that \u2014 as a result of the time-consuming focus on the credit union\u2019s very existence \u2014 Menorah\u2019s employees were not \u201cavailable to our members for the last two years as they should have been.\u201d J.A. at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">When asked about Latevola\u2019s confession, Taylor explained that his confession covered only part of the actual embezzlement. She said that there was a tremendous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>amount to which he did not confess, that she uncovered transfers and such on a daily basis that were not included in Latevola\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">While testifying in his own behalf, Latevola stated that he submitted a written confession to Goodman before D\u2019Agostino uncovered any of his wrongdoing. He explained that he confessed because it \u201cjust basically got to me.\u201d J.A. at 117. On cross-examination, Latevola was asked if he remembered being questioned by D\u2019Agostino about questionable checks and loan payments made on behalf of his wife. When Latevola basically said that he did not remember, the district court took over the questioning. In full, the ensuing colloquy between the court and Latevola was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">THE COURT: Do you recall answering questions that Mr. D\u2019Agostino made to you, posed to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">THE COURT: Did you give truthful answers when he asked you those questions, or did you lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">DEFENDANT: I must have given truthful answers. I don\u2019t recall what the questions were at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">THE COURT: You were here this morning. You have heard Mr. D\u2019Agostino\u2019s account of the conversation. And you know clearly according to him you lied to him. So I am asking you do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-12\">DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t remember. It was two and a half years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-13\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t remember whether you told the truth or lied? DEFENDANT: A lot has transpired in two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-14\">THE COURT: You\u2019re under oath now. DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-15\">THE COURT: Are you telling me you don\u2019t remember whether you told the truth to Mr. D\u2019Agostino or not; is that what you\u2019re saying now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-17\">DEFENDANT: Being a federal examiner, and having questions asked of me, I would have to answer truthfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-18\">THE COURT: You\u2019re telling me, under oath, you answered Mr. D\u2019Agostino truthfully in April of \u201998?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-19\">DEFENDANT: To the best of my ability, I don\u2019t remember specifically what was asked of me and what I answered, being that time period had transpired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnN\">THE COURT: Do you remember him asking you about checks to Barbara Zacharyacz, or something like that? DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-20\">THE COURT: Did you tell him that your wife knew her and she was trying to help her out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-21\">DEFENDANT: Which is true, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-22\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s the reason those checks were written? DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-23\">THE COURT: And what about checks to Barbara Zacharyacz charged to other accounts, did you tell Mr. D\u2019Agostino that Barbara Zacharyacz was friends with these members and that\u2019s why she\u2019s writing checks to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acz\">DEFENDANT: In many cases other checks, other fictitious accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-24\">THE COURT: So you lied to Mr. D\u2019Agostino, that these people, these fictitious\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-25\">DEFENDANT: On that basis, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-26\">THE COURT: So a moment ago I asked you did you tell the truth and you said you did, you weren\u2019t telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-27\">DEFENDANT: I am trying to recall the best I can.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-28\">J.A. at 124-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-29\">At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court announced its find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ings: namely, (1) that the government proved that Latevola caused a loss in excess of $350,000 as required for an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(J); (2) that the government proved that Latevola\u2019s conduct substantially jeopardized Menorah\u2019s safety and soundness as required for an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(7)(A); (3) that Latevola did <em>not </em>prove that he voluntarily disclosed to authorities the existence of the offense prior to the discovery of such offense and, more particularly, that the offense was unlikely to have been otherwise discovered as required for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.16; and (4) that Latevola gave false testimony under oath during the sentencing hearing, which supported a two level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Based on his findings, the judge sentenced Latevola to a term of imprisonment of 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">This court reviews a challenge to a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. </em>A district court\u2019s factual findings in relation to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines are subject to a deferential \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Garner, </em>940 F.2d 172, 174 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">On appeal, Latevola challenges the district court\u2019s decision to enhance Latevola\u2019s sentence for substantially jeopardizing the safety and soundness of a financial institution, its decision to enhance for obstruction of justice, and its calculation of the amount of the loss to Menorah. We find no merit to any of Latevola\u2019s arguments. .</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">A. <em>Substantially Jeopardizing the Safety and Soundness of a Financial Institution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">At the time Latevola was sentenced, section 2Fl.l(b)(7)(A) required an enhancement to level 24 where \u201cthe offense ... substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution.\u201d The Comments to section 2F1.1 provided that an offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent, or substantially reduced benefits to its pensioners or insureds, or was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations, or was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of those consequences. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 Comment 17 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Here, there was ample evidence that Menorah was placed in substantial jeopardy of becoming insolvent, of having to merge, of being unable on demand to make payments, and of having to reduce benefits to members. All three of the government\u2019s witnesses testified to that effect. The district court was accordingly correct in applying the enhancement under section 2Fl.l(b)(7)(A), which means that an unadjusted offense level of 24 was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">B. <em>Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Although Latevola did not object to the obstruction enhancement at the time of sentencing, Latevola argues that the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>imposition of a two level increase for obstruction of justice was plain error because the allegedly perjured testimony was not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the sentencing issues before the trial court. In order to establish \u201cplain error,\u201d a defendant must demonstrate (1) that error oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>curred; (2) that the error was obvious or clear; (3) that the error affected substantial rights of the defendant; and (4) that the negative impact affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Pursuant to the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased two levels if he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and ... the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoA\">Obstruction of justice includes the act of \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 application note 4(f) (1998). \u201cMaterial\u201d information is information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination. <em>United States v. Crousore, </em>1 F.3d 382, 385 (6th Cir.1993) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 Commentary). Notably, a district court has considerable discretion in determining whether the obstruction enhancement applies. <em>United States v. Moss, </em>9 F.3d 543, 553 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In this case, Latevola asked the court to give him the benefit of a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.16 based upon his alleged voluntary disclosure of his offenses to authorities. Section 5K2.16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">If the defendant voluntarily discloses to authorities the existence of, and accepts responsibility for, the offense prior to the discovery of such offense, and if such offense was unlikely to have been discovered otherwise, a departure below the applicable guideline range for that offense may be warranted.... This provision does not apply where the motivating factor is the defendant\u2019s knowledge that discovery of the offense is likely or imminent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Clearly, whether and to what extent Latevola voluntarily disclosed truthful information to federal bank examiners about his activities was material to the departure issue under section 5K2.16. On cross-examination, Latevola was asked about the answers he gave to D\u2019Agostino\u2019s questions after D\u2019Agostino became suspicious of wrong-doing. When he was evasive in responding to counsel\u2019s questions, the district court jumped in and asked Latevola very pointedly whether he had given truthful answers during the bank examiner\u2019s investigation. In response to the judge\u2019s questions, Latevola was untruthful at worst, evasive at best; and while he ultimately admitted to having lied to the judge, his initial responses were \u2014 without question \u2014 indicative of an attempt to mislead the court into thinking he had been truthful to D\u2019Agostino. Given such an attempt to \u201cobstruct or impede the administration of justice during the course of the... sentencing\u201d hearing, we find no abuse of discretion, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s decision to enhance the sentence under section 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">3. <em>Amount of the Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Latevola contends that the district court\u2019s calculation as to the amount of the loss was \u201chopelessly corrupt\u201d because it included amounts not specified in the indictment and because it allegedly included interest and loans made to third parties which the credit union might ultimately recover. He suggests that the loss attributable to him totaled only $208,000, an amount that should have triggered an 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>level rather than a 9-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">To be sure, none of the witnesses gave particularly illuminating testimony regarding the amount of the loss. Indeed, it is impossible to glean from this record a precise estimate of the overall loss. There was nonetheless convincing testimony from all three of the government\u2019s witnesses that the net losses were well in excess of $350,000 and were probably in excess of $500,000. The judge did not specify a precise figure but simply concluded that $350,000 was a very conservative figure given the testimony that he heard. He also said that he could not fathom why, after many months of investigating the circumstances, the bonding company would settle a claim for $450,000 if the loss were, in fact, \u201conly 200 something thousand.\u201d J.A. at 130. While Latevola challenged the government\u2019s evidence, he presented no credible evidence to demonstrate that the credit union\u2019s figures were grossly inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Furthermore, even if we were to agree with Latevola\u2019s estimate of the loss, he would not be entitled to sentencing relief because we have determined that the district court correctly increased his offense level to 24 under section 2F1.1(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Having found no merit to Latevola\u2019s arguments on appeal, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. Effective November 1, 2001, after Latevola was sentenced, the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 were merged into the provisions of \u00a7 261.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
