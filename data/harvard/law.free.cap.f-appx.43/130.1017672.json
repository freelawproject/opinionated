Accordingly, we deny Arreola\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b158-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-21\">California state prisoner Jose A. Arreola appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, challenging his conviction for first degree murder. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-22\">Arreola contends that his due process rights were violated when: (1) the California trial court excluded evidence concerning the victim\u2019s use of racial slurs and obscenities against Arreola, and (2) the prosecutor stated during closing argument that Arreola was motivated by \u201cmachismo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-23\">To grant habeas relief based on a state court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence, the decision \u201cmust be so prejudicial as to jeopardize the defendant\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>Tinsley v. Borg, </em>895 F.2d 520, 530 (9th Cir.1990). We find no due process violation in this case since the exact terminology of the victim\u2019s racial slurs was cumulative in light of trial testimony that the victim used profanity when speaking to Arreola on numerous incidents, and where the derogatory comments did not constitute a major part of Arreola\u2019s state-of-mind defense. <em>See id. </em>(enumerating factors to consider in determining whether exclusion of evidence violates defendant\u2019s due process rights).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-24\">Even assuming that the prosecution\u2019s two references to \u201cmachismo\u201d during clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ing argument were improper, Arreola has not demonstrated that the remarks \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>see Bains v. Cambra, </em>204 F.3d 964, 975-78 (9th Cir.2000) (affirming conviction based on \u201cstrong case\u201d against defendant, where ethnic references occurred only dining prosecution\u2019s closing argument); <em>cf. United States v. Cabrera, </em>222 F.3d 590, 596 (9th Cir.2000) (finding that a detective\u2019s repeated references to the defendants\u2019 Cuban origin, coupled with generalizations about the Cuban community, prejudiced defendants in the eyes of the jury). Additionally, in the absence of prejudice, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object during closing argument was not constitutionally ineffective. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Therefore, the California state courts\u2019 decisions were neither contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Arreola\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b158-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-25\">. Arreola was not deprived of his constitutional right to present a defense because, under California law, racial slurs do not constitute sufficient provocation to reduce a charge of intentional homicide to manslaughter. <em>See People v. Ogen, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 611, 215 Cal.Rptr. 16, 23 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
