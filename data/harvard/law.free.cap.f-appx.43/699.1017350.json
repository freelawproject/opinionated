The court concluded Brown failed to pay restitution as directed, failed to follow his probation officer\u2019s instructions to file an ineome/expense form, failed to work regularly, and tested positive for drug use. On appeal, Browne does not dispute these violations but asserts his thirteen-month sentence was unreasonable because the court did not take into account mitigating circumstances concerning Browne\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s illness. We disagree. It is clear from the record that the district court imposed a sentence below the statutory maximum in order to provide Browne with another opportunity to rehabilitate himself. Therefore, we conclude the thirteen-month sentence was not unreasonable and affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of the parties are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
