The said Lesta Ford was not provided for by any settlement by the said Paul Leicester Ford prior to his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-14\">\u201c(9) The said Grace K. Ford, as executrix of the will of the said Paul Leicester Ford, has not paid the said duty or tax assessed by the collector of internal revenue as aforesaid, nor has she given any notice, or rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>any schedule, or filed any return, or performed any other act or duty pursuant to the acts of Congress aforesaid, except that on or about the 2d day of November, 1903, she filed with the said collector of internal revenue a claim for the remission of the said tax so assessed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">The decision depends mainly upon the construction to he placed upon the language of the War Revenue Act (section 29, Act .Tune 13, 1898, as amended). The substance of it is that any one having control of \u201clegacies or distributive shares arising from personal property\u201d exceeding $10,000 in actual value \u201cpassing * * * from any person possessed of such property, either by will or by the intestate laws of any state or territory,\u201d shall pay a certain sum to the United States as a duty or tax. It is conceded that the property claimed to he subject to the tax did not pass from Paul Leicester Ford, the deceased, to Lesta Ford, ins posthumous daughter, by will, and did pass to her under the laws of the state of New York. The disputed point is that the law under which it did pass is not an \u201cintestate law.\u201d The main argument in support of this proposition is that the law in question is not placed by the Legislature of the state in that part of the statutes where the well-defined and 'well-understood \u201cintestate laws\u201d are found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">Admitting this to be so, it falls far short of settling the dispute. The question still remains open as to what the law really is, and whether it is one of the laws which the Congress had in mind when it enacted the section 29 above outlined. We must start our thoughts with the truism that no man has the inherent right to transmit what he has accumulated to others after he is dead. He can give it away while alive, and by virtue of the statute laws of the various states lie can, to a certain extent, direct what shall be done with it by will, and if he does not do so, either by neglect or advisedly, the state itself by legislative act provides for its distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">When tlie Congress provided for the levying of a certain toll on all the dead man\u2019s property passing either by will or intestate law, it would seem that no crevice was left for any property to slip through without responding to the provision. When a man dies, it will be found in every case that he either did or did not leave a will. In the case at bar he left a will: but it is conceded that Lesta Ford did not get her property by virtue of that will in the sense that she did not got it because of any stated wish of the testator appearing in the will. The testator said nothing about her, because she was not in being when he made the will. When she was born, it was too late for the testator to express any wish which he might have had, if alive, because he himself had passed beyond into the unknown land. The Legislature of the state of New York had long ago passed the statute, set forth in the stipulation, to provide for such cases. The statute does not, it is true, in set terms revoke the will; but it does plainly render the will inoperative in so far as it fails to provide for the later born Lesta.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">So far as she and her interest in her father\u2019s property is concerned, the case stands exactly as if the father had made no will at all. The statute provides for her welfare on the theory that the father did not express his will in that respect, because he was no soothsayer and could not foretell the happenings of the future, but in all human probability would have done what the statute has done for him, had he known what the situation was to be, and, as I just said, provides for her because her father did not. When Lesta was born, if the statute liad not been in existence, she would have been a forlorn waif, with not even a penny in expectation. The statute acts upon the property directly, to the exclusion, or rather in supplementation, of the testator\u2019s expressed desire, and to a plain mind, like the writer\u2019s, is, from every point of view, except its precise location in the statute book, an intestate law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">The other points against a verdict do not strike me as serious enough to warrant discussion. It is the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, upon the stipulated facts, for the sum of $2,035.16, the amount of the tax sued for, together with a penalty of 5 per cent, and 1 per cent, interest per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">So ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>T.'

The fundamental question in the case is whether the particular provision of the state statutes under which this child received her share of her father\u2019s personal estate, is an \u201cintestate law\u201d within the meaning of the War Revenue Act, which imposes a tax on personal property \u201cpassing * * * from any person possessed of such property, either by will or by the intestate laws of any state.\u201d Inasmuch as the particular state statute in effect provides. that as to her the will was ineffective, and that she should receive by virtue of <em>this </em>statute, in connection with the general statute of distribution of intestate estates, the personal property which she has received, it seems to us that this particular piece of state legislation may properly be called an \u201cintestate law.\u201d So far as she is concerned, the situation is the same as if her father had died .intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
