I\u00bb court upon request made a special finding of facts and entered judgment thereon in favor of the defendant. It is not necessary to set out the findings in full. The court found the facts substantially as alleged in the first count of the .declaration, except as- to performance by plaintiffs of the conditions imposed upon them by the contract. Upon this issue of plaintiffs\u2019 performance the court found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-13\">(4) Th\u2019at in the year 1908 said plaintiffs purchased from said defendant 3,239,975 pounds of glucose and 32,480 pounds of sugar, of which amount 2,773,261 pounds of glucose and 15,920 pounds of sugar were purchased in the months of January, February, and March of the year 1908, and that the amount of money paid for such glucose was' $69,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-14\">(5) That beginning on March 12, 1008, and up to December 31, 1908, said ifiaintiffs purchased from the American Maize products Company, a corporation in which they were interested in excess of $200,000 as stockholders, 5,691,240 pounds of a product, 95 per cent, of which was glucose and 5 per cent, of which was cane syrup; that said purchases were made under the name of \u201csyrup\u201d; that in the years 1906, 1907, .and up to March 12, 1908. plaintiffs had at all times in the conduct of their business themselves added at least 5 per cent, of cane syrup to glucose in making syrup for their customers, which was over 90 per cent, of their entire business; and that in the year 1908 their business was conducted in the same way as in the years 1900 and 1907, with the exception of their purchases from the American Maize Products Company on and after March 12, 190S, of glucose with 5 l)er cent, cane syrup added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(7) That the commodity so purchased from the American Maize Products Company by plaintiff from March 12 to December 31, 1.908, was delivered to the establishment of plaintiffs in tank ears, and by plaintiff's pumped into holding vats, and from holding vats pumped into mixing vats.

B. Scully was ihe vice president and general manager thereof, and that said plaintiff caused, said product so purchased from said American Maize Products Company to be shipped to plaintiffs' establishment under shipping instructions reading as follows: \u201cOne tank corn syrup with cane flavor, without water, 93 9\u00f3 glucose, 5% cane syrup. Bill as syrup.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">(9) That said plaintiffs were instrumental in the formation of said American Maize Products Company, and interested oilier persons in becoming stockholders thereof, and advised such persons prior to becoming stockholders thereof in 1906 that said plaintiffs would give to said American Maize Products Company the business of said plainlitfs, and all business controlled by them, and after the making of the written offers of December 7, 1906, and December 24, 1907, by said defendant, said plaintiffs assured those interested in said American Maize Products Company as stockholders that the acceptance by said plaintiffs of the terms of said profit-sharing offers made by defendant and their acting thereunder would not affect said plaintiffs, and would have nothing to do whatsoever with said plaintiffs giving to said American Maize Products Company the entire business of said plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">(12) The court finds that, before plaintiffs can recover in this action, they must prove hy a preponderance or greater weight of the evidence that during the year 1908 they purchased exclusively from the defendant all the glucose and grape sugar required by said plaintiffs in the conduct of their business, and the court further finds from the evidence that said plaintiffs did not during the year 1908 make all of their said purchases of glucose and grape sugar required in the conduct of their business exclusively from said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">(13) On and after January 2, 1909, said plaintiffs conducted their business, including the method of making purchases of glucose, in the way they had conducted their business and made their purchases in the years 1906, 1.907, and 1908 up to March 12, 1908, and that on and after January 2, 1909, said plaintiffs purchased from the American Maize Products Company glucose without, any cane syrup added, and plaintiffs on and after January 2, 1909, mixed 5 per cent, or a greater per cent, of cane syrup with said glucose so purchased from said American Maize Products Company in plainliffs\u2019 establishment as they had always done in the years 1906, 1907, and in the year 1908 up to March 12, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">(14) That a very small per cent, of plaintiffs\u2019 business in the year .1908 was the sale of the product which consisted of 95 per cent, glucose with 5 per cent, cane syrup added; that the greater part of their business was the sale of glucose with a greater per cent, than 5 per cent, of cane syrup added. That on and after March 12, 1908, said additional tier cent, of cane syrup above 5 per cent, was added in the establishment of said plaintiffs after said product of 95 per cent, glucose and C por cent, cane syrup had been purchased from the American Maize Products Company and had been pumped from the tank cars in which it was received by plaintiffs into the mixing vats in plaintiffs\u2019 establishment</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">(15) That the plaintiffs changed their method of purchasing glucose during the year 1908. after said American Maize Products Company began the manufacture and delivery of glucose and other products, and caused said American Maize Products Company to make and deliver to them the product known as 95 per cent, of glucose and 5 per cent, cane -syrup added for the purpose of enabling said plaintiffs to avoid the obligations imposed upon them under said profit-sharing plan of December 24, 1907 and January 23, 1908, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and that such method of purchase from said American Maize Products Company during the year 1908, and after the 12th day of March of said year, was not adopted by plaintiffs in good faith, and was a subterfuge to enable them to recover the moneys herein sued for while diverting the largest part of their business from the defendant to the American Maize Products Company, in which latter company they were largely interested as stockholders or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">(16) That Daniel B. Scully, one of the plaintiffs herein, was in the year 1908 the vice president and general manager of the American Maize Products Company, and as such vice president and general manager received a salary from said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">Upon these findings the court entered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-6\">Jacob E.

Plaintiffs have assigned numerous errors, but no assignment raising any question of fact is pressed here. Indeed, counsel for plaintiffs in their brief say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cThere is no real conflict in the evidence. The material facts are all conceded, and the question here is one of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Not only is the evidence sufficient to sustain the findings of the trial court; it conclusively establishes them. Neither is there any available question of law raised upon this record. One of the material averments of the declaration is that plaintiffs \u201cpurchased exclusively from the defendant all the glucose and grape sugar required by them in the conduct of their business during the year 1908,\u201d and \u201cfully complied with the terms of said written proposition.\u201d The court found that plaintiffs did not comply with the terms of the contract, and that what they claimed to be compliance was a mere subterfuge. The court, having properly found that plaintiffs had failed to perform the contract on their part, was bound to follow that finding with a judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">There is no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
