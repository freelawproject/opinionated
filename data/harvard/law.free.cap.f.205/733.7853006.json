The only errors assigned are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">\u201cFirst. The court erred in its decree of April 1, 1911, by refusing the motion of libelant to amend, its libel in this cause, as per the amendment filed on the 28th day of January, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">\u201cSecond. The court erred in its decree of April 1, 1911, by granting the motion of the defendant, McKeon, to dismiss the libel in this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-15\">\"Third. The court erred in its decree of April 1, 1911, in dismissing the libel in this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-16\">\u201cFourth. The court erred in its decree of April 1, 1911, wherein it taxed libelant with the costs of the above-mentioned cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">On the hearing, the scope of the libelant\u2019s right to recover damages, if entitled to recover at all, was neither discussed in the briefs nor in the oral argument. Under these circumstances, we find it proper to amend our decree, heretofore and during this term rendered, so that the District Court in due course may do full justice between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-18\">It is therefore ordered that our former decree in this case be amended so as to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-19\">\u201cFor these reasons, the decree dismissing the libel is reversed, and the case is remanded, with instructions to set aside the decree of April 1, 1911, and thereafter proceed according to admiralty rules and usages to ascertain and decree as the evidence may show the full damages which the libelant may be entitled to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Our former mandate is recalled, and another will be issued on the-decree as herein amended. All costs accruing in this court since the first mandate will be paid by the Eastfield Steamship Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
