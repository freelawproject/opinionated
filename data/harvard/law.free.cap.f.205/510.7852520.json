Keller against Donald A. Loyless for publishing an alleged libelous article of and concerning plaintiff. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>article was published on April 5, 1908, in a trade journal known as the \u201cSouthern Carbonator and Bottler/\u2019 and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">\u201c\u00a1Selling Goods to Bottlers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">\u201cIn its March issue, the National Bottlers\u2019 Gazette of New York perpetrated a characteristic editorial ghost dance under the above heading, running amuck with its crazy snickersnee whetted keen for the poor traveling man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">\u201cIn this remarkable aberration, the bellicose crank, who slings muck for ink in his self-appointed and highly imaginary job of running the business of every manufacturer, supply dealer, bottler and bottling trade journal In the United Stales of America, cooiy eliminates the knight of the grip from the equation of selling in the commercial carbonating world, reducing tho business to that of a mere mail order house. He gives the faithful, order-getting road man his walking papers, with a sneer at his efficiency and with a slander on his morals and maimers, declaring:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">\u201c \u2018The old timers who held back their orders for the coming of some glib salesman \u2014 who got him and himself, too, stone blind drunk and had \u201csuch fun\u201d together \u2014 are fast passing away. A new era has set in. A bottler can\u2019t be \u201chalf seas\u201d over and do business intelligently.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">\u201cYe gods! Listen to that! It was not enough to kick the drummer downstairs, but he is branded as a drunkard and roysterer, employing bibulous conviviality as an art to land orders, a good deal as the confidence man works his oily wiles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\">\u201cThe New York traducer of the bottling trade traveling man will probably be prompt with his little apology in his April issue, but Ms animus is plain enough, and the fraternity has seen him in Ms true light.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-10\">\u2019 \u201cOf course, slander aside, there is but one side to the question in so far as it involves advertising and traveling salesmen. The two are co-operative in every sense. Both are good and both are necessary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-11\">\"Acute Botts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-12\">\u201cFrom Texas \u2018Grandoldtaxes.\u2019 one of the best known traveling representatives in the line, writes that \u2018the editor of the National Bottlers\u2019 Gazette must be suffering from a ease of acute botts. Don\u2019t think his advertising scheme will work, and he will find the number of traveling men increasing year by year just the same as in the past.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-13\">The court dismissed the complaint on demurrer, and plaintiff brings error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AIn\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b525-14\">The following is the opinion of the trial judge:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b525-15\">Defendant has interposed a demurrer to the separate defense and various partial defenses herein. Upon demurrer the court may search the complaint and determine at the outset whether the article complained of is libelous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-16\">\u2022 In this ease the complaint is drawn upon the theory that the article is libelous per se. The language used is certainly not to be commended, but as I read the article it does not affect the reputation of the plaintiff. See Cohen v. New York <em>Times Co. </em>(Sup.) 138 N. Y. Supp. 206, for a <em>recoin </em>ami <em>interesting </em>discussion oil the law of libel. Any one reading this article would see at a glance that it is merely a discussion of the question as to whether traveling men are desirable in the bottling trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-17\">It is far-fetched to say that the article means that the plaintiff is demented, or is suffering from a loathsome disease, or is guilty of a crime or a tort. This article, -of course, must be read as a whole, and in connection with the article in the plaintiff\u2019s paper which provoked it. The expression, \u201cThe New York traducer of the bottling trade traveling man,\u201d is nothing more than a statement that the plaintiff\u2019s opinion and description of \u201cthe bottling trade traveling man\u201d is unfair, it may be remarked in passing that slander is not a crime, as asserted by plaintiff, and that it is not a tort as against a general class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>For the reasons briefly outlined, I am of the opinion that the article is not libelous per se, and for that reason the complaint must be dismissed.
