Both the referee and the District Court rejected the claim, their opinions dealing with some questions that we do not find it necessary to discuss. The facts disclose an unusual situation, and should therefore be stated in some detail:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Wm. G. Johnston (who is still living) was a wealthy resident of Pittsburgh, among whose possessions was a prosperous business conducted under the name of Wm. G. Johnston &amp; Co.

Johnston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cWitness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\"Eleanor 1). Johnston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">From the internal evidence the foregoing instrument was probably not drawn by a lawyer, but its general objects are not in doubt. The settlor understands it to be a permanent, and not merely a temporary, arrangement; for he does not reserve the right-to revoke it, and in several particulars it is the plain equivalent of a last will. Clearly, also, he knows that he is relinquishing control, and is making a final settlement in trust. He speaks of it as a trust, and he repeatedly refers to his son Stewart and his son-in-law, the bankrupt, as trustees, He does not regard them as employes, but as members of his family, upon whom he may lay a family burden. He directs that they shall perform their duties without compensation, and he reserves the right to revoke their appointment and to appoint other trustees at his pleasure. He agrees to convey certain specified real estate, requiring the trustees to pay taxes, insurance, and repairs; also giving them power lo sell and directing how the proceeds shall be disposed of. He provides that they shall pay the premiums upon certain life insurance policies referred to specifically in article 9. He requires them to pay a specified rent for the building in which the business is to be continued, and to' pay taxes, interest, insurance, and repairs; and he agrees to transfer to them all the assets of Wm. G. Johnston &amp; Co., distinctly stating that the transfer is in trust for certain purposes, among these being the payment to himself of $7,500 a year during his life. He provides with care that his debts shall be paid, retains full power to inspect the books whenever he pleases, requires frequent and full information concerning the business, and even specifies by whom notes and checks shall be drawn or indorsed. Then he confides to the bankrupt the special management and superintendence of the business (in.addition to liis other duties as trustee), and gives him $100 a week as a charge against the business, whether profits are made or not. increasing this sum if one-fourth of the net profits should exceed $5,200. The trustees also are given the option to divide any surplus arising from the profits of the business, and from the rents, profits, and proceeds of the real estate, among the children, share and share alike; and at their discretion they may make partition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>real estate in the same manner. When the paper was prepared, the settlor apparently intended that the beneficiaries should assent to it \u25a0by their signatures; but this was not done. Its provisions, however, were carried out, and the bankrupt acted under it for nearly 18 years, giving practically all his time and .attention to the business of William G. Johnston &amp; Co. For the year 1911, his share of the net profits was ascertained to be $12,690.97, and after deducting the sum of $100 per week, the disputed balance of $7,490.97 was left, all of which he claimed to be exempt as wages or salary, relying upon the statutes of Pennsylvania, and especially upon the act of 1845 (P. L. 459), the proviso to section 5 declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\u201cThat the wages of any laborers, or the salary of any person in public or private employment, shall not be liable to attachment in the hands of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADmz\">In our opinion, the sum in controversy is, neither \u201cwages\u201d nor \u201csalary\u201d in the hands of an employer, and is not exempt from execution 'finder the statutes of Pennsylvania. The bankrupt was not a servant, nor was Wm. G. Johnston a master or employer, in any customary or allowable sense of these terms; indeed, the settlor was deliberately leaving the class of employers altogether, with no apparent intention of resuming his place. As already stated, the transaction was a voluntary settlement in trust; the bankrupt was one of the trustees; the settlor and the other persons named were the beneficiaries; and the compensation to b\u2019e paid to the bankrupt, while it was, of course, intended to be remuneration for his services in performing a part of his duties as trustee, cannot be classed with either \u201cwages\u201d or \u201csalary.\u201d These terms may not always be easy to define with exactness, and they are sometimes difficult to discriminate; but the scope of each term has its limitations, and we feel able to say with confidence that neither term is, or can be, applied to the compensation earned by a trustee \u2014 save perhaps occasionally in careless and unconventional speech. Certainly in a statute, where words are always presumed to hear their ordinary meaning, we do not see how we can give to either of them the exceptional reach now contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
