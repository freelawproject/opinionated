It appears clearly enough that this was a very strongly built vessel; that is, it was niade strong wdien it was changed to a barge to carry a deck cargo. It seems to have been taken very good care of; there were several occasions on which it was put in drydock and put in order \u2014 the last time not very long before this accident. It seems to have carried heavy cargoes well up to three or four months before this accident. After that time she was carrying this copper ore, and the evidence is that the largest cargo of this ore which she carried before this one which capsized was about 350 tons. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b910-16\">Now, it is quite natural that the owners of this barge should have supposed that she was in good order, but the rule is fundamental that in contracts of affreightment the vessel must be seaworthy. It is not of any consequence whether the owner supposed it was seaworthy, or whether he had used his best efforts to ascertain whether she was seaworthy. It is an absolute requirement that she be seaworthy, based on the ground of public policy. The ordinary cargo owner does not know, and has no means of knowing, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>dition of the vessel, and the owner is bound to have a vessel that is seaworthy at the beginning of the voyage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b911-4\">This is a ease of a barge lying at Erie Basin loaded with 550 or 600 tons on deck, and in apparently good order, and at about half past 5 in the morning it careens. It has been suggested that there might have been some swell from passing ferryboats, or that she might have been bumped into and injured by some other vessel. There is not a shred of evidence to that effect, and indeed the evidence of two men that slept on the boat shows that they heard nothing at all the entire night. 1 think if there had been anything of any serious nature like a collision with another vessel, or heavy enough swells to move the vessel sufficiently to injure her, they would have been awakened and known of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b911-5\">The burden is on the owners to show that she was seaworthy. This barge careened and threw off her cargo while lying in a protected basin, without any evidence of anything whatever having happened to her. It seems to me a ease of res ipsa loquitur; no vessel ought to do that if she is seaworthy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b911-6\">I think the fair inference to be drawn is that she was taken down by the light loads which she had previously carried, and this load. The captain says that after she was pumped out she did not take in water any more, which she would have done if there had been a leak below the point to which she was submerged before they put a heavy load on. The evidence shows that it could be seen that tills seam was started after the careening, and it might have been caused of course by the careening itself, or might have existed before. There seems to have been a strip about 18 inches long where the oakum was loose as distinguished from the rest of the oakum in the seam, and I think the inference probably is that there is where the leak occurred. At all events, it is obvious that there must have been a leak and that water got in through it and caused the boat to careen, and I think that the leak must have occurred somewhere above the line at which she was sunk when she was light and the line at which she sunk by this heavy load. She therefore was not seaworthy for such a load, as there was a x&gt;lace there <em>where </em>the water would come in when so heavy a load was put on the barge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b911-7\">The result is that there must be a decree for the libelant for the damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b911-8\">Foley <em>&amp; </em>Martin, <em>o' </em>New York City (E.

The contract provided expressly that the respondents should \u201c'furnish only seaworthy boats.\u201d Under it they were bound to furnish siich boats; it was not a question whether they used due diligence to furnish them. So it was immaterial whether the respondents were common or special carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">The sudden capsizing of the vessel under the conditions shown raised a presumption of unseaworthiness which the evidence offered did not rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The arbitration provision was not a bar to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Nothing further need be added to the opinion of Judge Holt, and consequently the decree appealed from is affirmed with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
