But the provision that the charterers shall provide and pay for \u201call the coals\u201d specifically refers to coal, and we find nothing in that provision or in the other provisions requiring the phrase to be limited to coal used for steaming purposes. If it were shown that galley coal was kept separate from .the general supply, there would be more ground for that construction.. But this was not shown. Upon the whole, we think that the District Court properly interpreted the charter as requiring the charterers to pay for galley as well as other coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-17\">The decree is affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
