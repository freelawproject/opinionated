He sued Fidelity and its investment adviser under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b), claiming that Fidelity was paying the adviser too large a fee. The district court ruled that Evangelist\u2019s claim was basically \u201cequitable,\u201d not \u201clegal\u201d in nature, and that Evangelist was therefore not entitled to a trial before a jury. Evangelist asks us to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a jury trial. <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 472, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>S.Ct. 894, 897, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962); <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 511, 79 S.Ct. 948, 957, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959). The district court asked the right question \u2014 whether the claim is one \u2018at law\u2019 or \u2018in equity\u2019 \u2014 for the Seventh Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to a jury trial in civil cases extends only to suits at \u201ccommon law,\u201d U.S. Const., Amend. VII; it does not include cases that courts would have considered as arising in equity prior to the merger of law and equity in 1938. <em>Pernell v. Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 375, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 1729, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974). In our view, the district court also came up with the right answer. Petitioner is not entitled to a trial by jury here, for petitioner\u2019s claim is basically \u2018equitable\u2019 in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The statute under which the petitioner pursues his claim says that, on behalf of an investment company like Fidelity, the Securities and Exchange Commission or a shareholder can sue the company\u2019s investment adviser \u201cfor breach of fiduciary duty in respect of\u201d the investment adviser\u2019s \u201ccompensation.\u201d <em>(See </em>Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>Two opinions in the Second Circuit (one by a district court and one by the circuit court of appeals) have thoroughly discussed the arguments for and against the conclusion that Congress intended (and constitutionally could intend) that the typical claim arising under this statute would be tried before a judge alone, without a jury. <em>Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., </em>487 F.Supp. 999, 1005 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>mandamus denied sub nom. In re Gartenberg, </em>636 F.2d 16 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 910, 101 S.Ct. 1979, 68 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981). Both courts concluded that Congress intended (and could intend) a judge-tried action, basically for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">First, the statute creates a near classical \u2018breach of fiduciary duty\u2019 cause of action. The statute refers to the standard that it imposes as one of \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d; it says that the action need not involve tortious conduct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(l) (no need to show \u201cpersonal misconduct\u201d); it does not require a showing of breach of contract, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(2) (any contract will be given \u201csuch consideration as is ... appropriate\u201d). Actions for breach of fiduciary duty, historically speaking, are almost uniformly actions \u2018in equity\u2019 \u2014 carrying with them no right to trial by jury. <em>Restatement of Restitution, </em>introductory note at 9 (1937) (\u201c[Ejquity still retains jurisdiction of nearly all situations involving a breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Second, the statute\u2019s legislative history makes clear that Congress thought it was creating an action \u2018in equity.\u2019 <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 91-184, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, at 4897, 4911 (section authorizes \u201can equitable action involving a claim of fiduciary duty\u201d); H.Rep. No. 91-1382, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970) at 38 (same); H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 91-1631, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News at 4943 (section defines relationship governed by \u201cequitable standards\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Hearings before the Sub-comm. on Commerce and Finance of the House Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Nov. 12 \u2014 Dec. 11, 1969, Serial No. 91-33 at 796, (statement of Judge Henry J. Friendly, stating, in reference to different bills designed to deal with the same subject, that \u201cactions to recover unreasonable fees are equitable in nature, [and] would be tried to judges and not to juries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Third, the remedy Congress created \u2014 the payment of any excess fee to the company \u2014 is similar to the traditional equity remedy of an \u201caccounting,\u201d <em>see Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 176, 75 S.Ct. 249, 249, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955); <em>cf. Medtronic, Inc. v. Intermedics, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 440, 443-44 (7th Cir.1984) (discussing history and nature of equitable accounting); <em>see also </em>H. McClintock, <em>Handbook of the Principles of Equity </em>(2d ed. 1937) \u00a7 200 at 537 n. 2 (only one case of account at law in New York before 1842 and not more than a dozen in two centuries in England). Like other remedies of restitution, that remedy requires one owing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>fiduciary duty to pay to the beneficiary of that obligation \u2014 to \u201cdisgorge\u201d \u2014 money taken in derogation of the duty. <em>Curtis v. Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 197, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 1009, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974). <em>See generally </em>E. Re, <em>Remedies </em>298, 683-755 (1982); D. Dobbs, <em>The Law of Remedies </em>222-78, 683-84 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">On the other hand, we recognize that, against these three arguments, one can point to the appearance of the word \u201cdamages\u201d in one of the statute\u2019s subsections. That subsection reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">... no damages or other relief shall be granted against any other person other than the recipient of such compensation or payments. No award of damages shall be recoverable for any period prior to one year before the action was instituted. Any award of damages against such recipient shall be limited to the actual damages resulting from the breach of fiduciary duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(3). This use of the word \u201cdamages,\u201d as well as the limitation on recovery contained in the last sentence, distinguishes this action to a degree from traditional equitable monetary remedies like an accounting or other forms of restitution, for those equitable monetary remedies often include recovery of profits on the money the unfaithful fiduciary has taken; here the statute not only uses a word, \u201cdamages,\u201d that is traditionally associated with \u2018legal\u2019 remedies but also limits liability to the amount <em>taken </em>from the company. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 91-184, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, at 4911 (damages \u201cmay not exceed the amount of the payments received\u201d by the investment adviser).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">This limitation of recovery, however, is in fact neutral in respect to the issue before us. It makes the action look neither more \u201cequitable\u201d nor more \u201clegal.\u201d Granted, insofar as the limitation prevents recovery of profits generated by any excess payment, it makes the action look less like an equitable \u2018accounting\u2019 and hence more like a \u2018legal\u2019 remedy. But, as the legislative history makes clear, the limitation also prevents the company from recovering any <em>special </em>damages that the excess payments may have caused. Insofar as it prevents the recovery of special damages in excess of the payments made by the investment company, the limitation makes the action look less like a \u2018tort\u2019 or \u2018contract\u2019 remedy and more like \u2018restitution,\u2019 which is conventionally understood as an \u2018equitable\u2019 remedy. <em>In re Seatrade Corporation, </em>345 F.2d 785, 787 (2d Cir.1965) (per curiam) (\u201crestitutionary remedies are basically equitable in nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In respect to the fact that the statute uses the <em>word </em>\u201cdamages,\u201d the district court in <em>Gartenberg, supra, </em>stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">[I]t seems likely from the context that Congress was using \u201cdamages\u201d merely as a shorthand for \u201crecovery of money,\u201d not as a legal term of art. Since ... not all claims for monetary relief are legal in nature, the use of the term \u201cdamages\u201d is not persuasive in this instance. In particular, given the repeated statement in the legislative history that actions under \u00a7 36(b) are equitable, to be administered on equitable standards, it would seem impossible to conclude from the use of the word \u201cdamages\u201d that Congress thereby provided for a trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar\"><em>Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., </em>487 F.Supp. at 1006. We agree with the <em>Gartenberg </em>court. The simple use of the word \u201cdamages,\u201d in light of the other evidence of Congressional intent, is not sufficient to show that Congress intended to create an action \u2018at law\u2019 in the typical \u00a7 80a-35 case. And, the similarities between this action and classical equity actions \u2014 the first and third considerations mentioned above \u2014 show sufficient resemblance to classical pre-1938 actions in equity for accounting or restitution to allow the statute to pass muster under the Seventh Amendment. <em>Cf. Pernell v. Southall Realty, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">In sum, we agree with the Second Circuit, <em>for </em>reasons more fully set out in the two <em>Gartenberg </em>cases. The plaintiff in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>typical \u00a7 80a-35 case \u2014 presenting a claim that rests solely upon breach of fiduciary duty \u2014 is not entitled to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The remaining question in this case is whether the action before us, for some reason, falls outside the <em>Gartenberg </em>rationale. Petitioner makes two arguments that it does. First, he points out that his complaint asks for \u201cdamages.\u201d In <em>Gartenberg </em>plaintiff brought a derivative action on behalf of the company seeking repayment to the company of excess investment adviser fees. His prayer for relief, in relevant part, asked the court to require the adviser \u201cto account to the Trust for all excessive advisory fees.\u201d In the case before us the petitioner has brought an identical action, alleging excessive fees that breach the adviser\u2019s \u201cfiduciary duty to the Trust.\u201d The request for relief, however, does not use the word \u201caccount,\u201d but, instead, asks the court to require the adviser \u201cto pay to the Trust its damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We can find no significant differences of any sort between the two complaints except that one uses the word \u201caccount\u201d while the other uses the word \u201cdamages.\u201d And, in our view, the right to a jury trial cannot turn on the simple substitution of a different word. <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 477-78, 82 S.Ct. 894, 899-900, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962) (\u201cthe constitutional right to a trial by jury cannot be made to depend on the choice of words used in the pleadings\u201d); <em>cf. Medtronic, Inc. v. Intermedics, Inc., </em>725 F.2d at 443 (\u201ca suit for damages is not equitable merely because the plaintiff describes his action as one for an accounting\u201d). Otherwise, any equitable action for money, say for restitution, could become a legal action by the use of the word \u201cdamages\u201d in place of the word \u201crestitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Petitioner cites various cases in support of his argument that at least sometimes one can view a breach of fiduciary duty claim as setting forth an action at law, not in equity. We agree that <em>sometimes </em>this is so. Historically, a plaintiff under certain circumstances would occasionally bring an action for accounting <em>at law, </em>where, for example, no breach of fiduciary duty is at issue. <em>See, e.g., Restatement of Restitution </em>\u00a7 124, comment a and \u00a7 125, comment a (1937) (accounting by non-fiduciary for property received from third person). Conduct that breaches a fiduciary duty might <em>also </em>violate other legal rules; it might constitute a tort (such as fraud) or breach of contract. In each of the cases cited by petitioner, the relevant conduct was alleged to violate some such other legal principle, so it is not surprising that the courts viewed the complaint at issue as setting forth a claim for damages at law. <em>Ross v. Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. 531 at 542, 90 S.Ct. 733 at 740, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970) (breach of contract and gross negligence); <em>Bruce v. Bohanon, </em>436 F.2d 733, 736 (10th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 918, 91 S.Ct. 2227, 29 L.Ed.2d 694 (1971) (tortious misappropriation of trade information); <em>National Union Elec. Corp. v. Wilson, </em>434 F.2d 986, 987-88 (6th Cir.1970) (conspiracy to defraud); <em>Halladay v. Verschoor, </em>381 F.2d 100, 109 (8th Cir.1967) (fraudulent transactions); <em>DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., </em>323 F.2d 826, 836-37 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 950, 84 S.Ct. 969, 11 L.Ed.2d 970 (1964) (gross negligence: \u201cWhere a claim of breach of fiduciary duty is predicated upon underlying conduct, such as negligence, which is actionable in a direct suit at common law, the issue of whether there has been such a breach is ... a jury question.\u201d); <em>Robine v. Ryan, </em>310 F.2d 797, 798 (2d Cir.1962) (wrongful appropriation); <em>Kelly v. Dolan, </em>233 F. 635, 637 (3rd Cir.1916) (negligence). Here, however, the claim is solely one for breach of fiduciary duty under \u00a7 80a-35. <em>Cf. Moses v. Burgin, </em>445 F.2d 369, 384 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Johnson v. Moses, </em>404 U.S. 994, 92 S.Ct. 532, 30 L.Ed.2d 547 (1971) (award of damages for gross misconduct under former \u00a7 80a-35); <em>Tanzer v. Huffines, </em>314 F.Supp. 189, 196 (D.Del.1970) (allegations of gross misconduct under former \u00a7 80a-35 would allow relief both in damages and equitable accounting).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Second, petitioner argues that he has brought a different claim along with his \u00a7 80a-35 claim. This different claim charges misrepresentation, a classical tort action brought \u2018at law.\u2019 He says that this fact entitles him to a jury trial on both his (legal) misrepresentation charge and also his \u00a7 80a-35 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">This argument, however, suffers from three defects, each one of which is fatal. For one thing, joining a legal with an equitable claim does not give a plaintiff a right to a jury trial on the equitable claim. Rather, at most it gives the plaintiff a right to have the jury decide common issues of fact, and hence, it can provide a right to have the legal claim tried first. <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 334-35, 99 S.Ct. 645, 653-54, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979); <em>Ross v. Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. at 540, 90 S.Ct. at 739; <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. at 510, 79 S.Ct. at 956. Here, plaintiff has shown no common issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">For another thing, the district court here granted summary judgment for the defendant on the legal misrepresentation claim. Hence, there is nothing \u2018legal\u2019 to try first. Apparently, the petitioner intends to appeal the dismissal of his misrepresentation claim. But, we are aware of no authority giving a plaintiff the right to have a <em>dismissed </em>legal claim tried first (or tried at all) simply because it might be reinstated on appeal. And, to imagine such a right is to imagine an accompanying degree of administrative chaos.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Finally, the respondent here says, without contradiction, that the petitioner never raised this issue in the court below. Thus, in any event, we need not investigate it further. <em>Cf. Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">For these reasons, the petition for writ of mandamus is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u00a7 80a-35. Breach of fiduciary duty</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">(a) The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district court of the United States, or in the United States court of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the following capacities has engaged within five years of the commencement of the action or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct in respect of any registered investment company for which such person so serves or acts\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">(1) as officer, director, member of any advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount certificate company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">If such allegations are established, the court may enjoin such persons from acting in any or all such capacities either permanently or temporarily and award such injunctive or other relief against such person as may be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances having due regard to the protection of investors and to the effectuation of the policies declared in section 1(b) of this title [15 USCS \u00a7 80a-l(b)].</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">(b) For the purposes of this subsection, the investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by such registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof, to such investment adviser or any affiliated person of such investment adviser.
