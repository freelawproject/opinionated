Claimant went through a marriage ceremony with decedent in 1968 and lived with him until his death in 1978. The problem, however, is that there is a record that decedent had earlier (in 1961) married one Elpidia Espinosa, but there is no record that Elpidia and decedent ever divorced. (Records of decedent\u2019s divorces from his other three wives were found.) Hence, Elpidia claimed she was the decedent\u2019s legal widow, and the Secretary so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">To qualify for mother\u2019s benefits, claimant had to establish, among other things, that she was the \u201cwidow\u201d of the deceased. Determination of her status as widow was governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h). Potentially there were two ways claimant could qualify: under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(A) as the \u201clegal\u201d widow of decedent or under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) as the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">1. Legal Widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The first way claimant could have established her status as widow was to show that \u201cthe courts of the state in which [decedent] was domiciled at the time of death\u201d would find that claimant and decedent were \u201cvalidly married\u201d at the time of death. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(A). Decedent was domiciled in Puerto Rico at the time of death, and hence Puerto Rico law controlled. The Secretary stated Puerto Rico law to be as follows: \u201cWhere there are two or more conflicting marriages the latter marriage is presumed valid absent proof that the prior marriage was contracted and that it did not terminate. The burden of proof rests with the spouse of the prior marriage.\u201d Claimant has not challenged this construction of Puerto Rico law, and we therefore accept it. She does dispute, however, the Secretary\u2019s finding that Elpidia Espinosa satisfied her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The evidence in support of the Secretary\u2019s finding that Elpidia was the legal widow (i.e., that Elpidia was validly married to decedent at the time of his death) was a letter from a civil registry in Mexico attesting to decedent\u2019s marriage to Elpidia in Mexico on November 9, 1961, a letter from a Mexican civil registry official stating there was no record Elpidia and decedent had been divorced, and a statement that Puerto Rico records had been searched for evidence of such a divorce and none found. Additionally, the deceased\u2019s father stated that decedent had married Elpidia in Mexico, that they had had marital difficulties, that the deceased had left thinking he was divorced from Elpidia because Elpidia had told the deceased she had arranged their divorce, and that as far as the father knew the deceased never divorced Elpidia.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Claimant, too, at one point acknowledged decedent had married Elpidia \u2014 in her December 28, 1981 application for benefits she reported Elpidia married decedent in 1961 but that decedent had sworn to her that he and Elpidia were divorced in Mexico \u2014 though in an earlier statement (June 1, 1981) claimant said decedent had referred to Elpidia as an extra-marital affair and had never said anything about having gone through a ceremonial marriage with Elpidia.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">To begin with, we reject claimant\u2019s attack on Elpidia\u2019s failure to file an original of her marriage certificate to decedent, the ALJ\u2019s failure to accord claimant a second hearing, and the AU\u2019s failure to subpoena Elpidia (who lives in Mexico). These matters are covered adequately in the Appeals Council opinion. See also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-707(b)(1) (certified copies of extracts from records accepted; original documents not always required); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.725(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Claimant, who did not marry decedent until 1968, argues that it was impossible for decedent to have married Elpidia in Mexico in November 1961 because decedent was studying medicine in Spain at that time and decedent had been deported from Mexico in 1960 and hence would not have been able to reenter Mexico in 1961. In support, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>she points principally to two documents. The first is an affidavit decedent executed in 1968 in application for a temporary work permit. The affidavit gave decedent\u2019s educational background and stated he had passed certain courses at the University of Madrid from 1960 to 1962. The second is a 1964 letter from the United States Embassy in Mexico to decedent's father which referred to a 1960 deportation for drug addiction and stated decedent was currently being detained by immigration authorities in Mexico because he had returned to Mexico without authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The Secretary reasoned that the fact decedent had studied in Spain in 1961 did not mean he could not have travelled to Mexico and married Elpidia in November of that year. We note that the records from the University of Madrid suggest decedent\u2019s course work ended in May 1961. Hence it is entirely possible claimant could have managed to enter Mexico thereafter and marry Elpidia. On this record the matter was one for the Secretary to resolve, and the Secretary\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Next, claimant argues that even if decedent was in Mexico on November 9, 1961 and purported to go through a marriage ceremony with Elpidia, the purported marriage is completely void and of no effect under either Mexican or Puerto Rico law because, in view of the 1960 deportation, claimant was illegally in Mexico and therefore could not enter into any valid contract. Claimant says this result is mandated by a civil code provision reading, \u201cWhatever is done in contravention of a prohibitory law, is void, although the nullity be not formally directed.\u201d Because decedent\u2019s entrance into Mexico was, claimant says, \u201cin contravention of\u201d Mexican law, every contract claimant thereafter purported to execute, including a marriage one, was void. Claimant has directed us to nothing suggesting the code provision would be interpreted in such an embracive manner. Rather, the more logical reading as applied to this case would be that the act in direct contravention of law \u2014 the entrance into Mexico \u2014 was considered void (in other words it did not legalize claimant\u2019s entry), but not acts such as buying groceries at a market or getting married which have little to do with immigration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Hence, we conclude the Secretary\u2019s finding that Elpidia is the legal widow is supported by substantial evidence and not infected by legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">2. Deemed widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The second way in which claimant could have qualified as a widow was under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B). To satisfy \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B), a person such as claimant, living with a wage earner at the time of his death, must at a minimum show that she went through a marriage ceremony in good faith and that, but for a legal impediment unknown to her at the time of the ceremony, the marriage would have been valid. The Secretary concluded claimant satisfied this requirement. For simplicity, we will refer to this as the \u201cgood faith marriage\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The central dispute in the case, however, is whether \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) also imposes a second requirement before a deemed widow can qualify for benefits \u2014 namely, that a legal widow neither \u201cis [n]or has been entitled to benefits.\u201d In other words, if a legal widow has once collected benefits, even though she is not currently receiving any, is a person who has met the good faith marriage requirement barred from benefits? The issue is crucial here because Elpidia did collect mother\u2019s benefits for a time before they terminated in August 1980 when Nora, the daughter of Elpidia and decedent, turned 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">We turn to the statute. Section 416(h)(1)(B) was added to the Social Security Act in 1960. Prior thereto, spousal status was determined solely on the basis of the provision just considered, \u00a7 416(h)(1)(A). The first sentence of \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) generally sets forth the good faith marriage requirement under which a marriage can be deemed valid. The second sentence then says,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u201cThe provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply (i) if another person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>is or has been </em>entitled to <em>a benefit </em>under subsection (b) [wife\u2019s insurance benefits], (c) [husband\u2019s insurance benefits], (e) [widow\u2019s insurance benefits], (f) [widower\u2019s insurance benefits], or (g) [mother\u2019s and father\u2019s insurance benefits] of section 402 of this title on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual and such other person is (or is deemed to be) a wife, widow, husband, or widower of such insured individual under subparagraph (A) at the time [the] applicant files the application____\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">It is the interpretation of the \u201cis or has been entitled to a benefit\u201d clause which is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The literal reading of the clause is clear and would seem to say just what the Secretary says it means \u2014 namely, that once a legal widow either is or has received some benefit, no matter how little, the deemed widow is disqualified from receiving benefits. This is the interpretation a number of courts have adopted. <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d 428 (6th Cir.1981) (where legal widow received widow\u2019s benefits from 5/26/72 until her remarriage in 10/18/72 which terminated her entitlement to widow\u2019s benefits, deemed widow applying for widow\u2019s benefits in 1973 not entitled to them because of legal widow\u2019s prior receipt of benefits), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1165, 102 S.Ct. 1039, 71 L.Ed.2d 321 (1982). See also <em>White v. Schweiker, </em>709 F.2d 247 (3d Cir.1983) (deemed widow may not collect widow\u2019s benefits since legal widow is collecting them); <em>Davis v. Califano, </em>603 F.2d 618 (7th Cir.1979) (same). These courts have viewed the \u201cis or has been entitled to a benefit\u201d clause as clear, leaving no room for construction, and have concluded Congress acknowledged the plight of deemed widows but limited to a substantial extent their entitlement to benefits. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Other courts have rejected a literal reading. See <em>Woodson v. Schweiker, </em>656 F.2d 1169 (5th Cir.1981) (while legal widow and deemed widow could not concurrently collect benefits, after the legal widow\u2019s mother\u2019s benefits terminated on her remarriage, the deemed widow could collect benefits); <em>Rosenberg v. Richardson, </em>538 F.2d 487 (2nd Cir.1976) (benefits of a legal widow already receiving social security benefits on basis of her own salary were increased only $1.40 per month by husband\u2019s death; deemed widow and legal widow may concurrently collect benefits, deemed widow\u2019s to be in the amount of the difference between the full widow\u2019s benefit the deemed widow would have received but for the legal widow\u2019s application and the amount by which the legal widow\u2019s benefits were increased by virtue of her certification as legal widow); <em>Capitano v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>732 F.2d 1066 (2nd Cir.1984) (reaffirming <em>Rosenberg </em>); <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d 428, 433 (McKay, J. dissenting). The reasoning of the latter cases is that the \u201cis or has been entitled to a benefit\u201d clause, read mechanically, emasculates the statute, renders much of it illusory, and is inequitable. These courts see the purpose of the clause as limited to preventing \u201cdouble dipping\u201d on the federal treasury. In other words, it prohibits a variety of mates from <em>concurrently </em>drawing <em>full </em>Social Security benefits on the basis of the decedent\u2019s account by according preference to the legal widow, but does not otherwise disqualify the deemed widow from benefits. Thus, for example, when the legal widow\u2019s benefits have terminated due, say, to remarriage, the deemed widow, if otherwise eligible, may collect.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The second circuit in allowing a legal widow and a deemed widow concurrently to receive benefits concluded that only if a legal widow had received <em>full </em>benefits would a deemed widow automatically be disqualified by the legal widow\u2019s receipt of benefits. It thus read the phrase \u201cis or has been entitled to a benefit\u201d to mean \u201cis or has been entitled to a <em>full </em>benefit\u201d and relied on legislative history, S.Rep. No. 1856, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1960] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 3608, 3629, 3684-85, to reach this result. <em>Rosenberg, </em>538 F.2d at 491. We find that legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tive history unhelpful. It restates the statute without analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The argument that a literal interpretation of the \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d clause tends to make any benefit \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) purports to confer largely illusory has more appeal, but ultimately we are not convinced by it. The illusion is said to inhere in this. Generally, when a deemed widow applies for benefits, the existence of a legal widow is unknown to the Secretary and often to the applicant herself. In other words, the deemed widow usually does not rely on \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B), the section enacted to entitle deemed widows to benefits, but rather relies on \u00a7 416(h)(1)(A), the section pertaining to legal widows. Therefore, initially \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) serves little purpose. When, however, a competing legal widow does file and establish a claim and hence \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) could be of avail to the deemed widow, literal application of the \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d phrase disqualifies the deemed widow from receiving any further benefits. Hence under a literal interpretation of the exclusion clause, \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) assists deemed widows \u201conly in the unusual case where no \u2018legal widow\u2019 has ever been certified to receive a benefit [but] ... the Secretary [has] nonetheless learn[ed] of the impediment to the \u2018deemed widow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d at 434-435 (McKay, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We do not know how usual or unusual it is for spouses either to know or to harbor a suspicion or nagging doubt that perhaps there is some legal impediment to their marriage. Nor do we know how many such impediments might come to the Secretary\u2019s attention in the absence of an application from a competing spouse. Thus we are not in a position to judge that \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) is necessarily illusory when the \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d clause is given its literal interpretation. Section 416(h)(1)(B) does allow a spouse who did not know of the marriage impediment \u201cat the time of [the] ceremony,\u201d but who learns of it later, to apply for benefits as if he or she had been validly married. And benefits may be collected provided the legal spouse neither \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d to benefits. Furthermore, under the third sentence of \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B), the benefits of the deemed spouse do not terminate until \u201cthe month before the month\u201d in which the Secretary certifies another as the legal spouse. Thus, though the deemed spouse is in a less favored position than the legal spouse, we are not convinced that the benefits \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) does confer, even when the \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d clause is given its plain and literal meaning, are illusory. Harsh as the result may seem in this and similar cases, we see no basis to depart from a literal and plain reading on the statute or to think that Congress intended any other result.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
