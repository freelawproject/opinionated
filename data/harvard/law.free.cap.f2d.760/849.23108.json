(\u201cTWA\u201d), and his union, defendant International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the \u201cUnion\u201d), alleging that TWA breached a collective bargaining agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), and that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. The district court, applying the six-month statute of limitations found in \u00a7 10(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act (the \u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), held the action to be time-barred and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">This dispute arose when TWA failed to reassign plaintiff to the work shift of his choice.' Plaintiff felt he was entitled to the assignment under the terms of the Agreement because of his seniority. Accordingly, plaintiff had the Union file a grievance on his behalf. TWA denied relief at each of three steps in the grievance process created under the Agreement. While a System Board of Adjustment (the \u201cBoard\u201d) could review a Step 3 denial of relief, discretion to appeal to the Board rested exclusively with the Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a letter dated November 3, 1981, the Union officially informed plaintiff that TWA had denied his Step 3 appeal and that his \u201cgrievance will not be processed any further.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff retained counsel, who corresponded with TWA and the Union in an attempt to obtain Board arbitration. By letter dated December 14, 1981, counsel for the Union explained that plaintiff\u2019s claim lacked merit. He concluded: \u201cIf you have any comments, I would be pleased to receive them in writing; but as matters now stand, the Union denies your request to convene the System Board and will oppose any actions you may take to present Mr. Dozier\u2019s grievance to it.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel accepted the invitation and mailed his comments. The Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ion\u2019s counsel quickly responded in a letter dated February 1, 1982. He acknowledged receipt of the comments, but reiterated that \u201c[w]e simply disagree on your characterizations of the merits of the grievance and the manner in which it was processed. For these reasons, and the reasons stated in my December 14, 1981 letter, the Union declines to submit the grievance to the System Board of Adjustment.\u201d On June 22, 1982, this action was filed under the Railway Labor Act (the \u201cRLA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Plaintiff first argues that the six-month limitation period found in \u00a7 10(b) of the LMRA does not apply to actions such as this brought under the RLA. In <em>Del-Costello, </em>the Supreme Court opted for a uniform limitations period for claims brought under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. While conceding that the \u201cmost closely analogous statute of limitations under state law\u201d would normally apply (absent an express limitations period in the statute), the Court nevertheless concluded that the \u201cfederal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make [a uniform federal rule] a significantly more appropriate vehicle for intersticial lawmaking.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2287 and 2294. In particular, the Court reasoned that the six-month period contained in \u00a7 10(b) reflected \u201cthe proper balance between the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements, and an employee\u2019s interest in setting aside what he views as an unjust settlement under the collective bargaining system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2294 <em>(quoting United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 70, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 1567, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981) (Stewart, J., concurring)). The same policies that led the Court to adopt a federal limitations statute for hybrid claims brought under the LMRA apply with equal force to actions brought under the RLA, which similarly governs labor-management disputes although only in common-carrier industries. Thus, the reasoning and analysis of <em>Del-Costello </em>control in the instant case. This holding is in accord with decisions of other circuits that have applied the six-month statute of limitations to hybrid actions brought under the RLA. <em>Barnett v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 358 (10th Cir. 1984); <em>Welyczko v. U.S. Air, Inc., </em>733 F.2d 239 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Sisco v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>732 F.2d 1188 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Hunt v. Missouri Pacific R.R., </em>729 F.2d 578 (8th Cir.1984) (by implication); <em>Barina v. Gulf Trading and Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d 560, 563 n. 6 (9th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Plaintiff next argues that even if the six-month period applies, certain events tolled its running until about four months before he filed suit. At the very least, he urges us to remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on when the period began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The limitations period under the RLA \u201cgenerally begins to run when \u2018the claimant discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the acts constituting the alleged [breach of duty].\u2019 \u201d <em>Metz v. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc., </em>715 F.2d 299, 304 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Hungerford v. United States, </em>307 F.2d 99, 102 (9th Cir.1962), <em>overruled on other grounds, Ramirez v. U.S., </em>567 F.2d 854 (9th Cir.1977)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 976, 79 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984). <em>Cf. Vallone v. Local Union No. 705, </em>755 F.2d 520, 522 (7th Cir.1984). The complained of breach here occurred when the Union declined to appeal TWA\u2019s denial of relief to the Board. Plaintiff was apprised of this decision by letter dated November 3, 1981. Plaintiff, however, claims that the message contained in the notice was equivocal, and that the Union refrained from finally deciding not to take the matter to the Board only in February, 1982 \u2014 within six months of the complaint\u2019s June 22,1982 filing date. We cannot agree. The Union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>informed plaintiff in no uncertain terms in the November 3 letter that \u201cyour grievance will not be processed any further.\u201d This clear sentiment appeared in every future communication received by plaintiff from the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">A decision by the Union not to proceed with a grievance \u201cis no less final a determination than an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Vallone, </em>755 F.2d at 522. Even the complaint indicates \u201c[t]hat some time in November, 1981, the plaintiff was informed that his grievance was denied____\u201d And while the Union continued to respond to plaintiffs requests for a hearing before the Board, the courtesy it extended him should not be viewed as procrastination sufficient to toll the statute. Otherwise, a plaintiff could indefinitely delay resolution of labor disputes merely by bombarding his union with tiresome requests for needless review. This defeats the congressional policy of rapid resolution of labor disputes behind the RLA (as well as the LMRA). 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a. <em>See United Parcel Service, </em>451 U.S. at 63, 101 S.Ct. 1564.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-13\">.

Plaintiff also received a copy of a letter, dated November 4, 1981, that originally was sent to another union official.

Therefore, this grievance will not be processed any further.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">.
