Rutter while on sick leave from the New York City Police Department as the result of an injury received in the line of duty are excludable from gross income as amounts received under either a workmen\u2019s compensation act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1), or a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act, Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.104-l(b) (1982). Finding that these payments meet neither qualification, we conclude that they are not excludable from Rutter\u2019s gross income and affirm the order and decision of the tax court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Although Rutter served as a New York City police officer during most of the taxable year 1978, he was absent from work for approximately six months of that year due to an injury sustained in the line of duty in 1972. During that absence, he received sick leave payments totaling $10,873.45. These payments were made pursuant to a labor contract between the City of New York and the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association of New York, Inc. The relevant portion of the contract provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa9S\">[e]ach employee shall be entitled to leave with pay for the full period of any incapacity due to illness, injury or mental or physical defect, <em>whether or not service-connected.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The parties stipulated that this section of the labor contract is \u201cconsistent with\u201d \u00a7 434a-14.0(c) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which provides that the New York City police commissioner is authorized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">to deduct and withhold salary from any member or members of the force for or on account of absence for any cause without leave, lost time, sickness or other disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">On his 1978 federal income tax return, Rutter claimed an exclusion from gross income for the amount he had received as sick leave payments during that tax year, but the commissioner disallowed this amount in full. The tax court upheld the commissioner\u2019s determination and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including compensation for services. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a). Under \u00a7 104(a)(1), however, \u201camounts received under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries of sickness\u201d are excluded from gross income. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1). Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.104-1 interprets \u00a7 104(a)(1) to exclude from gross income any amounts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">received by an employee under a workmen\u2019s compensation act * * * <em>or under a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act </em>which provides compensation to employees for personal injuries or sickness incurred in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">Rutter does not claim that the plain language of the statute, \u00a7 104(a)(1), allows him to exclude his sick leave pay from gross income, since his sick leave pay was obviously not received \u201cunder a workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d. Rutter does contend, however, that he qualifies under the regulation, \u00a7 1.104-1, which allows for the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>elusion of payments made \u201cunder a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">To qualify under the regulation, however, Rutter must first show that he received his sick leave pay pursuant to a \u201cstatute\u201d, and this he cannot do. We recognize that courts have not limited the interpretation of the term \u201cstatute\u201d in this section to state or federal statutes or city ordinances. For example, in <em>Dyer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>71 T.C. 560 (1979), the petitioner received sick leave payments pursuant to regulations of the Board of Education of the City of New York, and, reasoning that \u201c[t]hese regulations [had] the force and effect of law\u201d, the tax court found that the payments were made under a \u201cstatute\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 104(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">However, Rutter\u2019s payments were not made pursuant to a regulation, but pursuant to a labor contract. A regulation, like a statute, is a rule of general applicability promulgated by a public agency to govern conduct within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. A labor contract, unlike a statute, is an agreement between union and employer, modifiable at any time. That this particular labor contract involved a public employer is irrelevant to the legislative purposes behind the workmen\u2019s compensation exclusion, and does not convert the contract into a \u201cstatute\u201d. Finally, Rutter does not cite, nor have we found, any case holding that the term \u201cstatute\u201d in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.104-l(b) can be stretched to include a labor contract. In short, we hold that Rutter\u2019s sick leave payments are not excludable from his gross income because the labor contract under which they were paid does not qualify as a statute within the meaning of the regulation. <em>See </em>Rev.Rul. 83-77, 1983-1 C.B. 37, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Rutter also argues that \u00a7 434a-14.0(c) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York may be viewed as a \u201cstatute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d under which he received his sick leave payments. There are two flaws to this argument. First, Rutter did not receive his sick leave payments pursuant to this section; as he has stipulated, the payments were made pursuant to the labor contract. The fact that the parties also stipulated that the contract is \u201cconsistent with\u201d this section of the New York City Administrative Code does not alter the basis for Rutter\u2019s sick leave payments. This section of the administrative code simply provides that the police commissioner is authorized to <em>deduct and withhold salary </em>from any member of the force \u201cfor or on account of absence for any cause without leave, lost time, sickness or other disability * * * \u201d. As suggested by the fact that \u00a7 434a-14.0 is entitled \u201cDiscipline of members\u201d, the section is intended to give the police commissioner the authority, within certain limits, to withhold pay on the account of absence, rather than to affirmatively authorize payments on account of disability or sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Second, even if we were to assume that Rutter somehow received his payments under this section, he still could not succeed because the section is not a statute \u201cin the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act\u201d. Unless a statute contains some provision restricting the payment of benefits to cases of work-related disabilities, it is not in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation statute. <em>Clifford v. Commissioner, </em>48 T.C.M. 1984-426; <em>see Riley v. United States, </em>156 F.Supp. 751, 752, 140 Ct.Cl. 381 (1957). Under the scheme for New York City policemen all sick leave is compensated, whether work related or not. Rutter\u2019s argument that his payments should qualify because they were in fact the result of a work-related injury is unavailing. In determining whether such payments are excludable from gross income, the regulation charges us to look to the nature of the statute, rather than the source of the injury, and a statute that does not distinguish between work-related injuries and other types of injuries is not \u201cin the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation statute\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">We also reject Rutter's claim that the commissioner erred when he applied Rev. Rul. 83-77, promulgated in 1983, retroactively to Rutter\u2019s case. The commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>has discretion to retroactively apply his regulations and rulings, <em>Dixon v. United States, </em>381 U.S. 68, 71, 85 S.Ct. 1301, 1303, 14 L.Ed.2d 223 (1965); <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(b), and nothing in the record indicates that the commissioner abused that discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
