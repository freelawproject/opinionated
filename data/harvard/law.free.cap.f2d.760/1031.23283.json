Secretary Heckler contends that the district court erred in finding that the Grant Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human Services abused its discretion in disallowing the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-28\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"A-m\">Under the Medicaid program, authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396n, and implemented in part by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456 (1984), the Secretary provides, partial reimbursement to the States for services that locally-run \u201cintermediate care facilities\u201d (ICFs)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provide to patients who qualify for such services under Medicaid. To demonstrate effective control over the utilization of long-term inpatient services in ICFs, the State is required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.360 to show that a physician has certified each patient\u2019s need for ICF services and has recertified that need every 60 days. If the State fails to make a satisfactory showing of certification and recertification, the Secretary will decrease federal matching funds available to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. In January 1981, federal reviewers performed an onsite utilization control validation survey at ten ICFs throughout Hawaii. The purpose of the survey was to verify whether the ICFs had satisfied the statutory requirements for certification, recertification, and updating of patient care plans during the period from July 1, 1980, through September 30, 1980. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the HHS agency conducting the survey, found that nine out of the ten ICFs surveyed in Hawaii failed to meet the requirements for physician certification and recertification. HCFA then informed Hawaii that the Secretary planned to reduce Hawaii\u2019s federal financial participation by $401,215.64, a dis-allowance later recalculated to $494,927.39 for eight facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Hawaii appealed to the Grant Appeals Board. The Board upheld the disallowance in the increased amount. The Board concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that signed and dated physician orders from Hale Nani Health Center and Maluhia Hospital were not adequate recertifications because they \u201cdo not contain an express statement indicating that continued care at the ICF level is necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">Hawaii filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on May 3, 1983, to enjoin the Secretary from implementing the Board\u2019s decision. On June 21, 1984, the district court granted summary judgment for the Secretary on the portion of the disallowance ($324,988.63) relating to six facilities, and for Hawaii on the portion of the disallowance ($169,938.76) relating to Hale Nani Health Center and Maluhia Hospital. The Secretary appeals that portion of the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment for Hawaii with regard to Hale Nani and Maluhia. Hawaii does not challenge the district court\u2019s decision relating to the six other facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment. <em>Blau v. Del Monte Corp., </em>748 F.2d 1348, 1352 (9th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Lojek v. Thomas, </em>716 F.2d 675, 677 (9th Cir.1983)). Under the Administrative Procedure Act, we set aside an agency\u2019s action only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 414, 91 S.Ct. 814, 822, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>Regents of the University of California v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 1387, 1393 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Villa View Community Hospital, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 1086, 1090 (9th Cir.1983). We must therefore determine whether the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in disallowing the payments to Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-12\">During the three-month period in 1980 for which federal reviewers surveyed Hawaii\u2019s ICFs, an action transmittal issued by the Secretary, SRS-AT-75-122 (AT-75-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>122), set forth the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the certification and recertification requirements of the federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g), and its implementing regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.360. We give substantial deference to an interpretation of a statute made by the agency charged with administering and enforcing the statute. <em>Blum v. Bacon, </em>457 U.S. 132, 141, 102 S.Ct. 2355, 2361, 72 L.Ed.2d 728 (1982). In an introductory paragraph, AT-75-122 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-5\">Recertification is the process by which a physician attests to an individual\u2019s need for continued placement at a specific level of care <em>at least every 60 days.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">After stating that recertification must be in writing and must be signed by a physician, AT-75-122 further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-7\">3. The ... State agency must describe in its written methods and procedures for UC [i.e., utilization control] what type of documentation it will require for recertification. Some examples are listed below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-8\">a. Signed and dated physician statement that continuation of the specific level of care is necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-9\">b. <em>Signed and dated physician orders indicating need for continuation of care </em>[emphasis added];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-10\">c. Signed and dated progress notes indicating the need for continued care____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">The Secretary maintains that the signed and dated physician\u2019s orders submitted by Hawaii for Hale Nani Health Center and Maluhia Hospital under 3b of AT-75-122 do not satisfy the regulation because the orders do not explicitly state the need for continued care at the ICF level. Hawaii argues that the orders, which do indicate a need for continuation of medical care,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are precisely what the Secretary described in 3b as an example of acceptable documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">We agree with Hawaii. The Secretary\u2019s regulation at 3b clearly states that a \u201cphysician order indicating need for continuation of care\u201d would be acceptable as a recertification document. \u25a0 Hawaii simply followed the Secretary\u2019s clear example. The physician orders Hawaii submitted may not have satisfied the Board, but they did conform to the explicit terms of the transmittal, i.e., AT-75-122 at 3b, which the Secretary herself issued. She cannot now say that documents that satisfy the precise words of AT-75-122 at 3b are not acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-16\">The Secretary asks that we disregard the specific language in 3b. The Secretary contends that the introductory paragraph defining recertification as \u201ca physician\u2019s attestation of an individual\u2019s need for continued placement at a specific level of care\u201d requires an explicit statement of the need for a specific level of care and controls the list of examples of acceptable documentation. The Secretary would have us read each example listed in AT-75-122 to require the specificity indicated only in the first example, 3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">Yet even the Secretary has implicitly acknowledged that AT-75-122 did not adequately stress the importance of an explicit indication of the specific level of care needed. The Secretary amended AT-75-122 in SRS-AT-80-68 (AT-80-68), which was effective October 1, 1980, the very next day after the period for which Hawaii\u2019s ICFs were surveyed. AT-80-68 corrects AT-75-122\u2019s defects, and the Secretary has labeled AT-80-68 a \u201cclarification\u201d of what constitutes a valid certification and recertification. AT-80-68\u2019s language shows that it was meant to clarify AT-75-122. AT-80-68 specifies that \u201c[a] recertification will <em>only </em>be acceptable if it evidences the physician\u2019s determination that continual care is required at a particular level,\u201d and 3b now gives as an example of acceptable documentation \u201csigned and dated physician orders <em>which clearly indicate a need for continuation of care at a specific level </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Under AT-80-68, Hawaii\u2019s documents for Hale Nani Health Center and Maluhia Hospital would not have been acceptable. Under AT-75-122, which was in effect during the period in question, they should have been acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>We hold it was an abuse of discretion for the Board to insist that recertification example 3b in AT-75-122 required something more than what its language clearly indicated. While we should defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of her own regulations, we need not honor an interpretation that is unreasonable. <em>See Loma Linda University v. Schweiker, </em>705 F.2d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.1983). It was unreasonable for the Board to conclude that AT-75-122 required the same documentation as its replacement, AT-80-68. If AT-75-122 had required the level of specificity that the Secretary argues it did, there would have been no need for the Secretary to issue a \u201cclarification\u201d at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">. Intermediate care facilities are defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.150(a)(1) (1984) as facilities that \"[fjully [meet] the requirements for a State license to provide, on a regular basis, health-related services to individuals who do not require hospital or skilled nursing facility care, but whose mental or physical condition requires services that \u2014 (i) [a]re above the level of room and board; and (ii) [c]an be made available only through institutional facilities.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">.
