EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AdC\">The petitioner, Mary Jane Ruderman Hirschey, seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs as the prevailing party in a case against the Government arising under the Federal Power Act (\u201cFPA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her initial petition before this court, we upheld Hirschey\u2019s claim for an exemption from the licensing requirements of the FPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is on this judgment that the petitioner now seeks fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">We must deny the petitioner\u2019s claim for costs as barred by section 317 of the FPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find, however, that the petitioner is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for counsel time expended in pursuit of her claim in this court. We remand to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d or \u201cthe Commission\u201d) the question whether Hirschey is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for the proceedings before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">The FPA makes it unlawful to construct, operate or maintain a hydroelectric project without a license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, under a congressional authorization contained in the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (\u201cPURPA\u201d), FERC may in its discretion grant an exemption from the licensing requirements to small hydroelectric power projects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to PURPA, FERC has adopted regulations setting forth procedures governing exemption applications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\">Hirschey filed an application for an exemption on December 16, 1981. The Commission accepted her application for filing on February 5, 1982, and the exemption was approved by operation of law on June 7, 1982. When no party made a timely request for rehearing before the Commission, the application became unreviewable on July 7, 1982.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, on July 20, 1982, the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>issued an order vacating the exemption. On Hirschey\u2019s petition for review in this court, we found \u201cno legitimate basis\u201d for the Commission\u2019s action, and accordingly held that FERC \u201cacted without statutory authorization in vacating the petitioner\u2019s exemption.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Within 30 days of the issuance of our mandate, Hirschey applied to this court for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">A. <em>Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The Equal Access to Justice Act provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\"><em>Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, </em>a judgment for costs, as enumerated in section 1920 of this title, but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys, may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency____<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The Commission argues that costs may not be assessed against the Government in this case because section 317 of the FPA specifically proscribes the assessment of costs against the Commission in judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hirschey responds that, since we found that FERC acted outside its statutory authority in vacating the license exemption, the Commission did not function under the authority of the Federal Power Act and therefore that Act simply does not apply to this case. Instead, Hirschey contends that the exemption rights at issue in this case are found in the 1980 amendments to PURPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">We reject the petitioner\u2019s contentions. In revoking Hirschey\u2019s exemption, the Commission purported to rely on its authority under the FPA, citing both section 313(a) of the FPA \u2014 which gives FERC the authority to modify or set aside any order or finding until the administrative record is filed in an appellate court<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 and section 309 of the FPA, which gives FERC the general authority to make and revoke orders, rules and regulations as \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d to carry out the provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree with the Commission that, in the first <em>Hirschey </em>decision, the validity of the revocation turned on our interpretation of the Commission\u2019s authority under the FPA. Furthermore, it is absolutely clear that our jurisdiction in the case was rooted in the FPA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the petitioner is hard pressed to suggest that this case did not arise under the Federal Power Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Because section 317 of the FPA plainly states that \u201c[n]o cost shall be assessed against the Commission in any judicial proceeding by or against the Commission under this Chapter,\u201d we deny the petitioner\u2019s request for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">1. ' <em>The Alleged Linkage Between Costs and Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">The petitioner\u2019s claim for fees is grounded in EAJA, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-19\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort) brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-20\">As a threshold matter, we consider the question whether EAJA conditions an award of attorney\u2019s fees upon an award of costs, thus proscribing an award of fees where costs are disallowed under a separate statute. The Government urges us to adopt this theory of \u201clinkage\u201d between costs and fees on the ground that the language in subsection 2412(d)(1)(A) of EAJA, which permits the prevailing party to recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a),\u201d somehow precludes an award of fees when the latter cannot be <em>added to </em>an award of costs. In our view, this \u201clinkage\u201d argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ment is based on patently flawed premises and a wholly untenable reading of EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Upon careful consideration of the issue, we hold that, under EAJA, an award of costs is not a necessary condition to an award of fees. First, the plain language of the statute in no sense compels the conclusion that costs and fees are inseverable. Second, the structure of the statute suggests a clear distinction between awards of costs and fees. Third, we note that several other circuits considering this issue have rejected the \u201clinkage\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On its face, the Government\u2019s argument is a thinly veiled attempt to turn the fee <em>granting </em>language of subsection 2412(d)(1)(A) of EAJA into <em>limiting </em>language that would deny fees unless costs are awarded. In this effort, the Government principally relies on the statutory language that says that fees shall be awarded \u201cin addition to any costs awarded.\u201d In our view, the \u201cin addition to\u201d language merely expresses the intent of Congress that, under subsection 2412(d)(1)(A), qualified prevailing parties shall be awarded attorney\u2019s fees and, when available, costs as well. Indeed, it is significant that the subsection (d) language <em>\u201cany </em>costs\u201d appears to us clearly to embrace a concept of zero costs. We therefore reject the contention that the \u201cin addition to\u201d language must be read as words of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It is noteworthy that the \u201cip addition to\u201d language stands in striking contrast to certain unambiguous words of limitation in subsection (d)(1)(A). For instance, the provision allows for the award of fees <em>\u201c[ejxcept as </em>otherwise specifically provided by statute,\u201d in any civil action <em>\u201cother than </em>cases sounding in tort,\u201d to a prevailing party <em>\u201cunless </em>the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d Since it is obvious that Congress knew how to use words of limitation when they were intended, we will not read \u201cin addition to\u201d to mean \u201cbut only if\u201d or \u201cso long as.\u201d We do not believe that \u201cin addition to\u201d purports any irrevocable linkage between fees and costs, and we will not adopt the Government\u2019s tortured reading of the statute in order to reach the result urged upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The structure and history of EAJA also support our interpretation. The predecessor statute to EAJA specified that costs, but not fees, could be recovered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In EAJA, Congress expressly authorized awards of <em>both </em>costs and fees, but under distinct subsections and according to different standards. As already noted, subsection 2412(a) provides that costs, but not attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cmay be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action.\u201d The only requirement for an award of costs is that the party requesting costs must have prevailed in a civil action brought by or against the Government. However, an award of fees to a prevailing party under subsection 2412(d)(1)(A) is qualified by the phrase \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d The standards for an award of attorney\u2019s fees are patently narrower than, and thus distinct from, those for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Furthermore, although hardly dispositive of this case, we note , that the legislative history of EAJA nowhere even suggests that the award of fees is predicated upon an awards of costs. If anything, the history emphasizes a distinct and separate treatment of costs and fees under the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>At least three other circuit courts have specifically rejected the Government\u2019s \u201clinkage\u201d argument, and have held that an award of fees under subsection 2412(d) of EAJA is not conditioned upon an award of costs under subsection 2412(a). <em>See United States v. 341.45 Acres of Land, St. Louis County, Minnesota, </em>751 F.2d 924, 934 (8th Cir.1984) (\u201cwe do not read \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) to condition an award of attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses upon an award of costs\u201d); <em>Washington Urban League v. FERC, </em>743 F.2d 166, 167 n. 1 (3rd Cir.1984) (same); <em>United States v. 329.73 Acres, Grenada and Yalobusha Counties, </em>704 F.2d 800, 808 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc) (\u201cIf there is an anomaly in the matter of <em>court costs, </em>either intentional or through inadvertence, the anomaly was created by Congress. Such anomaly, if indeed it is one, does not justify our failure as a court to ignore Congress\u2019 plainly expressed intention that <em>attorneys\u2019 fees </em>and <em>litigation expenses </em>may be awarded in condemnation cases unreasonably litigated by the government.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We can find no good basis upon which to disagree with the position followed by a majority of the circuits that have considered the issue now before us. Accordingly, we too reject the Government\u2019s \u201clinkage\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">2. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Eligibility for Attorney\u2019s Fees Under EAJA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">There can be no serious doubt over Hirschey\u2019s eligibility for a fee award in this case. EAJA provides for a mandatory award of counsel fees to a qualified,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> prevailing party,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> unless the United States can show that its position was substantially justified or that there were special circumstances making a fee award unjust.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Government bears the burden of demonstrating that its position was substantially justified<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and we find that the United States has not satisfied that burden here. We also find no special circumstances to preclude an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">In deciding whether the Government\u2019s litigation position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d we focus on whether the Government had a \u201creasonable basis in both law and fact.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We find it had neither. In our original opinion in <em>Hirschey, </em>we found \u201cno legitimate basis for FERC\u2019s asserted authority,\u201d and held that FERC \u201cacted without statutory authorization\u201d in vacating the petitioner\u2019s license exemption.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As for FERC\u2019s argument that it needed to conduct a comparative evaluation of competing license claims, we ruled that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in any statute, regulation or proven Commission practice to indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>cate that the petitioner\u2019s application could not be granted without a comparative evaluation.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In short, even a cursory review of our first opinion in <em>Hirschey </em>makes it plain that this court gave no credit whatsoever to the arguments advanced by the agency. In this light, it can hardly be urged that the Government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">3. <em>The Appropriate Amount Due in Attorney\u2019s Fees for Proceedings at the Judicial Level</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In connection with her application for fees at the judicial level, the petitioner already has submitted to the court certain documentation in support of her claim. FERC, however, has requested a period of discovery in the event we determine \u2014 as we do here \u2014 that Hirschey is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The petitioner has assented to the Government\u2019s request for discovery, and we approve. Discovery will afford the Government an opportunity to assess the petitioner\u2019s claim and to frame any objections that it intends to raise with respect to the amount of fees requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Within thirty days of the issuance of our mandate here, the petitioner must provide this court with adequate documentation to support her request for attorney\u2019s fees, including any request for the fees incurred in the instant proceeding. In preparing these materials, the petitioner is advised to comply with the documentary requirements outlined in <em>National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Government will have thirty days following the submission of the petitioner\u2019s documentation within which to conduct any necessary discovery and to respond. Following the Commission\u2019s response, the petitioner will have ten days within which to log her reply. We will then make our determination as to the amount of fees due.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Because there already has been an inordinate delay in the processing of this claim, we will look with extreme disfavor on any requests for extensions of the prescribed timetable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">4. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Entitlement to Attorney\u2019s Fees for Proceedings Before the Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">As a part of the instant claim for fees, the petitioner has requested an amount in excess of $12,000.00 for counsel representation during the proceedings before FERC. The Government has opposed this request on the ground that the proceeding before the Commission was not an \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d for which attorney\u2019s fees are available under either 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(3).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">On the claim for fees for proceedings at the agency level, it is clear that the petitioner is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In other words, it does not matter that the petitioner\u2019s claim was initially rejected by the agency because she was ultimately vindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cated in her appeal to this court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It would appear, however, that the petitioner is foreclosed from claiming fees for proceedings before the agency unless those proceedings involved an \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d; and, if there is such a requirement, then it must be determined whether the proceedings before FERC in this case satisfied the \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Commission has not as yet had an opportunity to address the \u201cadversary adjudication\u201d issue, and we find the present record inadequate to support an informed judicial determination on this question. Accordingly, we will remand the petitioner\u2019s claim for fees for proceedings at the agency level to allow for initial consideration by FERC. Unless the agency finds that fees are precluded,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> it should establish a schedule for resolving the amount of fees due Hirschey at that level. The agency\u2019s decision will, of course, be subject to judicial review if necessary.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We hold that, although the petitioner is not eligible for an award of costs here, as prevailing party she is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under EAJA for proceedings at the judicial level. Accordingly, we have established a time schedule within which the Government may engage in any necessary discovery and the parties may proffer submissions concerning the amount of fees due.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">As for the petitioner\u2019s request for fees for proceedings at the agency level, we remand the matter for consideration and initial determination by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\n<em>So Ordered</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\">.

FERC, </em>749 F.2d 1367, 1369 (9th Cir.1984), and the dissenting opinion of Judge Rubin in <em>United States v. 329.73 Acres of Land, </em>704 F.2d 800, 813, 817 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc), that in requiring the award of \u201cfees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a),\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1982), conditions the award of fees and expenses upon the award of costs. Since I agree with the majority that costs cannot be awarded in the present case by reason of the prohibition in the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825p (1982), which prohibition is not eliminated by the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a), the recovery of fees and expenses is also barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Though I acknowledge that the language \u201cin addition to any costs awarded\u201d is not the clearest way of expressing such a condition, I believe the language bears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>interpretation, which is preferable for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">(1) It would be extraordinary for Congress to provide for recovery of such items as attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness expenses while positively prohibiting award of the much more basic element of court costs. The statutory scheme should not be interpreted to produce such a result when it is avoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">(2) Even without reference to the positive prohibition of costs under the Federal Power Act, \u00a7 2412 itself produces a strange result if the subject phrase is not interpreted as a condition. It makes the award of costs, when they are permissible, discretionary (subsection (a)), but the independent award of attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses <em>mandatory </em>(subsection (d)(1)(A)). That is, to say the least, an improbable intent. The only way to avoid that result without interpreting the subject phrase as a condition is to say, as did the Eighth Circuit, that the qualifying phrase means that \u201cprevailing parties shall be awarded attorney\u2019s fees and, when available, costs as well,\u201d <em>United States v. 341.45 Acres of Land, More or Less, </em>751 F.2d 924, 935 (8th Cir.1984) \u2014 that is, to interpret the phrase not as conditioning the mandatory grant of attorneys\u2019 fees, but as <em>extending </em>that mandatory grant to costs. The problem with this interpretation is that the language will not bear it. The qualifying phrase is \u201cin addition to any costs <em>awarded </em>pursuant to subsection (a)\u201d (which subsection provides for a discretionary award), <em>not </em>\u201cin addition to any costs <em>awardable </em>pursuant to subsection (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The legislative history provides no specific answer to this question, but does suggest that Congress regarded the award of costs and the award of expenses as linked \u2014indeed, that Congress sometimes failed to recognize any distinction between the two for purposes of subsection (d). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1980); S.Rep. No. 253, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 7-9 (1979). The only disposition which the language of the statute will bear that produces this similar treatment is the interpretation suggested above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
