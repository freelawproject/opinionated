Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">On November 1, 1984, Storie Lynn Orta was arrested on a federal complaint charging her with conspiracy to possess and intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (1982). Bail was set at $500,000. At the time of her arrest, Orta was approximately five months pregnant. The grand jury indictment charging Orta was filed on November 8, 1984. On the same day, Orta filed a motion to reduce bond and the United States moved for a pretrial detention hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">The presiding magistrate held Orta\u2019s detention hearing on November 8, 1984. After considering the evidence, the magistrate concluded: \u201cno condition of release for [the] defendant, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(b), will reasonably assure [her] appearance * * * in court as required and will protect both the public at large and any cooperating individuals from retaliation or intimidation.\u201d <em>United States v. Orta, </em>No. 84-209Cr(1), slip op. at 6 (E.D.Mo. Nov. 13, 1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">The district court reviewed the magistrate\u2019s detention order and denied Orta\u2019s motion for rehearing and amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The court held the \u201cpre-trial provisions of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 were correctly applied in this case.\u201d <em>United States v. Orta, </em>No. 84-209Cr(1), slip op. at 2 (E.D.Mo. Nov. 21, 1984).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Orta appealed the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to this court. On December 14, 1984, we entered an order remanding Orta\u2019s case to the district court and instructing the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">[To determine] [w]hether defendant\u2019s activities may be adequately monitored by the United States Marshals Service and/or by the federal probation office for the Eastern District of Missouri so that defendant is not likely to constitute any danger to the public including witnesses for the prosecution and so that her appearance in court may be assured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aezk\"><em>United States v. Orta, </em>No. 84-2530 (8th Cir. Dec. 14, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The district court directed the magistrate to conduct a second evidentiary hearing and to file a report and recommendation on the remanded issues. After the supplemental hearing, the magistrate determined the new evidence did not contradict the findings and conclusions in his original order, and recommended that Orta be denied bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Orta filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and requested a hearing before the district court. On December 28, 1984, the district court accepted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and found that Orta\u2019s activities could not be monitored adequately to ensure compliance. The court reasoned that probation office or Marshal Service surveillance would not be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_-\">adequate or reasonable for the very reason that they cannot <em>guarantee </em>that defendant will not attempt to harm witnesses * * * or will not flee the jurisdiction * * * <em>Anything less than a guarantee </em>against such misconduct, especially where the record suggests that there is a <em>strong likelihood </em>of such misconduct, <em>is neither adequate nor reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbO\"><em>United States v. Orta, </em>No. 84-209Cr(1), slip op. at 1-2 (E.D.Mo. Dec. 28, 1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Orta appealed the district court\u2019s order. On January 21, 1985, this court held that the district court had erred in requiring a \u201cguarantee\u201d that Orta would not flee or compromise the community\u2019s safety. We remanded Orta\u2019s case to the district court for further hearing based on a legal standard requiring a <em>reasonable assurance </em>of Orta\u2019s appearance and lack of danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Orta argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s insistence on a \u201cguarantee\u201d she remain in the jurisdiction and pose no threat to the community is an erroneous interpretation of the pretrial detention provision of the Bail Reform Act of 1984.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>agree, and thus remanded this action to the district court for further consideration under the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">The Bail Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, tit. II, ch. 1,1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News (98 Stat.) 1976 (hereinafter cited as \u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), was a legislative response to growing public concern over increased crime and the perceived connection between crime and defendants released on bail. The legislative history explains that the 1984 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-5\">reflect[s] the Committee\u2019s determination that Federal bail laws must address the alarming problem of crimes committed by persons on release and must give the courts adequate authority to make release decisions that give appropriate recognition to the danger a person may pose to others if released. The adoption of these changes marks a significant departure from the basic philosophy of the [Superseded Bail Reform Act of 1966], which is that the sole purpose of bail laws must be to assure the appearance of the defendant at judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7x\">S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3182 at 3185-3186.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The major differences between the superseded Bail Reform Act and the 1984 Act pretrial release provisions relevant to this case are the prohibition against using inordinately high financial conditions to detain defendants, and the authorization to consider in determining release conditions or detention the danger a defendant may pose to the community or certain individuals. The two changes eliminate the judicial practice of employing high bail to detain defendants considered dangerous and substitute a procedure allowing the judicial officer openly to consider the threat a defendant may pose. The passage of the pretrial detention provision of the 1984 Act did not, however, signal a congressional intent to incarcerate wholesale the category of accused persons awaiting trial. Rather, Congress was demonstrating its concern about \u201ca small but identifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants as to whom neither the impostion [sic] of stringent release conditions nor the prospect of revocation of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community or other persons.\u201d S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-7, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3189. The legislative history stresses that \u201c[t]he decision to provide for pretrial detention is in no way a derogation of the importance of the defendant\u2019s interest in remaining at liberty prior to trial. * * * <em>It is anticipated that </em>[pretrial release] <em>will continue to be appropriate for the majority of Federal defendants.\u201d Id., </em>at 7, 12 <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3189 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Consistent with the intent expressed in the legislative history, the statutory scheme of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 continues to favor release over pretrial detention. Section 3142 provides four alternatives from which the judicial officer must choose: (1) release on personal recognizance or unsecured appearance bond,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or (2) release subject to certain conditions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or (3) temporary detention to permit, among other things, revocation of conditional release,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or (4) pretrial detention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judicial officer most often will be deciding between the first and the second alternatives. The statutorily mandated progression from one choice to the next is critical: a judicial officer cannot determine that a detention hearing and the possible imposition of pretrial detention is appropriate merely by determining that release on personal recognizance will not \u201creasonably assure\u201d the defendant\u2019s appearance at trial or \u201cwill endanger\u201d the community. The judicial officer must also consider whether one of the codified conditions or any combination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the conditions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> will \u201creasonably assure\u201d the defendant\u2019s appearance and the safety of the community.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The wide range of restrictions available ensures, as Congress intended, that very few defendants will be subject to pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">In Orta\u2019s case, the magistrate did not follow the statutory progression from release on personal recognizance to conditional release because the government moved upon Orta\u2019s arrest for an evidentiary hearing to consider the appropriateness of her release.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the hearing is designated a \u201cdetention hearing,\u201d the appellation is not completely accurate. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether any of the release options available to defendants not immediately subject to a detention hearing will satisfy the statutory safety and appearance concerns.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Only if the government<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> shows by clear and convincing evidence<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that no release condition or set of conditions will <em>reasonably assure </em>the safety of the community and<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> by a preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that no condition or set of conditions under subsection (c) will <em>reasonably assure </em>the defendant\u2019s appearance can a defendant be detained before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">In this case, the district court erred in interpreting the \u201creasonably assure\u201d standard set forth in the statute as a requirement that release conditions \u201cguarantee\u201d community safety and the defendant\u2019s appearance. Such an interpretation contradicts both the framework and the intent of the pretrial release and detention provision of the 1984 Act. Congress envisioned the pretrial detention of only a fraction of accused individuals awaiting trial. The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>trict court\u2019s interpretation, however, virtually mandates the detention of almost every pretrial defendant: no other safeguard can \u201cguarantee\u201d the avoidance of the statutory concerns.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Further, the burden on the government in most cases to show a defendant\u2019s dangerousness and flight propensity would be lessened considerably if the government need only show by clear and convincing evidence that no release condition could \u201cguarantee\u201d the community\u2019s safety and by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition could \u201cguarantee\u201d a defendant\u2019s appearance. The structure of the statute mandates every form of release be considered before detention may be imposed. That structure cannot be altered by building a \u201cguarantee\u201d requirement atop the legal criterion erected to evaluate release conditions in individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">We do not believe the \u201creasonably assure\u201d standard is an unduly difficult one to apply. The judicial officer cannot require more than an objectively reasonable assurance of community safety and the defendant\u2019s appearance at trial. This legal test ensures that, as in Storie Lynn Orta\u2019s case, defendants who can be released pending trial will be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">We hold in this supplemental opinion the district court erred in its interpretation of the pretrial release and detention provisions of the Bail Reform Act of 1984. We thus have remanded this action for further consideration.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">.

The January 21st order reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-10\">Before LAY, Chief Judge, and HEANEY, BRIGHT, ROSS, McMILLIAN, ARNOLD, John R. GIBSON, FAGG, and BOWMAN, Circuit Judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">ORDER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">On December 14, 1984, we remanded this case to the district court to determine whether Orta\u2019s activities could be adequately monitored so as to justify her release prior to trial. On remand, the district judge concluded that the United States Marshal\u2019s Service and the United States Probation Office could not <em>\u201cguarantee </em>that defendant will not attempt to harm witnesses * * * or flee the jurisdiction * * * \u2019\u2019 and that anything \"less than a <em>guarantee* * * </em>is neither adequate nor reasonable.\" Consequently, the district judge denied Orta\u2019s release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-13\">We conclude that the district judge applied an incorrect legal standard in ordering Orta\u2019s detention pending trial. The Bail Reform Act of 1984 provides that \u201d[i]f, after a hearing * * the judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions <em>will reasonably assure </em>the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community,\" the person shall be ordered detained prior to trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). The legal standard required by the Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees. Consequently, we must remand this action to the district judge for a further hearing and determination based on the appropriate legal standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-18\">A memorandum opinion addressing the issues upon appeal will follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-19\">LAY, Chief Judge, and HEANEY, BRIGHT, and McMILLIAN, Circuit Judges, concurring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-20\">We agree that the district judge applied an incorrect legal standard and that this case should be remanded. However, we would direct the district judge to release Orta pending trial and to conduct a hearing to determine the conditions of Orta\u2019s release.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b984-21\">. We note the magistrate appears to have applied incorrectly the pretrial release provisions in Orta\u2019s November 8 hearing. After finding the forms of release available under section 3142(b) will not meet the statutory safety and appearance concerns, the judicial officer must consider whether the more restrictive alternatives under section 3142(c) will assure community safety and the defendant\u2019s appearance before determining that detention is appropriate. <em>See infra </em>at 890.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b984-22\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b985-12\">. The district court did not disagree with the magistrate\u2019s findings that Orta had once struck a woman in the head with a revolver, that several weapons and various quantities of cocaine and marijuana had been found in Orta and her husband's places of residence, that Orta had been carrying a loaded gun in her purse, and that in both the matter at issue and another incident involving Orta and her husband, witnesses had been threatened or had expressed fears of reprisal. The length of sentence Orta could receive if found guilty was considered significant in determining Orta\u2019s propensity for flight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b985-13\">. Orta also challenges the pretrial detention provision on several constitutional grounds, including the fifth amendment due process clause and the eighth amendment prohibition against excessive bail. Orta did not, however, raise her constitutional arguments in the district court. Absent exceptional circumstances, we do not consider constitutional questions when unnecessary. <em>Dougherty v. White, </em>689 F.2d 142, 144 (8th Cir.1982). Although we intimate neither approval nor disapproval of any specific decision, we note the constitutional issues surrounding the pretrial detention provision have received attention in many of the opinions examining the Bail Reform Act of 1984. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kouyoumdjian, </em>601 F.Supp. 1506 (C.D.Cal.1985); <em>United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, </em>600 F.Supp. 501 (D.P.R.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>755 F.2d 203 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payden, </em>598 F.Supp. 1388 (S.D.N.Y.1984); <em>cf. United States v.

The difference between the legal standard set forth in subsection (b) and that found in subsections (c), (e), (f), and (g) reemphasizes congressional intent to preserve the statutory bias favoring pretrial release for most defendants. Subsection (b) directs release unless release \"will not reasonably assure\u201d the defendant\u2019s appearance, or \"will endanger\u201d the community\u2019s safety. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(b). Although the judicial officer may impose further restrictions upon a finding that the legal standard for either the flight or the danger concern is not met, a determination that a defendant\u2019s release <em>\u201cwill </em>endanger\u201d the community will be rare. In contrast, subsections (c), (e), (f), and (g) change the legal standard to require release if any set of conditions \"will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community * * 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(c), (e), (f), (g). The change from the negative to the positive in the flight determination standard and from \"will\u201d to \u201cwill reasonably assure\u201d in the dangerousness evaluation criterion renders it more difficult to find the defendant a flight and safety risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(2).

Orta\u2019s indictment and charge were based on provisions of United States Code Title 21 which give rise, upon the judicial officer\u2019s finding of probable cause, to a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the defendant\u2019s appearance and the safety of the community. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). We strongly encourage the finding of probable cause and the defendant\u2019s successful or failed rebuttal of the statutory presumptions be expressly discussed in cases applying section 3142(e). Further, although we do not decide the question in this case, we note the majority of cases thus far addressing the issue have held that the presumption shifts only the burden of production to the defendant; the burden of persuasion remains with the government. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Payden, </em>598 F.Supp. 1388, 1397 (S.D.N.Y.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b987-14\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b987-15\">. We do not decide today whether section 3142(e) requires the judicial officer to find that the defendant presents both a flight risk and a safety risk before she or he can be detained or whether the judicial officer can impose detention upon a finding of either flight or safety risk. <em>Cf. United States v.

The statute does not expressly state the appropriate evidentiary standard necessary to support a finding of propensity for flight, indicating the preponderance of evidence standard usually applied in pretrial proceedings is appropriate. <em>See United States v.

The Pretrial Services Act was intended to reduce both pretrial crime and the number of defendants detained unnecessarily while awaiting trial through programs increasing pretrial release supervision and services. <em>See </em>S.Rep.

We are informed that on remand the district court directed the magistrate to conduct a further supplemental hearing and file a report and recommendation with the district court. On January 30, 1985, the magistrate filed his report and recommendation describing conditions of release necessary to reasonably assure Orta would appear in court and would not endanger the community or particular individuals. The district court accepted the magistrate's report on February 7, 1985. On February 8, 1985, Orta agreed to comply with all the release conditions, but was unable to meet the financial security bond requirement. Because the Bail Reform Act of 1984 prohibits pretrial detention on the sole basis of an inability to satisfy a financial condition of release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(c), Orta was released upon execution of an appearance bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b988-9\">JOHN R.

The court in footnote 7 sets forth a number of facts in the record. The magistrate found a number of other facts that are of extreme significance. Not only was appellant carrying a loaded gun in her purse when she was arrested but another loaded revolver, a loaded shotgun, and yet another revolver were seized when she and her husband were arrested. There was evidence that she was sitting on one of the weapons when arrested. The magistrate found that Mrs. Orta and her husband were engaged in an armed confrontation with a person in another vehicle, although no weapons were fired. A loaded revolver belonging to Mrs. Orta was later found in their vehicle. The magistrate found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the Ortas resided in a home from which some fifteen to twenty shots were fired, some of which penetrated the walls of the house next door. On that occasion two Uzi semi-automatic rifles, which had been purchased by Mrs. Orta, were seized from the Ortas\u2019 vehicle. On two occasions witnesses expressed fear of reprisal. The court acknowledges the finding that Mrs. Orta struck a woman in the head with a pistol. This evidence is sufficient to support the finding that Mrs. Orta had endangered the public at large by the use of firearms. While appellant was an expectant mother when arrested, the public is entitled to protection from pistol-carrying mothersrto-be who have in the past shown propensities to use weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Because the order denying release was properly ruled by the district court before the remand that led to the utilization of the improper legal standard, I would affirm and deny release.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">\u00a7 3142. Release or detention of a defendant pending trial</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">(a) IN GENERAL. \u2014 Upon the appearance before a judicial officer of a person charged with an offense, the judicial officer shall issue an order that, pending trial, the person be\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\">(1) released on his personal recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">(2) released on a condition or combination of conditions pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">(3) temporarily detained to permit revocation of conditional release, deportation, or exclusion pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d);

and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-17\">(2) subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that he determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, which may include the condition that the person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-18\">(A) remain in the custody of a designated person, who agrees to supervise him and to report any violation of a release condition to the court, if the designated person is able reasonably to assure the judicial officer that the person will appear as required and will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-19\">(B) maintain employment, or, if unemployed, actively seek employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-20\">(C) maintain or commence an educational program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-21\">(D) abide by specified restrictions on his personal associations, place of abode, or travel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-22\">(E) avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime and with a potential witness who may testify concerning the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-23\">(F) report on a regular basis to a designated law enforcement agency, pretrial services agency, or other agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>(G) comply with a specified curfew;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-5\">(H) refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-6\">(I) refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any use of a narcotic drug or other controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802), without a prescription by a licensed medical practitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-7\">(J) undergo available medical or psychiatric treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, and remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">(K) execute an agreement to forfeit upon failing to appear as required, such designated property, including money, as is reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the person as required, and post with the court such indicia of ownership of the property or such percentage of the money as the judicial officer may specify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-9\">(L) execute a bail bond with solvent sureties in such amount as is reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the person as required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-10\">(M) return to custody for specified hours following release for employment, schooling, or other limited purposes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-11\">(N) satisfy any other condition that is reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the person as required and to assure the safety of any other person and the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">The judicial officer may not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the person. The judicial officer may at any time amend his order to impose additional or different conditions of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">(d) TEMPORARY DETENTION TO PERMIT REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL RELEASE, DEPORTATION, OR EXCLUSION. \u2014 If the judicial officer determines that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-14\">(1) the person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-15\">(A) is, and was at the time the offense was committed, on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-16\">(i) release pending trial for a felony under Federal, State, or local law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-17\">(ii) release pending imposition or execution of sentence, appeal of sentence or conviction, or completion of sentence, for any offense under Federal, State, or local law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-18\">(iii) probation or parole for any offense under Federal, State, or local law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-19\">(B) is not a citizen of the United States or lawfully admitted for permanent residence, as defined in section 101(a)(20) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) ); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-20\">(2) the person may flee or pose a danger or any other person or the community;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-21\">he shall order the detention of the person, for a period of not more than ten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and direct the attorney for the Government to notify the appropriate court, probation or parole official, or State or local law enforcement official, or the appropriate official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If the official fails or declines to take the person into custody during that period, the person shall be treated in accordance with the other provisions of this section, notwithstanding the applicability of other provisions of law governing release pending trial or deportation or exclusion proceedings. If temporary detention is sought under paragraph (1)(B), the person has the burden of proving to the court that he is a citizen of the United States or is lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">(e) DETENTION. \u2014 If, after a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f), the judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, he shall order the detention of the person prior to trial. In a case described in (f)(1), a rebuttable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community if the judge finds that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-5\">(1) the person has been convicted of a Federal offense that is described in subsection (f)(1), or of a State or local offense that would have been an offense described in subsection (f)(1) if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-6\">(2) the offense described in pararaph (1) was committed while the person was on release pending trial for a Federal, State, or local offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-7\">(3) a period of not more than five years has elapsed since the date of conviction, or the release of the person from imprisonment, for the offense described in paragraph (1), whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Subject to rebuttal by the person, it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person committed an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), section 1 of the Act of September 15, 1980 (21 U.S.C. 955a), or an offense under section 924(c) of title 18 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">(f) DETENTION HEARING. \u2014 The judicial officer shall hold a hearing to determine whether any condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (c) will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community in a case\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">(1) upon motion of the attorney for the Government, that involves\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">(A) a crime of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">(B) an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">(C) an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or section 1 of the Act of September 15, 1980 (21 U.S.C. 955a); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-15\">(D) any felony committed after the person had been convicted of two or more prior offense described in subparagraphs (A) through (C), or two or more State or local offenses that would have been offenses decribed in subparagraphs (A) through (C) if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-16\">(2) Upon motion of the attorney for the Government or upon the judicial officer\u2019s own motion, that involves\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-17\">(A) a serious risk that the person will flee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-18\">(B) a serious risk that the person will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-19\">The hearing shall be held immediately upon the person\u2019s first appearance before the judicial officer unless that person, or the attorney for the Government, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the person may not exceed five days, and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the Government may not exceed three days. During a continuance, the person shall be detained, and the judicial officer, on motion of the attorney for the Government or on his own motion, may order that, while in custody, a person who appears to be a narcotics addict receive a medical examination to determine whether he is an addict. At the hearing, the person has the right to be represented by counsel, and if he is financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed for him. The person shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his own behalf, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>proffer or otherwise. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. The facts the judicial officer uses to support a finding pursuant to subsection (e) that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. The person may be detained pending completion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">(g) FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.\u2014 The judicial officer shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, take into account the available information concerning\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence or involves a narcotic drug;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-7\">(2) the weight of the evidence against the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-8\">(3) the history and characteristics of the person, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-9\">(A) his character, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-10\">(B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, he was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State, or local law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-11\">(4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person\u2019s release. In considering the conditions of release described in subsection (c)(2)(K) or (c)(2)(L), the judicial officer may upon his own motion, or shall upon the motion of the Government, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to secure a bond, and shall decline to accept the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">(h) CONTENTS OF RELEASE ORDER. \u2014In a release order issued pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) or (c), the judicial officer shall\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-14\">(1) include a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the release is subject, in a manner sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the person\u2019s conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-15\">(2) advise the person of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-16\">(A) the penalties for violating a condition of release, including the penalties for committing an offense while on pretrial release;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-17\">(B) the consequences of violating a condition of release, including the immediate issuance of a warrant for the person\u2019s arrest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-18\">(C) the provisions of sections 1503 of this title (relating to intimidation of witnesses, jurors, and officers of the court), 1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), and 1513 (retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">(i) CONTENTS OF DETENTION ORDER. \u2014 In a detention order issued pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e), the judicial officer shall\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-20\">(1) include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-21\">(2) direct that the person be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-22\">(3) direct that the person be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with his counsel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-23\">(4) direct that, on order of a court of the United States or on request of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which the person is confined deliver the person to a United States marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person\u2019s defense or for another compelling reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">(j) PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.\u2014 Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
