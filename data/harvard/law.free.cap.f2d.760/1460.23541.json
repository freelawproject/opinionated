The regulation at issue prescribes a new formula for reimbursing Medicare health care providers for malpractice insurance premiums associated with the care of Medicare patients. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-452(a)(l)(ii) (1984) (the \u201cMalpractice Rule\u201d). The district courts below concluded that the Malpractice Rule was invalid because it was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to the Medicare Act and because the Secretary failed to provide an adequate basis and purpose statement. <em>St. James Hospital v. Heckler, </em>579 F.Supp. 757 (N.D.Ill.1984) (Will, J.); <em>Humana of Illinois, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>584 F.Supp. 618 (C.D.Ill.1984) (adopting Judge Will\u2019s decision).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-5\">A. The Malpractice Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-6\">Under the Medicare Act, a health care provider is entitled to government reimbursement for the lesser of the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services it provides for Medicare patients or its \u201ccustomary charges\u201d with respect to those services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b)(l) (1982). \u201cReasonable cost\u201d is defined as \u201cthe cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations\u201d to be promulgated by the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982). The statute further provides that such regulations shall take into account \u201cboth direct and indirect costs of providers of services ... in order that ... the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by [Medicare] will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by [Medicare] ____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1559-7\">With these directives in mind, the Secretary adopted regulations in 1966 that pooled all of a health care provider\u2019s general and administrative (\u201cG &amp; A\u201d) costs together and then allocated them among Medicare and non-Medicare patients on the basis of patient hospital usage (\u201cpatient utilization ratio\u201d). 31 Fed.Reg. 14,808 (1966) (codified at 20 C.F.R. Part 405, Sub-part D (1966)). For example, if Medicare patients constituted 30% of the patient charges at a hospital in a given year, then Medicare reimbursed the hospital for approximately 30% of its G &amp; A costs. G &amp; A costs included a variety of overhead expenses, including billing costs, accounting and legal fees, and all types of insurance premiums. This method of allocating indirect costs remained unchanged from 1966 until promulgation of the Malpractice Rule in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-11\">On March 15, 1979, the Secretary issued the proposed Malpractice. Rule for public comment. 44 Fed.Reg. 15,744 (Mar. 15, 1979). The proposed rule removed malpractice insurance premiums from the G &amp; A pool of indirect costs and apportioned them directly based on malpractice loss experience. The stated reason for segregating malpractice insurance premiums from the other G &amp; A costs was that the Medicare program was paying a disproportionate amount of malpractice insurance costs under the old formula. This conclusion was based on \u201c[a] study conducted by an HEW consultant indicating] that malpractice awards for Medicare ... patients are significantly lower in amount than losses for other patient population [sic].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15,745.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary attributed the low<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>er awards for Medicare patients to the fact that their income potential and life expectancies are generally less than those of the remainder of the patient population. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">The proposed rule removed malpractice insurance premiums from the G &amp; A pool and instead reimbursed those costs by dividing the losses paid to Medicare patients by the total plaid malpractice losses, and then multiplying that ratio times malpractice insurance costs. <em>Id. </em>The ratio was to be calculated for both the cost year at issue and the four preceding years. The Secretary selected a single provider\u2019s five-year malpractice loss ratio as the relevant measure on the theory that \u201cthe estimated malpractice losses paid in future periods are closely related to past malpractice losses paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hospital's with no malpractice loss experience for the relevant five-year period were required to obtain an actuarial estimate of Medicare\u2019s share of current malpractice costs from an independent actuary, insurance company, or broker. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1560-5\">The Secretary received nearly 600 comments on the proposed rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The comments were submitted by health care institutions, consumers, accounting firms, insurance companies, actuaries, health care consultants, physicians and nurses, and Medicare beneficiaries. All comments received were opposed to the proposed rule and recommended its complete withdrawal. 44 Fed.Reg. 31,641 (June 1, 1979). There were seven major criticisms of the proposed rule: (1) the inequity of removing malpractice premiums from the G <em>&amp; </em>A pool while retaining in the pool other costs incurred principally for Medicare patients, (2) providers\u2019 anticipated cash flow problems due to erratic reimbursement patterns as the paid-loss ratio fluctuates from year to year, (3) the increased likelihood that hospitals would fraudulently treat malpractice claims by Medicare patients, (4) the statistical invalidity of the Westat study, (5) the fact that malpractice insurance protects hospitals\u2019 assets and thus benefits all patients equally, (6) the fact that insurance companies set premiums on the basis of an overall assessment of risk, without allocating the risk among different types of patients, and (7) the complexity and expense of the additional accounting required by the proposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-9\">Notwithstanding the many adverse comments, the Secretary issued the final Malpractice Rule on June 1,1979. 44 Fed.Reg. 31,641 (originally codified at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(b)(l)(ii)). The only change to the proposed rule was the formula to be used for providers with no malpractice loss experience. Instead of the actuarial estimate required in the proposed rule, the final rule calculated reimbursement for these providers on the basis of the national ratio of malpractice awards paid to Medicare patients to the malpractice awards paid to all patients. <em>Id. </em>at 31,642. This national ratio, set at 5.1% for the first year based on the Westat study, was to be recalculated each year in light of the previous year\u2019s data.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1560-10\">B. The Hospitals</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-11\">Plaintiff-appellees St. James Hospital and Humana of Illinois, Inc. (\u201cHumana\u201d) are both health care providers as defined in the Medicare Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(u) (1982). For its cost year ending in 1980, St. James Hospital\u2019s overall Medicare patient utilization ratio was 30%. Under the new Malpractice Rule, however, Medicare only reimbursed 20.11% of its malpractice insurance premiums. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>amount of denied Medicare reimbursement at issue is $24,159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\">On June 3, 1981, St. James sought a hearing on its malpractice reimbursement determination before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a) (1982). The Board held that it had no jurisdiction to review the validity of the Malpractice Rule and therefore, pursuant to statute, certified the question for appeal to the federal district courts. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l) (1982). On appeal, Judge Will held that the Secretary failed to provide an adequate basis and purpose statement for the Malpractice Rule and that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious and not in compliance with the requirements of the Medicare Act. <em>St. James Hospital v. Heckler, </em>579 F.Supp. at 767. St. James Hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment was accordingly granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-6\">The Malpractice Rule\u2019s impact on Humana was even greater than its effect on St. James Hospital. Humana\u2019s Medicare patient utilization ratio was 49.38% for cost year 1980, yet its reimbursement under the Malpractice Rule was zero. Humana received no Medicare reimbursement because it had only paid a single $750 malpractice award in the relevant five-year period and the recipient of that award was a non-Medicare patient. The amount of denied Medicare reimbursement at issue for Humana is approximately $37,000. On appeal to the district court, Judge Ackerman adopted Judge Will\u2019s opinion holding the Malpractice Rule invalid and granted Humana\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Humana of Illinois, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>584 F.Supp. 618, 619 (C.D.Ill.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">In assessing the validity of the Malpractice Rule on appeal, we will address three separate, although somewhat interrelated, questions. The first question is whether the Secretary\u2019s action was substantively \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-559, 701 <em>et seq. </em>(1982). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982). The second inquiry is whether the Rule complies with the procedural requirements of the APA, in particular the statement of basis and purpose required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D) (1982). The last issue is whether the Rule violates the Medicare Act. Cases invalidating the Malpractice Rule, <em>see supra </em>note 1, have based their decisions variously on some or all of the above rationales. We begin by discussing whether the Secretary violated the APA in promulgating the Rule, first substantively and then procedurally, and then move on to address whether the Rule violates the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-10\">A. Arbitrary and Capricious</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">The scope of review under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is narrow, for we are not permitted to substitute our own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). The agency is required, however, to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2866-67. An agency rule may be arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-11\">if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-12\"><em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2867. <em>See also Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (presumption of regularity afforded agency\u2019s decision does not shield it from a \u201cthorough, probing, in-depth review\u201d); <em>City of West Chicago v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>701 F.2d 632, 648 (7th Cir.1983). There is no contention here that the Secretary relied on factors other than those Congress intended her to consider. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to determine whether the Secretary entirely failed to consider important aspects of the malpractice problem or offered an explanation for the Malpractice Rule that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">The hospitals\u2019 attack on the Malpractice Rule as arbitrary and capricious focuses primarily on the Westat study, since the Secretary issued the Rule based almost exclusively on the findings in the study. The hospitals argue that the Westat study, and hence the rulemaking record, is so deficient that the Secretary\u2019s implementation of the Rule was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">The Westat study was sponsored by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (predecessor agency to the Department of Health and Human Services) to analyze the frequency and type of malpractice claims and awards between July 1, 1976, and October 31, 1976. The study had a very broad scope, its general purpose being to determine the factors influencing the frequency of occurrence of malpractice claims and the size of awards, so that the level and rate of increase of medical malpractice insurance premiums might be reduced in order to achieve the general policy objective of controlling the cost of health care for <em>all </em>patients, not just Medicare patients. Only one of the study\u2019s eight chapters addressed Medicare issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-6\">Westat\u2019s analysis of Medicare claims as compared to non-Medicare claims led it to conclude that although Medicare paid for 21% of the hospital discharges in 1973, \u201conly a maximum of 13 percent of the malpractice claims closed in 1976 (for incidents, most of which occurred in 1973) were filed by persons for whom Medicaid [sic] paid for their medical care.\u201d In addition to finding that Medicare patients filed fewer claims, the study concluded that \u201cthe average award for Medicare patients is considerably smaller than for other groups.\u201d With regard to Medicare reimbursement of malpractice insurance costs, however, Westat only surmised that \u201c[i]f the percentage of Medicare patients involved in medical malpractice claims is proportionately smaller than the percentage of hospitalizations for which Medicare paid, then Medicare <em>may </em>be subsidizing malpractice insurance costs that should actually be covered by other payors\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-8\">The hospitals first point out the limited scope of the Westat study and argue that the data base was insufficient to justify reliance on the study\u2019s conclusions. As noted above, the study surveyed medical malpractice claims closed during a single four-month period in 1976. Data was acquired from only nine of more than fifty private insurance carriers for the four-month period. It appears, however, that insureds from those nine companies were involved in 84% of all malpractice claims closed by private carriers in 1976. Although claims paid by private insurance carriers thus seem to be adequately represented, the use of data from these private carriers alone means that self-insuring providers (usually hospitals) were excluded from the study, as were federal institutions. A study conducted by the American Hospital Association (cited in the Westat study) revealed that in 1976, approximately 20% of non-federal community hospitals in the United States were either partially or totally self-insured. Claims from the totally self-insured hospitals were not reflected in the Westat study, and those from the partially self-insured hospitals were underrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-9\">The authors of the Westat study identified a second source of bias in addition to the study\u2019s exclusion of self-insured providers \u2014 the fact that Westat did not have complete data on the identity of all defendants in multiple defendant cases. Although the Secretary now speculates that because these omissions relate to defendant identity they are not relevant to the Medicare chapter, where the key factor was plaintiff identity, the study\u2019s authors made no such distinctions. In fact, as will be discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>shortly, the Secretary should have paid particular attention to the study\u2019s warnings on this source of bias because defendant identity was indeed an important factor in this rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">Because of the above-noted limitations on the scope of the Westat study, the study\u2019s data base consisted of a total of 3,932 medical malpractice claims. Information on the source of payment for medical care was available for only 2,637 (approximately two-thirds) of the claimants. Of those, only 340 claimants, or approximately 12%, were identified as Medicare recipients. With respect to the findings on the size of awards made to Medicare claimants, the pool of information was even smaller. Because less than half of all malpractice claims resulted in awards (for Medicare and non-Medicare claimants alike), award information for Medicare claimants was based on only 166 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\">The authors of the Westat study cautioned at the outset that readers should keep in mind the limited nature of the study and certain possible sources of bias. With regard to one particular chapter \u2014 injury prevention \u2014 the authors warned that \u201c[cjonelusions must be drawn very cautiously because of the possibility of biased data.\u201d At least one court has noted that the same cautions would seem to apply to all conclusions drawn from the study. <em>See Boswell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 788, 796 &amp; n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-7\">In addition to the cautions contained in the study itself, Westat sent a memorandum to the agency on August 17, 1978, noting deficiencies in the Westat study and making recommendations for future research. The memorandum recommended a more precise sample design if \u201cnational estimates or \u2018representative data\u2019 \u201d were desired, pointing out that with the sample design used in the 1976 Westat study, \u201cit was virtually impossible to generalize beyond the sample \u2014 to annual totals or to national totals, to cite the most elementary limitations.\u201d The authors further stated that \u201cthere was no assurance [in the 1976 study] that the sample was in any way representative, of hospitalsf,] of physicians, of injuries, of geographic regions, of claimants.\u201d Notwithstanding this memorandum, the Secretary issued the proposed Malpractice Rule seven months later, to have nationwide effect, based almost exclusively on the findings in the Westat study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-10\">The most significant source of bias in the Westat study with respect to the Malpractice Rule, however, is one not noted in the study itself \u2014 the fact that the data base included claims against both hospitals and practitioners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Westat based its Medicare analysis on the number of claims filed for injuries <em>occurring in </em>hospitals rather than claims filed <em>against </em>hospitals. The study found that although hospitals were reported as the site of injury in 78% of all claims in the study, however, hospitals were named defendants in only 32%. Thus, Westat\u2019s use. of claims for all injuries occurring in hospitals included a fair number of claims filed against physicians for injuries occurring in hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-11\">Claims against hospitals represented only 32% of the claims in Westat\u2019s data base, and only 20% of claim dollars in the study. Since the Malpractice Rule is based on <em>hospital </em>claims experience only, the study\u2019s inclusion of data on claims against physicians permits reliable conclusions with respect to Medicare claimants only if they file claims against hospitals as opposed to physicians in the same proportion as do non-Medicare claimants. This, however, does not appear to be the case. The Westat study itself indicates that 69% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>injuries complained of in paid claims filed by Medicare patients were \u201cinstitutional problems\u201d (including fluid/specimen administration, falls, medical management, and equipment problems), as compared to 35% for all paid claims. This data suggests that Medicare recipients file a much greater proportion of claims against hospitals than do other patient populations, which tend to file more claims against physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">Reanalyzing Westat\u2019s data to take account of this potential source of bias produces a startling effect. Westat\u2019s analysis concluded that although Medicare paid for 21% of hospital discharges in 1973, only a maximum of 13% of malpractice claims closed in 1976 were filed by Medicare patients, representing 5.1% of dollars paid. When claims against hospitals only are isolated, however, Medicare patients accounted for 20.2% of claims paid and 17.8% of dollars paid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Westat\u2019s data is further refined to exclude claims against hospital-employed physicians (since these claims are excluded from the Malpractice Rule\u2019s paid-claim ratio), Medicare patients accounted for 22.5% of claims paid and 19.9% of dollars paid. This result seriously undermines the study\u2019s conclusion, heavily relied on by the Secretary in formulating the Malpractice Rule, that the percentage of Medicare patients involved in malpractice claims is substantially smaller than the percentage of hospitalizations (and hence the percentage of indirect G &amp; A costs such as malpractice insurance premiums) paid for by Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-5\">In summary, we agree with the district courts below that the Westat study furnished an inadequate basis for the Malpractice Rule and that the Secretary committed a clear error of judgment in relying on the study as the sole empirical basis for the Rule. <em>See St. James Hospital v. Heckler, </em>579 F.Supp. at 766. <em>See also Humana of Aurora, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1579, 1583 (10th Cir.1985) (\u201cWhen an agency adopts a regulation based on a study not designed for the purpose and which is limited and criticized by its authors on points essential to the use sought to be made of it, the administrative action is arbitrary and capricious and a clear error in judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-10\">Compounding the statistical limitations of the study itself, moreover, the Secretary promulgated the Rule without investigating several other important aspects of the malpractice problem, primarily the extent to which any disproportionality in the amount paid on malpractice claims filed by Medicare recipients affected the malpractice insurance costs of providers. The public comments received by the Secretary uniformly criticized the Malpractice Rule\u2019s use of actual loss experience as the sole measure of reimbursement for malpractice insurance premiums. Several insurance companies commented that the proposed rule was \u201cillogical\u201d because \u201cpast malpractice award experience for a particular patient group does not fairly reflect current malpractice costs attributable to the group.\u201d The insurance carriers noted that the cost of insurance depends on factors such as the size of the provider, the number of patients it services, the types of services it provides, and other factors in addition to past claim experience. Other commenters pointed out that administrative expenses such as risk management services, acquisition costs of policy issuance, accounting services, agents\u2019 commissions, licensing fees and taxes, unallocated claims expense, and the general administrative overhead expenses of the insurer account for anywhere from 30% to over 50% of premium costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-11\">The Secretary now belatedly attempts to justify the Malpractice Rule\u2019s use of loss experience to reimburse malpractice premium costs by citing to some commenters\u2019 statements that despite the various other factors considered when setting premium rates, loss payment is the largest single element of the malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>premium. The agency itself, however, made no attempt to examine the relationship between actual loss experience and premium costs before promulgating the Malpractice Rule, apparently assuming that the relationship was strong enough to support the Rule\u2019s use of loss experience as the sole measure of premium costs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Secretary now contends that a few public comments, in the course of criticizing the Malpractice Rule\u2019s reliance on this very relationship, confirm that assumption and that the relationship was therefore adequately established in the rulemaking record. This is clearly an insufficient basis upon which to rest a regulation with such substantial economic effects on health care providers. We therefore find that even if the Westat study was statistically valid and its findings reliable, promulgation of the Malpractice Rule was arbitrary and capricious because the Secretary completely failed to ascertain the extent of the correlation, if any, between actual malpractice losses and premium costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-5\">The Secretary failed to investigate another aspect of the malpractice problem as well. In deciding to remove malpractice insurance costs from the G &amp; A pool, the Secretary neglected to first determine whether the existing pool adequately compensated for any imbalance in the allocation of malpractice costs. This oversight will be more fully discussed in section C, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1565-6\">In sum, we find that the Secretary entirely failed to consider several important aspects of the malpractice problem before promulgating the Malpractice Rule, and that the explanation given for the Rule is not adequately supported by the Westat study, the only statistical evidence before the agency. We therefore find the Rule arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-8\">B. Inadequate Basis and Purpose Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-9\">The Malpractice Rule is also challenged as violating the procedural requirements of the APA, particularly the requirement that \u201c[ajfter consideration of the relevant matter presented [through notice and comment], the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c) (1982).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the agency need not respond to every fact or contention in the comments submitted, the basis and purpose statement must identify \u201cwhat major issues of policy were ventilated by the informal proceedings and why the agency reacted to them as it did.\u201d <em>Automotive Parts &amp; Accessories Ass\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>407 F.2d 330, 338 (D.C.Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-10\">We find that the Secretary\u2019s basis and purpose statement did not adequately respond to the criticisms raised in the many adverse comments submitted on the Malpractice Rule in several respects. First and foremost, the Secretary made no attempt to respond to comments that the Westat study was statistically unreliable and that its own authors had cautioned against its use in the manner contemplated by the Secretary. The Secretary\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>attempts to respond to those comments on appeal are insufficient and will not remedy the failure to do so in the basis and purpose statement. <em>See Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. State. Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-11\">Commenters also criticized the Malpractice Rule on the ground that the accepted insurance industry practice is to calculate premiums on the basis of occupied beds, regardless of the Medicare status of the patient. Thus, the commenters noted, the Malpractice Rule\u2019s formula for reimbursing premium costs bears no relation to the actual premium costs incurred by the hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>tais on behalf of Medicare recipients. In response to these criticisms, the Secretary stated: \u201cWe are aware that insurance companies generally do not determine insurance rates for malpractice insurance based upon the financial status of the patients. However, information about malpractice loss experience by type of patient (i.e., Medicare) is readily available.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 31,642 (June 1, 1979). Besides being nonresponsive, this statement ignores the fact that in the Secretary\u2019s own Westat study, the insurance companies had no information on the Medicare status of the claimant for a full one-third of the claims filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">The opportunity under the APA to comment on proposed rules is \u201cmeaningless unless the agency responds to significant points raised by the public.\u201d <em>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 9, 35-36 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 829, 98 S.Ct. Ill, 54 L.Ed.2d 89 (1977). We agree with the district courts\u2019 conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s basis and purpose statement failed to respond to many significant points made by the public in opposition to the Malpractice Rule. The Secretary\u2019s statement of basis and purpose provided no indication of why criticisms of the Westat study were deemed to be invalid, and failed to give a reasoned response to other criticisms of the Rule. We therefore conclude that the Secretary failed to comply with section 553(c) of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-5\">C. Violation of the Medicare Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">The last question for review is whether the Malpractice Rule is contrary to provisions of the Medicare Act. Although the Secretary is ordinarily given a great deal of deference in interpreting and implementing the laws that she is directed to administer, <em>see Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1957, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983) (involving Secretary\u2019s interpretation of Social Security benefit provisions); <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 53 L.Ed.2d-448 (1977) (same), a lesser degree of deference is required when reviewing the Secretary\u2019s actions under the Medicare Act\u2019s reimbursement provisions. <em>See Northwest Hospital, Inc. v. Hospital Service Corp., </em>687 F.2d 985, 990-91 (7th Cir.1982) (Medicare statute specifically circumscribes Secretary\u2019s discretion to define \u2018reasonable costs\u2019); <em>St. John\u2019s Hickey Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Califano, </em>599 F.2d 803, 813 (7th Cir.1979) (Secretary\u2019s authority under Medicare Act significantly more circumscribed than authority delegated in Social Security benefit cases); <em>Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital v. Heckler, </em>581 F.Supp. 1311, 1313-15 (E.D. Mich.1983) (Secretary\u2019s discretion limited in this area). The regulations promulgated under the Medicare Act <em>\u201cmust ... </em>take into account both direct and indirect costs and <em>must </em>avoid the result of shifting costs to non-Medicare patients.\u201d <em>St. John\u2019s Hickey Memorial Hospital, </em>599 F.2d at 813 n. 17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-8\">The first provision of the Act at issue is the prohibition against shifting Medicare costs to non-Medicare patients and vice versa. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982); <em>see also Northwest Hospital, Inc. v. Hospital Service Corp., </em>687 F.2d 985, 989 (7th Cir. 1982). As mentioned previously, the Secretary\u2019s mechanism for reimbursing providers\u2019 indirect costs has consistently been to pool them together as G&amp;A costs and then to reimburse a percentage of those costs on the basis of the provider\u2019s Medicare patient utilization ratio. This regulatory scheme was not premised on a belief that all G &amp; A costs applied to all of a hospital\u2019s patients equally, but rather on the assumption that some costs would be disproportionately allocated in favor of Medicare patients while others would be disproportionately allocated in favor of non-Medicare patients. Pooling all of the various costs together was believed to be the fairest and most administratively feasible way of allocating indirect costs among Medicare and non-Medicare patients. In addition, although there may have been cost-shifting with respect to a certain item <em>(i.e., </em>billing expenses associated predominately with the Medicare program), the G&amp;A pool as a whole was thought to fairly allocate indirect costs among Medicare and non-Medicare popula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>tions such that neither sector impermissibly paid the costs of the other. The Secretary pulled malpractice insurance premiums out of the G&amp;A pool based on two findings: first, the cost of malpractice insurance skyrocketed in the 1970\u2019s, and second, the Westat study led the Secretary to believe that Medicare was paying more than its fair share of that cost. <em>See </em>44 Fed.Reg. 31,642 (June 1, 1979). The problem with this analysis is the findings that were <em>not </em>made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">Even assuming that Medicare paid a disproportionate amount of malpractice insurance costs when they were included in the G&amp;A pool, the Secretary seems to have forgotten that the G&amp;A pool was designed to accommodate such imbalances. What is missing in the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of the Malpractice Rule is the necessary starting premise: that the G&amp;A pool including malpractice insurance costs, taken as a whole, impermissibly shifted costs attributable to non-Medicare patients to the Medicare program. <em>See Boswell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d at 795. If the starting point was otherwise, the removal of a specific cost that <em>was </em>disproportionately attributable to non-Medicare patients would inevitably <em>result </em>in an imbalanced pool, in violation of the Act. <em>Id. </em>The Secretary did not explicitly make this essential preliminary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">One could argue that in instigating this rulemaking at all, the Secretary must have made an implicit finding that the then-existing method of allocating indirect costs was inequitable. The problem with this argument, however, is that the Secretary had no factual support for that finding. Although the Secretary had support for the finding that malpractice insurance premiums increased dramatically during the 1970\u2019s, for example, no attempt was made to determine whether and to what extent <em>other </em>indirect costs in the G&amp;A pool, such as legal fees, also increased over the same time period. <em>See Boswell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d at 795 n. 8. The Secretary therefore had no information indicating the amount of change in the <em>percentage </em>of the G&amp;A pool representing malpractice insurance costs. Without that information, it was impossible to determine whether the G&amp;A pool as a whole impermissibly shifted costs from the non-Medicare to the Medicare populations. Therefore, the Secretary could not have made the necessary finding on the information before the agency. <em>See Alexandria Hospital v. Heckler, </em>586 F.Supp. 581, 589 (E.D.Va.1984) (neither Westat report nor any evidence in rulemaking record supports Secretary\u2019s conclusion that supposed disproportionate allocation of malpractice costs is so great as to defeat the operation of the G&amp;A pool\u2019s averaging principle).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-8\">The Secretary\u2019s action in removing malpractice insurance costs from the G&amp;A pool is particularly suspect in light of the agency\u2019s long-standing resistance to providers\u2019 attempts to isolate other costs disproportionately attributable to Medicare and thus under-reimbursed under the pooling system. <em>See </em>PRRB Decision No. 79-D53, 1979-2 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 30,086, at 9707 (\u201cProgram policy has consistently maintained that it is impractical to isolate discrete items of [G&amp;A] cost between Medicare and non-Medicare beneficiaries and has posited that all such discrete items making up total [G&amp;A] costs will \u2018average out.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Good Luck Nursing Home, Inc. v. Califano, </em>1979-1 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 29,450, at 9287 (D.D.C.1978) (finding arbitrary and capricious the PRRB\u2019s refusal to remove from the G&amp;A pool certain legal and accounting fees incurred solely as a result of provider\u2019s participation in Medicare program); PRRB Decision No. 76-D74, 1976 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) U 28,300, at 10,-609-10 (refusing to remove from G&amp;A pool certain extraordinary legal fees attributable solely to Medicare program); Provider Appeal Decision No. 00-75-04, 1975 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 27,361, at 9589 (refusing to remove from the G &amp; A pool certain expenses incurred in preparing Medicare cost reports); Intermediary Letter No. 234 (June 2, 1967) (including in G&amp;A pool all costs of Medicare utilization review, including compensation paid to physicians for their services on utilization re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>view committees). The agency has long believed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1568-4\">[t]he requirement in the law that our costs are not to be borne by others is construed to refer to <em>total </em>costs, not to any one cost. In our cost finding procedures ... it is presumed that where a particular cost might be allocated disproportionately to or from the program, there will be other costs disproportionately allocated in the other direction which will compensate for the first cost. In this manner, the program is presumed to bear its proper share of the total allowable costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1568-5\">Intermediary Letter No. 234 (June 2, 1967). The agency continues to hold this view with respect to G&amp;A costs other than malpractice insurance premiums. <em>See </em>PRRB Decision No. 82-D46,1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 31,810, at 9073.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-6\">Although an agency is not rigidly bound to its own precedent, the presumption is against changes in established policy that are not justified by the rulemaking record. <em>See Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). We conclude that the Secretary violated the cost-shifting prohibition of the Medicare Act by removing malpractice insurance costs from the G&amp;A pool without first determining, on the basis of an adequate factual record, that the existing system itself inequitably shifted costs and that removal of malpractice costs from the pool would rectify the inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-7\">A second way in which the Malpractice Rule violates the Medicare Act is its failure to recognize that malpractice insurance protects against the risk of future loss. Even if a provider has never incurred any actual malpractice losses, for example, it must still purchase malpractice insurance because of the risk that losses will be incurred in the future. The Provider Reimbursement Manual recognizes this reality and thus provides that hospitals are expected to maintain an adequate insurance program to protect against likely losses, particularly losses so great that their financial stability would be threatened. <em>See also </em>PRRB Decision No. 82-D89, 1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 31,987, at 9814 (malpractice insurance carried by provider to protect its assets). Providers may also be required to insure against malpractice loss under state law. The effect of the Malpractice Rule, however, is to reimburse these necessary costs only to the extent that the provider has incurred claim loss in the past. This ignores the fact that insurance premiums must be paid regardless of whether actual losses are incurred. <em>See Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital v. Heckler, </em>581 F.Supp. at 1315-16. The carrying of malpractice insurance must be deemed a reasonable cost, and thus reimbursable by Medicare, regardless of whether a hospital has paid one dollar or one million dollars in malpractice claims over the relevant five-year period. To the extent that the Malpractice Rule does not reimburse these costs, therefore, it violates the Medicare Act\u2019s mandate that providers are entitled to government reimbursement for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services they provide for Medicare patients. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b)(l) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-9\">The fact that the Secretary promulgated the Malpractice Rule on the basis of a biased and statistically questionable study and without adequately investigating several key aspects of the malpractice problem, as discussed in section A, <em>supra, </em>is closely tied to our finding that the Rule violates these two provisions of the Medicare Act. Because of the deficiencies in the rulemaking process, reimbursement under the Malpractice Rule seems to bear no reasonable relation to the portion of a provider\u2019s actual malpractice insurance costs attributable to Medicare patients. As one court has stated, the Malpractice Rule prescribes a formula \u201cwhich seemingly guarantees that the statutory mandate will inevitably be violated in most cases.\u201d <em>Abington Memorial Hospital v. Heckler, </em>576 F.Supp. 1081, 1089 (E.D.Pa.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>750 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>F.2d 242, 243 (3d Cir.1984) (adopting district court\u2019s opinion). <em>See also Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital v. Heckler, </em>581 F.Supp. at 1317 (\u201cmerely fortuitous\u201d whether a hospital is properly reimbursed for its malpractice insurance costs under the Malpractice Rule). When reimbursement bears no reasonable relation to actual costs, as in Humana\u2019s case (over $85,000 spent for malpractice insurance premiums in cost year 1980 but nothing reimbursed), the Act is violated both because of impermissible cost-shifting and because, in cases of under-reimbursement, the provider is denied reimbursement for the reasonable cost of a service it provides for Medicare patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-5\">In sum, we agree with Judge Will\u2019s conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1569-6\">the Secretary is not, of course, limited to any one method of reimbursement and may use different methods for different costs and circumstances. This the statute clearly allows. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A). But when, as here, the chosen method neither assures that Medicare costs will not be borne by non-Medicare patients nor that hospitals will be reimbursed the reasonable costs of their services ... then the regulation does not carry out the mandate of the Medicare statute and is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1569-7\"><em>St. James Hospital v. Heckler, </em>579 F.Supp. at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-10\">We conclude that (1) the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of the Malpractice Rule was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion, (2) the Secretary failed to provide an adequate basis and purpose statement for the Rule, and (3) the Rule violates certain provisions of the Medicare Act. In reaching this result, we are not unmindful of the deference afforded the Secretary when reviewing administrative decisions such as the one at issue in this case. However permissible, and even laudable, might be the Secretary\u2019s desire to ferret out unnecessary expenditures in the Medicare program, however, there are certain statutory requirements that Congress has determined must be met before the Secretary can take steps to achieve that goal. Because those requirements were not met with respect to the Malpractice Rule, we must set aside the Rule and affirm the district courts\u2019 grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff hospitals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1558-16\">.

We must remand No. 84-1727, the Humana case, for clarification of the district court\u2019s disposition of two claims raised by Humana in addition to its attack on the Malpractice Rule. Humana\u2019s additional claims are: (1) that the Secretary\u2019s regulations are contrary to the Medicare Act because they do not provide for a procedure by which the Secretary can make \"suitable retroactive corrective adjustments to a provider\u2019s reimbursement\u201d whenever a provider\u2019s reimbursement under the Malpractice Rule is shown to be inadequate, as required by the Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A)(ii) (1982)), and (2) that four categories of costs attributable solely to its Medicare program should be removed from the G&amp;A pool and fully reimbursed by Medicare. The district court simply issued a one-page order adopting Judge Will\u2019s opinion in <em>St. James Hosp. v.
