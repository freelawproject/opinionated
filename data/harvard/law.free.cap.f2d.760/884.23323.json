For reversal, Moore asserts that the prosecutor violated his right to due process by improperly suggesting during closing arguments that the jury could draw an adverse inference from Moore\u2019s failure to call corroborative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>fense witnesses. We affirm the denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Moses Moore, Charles Johnson, and Darrell Smith were each charged with raping and sodomizing a woman on April 4, 1978. A jury convicted Smith and he received a twenty-year sentence. A jury also convicted Johnson, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed his conviction. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>595 S.W.2d 774 (Mo.Ct.App.1980). Johnson then pled guilty to one count of rape and one count of sodomy, and received a seven-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Moore\u2019s first trial in February 1979, ended in a mistrial when the jury was' unable to reach a unanimous verdict. At his second trial in March 1979, the jury convicted Moore, and he received a twenty-five year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">During his second trial, Moore testified that the victim was one of ten or twelve guests who attended a party he held on the evening of April 4, 1978. Moore remembered the names of six of the other guests: Darrell Smith, Charles Johnson, Joseph Gregory, Billy Kidd, Cynthia Smith, and a neighbor named Faye. According to Moore, the victim drank, smoked marijuana, and danced during the evening. Moore admitted that he had intercourse with the victim, but claimed that she consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The victim testified that Moore approached her outside a lounge on the evening of April 4, 1978, and asked her for a ride to his home. When they arrived at Moore\u2019s house, the victim discovered she had a flat tire. She claimed that when she attempted to borrow cabfare, Johnson forced her into Moore\u2019s house where Johnson, Moore, and Smith repeatedly raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">At Moore\u2019s first trial, Billy Kidd appeared as a defense witness. Kidd corroborated Moore\u2019s testimony that a party took place at Moore\u2019s house on April 4, 1978. At Moore\u2019s second trial, however, neither Kidd nor any of the other guests named by Moore as having attended his party testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">During closing arguments of Moore\u2019s second trial, the prosecutor made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">\u201cWe had a party.\u201d \u201cIt was a big party.\u201d But where are the guests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">Who came in here and verified the party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-14\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) Object to that, Your Honor. The defendant stated the names of those people. They\u2019re equally available to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-15\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-16\">MR. STIGALL: (Prosecutor) He says these people are available to the State. These are the defendant\u2019s friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) I\u2019ll object to that, Your Honor. The evidence is that Billy Kidd is related to the alleged victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\">THE COURT: This is argument; overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-19\">MR. STIGALL: (Prosecutor) These are his friends. He lives with them, plays with them, has parties with them. Nobody came in here to verify that party, except this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-20\">Why didn\u2019t they bring in somebody to tell us about this party, and what happened? Why didn\u2019t they bring in Billy, the kid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-21\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) I object to that, Your Honor. That witness is peculiarly available to the State, being a relative, by marriage, of the alleged victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-22\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-23\">MR. STIGALL: (Prosecutor) These are his friends. Why didn\u2019t he bring in anybody\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-24\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-26\">MR. STIGALL: (Prosecutor) \u2014to verify this party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-27\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-29\">(Counsel approached the bench and the following proceedings were out of the hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) I object, Your Honor, and move that the jury be instructed to disregard that last comment of counsel for the State on the grounds that the individuals at the party, Charles Johnson, Darrell Smith, defendants in this crime, have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Counsel for the State is aware of that right, and further that Joseph Gregory, at the last trial, did advise the Court that he intended to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Counsel for the State is therefore commenting upon the rights exercised by these persons of their Fifth Amendment rights, and I ask that the jury be instructed to disregard the comments of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">THE COURT: Overruled, and I might also make this observation. There were other people there, that you\u2019ve not mentioned now, that were friends of this particular defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-5\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) There is only one other, Your Honor, and the testimony is that she is currently in California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-7\">THE COURT: There were others as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-8\">MR. ROGERS: (Defense Counsel) That he didn\u2019t even know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-10\">THE COURT: Know then. Overruled. (The following proceedings were in the presence and hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-11\">MR. STIGALL: (Prosecutor) Where are these people and why didn\u2019t they come in here and tell you they were there?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-12\"><em>State v. Moore, </em>620 S.W.2d 370, 371-72 (Mo. 1981) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">On direct appeal, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed Moore\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that the persons Moore failed to call were \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to him \u2014 that is, they were friends who could be expected to testify favorably for the defense. Moore\u2019s failure to call one or more of them as witnesses therefore gave rise to a permissible inference that their testimony would actually have been unfavorable to him. <em>Id. </em>at 374. The court held that, under Missouri law, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the prosecutor\u2019s adverse inference argument in the circumstances of this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-16\">Thereafter, Moore filed the present petition for habeas relief, alleging that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks during closing argument deprived him of due process. The district court concluded that no error of constitutional dimension had occurred at Moore\u2019s trial, and denied the petition. <em>Moore v. Wyrick, </em>589 F.Supp. 608 (W.D. Mo.1984). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">The scope of review by federal courts of habeas corpus petitions alleging violations of due process is narrow. <em>See Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); <em>Batten v. Scurr, </em>649 F.2d 564, 569 (8th Cir.1981). Moore must show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were so egregious that they fatally infected the proceedings and rendered his entire trial fundamentally unfair. <em>See Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. at 642, 94 S.Ct. at 1871; <em>Ellis v. Black, </em>732 F.2d 650, 657-58 (8th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Maggitt v. Wyrick, </em>533 F.2d 383, 385 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 898, 97 S.Ct. 264, 50 L.Ed.2d 183 (1976)); <em>Cook v. Bordenkircher, </em>602 F.2d 117, 119 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 936, 100 S.Ct. 286, 62 L.Ed.2d 196 (1979). <em>See also United States v. Young, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1044, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (prosecutor\u2019s improper comments must be viewed in context to determine whether they affected the fairness of the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-20\">Applying that narrow standard of review to the present case, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s adverse inference argument deprived Moore of a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The trial judge had broad discretion to rule on the propriety of the closing argument. <em>See State v. Moore, </em>620 S.W.2d at 373. Moreover, even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, the district court determined that \u201cthey were not so egregious as to infect the trial with constitutional error,\u201d especially in view of the overwhelming evidence of Moore\u2019s guilt. <em>Moore v. Wyrick, </em>589 F.Supp. at 611. After reviewing the record, we agree that Moore has not established error of constitutional dimension justifying reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Moore\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-31\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b982-14\">. Under some circumstances, a prosecutor may invite a jury to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call available defense witnesses. <em>See, e.g., Yancey v. Housewright, </em>664 F.2d 187, 190 (8th Cir.1981) (dictum) (prosecutor may comment on petitioner's failure to call available alibi witnesses); <em>cf. United States v.
