HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">Irvin M. Carbalan filed this civil rights suit against the city of Buffalo, Texas, and its Municipal Judge, Ben Bagley, complaining that Judge Bagley denied his constitutional right to reasonable bail when he refused to accept two motor club cards in lieu of cash bail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carbalan convinced a jury that Judge Bagley denied him his right to reasonable bail, but won no relief: before trial the district court, finding that Judge Bagley was immune, dismissed all claims against him and the jury found that Buffalo had no policy approving Judge Bagley\u2019s bail rulings. Carbalan asserts on appeal (1) that the court abused its discretion in refusing him leave, after trial had begun, to amend his pleadings to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Judge Bagley, (2) that the court erroneously instructed the jury on Buffalo\u2019s potential municipal liability, and (3) that because the jury found a constitutional violation he is a \u201cprevailing\u201d party, entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We affirm because we are persuaded that the court was within its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint, that the city could not have been liable for Judge Bagley\u2019s rulings regardless of the correctness of the jury instructions, and that Carbalan did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-22\">On March 31, 1980, Carbalan was arrested for driving with an expired motor vehicle registration and for failure to appear previously on that charge. The arrests were authorized by warrants issued by Judge Bagley who set bail at a total of $407 for the two offenses, the maximum amount permitted by Texas law. Carbalan tendered two motor club cards with arrest bond endorsements. The parties agree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>and we assume, that Texas law requires courts to accept such cards as equal to cash bail of up to $200 per card. According to Carbalan\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, when Judge Bagley said that he would not accept such cards under any circumstances, Carbalan telephoned his wife, who drove to the courthouse and wrote a personal check for $407, obtaining his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Carbalan\u2019s original and amended complaints sought only money damages against Judge Bagley and the city. The amended complaint and amended proposed pretrial order were filed the day before the trial began. Neither the pretrial order nor the amended complaint requested any declaratory or injunctive relief. After the jury had been selected, Carbalan sought leave to amend his complaint to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Judge Bagley, which the court denied. Carbalan did so presumably because judges are not absolutely immune from suits seeking such relief. <em>Pulliam v. Allen, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Both sides agree that the evidence developed at trial showed that Buffalo exercised no control over Judge Bagley\u2019s conduct as a municipal judge, and that Judge Bagley had full responsibility for operating the municipal court. There was no evidence that any city official approved or was aware of Judge Bagley\u2019s \u201cpractice\u201d of not accepting motor club cards. Indeed, the evidence of \u201cpractice\u201d was the judge\u2019s statement that he would not take them under any circumstances. There was no other evidence that the issue was a recurring one.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The court submitted the issue of the city\u2019s liability to the jury, with instructions that Carbalan asserted that city officials allowed Judge Bagley\u2019s acts \u201cto occur as a de facto policy of the city,\u201d and that the defendants \u201cdenied that any such de facto policy existed.\u201d The court did not define \u201cde facto policy\u201d or otherwise explain the elements of municipal liability under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Carbalan requested that the court charge the jury that the city\u2019s \u201cde facto policy\u201d includes \u201cthe acts of those whose acts and edicts fairly represent the policy of the City of Buffalo.\u201d The court refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In response to special interrogatories, the jury found that Judge Bagley had \u201cdenied Plaintiff Carbalan his right to reasonable bail by refusing to accept the tendered motor club cards,\u201d but that the city did not have \u201ca policy approving such action____\u201d The jury, asked what sum of money would compensate Carbalan for damages sustained for the \u201cpolicies of the City of Buffalo,\u201d answered \u201cNone.\u201d The court then entered a judgment that Carbalan take nothing. Finding that Carbalan had not \u201cprevailed,\u201d it refused to award attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Carbalan, citing the statement in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) that leave to amend a complaint \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d asks us to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend his complaint to add claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against Judge Bagley. We can do so only if the court below abused its discretion. <em>Bamm, Inc. v. GAF Corp., </em>651 F.2d 389, 391 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>401 U.S. 321, 330, 91 S.Ct. 795, 802, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971). A court\u2019s exercise of discretion to deny leave to amend is informed by \u201cundue delay\u201d and \u201cundue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Given the broad reach of judicial immunity the rejected amendment attempting, as it did, to slip past immunity and expose the judge to the threat of attorneys\u2019 fees presented a significant shift. As the case had long been framed, Judge Bagley\u2019s immunity defense was virtually certain and his expectation of dismissal at the outset of trial was justifiable; it is reasonable to infer that this expectation affected his trial preparation, a reality that while not lifted up on the record, was doubtlessly apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>to the trial judge. We cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in taking into account the lulling of Judge Bagley even though there is no suggestion that it was other than the product of oversight or inadvertence. Similarly, the court was within its discretion in denying leave to amend requested during the trial. <em>See Daves v. Payless Cashways, Inc., </em>661 F.2d 1022, 1024-25 (5th Cir.1981) (approving denial of leave to amend on similar facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Nor can Carbalan rely on Rule 15(b), which allows amendments to pleadings to conform to the evidence presented at trial. Rule 15(b) deals only with issues \u201ctried by express or implied consent of the parties.\u201d Judge Bagley did not consent to trial of any claims against him for declaratory or injunctive relief; he successfully moved to be dismissed entirely as a defendant. The trial record reflects no discussion or argument concerning any claims for declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Finally, we cannot agree with Carbalan that his general prayer for \u201csuch other and further relief ... to which plaintiff may be entitled\u201d constituted a demand for declaratory and injunctive relief in the face of his proposed pretrial order in which he sought only damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Carbalan argues that the district court erred in its charge on municipal liability; that in any event, the jury\u2019s finding that Buffalo had no policy approving Judge Bagley\u2019s acts was against the great weight of the evidence. We need not reach Carbalan\u2019s complaints about the jury instructions, because on the facts adduced at trial, Buffalo was not liable for Judge Bagley\u2019s acts as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The parties agree that Buffalo city officials exercised no control over the municipal court\u2019s operations, and gave no guidance or instructions to Judge Bagley. Yet, Carbalan argues that Judge Bagley was, or the jury could have so concluded, a policy-making official of the city, \u201cwhose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,\u201d <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037, and that the city is therefore responsible in damages for any constitutional violation committed by Judge Bagley. The argument relies on <em>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391, 404 (5th Cir.1980), in which we stated that in some areas of responsibility, county judges in Texas are \u201cthe final authority or ultimate repository of county power,\u201d and that counties can be held responsible for county judges\u2019 acts in those fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Carbalan, however, ignores a crucial distinction made in <em>Familias Unidas. </em>In Texas, county judges perform \u201cnumerous executive, legislative, and administrative chores,\u201d and in doing so can shape county policy. <em>Id. </em>at 404. Their judicial function, though, \u201cmay more fairly be characterized as the effectuation of the policy of the State of Texas ... for which the citizens of a particular county should not bear singular responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the specific holding of <em>Familias Unidas </em>was that a county was <em>not </em>liable under <em>Monell </em>for a county judge\u2019s enforcement of an unconstitutional state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The city of Buffalo had no policy regarding Judge Bagley\u2019s judicial duties. If Judge Bagley erred in their exercise, the city is not liable simply because Judge Bagley held the office of municipal judge, any more than the county in <em>Familias Unidas </em>was liable for the judicial acts of a county judge. The urged reading would subvert the message of <em>Monell </em>that municipalities cannot be vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762, 767 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">On these facts, the district court would have been justified in granting a directed verdict for the city of Buffalo, and was <em>a fortiori </em>correct in denying Carbalan\u2019s motion for new trial. Because a verdict for Carbalan against the city would have been impermissible as a matter of law, any error in the jury charge on municipal liability was harmless. <em>Lyle v. R.N. Adams Construction Co., </em>402 F.2d 323 (5th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Finally, Carbalan argues that because the jury agreed that the refusal of the motor club cards was a constitutional deprivation, he \u201cprevailed\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and should have been awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. To prevail, though, a plaintiff must obtain \u201cthe primary relief sought.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669 (5th Cir.1981). Carbalan has won no relief against anyone, and is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir.1981) (plaintiffs cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cfor the pursuit of claims on which they obtained no relief, judicial or otherwise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\">. The claims rested on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Carbalan also sued the city marshal, claiming that he used excessive force in arresting him. The jury found for the marshal and Carbalan does not here quarrel with that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
