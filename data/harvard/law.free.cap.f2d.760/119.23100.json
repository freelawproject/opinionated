The parties were directed to file and did submit supplemental briefs on this interesting question remaining in this longstanding controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">On the one hand, the trustee argues that language in <em>W.C. Early Co. v. Williams, </em>135 Tenn. 249, 254, 186 S.W. 102, 107 (1916), is controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">It is a well-settled rule with us that the lien of a mortgage or trust deed passes, without a special assignment thereof, to the indorsee of a note or transferee of the debt secured by the instrument. The policy of the law is to treat the note as the principal thing and the mortgage as incident \u2014 the transfer of the note secured as a transfer pro tanto of the incident, the lien of the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">The trustee asserts, therefore, that the deed of trust lien passed to the transferee of the debt, that the note \u201cis the principal thing\u201d and that \u201cthe lien of a mortgage [deed of trust]\u201d remains with the possessor of the notes, in this case the debtor, and henceforth the trustee. <em>See also </em>55 Am. Jur.2d <em>Mortgages </em>\u00a7 1270 (1970); <em>Sobel v. Mutual Development, Inc., </em>313 So.2d 77 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">Peoples Bank, however, relies upon the recent decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>Hudson v. Town &amp; Country True Value Hardware, Inc., </em>666 S.W.2d 51 (Tenn.1984), arguing that the predominant nature of the transaction was real estate related, and that a \u201cpredominant factor test\u201d need be applied, as in <em>DeFilippo v. Ford Motor Co., </em>516 F.2d 1313 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 912, 96 S.Ct. 216, 46 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), cited in <em>Hudson. </em>It argues further that the transfer and subsequent recordation of the deeds of trust effectuated a transfer of title, rather than a mere lien, <em>see Howell v. Tomlinson, </em>33 Tenn.App. 1, 228 S.W.2d 112 (1949),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>evidences \u201cin the absence of contrary proof, ... an intent to transfer the debt as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We cannot say that the \u201cpredominant factor\u201d in this case is real-estate-related as urged by Peoples Bank, because of the existence of the deed of trust; the transaction was similarly concerned with promissory notes, which are usually treated as personalty under the U.C.C. <em>DeFilippo </em>was concerned with the bulk sale of a business, and whether the items involved in the sale were predominantly goods or moveables within the meaning of Pennsylvania law. Real estate was apparently not involved. The court held in that case that the U.C.C. applied to the transaction under the \u201crule of reasonable characterization of the transaction as a whole.\u201d 516 F.2d at 1328. <em>Hudson </em>similarly involved the bulk sale of a going business, involving both real estate and stock in trade. The Tennessee Chief Justice in <em>Hudson </em>held that since the \u201cpredominant assets\u201d to be transferred were \u201cnon-goods,\u201d or real estate, the U.C.C. did not apply to the transaction. 666 S.W.2d at 54. We find none of the cases cited by Peoples Bank to be determinative of the question before us. There is no bulk sales issue here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>W.C. Early </em>decided that the holder and possessor of notes, secured by a deed of trust purportedly but wrongfully reflected as having been satisfied and released, would prevail over a bona fide purchaser of the property subject to the indebtedness reflected by the notes. We conclude that it was up to the creditor, Peoples Bank, to protect itself with respect to its interest in the notes, and that its failure in this respect brings about the conclusion that the trustee must prevail with respect to the proceeds of the notes received without respect to foreclosures. To the extent foreclosure of the deeds of trusts, with respect to which Peoples Bank has perfected its interests, brings about a realization of funds, the result might be to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We accordingly hold that the appellant trustee is entitled to the proceeds in controversy. Each party will bear its own costs of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\">. <em>Tomlinson </em>held that a deed given by a mortgagee to another operates as \"an assignment of the mortgage debt, if no contrary intent be expressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 228 S.W.2d at 116. We have no deed here involved executed by Mary-ville Savings and Loan, the mortgagee. <em>Tomlin-son </em>decides that the mortgagee holds the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>title to the properties involved subject to the mortgagor\u2019s or borrower's equities, including the right of redemption by payment of the underlying debt secured by the deed of trust or mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
