His case is before us for the second time because the Solicitor General, on behalf of the appellee U.S. Parole Commission, conceded in a brief in response to appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari that presentence reports are agency records subject to the FOIA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Appellee had previously argued, and we held, that such reports were court records not subject to disclosure under the Act. In light of the Solicitor General\u2019s concession, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated our earlier judgment, 730 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1984), and remanded the case to us, \u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 317, 83 L.Ed.2d 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The Parole Commission now argues that even though the presentence report is an agency record, it is exempt from disclosure, and it seeks to raise claims of exemption not previously made before us or the district court. The Commission, however, proffers absolutely no reason why it did not previously argue all applicable exemptions. That a deliberate choice had been made with regard to exemptions is shown by the fact that it did advance one. <em>Cf. Carson v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>631 F.2d 1008, 1015 n. 29 (D.C.Cir.1980) (government raised no exemptions below, relying entirely on agency vs. court records issue); <em>Berry v. Dept. of Justice, </em>733 F.2d 1343, 1352 n. 13 (9th Cir.1984) (same). We find unpersuasive the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in support of its decision in the identical situation to allow consideration of newly raised exemptions, <em>Cotner v. United States Parole Commission, </em>747 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir.1984), and conclude that this ease does not involve \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting such consideration, <em>Ryan v. Dept. of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781, 792 (D.C. Cir.1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cThe key is that assertion of the exemption originally [must have been] barred by legal doctrine, and only now is available. The exception should not apply when the exemption was available but the government, as the result of a deliberate, tactical decision, simply chose not to assert it. This is \u2018tactical maneuvering\u2019 [and] the consequence is [that] the exemption claim comes too late.\u201d <em>Lykins v. Asst. Atty. Gen., </em>608 F.Supp. 693, 696 (D.D.C.1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\"><em>See Jordan v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753, 780 (D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(en banc). </em>Were we to rule otherwise on the facts of this case we would be elevating routine recourse to hindsight to the level of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">We thus consider only exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), which the Commission raised previously. It states that the FOIA does not apply to matters that are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552(b) of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The Commission seems to argue that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208, the Parole Act, or some combination of the two of them, meet the requirements of \u00a7 552(b)(3). We find the Commission\u2019s argument unpersuasive. Under the Parole Act, the Parole Commission must furnish the prisoner with \u201creasonable access\u201d to the presentence report, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b)(2), a requirement which unquestionably leaves discretion with the Commission to decide what matters should be released to the prisoner and in what form. Contrary to our previous opinion in this case, the Solicitor General has conceded that that discretion also includes the power to furnish defendants with copies of their presentence reports. The extent of the discretion is unimportant; subsection A of \u00a7 552(b) requires that the agency have <em>no </em>discretion. And, since it is the prisoner himself who here asks for the document, whether the statute requires withholding such documents from <em>other </em>members of the public is of no consequence in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">As to subsection B, it does appear that the Parole Act, \u00a7 4208(c), \u201crefers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d The section specifically excludes from the \u201creasonable access\u201d provision three types of information: potentially disruptive diagnostic opinions, documents which reveal confidential sources of information, and other potentially harmful information. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>argues that this section can not apply because he already has seen his entire report. The Commission plausibly responds that there is a distinction between reviewing the report and obtaining a copy of it, and that denial of an opportunity to retain a copy of the report means that it was \u201cwithheld\u201d under \u00a7 4208(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We agree that a presentence report that has been seen but not retained by the defendant logically could be considered \u201cwithheld\u201d under \u00a7 552(b)(3), but we need not reach that issue in this case. The Commission has not convinced us that the exemption would be applicable even if appellant had never seen his report. There is no indication that the Commission refused to release the document because it contained matters which would fall under \u00a7 4208(c). It seems unlikely that exemption 3 would allow withholding of the presentence report simply because \u00a7 4208 is a statute which \u201crefers to particular types of matters to be withheld\u201d, even if none of the types of materials specifically excluded under \u00a7 4208(c) is involved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cNondisclosure is countenanced by Subsection (B) if, but only if, the enactment is the product of congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and incorporates a formula whereby the administrator may determine precisely whether disclosure in any instance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw.\u201d <em>American Jewish Congress v. Kreps, </em>574 F.2d 624, 628-29 (D.C.Cir.1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Surely, the listing of the three exceptions in subsection (c) of \u00a7 4208 must be viewed as the product of Congress\u2019 balancing of competing interests and reflects its \u201cappreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data.\u201d It appears to us that unless the information to be withheld is within that \u201cparticular data\u201d, it does not \u201cpose the hazard\u201d against which Congress sought to protect; the information thus would not fall within exemption 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The Commission appears to make another argument concerning the \u201cparticular types of matters\u201d criterion, claiming that it is met because subsection b of \u00a7 4208 refers to \u201ca report or other document to be used by the Commission in making its determination.\u201d On its face, however, this subsection addresses matters to be <em>disclosed, </em>not withheld, and the Commission has failed to demonstrate how its reading of \u00a7 4208(b) can be reconciled with the plain language of the subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">In addition to statutes referring to particular types of matters, subsection B of \u00a7 552(b)(3) covers statutes which establish \u201cparticular criteria for withholding.\u201d The Commission also appears to argue that \u00a7 4208 meets this second prong of subsection B. The Commission points to the competing policies at issue in disclosing a presentencing report \u2014 the prisoner\u2019s need to review the report before sentencing and the court\u2019s interest in the report\u2019s security \u2014 and emphasizes Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 as evidence of those competing interests. The Commission does not, however, point to \u201cparticular criteria\u201d, and we thus fail to see how \u00a7 4208 fits that part of the exemption 3 requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">We note finally that we have given little attention to whether Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 and \u00a7 4208 jointly preempt FOIA on the issue of presentence reports. The Commission raised this argument only in a footnote at the conclusion of its section on exemption 3 in its original brief to this court, and offered no convincing statutory analysis in support of the theory. We therefore have no basis for believing Congress intended to limit the FOIA in this manner. <em>Cf. Zale Corp. v. U.S. Internal Revenue Service, </em>481 F.Supp. 486 (D.D.C.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we believe appellant is now entitled to a copy of his presentence report. We do not mean to suggest that presentence reports, or parts of them, can never be properly withheld under exemption 3. <em>See Berry v. Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Justice, </em>733 F.2d 1343, 1354 n. 17 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cthe FOIA will probably entitle defendants to copies of that which they were shown at sentencing and no more\u201d). In this case, however, the Commission has failed to show why the FOIA\u2019s broad mandate of disclosure should not be honored.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>The decision of the district court is reversed, and the Commission is directed to provide appellant with a copy of his presentence report.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">. Even if Rule 32 on its own could be considered a \"statute\u201d under \u00a7 552(b)(3), it provides no more basis than does the Parole Act, for identical reasons, for the Commission\u2019s exemption 3 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-16\">. The Commission tries to make much of the fact that if presentence reports are not protected from disclosure under the FOIA, they would be available to third parties as well as to defendants such as appellant. We suspect that exemption 6 would be invoked when disclosure of presentence reports would implicate protectible privacy interests. <em>See Berry v. Dept. of Justice, </em>733 F.2d 1343, 1353 (9th Cir.1984). Moreover, it may be that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 would meet Subsection A of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) when the person seeking disclosure is a member of the general public rather than the prisoner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
