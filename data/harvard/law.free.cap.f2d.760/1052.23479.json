Fulton, Jr., applied for disability insurance benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1) (1982), and supplemental security income benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(1) (1982) in April 1982, alleging that he had been disabled since October 25, 1981, due to a mental impairment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. Fulton then obtained a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who received Fulton\u2019s medical records and heard testimony from Fulton, Fulton\u2019s father, and Dr. Nolan Armstrong, a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">The record reveals that Fulton was born in 1948, is married, and is the father of three sons. He did not finish high school, and worked for fourteen years washing horse trailers with lacquer thinner and paint thinner and spray painting them. He inhaled the fumes to the point of daily intoxication. According to Dr. Vincent, Fulton\u2019s family physician, after two years of increasing problems from inhaling these substances, Fulton suffered a severe reaction in November 1975. Dr. Vincent described Fulton at that time as suffering from both acute contact dermatitis and acute systemic toxic effects, including severe frontal headaches, nausea, vertigo, profound weakness, and \u201cblackout spells.\u201d Although Dr. Vincent indicated in 1975 that it was absolutely necessary for Fulton to avoid further contact with the substances he was using, Fulton continued to try to work, despite suffering from hyperventilation, chest pain, and dyspnea. Fulton was finally unable to maintain regular employment and had a nervous breakdown in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">Following this breakdown, Fulton was hospitalized under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Maud Staveley-O\u2019Carroll, for an extended period of time. After his discharge, he made two attempts to work but could not hold on to a job for more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>day. He became increasingly frustrated and angry and withdrew from his family to keep from venting his anger on them. Fulton was readmitted to the hospital in April 1980, and Dr. Staveley-O\u2019Carroll requested other psychologists and physicians to examine Fulton in an attempt to determine whether his mental problems were caused by exposure to toxic substances. The reports are inconclusive. Fulton was found to have trouble reading, spelling, and doing simple arithmetic, although these problems were of long standing. A neuropsychological examination revealed recently acquired disturbance in memory function and problems in sustaining concentration which may or may not have been due to the toxic substances. In addition, the neuropsychologist found Fulton to be in considerable psychiatric distress, constantly fearful of smothering to death. Dr. Stavely-O\u2019Carroll reported that Fulton described</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlU\">\u201cepisodes of hyperventilation and a feeling that he could not breathe accompanied by tachycardia and pains in the chest. Episodes like this were triggered by the site [sic] of smoke, hot room, or water. Between episodes the patient experienced distortion of visual and auditory perception and hallucinated. The voice he heard told him that he was going to die and that he would be smothered or drowned and this hallucination apparently had alot to do with precipitation of his apparent anxiety attacks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9j\">Rec., vol. II, at 144. Dr. Stavely-O\u2019Carroll diagnosed psychosis of unknown origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Fulton continued to have problems and to seek help. He went to the Scott and White Clinic in Temple, Texas for an evaluation and was diagnosed as having a somatization disorder, a condition in which physiologic disfunction, often resulting in structural changes, is caused by an exaggerated emotional state. In September 1982, he was examined by Dr. Armstrong, as well as by a neuropsychologist and a psychologist. In testifying before the ALJ, Dr. Armstrong noted that Fulton hears voices which criticize him, urge suicide, and accuse his wife of unfaithfulness. Dr. Armstrong stated that Fulton is suspicious and hostile, has withdrawn from others, and has attempted suicide many times. After reviewing his own examination of Fulton and the other medical evidence, Dr. Armstrong concluded that Fulton fell under the criteria for functional nonpsychotic disorders set out in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P, app. 1 (1984) (hereinafter Appendix 1). Dr. Armstrong' concluded that Fulton\u2019s condition is severe, and that \u201c[i]t is quite apparent that he is unable to work and has been unable to work for the past year and it\u2019s unlikely that he will be able to work in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Fulton also testified before the AU. He described hearing voices, hallucinating, and feelings of panic. He stated that he had beaten his wife when the voices told him she was unfaithful, and that the voices sometimes send him on trips and sometimes tell him to kill himself. He stated that he could not stand to be around his family or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">Following the hearing, the AU sent the documentary medical evidence to Dr. Schneider, a medical adviser under contract with the Government, who did not examine Fulton or review a transcript of the hearing. Dr. Schneider concluded that Fulton did not satisfy the requirements for a disabling functional nonpsychotic disorder. The AU adopted Dr. Schneider\u2019s report as his own and rejected Dr. Armstrong\u2019s opinion that Fulton was disabled under the criteria in Appendix 1. The AU found that Fulton was not disabled by applying the medical-vocational guidelines in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P, app. 2 (1984) (hereinafter Appendix 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">Fulton\u2019s request for administrative review by the Appeals Council was denied and he filed this suit for judicial review pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). The parties agreed to proceed before a United States Magistrate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1982) and to take any appeal directly to this court under section 636(c)(3). In reviewing the administrative record, the Magistrate properly disregarded the findings of Dr. Schneider. \u201cAn AU\u2019s use of a post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>hearing medical report constitutes a denial of due process because the applicant is not given the opportunity to cross-examine the physician or to rebut the report.\u201d <em>Allison v. Heckler, </em>711 F.2d 145, 147 (10th Cir. 1983). However, the Magistrate found that the AU\u2019s decision was nonetheless supported by substantial evidence and affirmed the finding of no disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">On appeal Fulton contends that: 1) the AU erred in concluding that he was not disabled under the criteria for functional nonpsychotic disorders set out in Appendix 1; 2) the AU erred in considering his impairments individually instead of considering their combined effect; 3) the AU erred in rejecting his subjective complaints of disabling pain; and 4) the AU erred in applying the medical-vocational guidelines of Appendix 2 to a mental impairment. Because we agree with Fulton\u2019s first contention, we need not reach the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">The regulations provide that if a claimant has an impairment which can be expected to last not less than twelve months and is listed in Appendix 1, he will be found disabled without considering his age, education, and work experience. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d) (1984). Section 12.04 of Appendix 1 lists the criteria for establishing a disabling functional nonpsychotic disorder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-6\">\u201cA. Manifested persistence of one or more of the following clinical signs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-7\">1. Demonstrable and persistent structural changes mediated through psycho-physiological channels (e.g., duodenal ulcer); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-8\">2. Recurrent and persistent periods of anxiety, with tension, apprehension, and interference with concentration and memory; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-9\">3. Persistent depressive affect with insomnia, loss of weight, and suicidal preoccupation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-10\">4. Persistent phobic or obsessive ruminations with inappropriate, bizarre, or disruptive behavior; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-12\">5. Persistent compulsive, ritualistic behavior; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-13\">6. Persistent functional disturbance of vision, speech, hearing, or use of a limb with demonstrable structural or trophic changes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-14\">7. Persistent, deeply ingrained maladaptive patterns of behavior manifested by either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-15\">a. Seclusiveness or autistic thinking; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-16\">b. Pathologically inappropriate suspiciousness or hostility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-17\">B. Resulting persistence of marked restriction of daily activities and constriction of interests and deterioration in personal habits and seriously impaired ability to relate to other people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-18\">A claimant must satisfy at least one of the elements in section A <em>and </em>also satisfy section B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-19\">The AU\u2019s finding that Fulton had not satisfied the criteria in section 12.04 will be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. Evidence is substantial if it is more than a mere scintilla, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Broadbent v. Harris, </em>698 F.2d 407, 414 (10th Cir.1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-20\">\u201cThis oft-cited language is not a talismanic formula for adjudication; the determination is not merely a quantitative exercise. Evidence is not substantial \u2018if it is overwhelmed by other evidence\u2014 particularly certain types of evidence (e.g., that offered by treating physicians) \u2014or if it really constitutes not evidence but mere conclusion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-21\"><em>Knipe, </em>755 F.2d 141, 145 (10th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Kent v. Schweiker, </em>710 F.2d 110, 114 (3d Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-22\">In a motion to remand filed subsequent to the briefs on appeal, and again in oral argument, the Secretary conceded that Fulton satisfies section A and \u201ccomes close\u201d to meeting section B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon a careful review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>of the record, we find ample evidence that Fulton has satisfied section B as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Dr. Armstrong testified that Fulton exhibited pathologically inappropriate suspiciousness and hostility to others as shown by his history of frequent fights and his feelings of suspicion towards people for no good reason. The medical reports by those who examined Fulton contain repeated references to Fulton\u2019s depression, his feelings of hostility, suspicion, aggression, and anger, and his inability to maintain a normal relationship with his family. The psychologist who examined Fulton at the Scott and White Clinic stated that a person with Fulton\u2019s diagnosis is likely to be hypersensitive, somewhat suspicious, and to harbor hostility toward those not perceived as offering attention and support. He recited Fulton\u2019s history of hypersensitivity, aggressive behavior, and vocational adjustment difficulties, noting that the only way Fulton can avoid fighting is to remain sitting at home in a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Fulton testified that he cannot tolerate being around people, that he never goes anywhere, and that he no longer has any friends. He stated that he has tried to get a job but cannot tolerate supervision because of the voices that he hears. He is unable to sleep and does not maintain marital relations with his wife because he cannot stand to touch her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">We conclude that the medical evidence and testimony in this case establish that Fulton suffers persistent marked restriction of daily activities, constriction of interests and deterioration in personal habits, and a seriously impaired ability to relate to other people. He therefore meets the requirements in section B. We reject the contrary opinion of Dr. Schneider. He was not provided with the medical testimony of Dr. Armstrong, or that of Fulton and Fulton\u2019s father regarding Fulton\u2019s daily activities and his impaired ability to relate to other people. As discussed above, reliance on such a post-hearing report violates Fulton\u2019s constitutional rights. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-11\">\u201c[i]n determining the question of substantiality of evidence, the reports of physicians who have treated a patient over a period of time or who are consulted for purposes of treatment are given greater weight than are reports of physicians employed and paid by the government for the purpose of defending against a disability claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\"><em>Broadbent, </em>698 F.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">In reaching our conclusion, we have also considered the psychiatric evaluation of Dr. Thomas Donica, who examined Fulton in May 1982. Dr. Donica concluded that with proper therapy Fulton would be able to respond appropriately to work pressures, supervision, and co-workers within three months. Dr. Armstrong testified that he did not agree with Dr. Donica\u2019s evaluation because he thought Dr. Donica\u2019s examination had been inadequate. We also do not find Dr. Donica\u2019s opinion persuasive. Fulton had received therapy unsuccessfully from a variety of qualified professionals for over two years before Dr. Donica saw him, thus casting doubt on Dr. Donica\u2019s conclusion that therapy would solve Fulton\u2019s problems. Furthermore, Dr. Armstrong examined Fulton and found him unable to work more than three months after Dr. Donica made his prediction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">In sum, we hold that Fulton meets the criteria set out in Appendix 1, sec. 12.04, and is therefore disabled. The AU\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is not supported by substantial evidence. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Secretary for prompt payment to Fulton of social security disability benefits as of October 25, 1981. We are unable to determine on this record whether Fulton has satisfied the requirements in addition to disability for receiving supplemental security income benefits set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382 (1982). Accordingly we direct the Secretary to make a prompt determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>of Fulton\u2019s eligibility under that statute without delaying payment of Fulton\u2019s disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">Reversed and remanded to the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">. \"In determining whether an individual is disabled, 'the relevant law and regulations governing a claim for disability benefits are identical to those governing a claim for supplemental income benefits, [and] we treat the two claims together.\u2019\u201d <em>Knipe v.
