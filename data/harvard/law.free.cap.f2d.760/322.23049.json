Durrah commenced employment with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) as a special police officer on July 30, 1979. The accident at issue occurred some three weeks later, on August 22, 1979. Durrah, at the time of the accident, was on duty on the midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift at a large Metrobus depot. That night, for the second time since he began working for WMA-TA, Durrah was assigned to Post No. 1, where he was responsible for monitoring all traffic entering or leaving the depot. At approximately 4:00 a.m., Durrah left the guardhouse and purchased a soda from a vending machine WMATA had installed in the employees\u2019 lounge on the premises. In alleged contravention of WMATA\u2019s instructions, Durrah did not report that he was leaving the guardhouse and obtain a substitute to cover Post No. 1 in his absence. Upon leaving the lounge to return to Post No. 1, Durrah slipped on a staircase. He immediately complained of a knee injury and in due course sought benefits under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>(1982 &amp; Supp. I 1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An administrative law judge (AU) denied Durrah\u2019s claim, <em>Durrah v. WMATA, </em>No. 80-DCWC-224 (Sept. 29, 1981) (hereafter \u201cAU Decision\u201d), and the Benefits Review Board (BRB) affirmed. <em>Durrah v. WMATA, </em>16 Ben.Rev. Bd.Serv. (MB) 333 (BRB May 8, 1984). On Durrah\u2019s petition for review, we reverse the BRB\u2019s decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Durrah alleges an injury occurring on his employer\u2019s premises in the course of his workday. There is no dispute that this injury would be one \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2), if Durrah had obtained both permission and a substitute to cover Post No. 1 before going to the employees\u2019 lounge. We hold that his fall was securely within the time and space boundaries of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The lounge and staircase were facilities WMATA expected its employees to use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Durrah\u2019s conduct \u2014 getting a soft drink \u2014 is generally incidental to day- (or night-) long employment. The soda machine Durrah visited was maintained by the employer on the employer\u2019s premises. Employee use of the machine was an anticipated occurrence in the course of a workday. \u201cGenerally, personal comfort activities such as obtaining a cold drink for a meal come within the course of employment.\u201d ALJ Decision at 5. <em>See, e.g., Prater v. Indiana Briquetting Corp., </em>253 Ind. 83, 251 N.E.2d 810, 813 (1969); <em>Jones v. Continental Electric Co., </em>75 N.J.Super. 76, 182 A.2d 168 (1962); <em>see also Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307 (D.C.Cir.1968) (en banc). It is not \u201cnecessary that the employee be engaged at the time of the injury in activity of benefit to his employer. All that is required is that the \u2018obligations or conditions\u2019 of employment create the \u2018zone of special danger\u2019 out of which the injury arose.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, </em>340 U.S. 504, 507, 71 S.Ct. 470, 472, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951). <em>Accord, e.g., O\u2019Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Assocs., Inc., </em>380 U.S. 359, 362, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 1014, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965) (per curiam); <em>Hensley v. WMATA, </em>655 F.2d 264 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 904, 102 S.Ct. 1749, 72 L.Ed.2d 160 (1982); <em>Director, OWCP v. Brandt Airflex Corp., </em>645 F.2d 1053, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Kemp, </em>533 F.2d 1224 (D.C.Cir.1976). In short, had Durrah first secured a replacement, his injury would unquestionably have \u201ctake[n] place within the period of the employment, at a place where the employee reasonably may be, and while he [was] engaged in doing something incidental [to the employment].\u201d 1 A. Larson, <em>supra </em>note 3, \u00a7 14.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">The AU found, however, that Durrah violated a WMATA rule in taking a soda break: he left his duty station to go to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>from the lounge area without requesting permission and without obtaining a substitute to cover Post No. 1. That finding alone determined the case for the AU and the BRB. The AU ruled, and the BRB agreed, that \u201c[Durrah\u2019s] actions were removed from the course of employment when [he] knowingly violated the employer\u2019s rule that officers stationed at Post No. 1 never leave the post without express permission.\u201d <em>Durrah, </em>16 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. at 334. We explain below why we are unable to accept this peremptory adjudication of Durrah\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Initially, we note the absence of documentary or clear testimonial evidence for the critical finding that Durrah had been forbidden to leave the guardhouse. The statutory presumption of coverage is relevant in this regard. A claim \u201cshall be presumed\u201d to \u201ccome[] within the provisions of\u201d the Act \u201cin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). The evidence shows that the bus depot had two guardposts; WMA-TA personnel testified that the Post No. 1 guard was to remain at the guardhouse while the Post No. 2 guard made rounds, which evidently included the employees\u2019 lounge. Transcript at 58-61; 75-76. There is no uncloudy record evidence, however, that Durrah, who had begun working at his new station only the night before, was made aware of this distinction between Post No. 1 and Post No. 2 duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The AU based his declaration \u201cthat [Durrah] had notice of the prohibition against leaving the guardhouse\u201d principally upon the assertion that \u201c[the] rule was posted inside the guardhouse, was contained in [Durrah\u2019s] guard manual and rule book, and was covered by the two week training session in which [Durrah] participated.\u201d AU Decision at 4; <em>see also Durrah, </em>16 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. at 334. But the best evidence of the tenor of WMATA\u2019s rule was conspicuously missing from the record WMATA made. WMATA never placed in evidence the rule book, guard manual, or guardhouse sign upon which the AU and, in turn, the BRB relied. We believe these glaring gaps in WMATA\u2019s presentation should have attracted the attention of those assigned to judge Durrah\u2019s case. Nor is there any indication, through testimony or otherwise, that the posting, manual, or rule book, unseen by the AU and BRB, differentiated between Post No. 1 and Post No. 2 duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The only other evidence suggesting that Durrah had been informed of a rule confining Post No. 1 guards to the guardhouse<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was testimony that, on a training ride to facilities in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia a week prior to starting in his new position, Durrah would have discussed and would have had an opportunity to ask questions about his duties. Transcript at 77. More than references to a written rule never placed in evidence and vague testimony that Durrah had an opportunity to get information bearing on guard responsibilities should be required to overcome the advantage Congress accorded workers by the coverage presumption set out in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). <em>See Champion v. S &amp; M Traylor Brothers, </em>690 F.2d 285 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Hensley v. WMATA, </em>655 F.2d at 267-71; <em>Swinton v. Kelly, </em>554 F.2d 1075, 1084-85 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 67, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976). What more the AU and BRB perceived we cannot discover in the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Our disagreement with the AU and BRB, however, goes beyond the cloudy quality of the evidence WMATA presented at the hearing. Even viewing the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the light most favorable to WMATA, we do not comprehend how it can be maintained that Durrah\u2019s transgression \u201cso thoroughly disconnected [him] from the service of his employer that it would be entirely unreasonable to say that injuries suffered by him arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>340 U.S. at 507, 71 S. Ct. at 472 (quoting <em>Waters v. William J. Taylor Co., </em>218 N.Y. 248, 252, 112 N.E. 727, 728 (1916)); <em>accord, e.g., O\u2019Keeffe, </em>380 U.S. at 362, 85 S.Ct. at 1014. The asserted violation did not place Durrah in the path of new risks not inherent in his employment situation. Had Durrah followed his employer\u2019s alleged instructions to the letter in obtaining permission to take a mid-shift break at the employees\u2019 lounge soda machine, his injury would have occurred in the very same place on WMATA\u2019s premises, at the same time, and in the same manner. Far from severing the link between employment circumstances and injury, Durrah\u2019s deviation did not determine the time or place of his injury, and did not render his activity nonincidental to employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The AU and BRB cited no authority closely in point in support of their dispositions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> WMATA, in its brief to this court, offers as the most analogous cases ones in which guards left the work premises and thus removed themselves, as Durrah did not, from the space boundaries of routine compensation coverage. <em>Lisonbee v. Chicago Mill &amp; Lumber Co., </em>278 So.2d 5 (La. 1973); <em>Metropolitan Sand &amp; Gravel Corp. v. Lowe, </em>22 F.Supp. 65 (E.D.N.Y.1938). In sharp contrast, the fateful staircase here came with the territory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was part of the employment scene for guards who did rounds, for guards assigned to a fixed spot who obtained replacements, and for guards who did not. Fault on Durrah\u2019s part there may be, but to deny compensation solely because of misconduct that does nothing to alter the relationship between employment setting and injury would be alien to the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whatever discipline Durrah\u2019s alleged rule violation may have warranted, it distorts workers\u2019 compensation precedent, and the basis in law and reason for that precedent, to describe his staircase slip as outside the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>zone that the conditions of his employment created. <em>See Gondeck v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>382 U.S. 25, 27, 86 S.Ct. 153, 154, 15 L.Ed.2d 21 (1965) (per curiam); <em>O\u2019Keeffe, </em>380 U.S. at 362, 85 S.Ct. at 1014; <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>340 U.S. at 507, 71 S.Ct. at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The AU \u00e1nd BRB relied on evidence that was far from the best WMATA could have offered; in view of the statutory presumption of coverage, that evidence should not have been embraced so swiftly. More basically, even assuming the facts to have been as stated by the AU, the employee\u2019s alleged misconduct did not sever the relationship between the employment circumstances and the injury. We therefore reverse the BRB\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">.

We have no occasion to consider how far employment circumstances may range beyond locations employees are expected to frequent in a routine workday. Our decision does not implicate, and therefore in no way impugns, the numerous cases holding compensable injuries that occur off premises or at locations placed off limits by an employer's rules. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Leary v.

The AU relied in part on a statement Durrah gave to WMATA, but refused to sign, the morning after the incident. Employer\u2019s Exhibit 8. <em>See </em>AU Decision at 4. In the statement, Durrah indicated as a matter of \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that getting a soda without first calling for a replacement was done by \"all the rest of the officers,\" Employer\u2019s Exhibit 8, p. 2 at A. 5; he did not differentiate between Post No. 1 and Post No. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-13\">. Any doubt the AU and BRB might have entertained as to the source and severity of Durrah\u2019s knee problem, <em>see </em>Transcript at 25-29, should not have influenced the threshold decision whether the incident he alleged fell within the compensation statute\u2019s compass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\">. The cases discussed in 1A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 31.00, 31.12 (1981), cited by the BRB, are inapposite. No \u201dviolation[] of express prohibitions relating to incidental activities,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 31.00, is alleged. No rule forbade getting sodas or going to the lounge. The asserted rule addressed merely the manner of engaging in activity the employer routinely permitted. In the cases Professor Larson discusses, unlike Durrah\u2019s, obedience would have prevented the injury. The sometimes <em>recherche </em>distinctions invoked to resolve obscure cases should not cloud analysis where the employee is injured in the course of work-incidental conduct on the employer\u2019s premises during working hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. We do not venture in this opinion any overarching views on whether or when guards who leave their employer's premises seeking personal comfort, <em>see Jones v. Continental Elec.
