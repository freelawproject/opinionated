Without responding to this motion as authorized by Rule 26 of our General Rules, appellant has filed a motion to stay this appeal until the Sixth Circuit has decided the Government\u2019s \u201cprecautionary\u201d appeal of the same case to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">Our ruling on the motion to dismiss the appeal to this court is deemed controlled by <em>Bray v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 73, 96 S.Ct. 307, 46 L.Ed.2d 215 (1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also, United States v. Cooper, </em>482 F.2d 1393 (Em.App.1973); <em>United States v. Zang, </em>645 F.2d 999 (Em.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 864, 102 S.Ct. 323, 70 L.Ed.2d 164 (1981); <em>United States v. Uni Oil, Inc., </em>646 F.2d 946 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s motion for stay should be denied and the appellees\u2019 motion for dismissal of this appeal should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">. All the more compelling here because the dismissal of the indictment by the district court was predicated upon the wholly non-ESA/EPAA ground of the \"Government\u2019s negligence in failing to protect the documents and the resulting prejudice to the defendants\u2019 ability to put on an adequate defense\u201d in the light of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order dated February 8, 1985, at 9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
