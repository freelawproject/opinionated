LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">Appellant Young\u2019s habeas corpus death penalty petition appears for a second time in this court. Young maintains that the district court\u2019s initial judgment, <em>Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. 274 (M.D.Ga.1980)\u2014 holding that there was insufficient evidence to support the death sentence, <em>i.e., </em>insufficient evidence to prove the alleged statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as required by the Georgia death penalty statute, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30(c) \u2014 bars the state under the Double Jeopardy Clause from seeking the death penalty in its current retrial of Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AbV\">Young was tried and convicted of murder, armed robbery, and robbery by intimidation in the Superior Court of Green County, Georgia, in February of 1976. The evidence presented at trial showed that after a heated argument with his banker, Flynt, over a loan, Young shot and killed the banker. After the shooting, Young took a wallet from his victim\u2019s back pants pocket and left the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Georgia\u2019s bifurcated death sentencing procedures, <em>see </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30, <em>et seq., </em>Young was sentenced to death after the jury found that Young was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of two statutory aggravating factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The two aggravating factors found were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-16\">(1) \u201c[T]he offense of murder ... was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>armed robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-17\">(2) \u201c[T]he offender committed the offense of murder ... for the purpose of receiving money\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-18\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30(b)(2), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-19\">After exhausting all available state remedies, Young filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254. Young alleged several constitutional infirmities, only two of which are relevant to this appeal. First, he maintained that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel at both the guilt/innocence phase of his trial and at the sentencing phase. Second, Young maintained that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support either aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Young argued, his death sentence could not stand because Georgia law requires such a sentence to be supported by at least one legitimate aggravating factor. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-31. The district court ruled that Young\u2019s trial counsel had been reasonably effective at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>guilt/innocence phase of the trial. However, the court held that Young\u2019s counsel had been constitutionally ineffective at the sentencing phase of the trial. In addition, the district court agreed with Young that the evidence was insufficient to support either of the statutory aggravating factors. <em>See Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. at 278-81. The court found that there was no evidence that Young had formed the intent to rob his victim prior to the killing and, thus, the murder was not perpetrated while Young was <em>engaged </em>in another capital felony <em>(i.e., </em>armed robbery), nor for the <em>purpose </em>of receiving money. Thus, the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus with respect to Young\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">The state appealed the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to Young\u2019s death sentence, and Young cross-appealed from the denial of his other claims. On appeal, this court made only one explicit ruling: that Young\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, as well as during the sentencing phase. <em>Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d 792 (11th Cir.1982). Thus, the court held that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus with respect to the guilt phase of Charlie Young\u2019s trial is ... REVERSED.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800. With respect to the district court\u2019s holding that there was insufficient evidence to support the statutory aggravating factors, this court made no explicit determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the court acknowledged the district court\u2019s ruling in this regard, <em>id. </em>at 794, 799, and discussed the \u201cdeficiency in the evidence\u201d in the course of highlighting Young\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. <em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">After this court\u2019s decision in <em>Young v. Zant, supra, </em>Young was reindicted by the Green County grand jury. The grand jury again charged Young with murder, armed robbery, and robbery by intimidation. Subsequently, on December 8, 1982, Young's trial counsel was served with a new \u201cnotice of statutory aggravating circumstances,\u201d indicating that the state would again seek the death penalty. The notice stated that the two aggravating circumstances alleged in Young\u2019s first trial would again serve as bases for the imposition of the death penalty. In addition, the notice indicated that the state would seek to submit to the jury a third aggravating circumstance: that the murder was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">Upon receiving this new notice of statutory aggravating circumstances, Young pleaded double jeopardy, arguing that the federal district court\u2019s insufficiency finding amounted to former jeopardy under <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), and <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981). This plea was overruled by the trial court and appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. The Georgia Supreme Court agreed with the trial court, finding no double jeopardy bar to the imposition of a new death sentence based on the same aggravating factors alleged in the first trial. <em>Young v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>251 Ga. 153, 303 S.E.2d 431 (1983) (one Justice dissented), ce<em>rt. denied sub nom. Young v. Georgia, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 740, 79 L.Ed.2d 198 (1984) (two Justices dissented from denial of certiorari). Subsequently, the case was returned to the Green County Superior Court for trial. On March 14, 1984, Young filed in federal district court a \u201cMotion to Enforce Judgment\u201d in his original federal habeas corpus proceeding. Young argued that the state\u2019s attempt to impose the death penalty violated the Double Jeopardy Clause in light of the district court\u2019s prior determination of evidentiary insufficiency with regard to the statutory aggravating factors alleged in Young\u2019s first trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>district court declined to enforce its prior habeas judgment by applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar imposition of the death penalty in Young\u2019s retrial, suggesting instead that it was appropriate for this court to determine the validity of the double jeopardy claim, because the decision would turn in part on the meaning of the previous decision of this court. <em>Young v. Zant, </em>585 F.Supp. 295 (M.D.Ga.1984) <em>(\"Young II\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">We conclude that the previous judgment of this court left intact the district court\u2019s finding of insufficient evidence to support the death sentence. That being the case, the double jeopardy principles announced in <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), and <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981), prevent the state from seeking the death penalty in Young\u2019s retrial. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">In reviewing Young\u2019s double jeopardy claim, we must answer two principal questions: (1) what was the effect of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d 792, on the validity of the district court\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to buttress the aggravating factors alleged to support Young\u2019s death sentence? <em>See Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. 274, 280-81; and (2) what are the double jeopardy implications of the district court\u2019s holding?</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">A. <em>This Court\u2019s Initial Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">As indicated above, this court made no explicit ruling with regard to the district court\u2019s holding that there was insufficient evidence to support the aggravating factors alleged by the state. It is important to ask whether this court implicitly affirmed or reversed the district court\u2019s sufficiency finding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">It is clear that the court of appeals was cognizant of the district court\u2019s finding regarding sufficiency and that the state sought reversal of this finding. 677 F.2d at 794. Although the court did not entertain the sufficiency issue for adjudication per se, it did comment on the issue with respect to Young\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-12\">Turning to the armed robbery count, we note the district court, in assessing the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence of aggravating circumstances on the malice murder charge, concluded that the State did not produce sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Young had formed the intent to rob Flynt prior to the fatal assault. <em>Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. at 280-81. This deficiency in the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>should have been sufficiently clear to Garland [Young\u2019s trial attorney] to suggest a strong argument that Young did not rob Flynt by use of an offensive weapon and thus could not be guilty of armed robbery under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 26-1902.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">677 F.2d at 799 [footnote omitted]; <em>see also id. </em>at 794 n. 3. Young urges this court to consider the above quoted language as an implicit affirmance of the district court\u2019s sufficiency finding. While we acknowledge that the appellate court\u2019s description of the \u201cdeficiency in the evidence\u201d amounts to a favorable comment upon the district court\u2019s sufficiency finding, we do not believe that the above quoted paragraph was intended as an affirmance. Nowhere in the opinion does the court take up the sufficiency issue as a separate matter. There is no question that the sufficiency issue was dealt with for the explicit purpose of highlighting the court\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel analysis. <em>Cf. Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d at 799 n. 12 (\u201cAlthough the petitioner did not raise a claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support his armed robbery conviction, we consider the insufficiency of that evidence in assessing the adequacy of Garland\u2019s assistance to Young under the Sixth Amendment\u201d). Finally, the court ended its opinion by indicating that the relief being granted related only to the guilt/innocence phase of Young\u2019s trial. 677 F.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">The state argues, on the other hand, that the effect of this court\u2019s opinion was to reverse the district court\u2019s sufficiency finding. This argument also has no merit. First, as Young\u2019s counsel pointed out at oral argument, if we read the court of appeals opinion as reversing the district court entirely, we would, as a matter of logic, be compelled to believe that this court meant to reverse the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to the numerous constitutional claims on which the district court denied relief. Such an interpretation of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion would be absurd since at least two of Young\u2019s claims were broad-based attacks on the constitutionality of the Georgia death penalty statute. Second, that this court intended to reverse the district court's sufficiency finding after discussing it favorably in conjunction with its ineffective assistance of counsel analysis is contrary to a common sense reading of the opinion. Finally, it is important to note the precise way in which the court of appeals granted relief. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-7\">The district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus <em>with respect to the guilt phase </em>of Charlie Young\u2019s trial is therefore REVERSED. On receipt of the mandate, the district court shall grant the writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">677 F.2d at 800 (emphasis added). The emphasized language makes clear that the reversal did not relate to the sentencing phase of Young\u2019s trial, the phase which is pertinent to the sufficiency claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">The state also argues that the court of appeals chose to \u201cnullify\u201d the district court\u2019s opinion, relying on the interpretation given our prior opinion by the Georgia Supreme Court. <em>See Young v. State, </em>251 Ga. 153, 303 S.E.2d 431, 432-33 (1983). In denying Young\u2019s double jeopardy claim, the Georgia Supreme Court put great stock in the fact that this court did not by its words explicitly affirm the district court. The Georgia court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-10\">Rather than reversing in part and affirming in part, the court of appeals chose to substitute its opinion for that of the district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-11\">We perceive that the effect of this reversal was to nullify the entire opinion of the district court and to place the parties in the position <em>quo ante, </em>subject, of course, to the holdings of the court of appeals ____ It follows that in reviewing the denial of Young\u2019s double jeopardy pleas, we look only to the opinion of the court of appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-13\"><em>Young v. State, </em>303 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">We respectfully conclude that the idea that this court sought to \u201cnullify\u201d the district court opinion in all respects draws no support from the plain language of this court\u2019s opinion. Our conclusion is bolstered by the same reasons given above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>indicating that this court could not have intended to reverse every aspect of the district court\u2019s judgment. If this court had chosen to substitute its opinion for the district court\u2019s, the more appropriate action would have been to \u201cvacate,\u201d not \u201creverse.\u201d For the reasons indicated, we are confident that this court\u2019s prior opinion did not intend to \u201cnullify\u201d the district court\u2019s sufficiency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Given the above analysis, it is apparent that the court of appeals did not appreciate the double jeopardy implications of the district court\u2019s sufficiency ruling<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, thus, did not find it necessary to reach the issue. The court apparently labored under the misunderstanding that by reversing the district court on a guilt/innocence phase issue, all sentencing phase issues were subsumed thereby, and were thus irrelevant. That being the case, we are left with an <em>undisturbed district court holding </em>with respect to its sentencing phase sufficiency finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The effect of leaving this portion of the district court holding undisturbed on appeal is the same as if there had been no appeal at all. <em>See </em>IB J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.404[9], This holding became the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">We now must consider whether the state is barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause from seeking a death sentence in Young\u2019s retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">B. <em>Does Double Jeopardy Attach to the District Court\u2019s Sufficiency Finding?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Before turning to a consideration of the double jeopardy effect of the district court\u2019s insufficiency finding, we address two subsidiary arguments made by the state which contend that the district court\u2019s ruling was not, in reality, a holding that the evidence was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">First, the state argues, relying on the Georgia Supreme Court opinion, that the district court\u2019s finding was not actually one of insufficient evidence because the court misconstrued the applicable Georgia law. The Georgia Supreme Court apparently interpreted the district court opinion as holding that the fact of the victim\u2019s death prior to the taking would extricate the defendant\u2019s conduct from the definition of armed robbery. <em>Young v. State, </em>303 S.E.2d at 433-34. The Georgia court then properly criticized such a holding as being inconsistent with <em>Moore v. State, </em>233 Ga. 861, 213 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1975). <em>Moore </em>held that a defendant may be convicted of armed robbery even if he incapacitates or kills the victim prior to the actual robbery, where the \u201c[appellants\u2019 admitted purpose in going to [the victim\u2019s] home was to rob him.\u201d 213 S.E.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">We respectfully conclude that the Georgia Supreme Court misinterpreted the district court opinion, and that the district court opinion is not in fact in derogation of <em>Moore v. State. </em>The district court did not hold that there can be no armed robbery merely because the victim dies prior to the taking (a holding which would be in derogation of <em>Moore v. State); </em>rather, the district court held that the murder must be \u201cin the course of\u201d the armed robbery, and that the murder here was not \u201cin the course of\u201d the armed robbery because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>intent to rob was an afterthought and was not formulated until after the murder was entirely completed (a holding which is not inconsistent with <em>Moore v. State). </em>The plain words of the district court opinion require this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">The only relevant evidence presented at trial indicated that petitioner <em>did not contemplate </em>the taking of any money until after the shots had been fired and the blows had been struck, <em>i.e., </em>after the murder had been committed____ Based on the evidence presented at trial, that petitioner prior to the commission of the murder had any <em>intent </em>to rob the victim is only speculation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\"><em>Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. 274, 280-81 (emphasis added). Thus, the district court finding turns <em>not </em>on the notion that armed robbery cannot legally occur subsequent to the incapacitation or death of the victim; rather, the decision turns on the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was no evidence that the murder was committed <em>in the course </em>of the armed robbery <em>ox for the purpose </em>of obtaining money, because the intent to rob and the purpose to obtain money were afterthoughts and, thus, nonexistent until after the murder was entirely completed. The dissenting opinion in the Georgia Supreme Court puts it precisely: <em>Young v. State, </em>803 S.E.2d at 436 (dissenting opinion). We conclude that there was no erroneous construction of the Georgia statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">The district court found that the jury could only speculate that Young intended to rob the victim before committing the murder, ... and thus that the evidence as to the first aggravating circumstance \u2014 murder committed <em>in the course </em>of an armed robbery \u2014 was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">Second, the state argues, relying again on the opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court, that the federal district court did not make a finding of constitutional insufficiency. The Georgia Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[ajbsent a reliance upon <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>... in support of [the federal district court\u2019s] determination, we conclude that the court\u2019s observations related to the <em>weight </em>of the evidence rather than the constitutional sufficiency.\u201d <em>Young v. State, </em>303 S.E.2d at 434. The Georgia court\u2019s statement in this regard finds no support in the federal district court\u2019s habeas ruling. The district court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-12\">Petitioner also asserts as a basis for habeas corpus relief that the evidence at trial did not support the jury\u2019s finding of statutory aggravating circumstances ... (b)(2), that the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and ... (b)(4) that the murder was committed for the purpose of obtaining money. Having carefully considered all of the evidence presented at trial, the court finds that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed <em>in the course of </em>an armed robbery or <em>for the purpose of </em>obtaining money. The only relevant evidence presented at trial indicated that petitioner did not contemplate the taking of any money until after the shots had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>been fired and the blows had been struck, <em>i.e., </em>after the murder had been committed ____ Based on the evidence presented at trial, that petitioner prior to the commission of the murder had any intent to rob the victim is only speculation. Certainly the evidence does not prove these aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\"><em>Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. 274, 280-81 (emphasis in original). The above quoted language clearly constitutes a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>insufficiency finding, invoking the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard announced in <em>Jackson </em>and referring to legal sufficiency. In <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2792, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the Supreme Court held that a federal habeas court may grant the writ if upon the evidence presented in a state criminal proceeding \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s reliance on the fact that the district court did not cite <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>is not persuasive. A federal habeas court has no power to grant habeas corpus relief because it finds that the state conviction is against the \u201cweight\u201d of the evidence, and there is no hint in the district court\u2019s opinion that the district court misunderstood this fundamental principle. We conclude that the district court\u2019s judgment cannot reasonably be construed to be anything other than a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>holding on the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Having concluded that the district court\u2019s holding was, in reality, based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence, we now turn to the question of whether the state is barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause from seeking a death sentence in Young\u2019s retrial. In assessing Young\u2019s double jeopardy claim, we must consider two recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">In <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), defendant Burks was tried in a federal district court. Before the case was submitted to the jury, Burks moved for a judgment of acquittal which was denied by the trial judge. The jury then found Burks guilty as charged. On appeal, the court of appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, but remanded to the district court to decide whether it was proper to retry Burks <em>{i.e., </em>whether the government could produce additional evidence which would cure the insufficiency). The Supreme Court was thus \u201cpresented with the question of whether a defendant may be tried a second time when a reviewing court has determined that in a prior trial the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 98 S.Ct. at 2144. Reasoning from the established doctrine that double jeopardy attaches to a judgment of acquittal, the court stated that to distinguish between a judgment of acquittal and appellate reversal based on insufficient evidence \u201cwould create a purely arbitrary distinction between those in petitioners position and others who would enjoy the benefit of a correct decision by the [trial cjourt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 98 S.Ct. at 2147. The Court thus held \u201cthat the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>found evidence legally insufficient \u2014\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 98 S.Ct. at 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">In <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981), the Supreme Court held that double jeopardy principles apply to the sentencing phase of Missouri\u2019s bifurcated death penalty system.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bullington was convicted in state court of a capital offense for which the state sought the death penalty. However, the jury in its discretion sentenced him to life in prison without eligibility for probation or parole for 50 years. Thereafter, Bullington was granted a new trial on the ground that his trial jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. <em>See Duren v.

Under Georgia\u2019s death penalty statute, with certain exceptions not relevant here, the jury can only impose the death sentence if it finds the defendant guilty of a capital crime and, then, in a separate proceeding, finds the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of at least one of the statutory aggravating factors. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-31. Even if the jury finds the defendant guilty of a statutory aggravating factor, it nevertheless has complete discretion to forego imposing the death sentence, and to sentence the defendant to life in prison. <em>Id.; Gregg v.

The court of appeals' failure to explicitly rule on the insufficiency claim in <em>Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d 792 (11th Cir.1982), is of critical importance in assessing Young's double jeopardy claim in the instant appeal. <em>See infra </em>Part II.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">. A fuller discussion of the Georgia Supreme Court decision and its implications with regard to Young's double jeopardy claim appears in Part II.B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">. In the first instance, it is important to ask whether a finding of constitutional insufficiency is reviewable at all, <em>i.e., </em>whether double jeopardy attaches as soon as a court makes its determination of insufficiency. This court has assumed otherwise \u2014 that it <em>can </em>reverse a federal district court\u2019s habeas determination of insufficient evidence \u2014 and it has done so when it f\u00f3und the lower court to be in error. <em>Martin v. Alabama, </em>730 F.2d 721, 723 (11th Cir.1984). At first blush, this might seem to be at odds with the general proposition that a judgment of acquittal amounts to former jeopardy. However, where a reviewing court is assessing the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in which the defendant was originally convicted in the trial court <em>(e.g., </em>all federal habeas proceedings), a reversal of the reviewing court\u2019s insufficiency finding would not result in a <em>retrial </em>of the defendant. While a jury verdict of acquittal is absolutely final, <em>see Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 16, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2150, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), a judgment of acquittal after a jury conviction or an appellate reversal on the basis of insufficient evidence does not always amount to former jeopardy. There is a narrow exception in cases where an original jury verdict of guilty is set aside and a judgment of acquittal is entered on sufficiency of the evidence grounds either by the trial judge or by an intermediate appellate court. In such a case, it has been held that double jeopardy does not preclude a subsequent reversal on appeal of such a judgment of acquittal, because the appellate reversal would not result in a retrial, but rather in a reinstatement of the jury\u2019s guilty finding. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 345, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1022, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975) (\u201ca defendant has no legitimate claim to benefit from an error of law when that error could be corrected without subjecting him to a second trial before a second trier of fact\u2019\u2019); <em>accord, Arizona v. Rumsey, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 2311, 81 L.Ed.2d 164, 172 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">. None of the participants in this case seem to have recognized the double jeopardy issue at this point in the litigation. In fact, the district court had earlier suggested that the state might again seek the death penalty on retrial, although on different aggravating circumstances. <em>Young v. Zant, </em>506 F.Supp. 274, 281 (M.D.Ga.1980). However, the district court cannot be faulted for this since its opinion was rendered prior to <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981), the case which first applied double jeopardy principles to the sentencing phase of a bifurcated death penalty system. <em>See infra </em>Part II.B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">. We realize that a definitive ruling by the court of appeals on the sufficiency question would have produced a more satisfactory result. Nevertheless, the state was not left without procedural mechanisms to force a resolution of the issue. The state could have petitioned for rehearing or rehearing en banc to this court or for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The fact that the state did not use these procedural mechanisms indicates that it, too, did not appreciate the double jeopardy consequences of the district court\u2019s ruling at the time it was rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">. In any event, it is far from clear that an error of law, even if it did exist, would work in the state\u2019s favor. Generally, the fact that an acquittal may result from an erroneous evidentiary ruling or an error of law does not alter its double jeopardy implications. \"[TJhere is no exception permitting retrial once the defendant has been acquitted, no matter how \u2018egregiously erroneous\u2019 ... the legal rulings leading to that judgment might be.\u201d <em>Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 75, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2184, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978), <em>quoting Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S.Ct. 671, 672, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962); <em>see also Arizona v. Rumsey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 2310-11, 81 L.Ed.2d 164, 171-72 (1984) (applying this principle in death sentencing context). While it is true that any such error of law could have been corrected on appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment because it would not have resulted in the retrial of the defendant, <em>see supra </em>note 5, it would be another question entirely whether the district court\u2019s insufficiency judgment, which is now the law of the case, can be collaterally attacked where double jeopardy concerns are implicated. Because we find no error of law, we need not address that thorny issue. In any event, the state has made no such collateral attack argument seeking to avoid the lav; of the case doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">. An insufficiency finding by a habeas court under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>like findings of legal insufficiency by other reviewing courts, must be given double jeopardy effect. <em>See Tibbs v. Florida, </em>457 U.S. 31, 44-45 &amp; n. 21, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 2219-2220 &amp; n. 21, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). In <em>Tibbs, </em>petitioner argued that the distinction between reversal on the basis of the weight of the evidence, with no double jeopardy consequences, and reversal on the basis of legally insufficient evidence, which would invoke the double jeopardy bar, would undermine <em>Burks </em>by encouraging appellate judges to mask insufficiency reversals as weight-of-the-evidence reversals. The Supreme Court responded that <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>would place some restraints on that temptation. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>recognized that a federal habeas corpus court could enforce the Due Process prohibition against any conviction based on legally insufficient evidence. The clear implication of the Supreme Court's remarks in <em>Tibbs </em>is that a federal habeas corpus court\u2019s finding of insufficiency would carry double jeopardy consequences. If such were not the case, the difference between a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>insufficiency finding and a weight-of-the-evidence finding would be meaningless because in either case the defendant could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>retried. The Fifth Circuit explained and applied this interpretation of <em>Tibbs </em>in <em>Carter v. Estelle, </em>691 F.2d 777, 778-84 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1056, 103 S.Ct. 1508, 75 L.Ed.2d 937 (1983). In addition, the First Circuit has explicitly held that a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>insufficiency finding creates a double jeopardy bar under <em>Burks. Lydon v. Justices of Boston Municipal Court, </em>698 F.2d 1, 2-3, 7 (1982), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984); <em>cf. Greene v. Massey, </em>706 F.2d 548 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 718, 79 L.Ed.2d 180 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">. The Missouri structure is similar to Georgia\u2019s in that the same jury makes both the guilt/innocence and sentencing phase determinations, that the jury must find at least one aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury may always sentence the defendant to life, even if it finds that the aggravating factors \"outweigh\u201d the mitigating factors. <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 432-35, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 1854-56, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981). The Missouri statute has certain provisions not found in the Georgia statute, <em>e.g., </em>a specific enumeration of mitigating factors; however, the state does not argue, nor could it, that any statutory differences between the Georgia and Missouri schemes make <em>Bullington </em>inapplicable here. <em>Cf. Arizona v. Rumsey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 81 L.Ed.2d 164 (1984) <em>(Bullington </em>fully applicable where judge, not jury, makes sentencing determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1202-16\">. <em>Green v. Zant, </em>738 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir.1984), and <em>Zant v. Redd, </em>249 Ga. 211, 290 S.E.2d 36 (1982), relied upon by the state, are inapposite. <em>Redd </em>involved an original sentencing trial in which the state relied upon three aggravating circumstances. The jury's findings listed only one of the aggravating factors in recommending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>the death sentence. After reversal on appeal for trial error, the state, at resentencing, relied upon the same three aggravating circumstances plus an additional one. The second jury\u2019s findings in recommending death listed two aggravating circumstances, including one presented but not found at the original sentencing.The Georgia Supreme Court rejected Redd\u2019s double jeopardy argument. It held that the original jury\u2019s failure to list the aggravating circumstance could not be considered an acquittal because the jury was instructed that it need only find one of the several aggravating circumstances presented. Thus, having found one aggravating circumstance, the original jury might well have simply declined to decide whether the other ones were proved. The Georgia court also declined to equate the failure to find one of several aggravating circumstances with the verdict itself, which was accorded double jeopardy effect in <em>Bullington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Although <em>Green </em>involved facts even more remote from the instant case than <em>Redd, </em>this court approved the rationale of <em>Redd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">The instant case does not involve the mere failure of one of several aggravating circumstances. Here, there was legally insufficient evidence with respect to the only aggravating circumstances presented to the jury. Thus, the death sentence itself fell for lack of legally sufficient evidence. This situation <em>is </em>comparable to the .verdict itself, which was accorded double jeopardy significance in <em>Bullington. See Green v. Zant, </em>738 F.2d at 1541. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">. The state argues that even if we find that imposition of the death penalty is barred with respect to the two aggravating factors alleged in Young\u2019s first trial, the state may still seek the death penalty on the basis of a \"new\u201d aggravating factor, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 17 \u2014 10\u201430(b)(7) (involving whether the murder was \"outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-18\"><em>Bullington </em>is based on the notion that, after the equivalent of a judgment of acquittal, a defendant must not be forced to run the gauntlet and stand trial for his life again. Although <em>Bullington </em>involved an attempt at retrial based upon the same aggravating factors used in the original trial, its holding is explicitly not limited to such a circumstance. The court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5U\">our decision today does not at all depend upon the State\u2019s announced intention to rely only upon the same aggravating circumstances it sought to prove at petitioner\u2019s first trial or upon its statement that it would introduce no new evidence in support of its contention that petitioner deserves the death penalty. Having received \"one fair opportunity to offer whatever it could assemble,\" <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States ..., </em>the state is not entitled to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeG\">451 U.S. at 446, 101 S.Ct. at 1862. The above quotation from <em>Bullington </em>also disposes of the ground upon which the district court apparently relied in its most recent opinion, declining to find double jeopardy effect. The district court apparently interpreted its original insufficiency holding as meaning \"not that there was insufficient evidence to support the death sentence but rather that the evidence was not sufficient to support the death penalty based on the particular aggravating circumstances relied on by the district attorney.\u201d <em>Young II, </em>585 F.Supp. at 299. As the above-quoted language from <em>Bullington </em>makes clear, having elected to rely on the two aggravating circumstances at Young\u2019s original sentencing trial, and having failed to adduce legally sufficient evidence to support a death sentence on those aggravating circumstances, the state is not entitled to a second attempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
