The district court dismissed each claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. For the reasons expressed below, we reverse these rulings and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-23\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">Richard Kuntz, Dan Caccavo, Jimmy Humes, John McCord, Gursewak Singh, and Duane White (the Kuntz plaintiffs) worked for the Capitol Metals Companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>(the Companies)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> during various periods between 1970 and 1981. In 1982, the Kuntz plaintiffs filed suit against the Companies, which had employed them and sponsored their pension plan and trust fund, and against the successors-in-interest to Capitol Metals\u2019 assets (the Reese defendants),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who administer the pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">In short, the Kuntz plaintiffs contend that the Reese defendants lied about the amount of benefits that plaintiffs would get under the plan and failed to comply with ERISA requirements for disclosing pension plan documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In the district court, the Kuntz plaintiffs alleged that the Companies and the Reese defendants misrepresented to each Kuntz plaintiff, both at the time he interviewed for his job and afterward, that the Companies would immediately enroll each Kuntz plaintiff in the pension plan. The Reese defendants described the plan as \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d Plaintiffs further alleged that, in response to employees\u2019 requests for information about the plan, the Companies and the Reese defendants promised to send pertinent documents soon and advised the Kuntz plaintiffs not to worry. According to the original complaint, the pension plan \u25a0 was neither standard nor good; instead, the plan discriminated in favor of the highest-paid workers and failed to provide any coverage to other workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The original complaint also alleged that the Companies and the Reese defendants falsely represented that, when a firm called Estell Corp. purchased Capitol Metals Co., the employees would be covered by a new, retroactive pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">The Reese defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court dismissed the second through seventh claims for relief in the original complaint, apparently on the ground that these claims were state law causes of action over which the court could decline to exercise its pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">Next, defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under ERISA, to strike parts of the complaint, and to require plaintiffs to make a more definite statement of the case. The district court granted this motion in part. After striking the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for punitive damages and their allegations of misrepresentation, the district court gave plaintiffs 30 days to amend to allege that Kuntz and the others had made written requests for pension plan documents, to specify the dates of purported ERISA disclosure violations, and to identify the plan administrators involved in the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">Later, the Kuntz plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. This complaint stated only federal claims under ERISA. The Reese defendants again moved to dismiss each count for failure to state a claim. They argued that the statute of limitations barred the claim and moved to strike as immaterial plaintiffs\u2019 fraud and misrepresentation allegations. The court granted the motions in their entirety without leave to amend. The Kuntz plaintiffs then took the appeal now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">Finally, after the parties had briefed the substantive issues we outlined above, the Reese defendants moved this court to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Kuntz plaintiffs did not have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\">We now take up each disputed matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-20\">I. Standing to Sue</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-21\">According to the Reese defendants, ERI-SA does not confer standing to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and nondisclosure of pension plan documents on former em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>ployees whose vested pension plan benefits have already been distributed. Defendants reason that the Kuntz plaintiffs, as persons who have already received a distribution, are no longer \u201cparticipants]\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7) who may sue to collect their fair share of the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Because both the case law and ERISA\u2019s legislative history undermine these arguments, we reject defendants\u2019 novel interpretation of \u00a7 1002(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">A. <em>Requirements of \u00a7 1002(7)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Determining whether plaintiffs have standing is a \u201cthreshold question in every federal case [that] determines] the power of the court to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Therefore, we must decide whether ERISA authorizes the Kuntz plaintiffs to bring suit before we may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over their claims. <em>See Freeman v. Jacques Orthopaedic &amp; Joint Implant Surgery Medical Group, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 654, 655 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">The Kuntz plaintiffs bring their ERISA action pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(A) &amp; 1132(a)(2). Section 1132(a)(1)(A) authorizes a \u201cparticipant or beneficiary\u201d to bring a civil action against the plan administrator to recover statutory damages for violating the duty to disclose plan documents under \u00a7 1132(c). Section 1132(a)(2) authorizes either the Secretary of Labor or a \u201cparticipant, beneficiary or fiduciary\u201d to bring a civil action for relief from breaches of fiduciary duty that the plan administrator has committed in violation of \u00a7 1109(a). The Reese defendants argue that these parts of \u00a7 1132 do not permit the Kuntz plaintiffs to bring suit, and therefore, that we lack jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">The crux of the dispute is whether the Kuntz plaintiffs qualify as \u201cparticipant^]\u201d within the meaning of ERISA. As defined in \u00a7 1002(7),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-11\">[t]he term \u201cparticipant\u201d means any employee or former employee of an employer, or any member or former member of an employee organization, <em>who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type </em>from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization, or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7) (emphasis added). The Reese defendants contend that the Kuntz plaintiffs are not participants because, as former employees whose vested benefits under the plan have already been distributed in a lump sum, the Kuntz plaintiffs were not \u201celigible to receive a benefit,\u201d or likely to become eligible, at the time they filed suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">B. <em>The Meaning of Freeman</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnR\">Relying primarily on <em>Freeman v. Jacques Orthopaedic &amp; Joint Implant Surgery Medical Group, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 654 (9th Cir.1983), the Reese defendants argue that, as to former employees, only those with presently vested benefits are \u201cparticipants\u201d within the meaning of ERISA. They also contend that the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 action to recover damages for misrepresentation concerning a pension plan does not make them \u201celigible for a benefit\u201d under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">To support their interpretation of <em>Freeman, </em>the Reese defendants offer two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">First, the Reese defendants read <em>Freeman </em>as holding that only current employees with presently vested benefits are participants. They rely on the fact that our court in <em>Freeman </em>cited <em>Nugent v. Jesuit High School of New Orleans, </em>625 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.1980), which held that some of the language defining participants \u2014 specifically, the phrase \u201cmay become eligible to receive a benefit\u201d \u2014 applies solely to current employees. <em>See Freeman, </em>721 F.2d at 655 (citing <em>Nugent, </em>625 F.2d at 1287).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>But Freeman\u2019s citation of <em>Nugent </em>does not dispose of the standing issue in the case before us. In <em>Freeman, </em>we merely stated the fact that the Fifth Circuit \u201chas held that ERISA\u2019s \u2018may become eligible\u2019 language defining who is a participant applies only to current employees.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>721 F.2d at 655. We did not rely on this statement to support our holding in <em>Freeman, </em>nor did we express any agreement or disagreement with it. Therefore, the Reese defendants\u2019 first argument regarding <em>Freeman </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Moreover, <em>Freeman </em>is factually distinguishable from the present case. Plaintiff in <em>Freeman </em>had not at any time possessed <em>vested </em>benefits or maintained a fiduciary relationship with the employer and plan administrator. By contrast, the Kuntz plaintiffs allege that they accrued vested benefits under the pension plan, and thereby enjoyed a fiduciary relationship with the employer and plan administrator. In <em>Freeman, </em>a former employee, Freeman, brought an action pursuant to \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) for \u201can accounting and distribution of benefits claimed owing under [his] pension and profit sharing plan.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>721 F.2d at 655. Unlike the Kuntz plaintiffs, Freeman had waived participation in the plan, but then changed his mind and sued for benefits. Freeman claimed that the employer had misled him about the cost of participation. We held that Freeman was not a \u201cparticipant\u201d authorized to sue because \u201c[n]othing Freeman can do will make him eligible for a benefit, since he is no longer employed by the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We went on to note that \u201c[e]ven if Freeman were to win his claim ... he would not become a \u2018participant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Freeman, </em>the Kuntz plaintiffs have established a fiduciary relationship with the pension fund administrator. The Kuntz plaintiffs have neither waived participation in the plan nor absolved the pension fund administrator of his fiduciary duty to distribute the benefits fairly and accurately. In light of these facts, we think the real holding of <em>Freeman </em>is that a fiduciary relationship is crucial to \u00a7 1002(7)\u2019s definition of who is a participant under ERISA. Because no fiduciary relationship exists toward potential, rather than past, participants, a plaintiff (like the plaintiff in Freeman) who has never signed up for a pension fund does not have standing to sue for misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. Nothing in <em>Freeman, </em>however, precludes the Kuntz plaintiffs, who signed up for the pension fund and accrued vested benefits under it, from going forward with this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Second, the Reese defendants read <em>Freeman </em>as holding that a claim for damages due to misrepresentation does not make a former employee \u201celigible to receive a benefit\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1002(7). In <em>Freeman, </em>we ruled that plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was misled about the cost of participation, and consequently did not enroll in the pension plan, constituted a tort claim for damages, and therefore was not \u201ca <em>benefit </em>of any type\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1002(7). <em>Freeman, </em>721 F.2d at 656 (emphasis in Freeman). But we did not base our decision in <em>Freeman </em>on the fact that, as the Reese defendants argue, Freeman alleged misrepresentation. Instead, we based our decision in <em>Freeman </em>on the fact that plaintiff\u2019s allegations, even if true, did not state a claim for eligibility for <em>benefits </em>under the pension plan \u2014 simply because plaintiff had never enrolled in the plan, and thus had never acquired a vested benefit in the plan. We thought that Freeman really sought a \u201cdeclaration that his waiver was invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. We reasoned that, even if Freeman had won his claim, he could not have become a \u201cparticipant\u201d because he had never enrolled in the plan. Instead, we said, \u201cIf anything, he would receive specific damages equal to a benefit share under a plan. In other words, Freeman would receive as damages what a participant would receive as a benefit under the plan____ He would not, however, become enrolled in the plan and become a participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number><em>Freeman, </em>then, does <em>not </em>hold that a former employee\u2019s claims for damages due to nondisclosure of plan documents are not \u201cbenefit[s] of any type\u201d under \u00a7 1002(7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Furthermore, we believe that the Reese defendants\u2019 broad, two-pronged interpretation of <em>Freeman </em>conflicts with our holding in <em>Bricklayers\u2019 Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund of Inland Empire v. Brick Masons\u2019 Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund, </em>656 F.2d 1387 (9th Cir.1981). <em>In Bricklayers\u2019Fund, </em>we found that former members of an employee organization who did not have vested benefits nonetheless had standing to sue their previous pension plan to recover employer contributions that they alleged the former employer owed to their current pension plan. We emphasized that the participant merely needed to show eligibility for a benefit \u201cof any type.\u201d <em>Bricklayers\u2019 Fund, </em>656 F.2d at 1391 (quoting \u00a7 1002(7)) (emphasis omitted). We concluded that \u201c[t]he former participants allege that they are entitled to receive certain benefits from the Brick Masons\u2019 Fund; they are therefore participants for jurisdictional purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">C. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">Although neither the statutory language defining who is a participant under ERISA nor our case law interpreting the statute denies the Kuntz plaintiffs standing, neither set of authorities states precisely that they have standing, either. Therefore, we turn to the legislative history to shed light on Congress\u2019 intent in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">The legislative history indicates that Congress intended the federal courts to effectuate the remedial purposes of the statute by construing the jurisdictional requirements broadly. Congress declared that the policy of the Act is to \u201cprotect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries ... by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">In various reports, Congress also emphasized the liberal remedial provisions of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-12\">The enforcement provisions have been designed specifically to provide both the Secretary [of Labor] and participants and beneficiaries with broad remedies for redressing or preventing violations of the [Act]____ The intent of the Committee is to provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies available in both state and federal courts and to remove jurisdictional and procedural obstacles which in the past appear to have hampered effective enforcement of fiduciary responsibilities under state law or recovery of benefits due to participants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">S.Rep. No. 127, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4639, 4838, 4871.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">A House of Representatives report made an even stronger statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-17\">The Committee recognizes the <em>absolute need that safeguards for plan participants be sufficiently adequate and effective </em>to prevent the numerous inequities to workers under plans which have resulted in tragic hardship to so many.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">H.R.Rep. No. 533, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4639, 4647.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>In light of this legislative history, we think that the Reese defendants\u2019 construction of ERISA\u2019s standing provisions is unacceptable. Under the Reese defendants\u2019 view of the statute, an employer who is also the plan administrator could defeat a former employee\u2019s right to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and for failure to distribute benefits simply by distributing whatever lump sum he wishes and then termininating benefits before his former employee can file suit. Congress, however, did not intend this type of inequitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">In response, the Reese defendants suggest that the statute, by prohibiting retaliatory discharges under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, adequately prevents employer abuse. We disagree. The statute does not apply in cases, such as the one before us, in which the employees are not discharged. If we adopted the Reese defendants\u2019 construction of who has standing under ERI-SA, an employer who is also the sole administrator of a pension plan could commit serious breaches of fiduciary duty, terminate the plan, distribute the vested benefits, and thereby immunize himself from suit by former employees. These are the very types of \u201cjurisdictional and procedural obstacles\u201d that have \u201champered effective enforcement of fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d 5. Rep. No. 127, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4838, 4871; <em>see, e.g., Hager v. Veco Corp., </em>1 Empl.Ben.Cas. (BNA) 1827, 1829 (N.D.Ill.1979) (permitting employer to defeat former employees\u2019 \u201cparticipant\u201d status by distributing vested benefits would contravene congressional intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">We do not believe that Congress drafted the statute to produce such an arbitrary result. Therefore, we conclude that Congress did not intend the term \u201cparticipant\u201d to be interpreted so narrowly that former employees are denied standing under ERISA to challenge the correctness of the amount of vested benefits that have been distributed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Having concluded that the Kuntz plaintiffs may sue under ERISA, we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">II. Preemption and State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">In their original complaint, the Kuntz plaintiffs alleged seven claims for relief arising under both California law and ERI-SA. The district court dismissed six claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court apparently concluded that all of the claims arising under California law were state law claims over which it could decline to exercise its pendent jurisdiction. On appeal, the Kuntz plaintiffs contend that the district court should have exercised its pendent jurisdiction and decided these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">But ERISA\u2019s broad preemption clause, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), together with its exclusive jurisdiction provision, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1132(e)(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has eliminated state court jurisdiction over actions related to most employee benefit plans. Therefore, if ERISA preempts the state law claims that plaintiffs assert, we need not decide the question of pendent jurisdiction. In the case before us, the state issues include whether ERISA preempts the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 California law claim for misrepresentation, and, if so, whether ERISA provides a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">A. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">Congress enacted ERISA as a comprehensive legislative scheme to resolve problems in private employee benefit plans and to provide security, stability, and uniformity in this area of the law. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a). To establish national uniformity, Congress included a broad preemption clause providing that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ee benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The legislative history of ERISA indicates that Congress wanted the federal courts to construe the preemption clause broadly. Congress expressly rejected a more limited preemption clause that would have applied only to state laws relating to the specific subjects that ERISA covers. <em>See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 98-99, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2900-01, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983). According to one of the bill\u2019s Senate sponsors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\">[T]he substantive and enforcement provisions of the conference substitute are intended to preempt the field for Federal regulations, thus eliminating the threat of conflicting or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefit plans. This principle is intended to apply in its broadest sense to all actions of State or local governments, or any instrumentality thereof, which have the force or effect of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">120 Cong.Rec. 29,933 (1974) (statement of Senator Williams).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Citing this legislative history, the Supreme Court has broadly defined a law that \u201crelate[s] to\u201d an employee benefit plan as a law that \u201chas a connection with or reference to such a-plan.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 2900. Although some of the claims for relief<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the district court initially dismissed were pleaded in terms of California statutory and breach of contract law, all the claims relate to the same alleged harm: the damage that pension plan fiduciaries caused when they misrepresented the fact of the plan\u2019s coverage and the quality of that coverage. Consequently, the issue before us is whether a state law claim for a fiduciary\u2019s misrepresentation \u201crelate[s] to\u201d an employee benefit plan in a manner that ERISA would preempt. This is an issue of first impression in our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-17\">In <em>Russell v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>722 F.2d 482 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 81, 83 L.Ed.2d 29 (1984),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we held that ERISA preempts state law claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the handling of a disability benefit claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 487-88. No other Ninth Circuit case has decided whether ERISA preempts state tort causes of action involving pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>plans that ERISA covers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we find the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 action for misrepresentation logically indistinguishable from the state law tort claim that we confronted in <em>Russell. </em>Both claims have \u201ca connection with or reference to\u201d a benefits plan that ERISA covers, and thus come within the preemption provision. <em>See Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at-, 103 S.Ct. at 2900; <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 487-88; <em>see also Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>653 F.2d 1208, 1215-16 (8th Cir.) (holding state common law action for tortious interference with contract preempted), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 968, 1084, 102 S.Ct. 512, 641, 70 L.Ed.2d 384, 619 (1981). Therefore, we hold that ERISA preempts the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">B. <em>ERISA Claim for Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"Avg\">Although the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 California law claim for misrepresentation is preempted, we must still decide whether the allegations state a <em>federal </em>claim for relief under ERISA. This too is an issue of first impression in our court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">We think that the alleged misrepresentations, if proved, would constitute a breach of the type of fiduciary duty that Congress intended ERISA to govern. Under \u00a7 1104(a), a fiduciary must \u201cdischarge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and ... for the exclusive purpose of ... providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(l)(A)(i). The actions that the Reese defendants allegedly took would breach this duty. Because \u201c[i]t would be anomolous if Congress eliminated the protections offered by state law without providing comparable federal protections,\u201d <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 488, we hold that ERISA provides a federal cause of action to consider allegations that a pension plan fiduciary has misrepresented the fact and/or quality of plan coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">III. Statute of Limitations Under ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">The district court dismissed the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, which asserted only ERISA claims, because the statute of limitations had run. Apparently, the court adopted the Reese defendants\u2019 argument that ERISA did not provide a limitations period for the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and, therefore, the analogous California statute of limitations governed. The district court held that the three-year limitation in Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 338(1) (West 1982) precluded the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 compensatory damage claim. The court also held that the one-year limitation in Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 340(1) (West 1982) barred their prayer for statutory penalties under ERI-SA. The Kuntz plaintiffs now assert that the district court erred when it failed to apply the six-year limitations period that Congress provided in \u00a7 1113 for actions arising out of a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">On appeal, the controversy over the statute of limitations provision in \u00a7 1113 raises three separate issues: first, whether the question is properly before us at all; second, whether the limitations period in \u00a7 1113 even applies to actions brought under \u00a7 1104(a) (fiduciary\u2019s duty to act solely in interest of participants) and \u00a7 1109(a) (fiduciary\u2019s personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty); and third, whether \u00a7 1113, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>if applicable, bars the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">A. <em>Propriety of Appeal Regarding \u00a71113</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The Reese defendants contend that the Kuntz plaintiffs did not properly raise in the district court the issue whether the federal statute of limitations set out in \u00a7 1113 applies to this case. Pointing to the papers filed in the district court, the Reese defendants note the absence of this argument in the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 response to the Reese defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the statute of limitations question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Generally, a party may not raise new issues on appeal. <em>Taylor v. Sentry Life Insurance Co., </em>729 F.2d 652, 655-56 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam). Nonetheless, when the issue involves a purely legal matter, such as a question of statutory construction that is central to the case and important to the public, we may exercise our discretion to hear it. Abex <em>Corp. v. Ski\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 513, 516 (9th Cir.1984). Due to the importance of this question of law, and in light of the fact that the parties have presented an otherwise fully developed record to us on appeal, <em>see In re Howell, </em>731 F.2d 624, 627 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 330, 83 L.Ed.2d 266 (1984), we exercise our discretion to entertain and decide this issue even though the record does not conclusively demonstrate that the Kuntz plaintiffs raised this issue- in the first instance before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">B. <em>Applicability of \u00a7 1113 to Claims Under \u00a7\u00a7 110b(a) and 1109(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">Section 1113 provides that \u201c[n]o action may be commenced ... with respect to a fiduciary\u2019s breach of any responsibility, duty, or obligation <em>under this part\u201d </em>after the earlier of six years from the breach, or three years from the date plaintiff gained actual knowledge of the breach. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(a) (emphasis added). The statute makes an exception in cases of fraud or concealment, for which it provides a limitations period of six years from the date of discovery of the breach. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">The \u201cpart\u201d that \u00a7 1113 refers to is Part 4 of Subchapter I, Subtitle B of the statute. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1114 (enacting rules of fiduciary responsibility). ERISA provides no statute of limitations for actions brought to attack violations of other parts of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">When a federal statute creates a claim for relief, but does not specify a period of limitations, the district court should apply the most analogous state statute of limitations. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 462, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). But the Kuntz plaintiffs assert that the limitations period in \u00a7 1113 should apply because they may bring their ERISA claim for nondisclosure of plan documents as an action for breach of fiduciary duty under \u00a7 1104(a) and \u00a7 1109(a), which are found in Part 4. Section 1104(a)(1) imposes a general obligation on a plan fiduciary to act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries. Section 1109(a), a companion provision, holds a fiduciary personally liable for damages that he causes by breaching his fiduciary duty. The Kuntz plaintiffs argue that a fiduciary\u2019s nondisclosure of plan documents constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty under these sections \u2014 and therefore, that the limitations period in \u00a7 1113, rather than the one under the analogous California statute, should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">Section 1113 applies by its terms to actions for breach of fiduciary duty that arise under <em>both </em>\u00a7 1104(a) and \u00a7 1109(a). Section 1109(a) applies to a breach of any of the \u201cresponsibilities, obligations, or duties\u201d that Subchapter I of ERISA imposes on fiduciaries. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a). Because the disclosure requirements at issue in this ease, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1025, appear in Subchapter I, we think that failure to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1025 is actionable under \u00a7 1109(a). But no court has ruled on the particular question whether a fiduciary\u2019s violation of his duty to disclose plan documents, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b), is a breach of fiduciary duty that creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>liability under \u00a7 1109(a) to which the statute of limitations in \u00a7 1113 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The Reese defendants contend that the obligations and duties of the fiduciary to which \u00a7 1109(a) refers are limited to the management of fund assets and financial transactions, which ERISA discusses in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104-1108. Recently, however, we rejected this position. In <em>Russell, </em>we found that the mishandling of a claim for disability benefits constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA and gives rise to a cause of action for the relief provided in \u00a7 1109(a). <em>See Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 488-89. In so holding, we relied on \u201cCongress\u2019 express policy of imposing \u2018strict fiduciary obligations upon those who exercise management or control over the assets or <em>administration </em>of an employee pension or welfare plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 488 (emphasis in <em>Russell) </em>(quoting 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5177, 5177-78 (statement of Senator Williams)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">The Kuntz plaintiffs charge the Reese defendants with breach of the duty to disclose pension plan documents under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1025 and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2520.-101-1 to .104b-30 (1983). We conclude that the nature of this duty to disclose pension plan documents is analogous to the duty to process claims fairly and diligently under \u00a7 1133 and \u00a7 1135, which duty we found breached in <em>Russell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The legislative history behind the disclosure provisions and sanctions provided in \u00a7 1132(c) does not say conclusively whether Congress intended the breach of a nondisclosure provision to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1109(a), to which the statute of limitations in \u00a7 1113 would apply. In the absence of a plain statement of congressional intent regarding this issue, the Kuntz plaintiffs argue that we should follow Congress\u2019 expressed general intent to enact liberal remedies for breaches of fiduciary duties under ERISA. <em>See Varsic v. United States District Court, </em>607 F.2d 245, 247 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">We agree with the Kuntz plaintiffs. As we have already noted, <em>see supra </em>p. 932, Congress intended \u201cto provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies available in both state and federal courts and to remove jurisdictional and procedural obstacles which in the past appear to have hampered effective enforcement of fiduciary responsibilities____\u201d S.Rep. No. 127, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4838, 4871. In light of this general intent, we conclude that the application of the shorter California limitations periods to this specific case is the type of jurisdictional or procedural obstacle to enforcement that Congress intended to eliminate when it enacted ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">We hold that a fiduciary\u2019s failure to disclose plan documents, as required in \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1025, creates fiduciary liability under \u00a7 1109(a) \u2014 as well as under the companion provision in \u00a7 1104(a) \u2014 that triggers the six-year limitations period prescribed in \u00a7 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">C. <em>Effect of \u00a7 1113 on This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">Applying the limitations period of \u00a7 1113 to the record before us, we find that the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims are not time-barred. Because the Kuntz plaintiffs have pleaded fraud and concealment, the six-year period would apply to this action commencing with the date that the Kuntz plaintiffs discovered the alleged breaches of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">A district court must deny the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim unless it is certain that plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any set of facts that he might prove. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); <em>see Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Keniston v. Roberts, </em>717 F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir.1983). Because the pleadings do not plainly indicate when the employees first became aware of the fraud in the Reese defendants\u2019 representations that the plan documents would be forthcoming, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the claims as untimely. <em>See Jablon v. Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>614 F.2d 677, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>682 (9th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that the limitations period in \u00a7 1113 does not bar the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">IV. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The Kuntz plaintiffs assert that the district court committed another error when it granted the Reese defendants\u2019 motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The Reese defendants contend that ERISA does not permit a party to recover punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">We have twice had occasion to consider this question. We held then, as we do now, that Congress intended to permit punitive damages in appropriate cases, and that the punitive damages award is appropriate when a fiduciary has breached his duties. <em>Winterrowd v. David Freedman &amp; Co., </em>724 F.2d 823, 826 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 490-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">The Reese defendants, however, contend that the issue is not so simple in this case. According to the Reese defendants, punitive damages are not available for failure to disclose plan documents because Congress has already provided a statutory penalty provision. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c). Under \u00a7 1132(c), the district court, in its discretion, may award an amount of up to $100 per day for breach of this duty, plus \u201csuch other relief as it deems proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the district court may hold the plan administrator personally liable under \u00a7 1109(a) for \u201csuch ... equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">The Reese defendants argue that the penalty provision in \u00a7 1132(c) precludes an additional award of punitive damages. But in <em>Winterrowd, </em>we held that the existence of a punitive double interest provision in ERISA for actions to recover an employer\u2019s unpaid benefit contributions did not preclude the district court from awarding punitive damages in light of the fact that plaintiffs had established aggravated conduct. <em>Winterrowd, </em>724 F.2d at 826-27. We did note that a district court would rarely award punitive damages in actions to recover an employer\u2019s contributions, because the double interest provision would usually deter misconduct and thereby fulfill the purpose of awarding punitive damages. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">We conclude that the statutory penalty in \u00a7 1132(c) is indistinguishable from the one in <em>Winterrowd. </em>Therefore, the district court erred in striking the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for punitive damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">Recognizing the increasing growth, scope, and complexity of private employee benefit plans throughout the United States, and citing the inadequacy of the existing standards governing these plans, Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>decided to enact a comprehensive legislative scheme to remedy the problems and to provide security, stability, and uniformity in this important area of law. <em>Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 487 (relying on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)). This comprehensive legislative scheme is codified in ERISA. Because Congress intended to provide more adequate redress to participants who allege injuries as a result of a fiduciary\u2019s breach of his obligations under the statute, <em>see Russell, </em>722 F.2d at 490, we REVERSE the judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-25\">. Congress amended ERISA in 1980. <em>See </em>Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-364, 94 Stat. 1208 (codified in scattered sections of 26 &amp; 29 U.S.C. (1982)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. The Companies include Capitol Metals Co., Inc.; Capitol Metals Enterprises, Inc.; Capitol Metals Co., Inc., Northern California Division; Gilbraltar Metals Corp.; and Metal Transport, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1025-22\">. The Reese defendants include Nat Reese, Daniel Eget, Sammy Narens, and Danat Investments. Reese is the pension plan administrator. For brevity, we often refer to both the Companies and the Reese defendants as \u201cthe Reese defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">. The Kuntz plaintiffs do not dispute that standing is determined at the time that plaintiffs file suit. <em>See Freeman v. Jacques Orthopaedic &amp; Joint Implant Surgery Medical Group, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 654, 655 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">. The Kuntz plaintiffs apparently allege that the Reese defendants not only misled them as to the amount of benefits due under the plan, but also induced some of the Kuntz plaintiffs to believe that they were participating in the plan before the Reese defendants actually enrolled them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">Again, the Reese defendants contend that <em>Freeman </em>precludes these claims. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">The claim that the Kuntz plaintiffs were misled as to the amount of benefits is cognizable because, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Freeman, </em>plaintiffs here had a fiduciary relationship with the plan administrator. Moreover, the claim that the Reese defendants induced plaintiffs prematurely to believe that they had been enrolled in the plan is also cognizable because the inducement, if proved, constitutes a form of fraud infecting the fiduciary relationship. The Kuntz plaintiffs contend that they were misled into believing that a fiduciary relationship under ERISA existed from the time that their employer hired them. In <em>Freeman, </em>however, plaintiff was aware from the moment he was informed of the plan that a fiduciary relationship between him and the plan administrator did not exist; he knowingly signed a waiver of participation in the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">. Section 1132(e)(1) grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all ERISA actions, except for a plan participant or beneficiary's action to recover benefits, to enforce his rights, or to clarify his right to future benefits under, the terms of the plan. Thus, actions for relief under \u00a7 1109(a), and for the statutory penalty for nondisclosure under \u00a7 1132(c), are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">. ERISA contains several exceptions to the preemption provision in \u00a7 1144(a), none of which apply in this case. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">. The district court dismissed the following six claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">(1) An action under Cal.Labor Code \u00a7 972 (West 1971), which concerns an employer\u2019s knowing false misrepresentation that induces a prospective employee to change location, based on the allegation that the Reese defendants misrepresented the pension plan to plaintiffs at their job interviews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">(2) An action for willful fraud, based on the allegation that the Reese defendants knowingly misrepresented the fact and quality of coverage under the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">(3) Negligent misrepresentation, based on the same factual allegations in (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-12\">(4) An action for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud, based on the allegation that a confidential relationship existed and that the Reese defendants\u2019 misrepresentations breached their duties under this relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-13\">(5) An action for breach of contract, based on the allegation that the Reese defendants breached a clause of the pension plan agreement obligating the plan committee to act in compliance with ERISA requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-21\">(6) An action for breach of employment agreement, based on the allegation that the Reese defendants, as part of the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 compensation, promised a \"good\" pension plan but failed to deliver one.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1030-22\">. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari only on the question whether ERISA permits a court to award punitive damages against a plan fiduciary who improperly or untimely processes benefit claims. <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1838, 84 L.Ed.2d 139. We take up a related question in Section IV. <em>See infra </em>p. 938.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1030-25\">. We further held in <em>Russell </em>that no parallel federal claim for relief exists under ERISA. <em>Russell v. Massachusetts Life Ins. Co., </em>722 F.2d 482, 490 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 81, 83 L.Ed.2d 29 (1984). And although we held that ERISA also preempted Russell\u2019s claim for compensatory and punitive damages for improper processing of her disability claim, we nonetheless found that her contention did state a federal claim under ERISA. 722 F.2d at 490.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">. We have decided, however, whether ERISA preempts various state regulatory schemes. <em>See, e.g., Employee Benefits Comm. of Retirement Sys. of Hawaiian Tel. Co. v. Pasco, </em>679 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir.1982) (holding workers\u2019 compensation statute preempted); <em>Carpenters Pension Trust for S. Calif. v. Kronschnabel, </em>632 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding community property laws not preempted), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 922, 101 S.Ct. 3159, 69 L.Ed.2d 1004 (1981). <em>But cf. Provience v.

A district court in our circuit, however, has decided that an action for misrepresentation does not state a claim under ERISA. <em>See Provience v. Valley Clerks Trust Fund, </em>509 F.Supp. 388, 391-392 (E.D.Cal.1981). <em>But see Ogden v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co., </em>571 F.Supp. 520, 523 (E.D.Mich.1983) (holding that action for misrepresentation does state claim under ERISA); <em>Gordon v. Matthew Bender &amp; Co., </em>562 F.Supp. 1286, 1293 (N.D.Ill.1983) (casting doubt on validity of <em>Provience).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">. The failure to allege a written request for plan documents is not fatal to the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 claim, at least under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022(a)(1) and 1024(b)(1), which do not refer to written requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">. Before the district court ruled on the amended complaint, the Kuntz plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to extend defendant Estell Corp.\u2019s time to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and interrogatories. The Kuntz plaintiffs also stipulated that they would voluntarily dismiss Estell in accordance with any order of the court that favored the other defendants. The Kuntz plaintiffs, therefore, stipulated to dismissing Estell with prejudice only after the court dismissed the action as to the Reese defendants and the Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">Taking the position that the Kuntz plaintiffs\u2019 stipulation completely terminated its involvement in the case, Estell now contends that it is not a proper party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">This argument is meritless. The parties plainly intended to put Estell Corporation in the same position as the other defendants with regard to this litigation.
