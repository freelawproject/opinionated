Pursuant to this Court\u2019s December 14 order, the parties have submitted a stipulation of facts upon which they were able to agree. The parties also have submitted, as the order indicated they might, additional offers of proof and supplemental briefs in support of their respective positions. Based on the foregoing and for the reasons stated below, we hold that appellants (hereinafter \u201cappellant\u201d since Judy Lancor is the only appellant before us) are entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The standard in this Circuit for injunctive relief requires appellant to demonstrate: (1) irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted; (2) that such injury outweighs any harm which granting injunctive relief would inflict on appellee; (3) a likelihood of success on the merits; and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of the injunction. <em>Auburn News Co., Inc. v. Providence Journal Co., </em>659 F.2d 273, 277 (1st Cir.1981). Of these four factors, the probability-of-success component in the past has been regarded by us as critical in determining the propriety of injunctive relief. <em>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood League v. Bellotti, </em>641 F.2d 1006, 1009-22 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">The underlying dispute in the instant case relates to appellant\u2019s admitted violation of paragraph 6c in appellee\u2019s lease which in relevant part provides that \u201c[p]er-mission from management in writing shall be required in the case of overnight guests____\u201d Appellant claims that this provision violates her rights under the federal housing law as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Appellee claims that the provision is necessary for it to fulfill its mandate to provide safe, decent housing and to keep track of occupancy and eligibility in public housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development state that a \u201clease shall provide that the tenant shall have the right to exclusive use and occupancy of the leased premises <em>which shall include reasonable accommodation of the tenant\u2019s guests or </em>visitors____\u201d 24 C.F;R. \u00a7 966.4(d) (1984) (formerly 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.4(d)) (emphasis added). The regulations also state that tenants are obligated to \u201cabide by the <em>necessary </em>and <em>reasonable </em>regulations promulgated by the PHA (public housing agency) for the benefit and well-being of the housing project____\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 966.4(f)(4) (1984) (formerly 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.4(f)(4)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, a regulation which requires a tenant to obtain the management\u2019s prior written approval of <em>every </em>overnight guest, and allows the management unfettered discretion to approve or disapprove the tenant\u2019s request, strikes us as neither necessary nor reasonable. This regulation also cannot be said to provide for the reasonable accommodation of a tenant\u2019s guests or visitors. Both parties agree that other similarly situated municipal housing authorities in New Hampshire only require a tenant to obtain the management\u2019s permission for guest stays of longer than two weeks. Without determining the validity of such regulations, and contrary to appellee\u2019s contention, obviously a two week grace period is significantly less intrusive upon the personal lives of tenants, than is appellee\u2019s regulation. Appellee has not demonstrated to our satisfaction why it alone must require such a stringent regulation in order to maintain control over its tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Appellant\u2019s challenge to appellee\u2019s regulation based on First Amendment associational rights and a constitutional right to privacy is one for which there is no authority in this Circuit. We expressly decline the invitation to decide the merits of these constitutional claims at this time. One reason we decline to do so is that the HUD regulations referred to above so clearly support appellant\u2019s position that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for us to reach the constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">We do note that the Second Circuit has held that a similar regulation impinged on a tenant\u2019s constitutional rights of privacy and association. <em>McKenna v. Peekskill Housing Authority, </em>647 F.2d 332, 335 (2d Cir.1981). While we reserve judgment as to whether, in an appropriate case, we would agree with the constitutional implications which the Second Circuit found in <em>McKenna, </em>we do believe that the existence of such authority, even in another circuit, is a weighty factor to be considered on appellant\u2019s behalf when evaluating her likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">We hold that appellant has sufficiently sustained her burden of satisfying the probability-of-success component of the test for a preliminary injunction. Furthermore, we hold that the harm to appellant of imminent eviction from her home of eight years in the absence of injunctive relief outweighs the minimal harm to appellee which will result from a preliminary injunction. We find totally unpersuasive appellee\u2019s suggestion that the grant of injunctive relief in this case will force it to lose all credibility with the tenants and, therefore, diminish its ability effectively to maintain control of the housing project. Since the balance of harm tips decidedly in appellant\u2019s favor, our determination that appellant has provided enough support to sustain her burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits militates in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. <em>Auburn News, sufra, </em>659 F.2d at 276; <em>United States v. Bedford Associates, </em>618 F.2d 904, 912 n. 15 (2d Cir.1980). Accordingly, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\">(1) That this case be, and the same hereby is, remanded to the district court with instructions to enter, not later than ten (10) days from the date of this Order, a preliminary injunction on appellant\u2019s behalf enjoining appellee from taking any action toward evicting appellant from her apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ment pending a determination of the merits of her action challenging paragraph 6c of appellee\u2019s lease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZE\">(2) That paragraph (6) of our order of December 14, 1984 is incorporated herein and is hereby reconfirmed.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
