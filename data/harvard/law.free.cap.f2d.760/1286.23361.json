In March 1981, she was promoted to GS-4 and in April 1982, to GS-5. As a GS-4 and GS-5, her position, although labeled as Clerk (Typist), was also known as Voucher Clerk, and included duties in addition to her Clerk (Typist) responsibilities. Romane was denied a within-grade pay increase (WGPI) by the agency from GS-5 step 2 to step 3 for a rating period ending June 5, 1983. Romane was issued a reconsideration decision on October 20, 1983, by the agency affirming the denial of the WGPI and she appealed this reconsideration decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\">The Board\u2019s presiding official rendered a decision on March 9, 1984, affirming the denial of Romane\u2019s WGPI. In the decision the presiding official stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-16\">An agency may grant a within-grade increase only if an employee\u2019s performance is \u2018of an acceptable level of competence.\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.404. In this case, the agency must prove by substantial evidence that appellant\u2019s performance was not of such a level and that it, therefore, properly denied her within-grade increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-17\">The presiding official\u2019s conclusion that Romane\u2019s performance was not of an acceptable level of competence was predicated on the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-18\">In summary, I have found that the agency has proven by substantial evidence that appellant\u2019s performance in the critical elements of voucher processing and maintaining of contract briefing cards was unacceptable during the applicable waiting period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-19\">The presiding official\u2019s initial decision became final pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.-113(b) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-20\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-21\">The sole issue before us is whether \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d is the appropriate standard for reviewing the agency\u2019s determination to deny Romane a WGPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) to hear an appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). <em>Carroll v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>703 F.2d 1388 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">In <em>South Corp. v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed.Cir.1982) (in banc), this court adopted as binding precedent the prior decisions of our predecessor courts, the United States Court of Claims and the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Consequently, in the absence of an in banc consideration of this case, we are bound by the decision in <em>Meyer v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>666 F.2d 540, 229 Ct.Cl. 151 (1981), in which the Court of Claims held that the appropriate standard for review by the Board of an agency\u2019s decision to withhold an employee\u2019s scheduled within-grade pay increase is,\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(1)(A), substantial evidence. <em>Meyer, </em>666 F.2d at 545. Recognizing this, Romane filed a suggestion for hearing in banc. However, since no member of this panel nor any judge on the court requested a polling on a hearing in banc (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35 and Federal Circuit Local Rule 19), the suggestion for initial hearing in banc was declined on March 15, 1985. Therefore, the decision of the Court of Claims in <em>Meyer </em>continues as binding precedent and this panel is without the ability to alter the holding of <em>Meyer. </em>Nor do we wish to.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1384-10\"> We are convinced of the correctness of the <em>Meyer </em>decision although we recognize other circuits have reached contrary results, <em>e.g., Ommaya v. National Institutes of Health, </em>726 F.2d 827 (D.C. Cir.1984); <em>White v. United States Department of the Army, </em>720 F.2d 209 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Stankis v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>713 F.2d 1181 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Schramm v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>682 F.2d 85 (3rd Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
