In so doing, we discussed only the claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Wells has now filed a petition for rehearing in which she argues, first, that we erred in affirming dismissal of the pendent state law claim against the town. However, the grounds she now relies upon were not presented to us in either of her briefs on appeal. Moreover, Wells admits that at trial the state law claim was not taken before the jury in the court\u2019s instructions or interrogatories. Nor was the claim presented in her requested, but refused, instructions and interrogatories. The claim was not mentioned in Wells\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial. In response to the town\u2019s argument for a complete directed verdict in its favor, Wells never raised the state claim in rebuttal. Having raised the issue neither below nor before us, Wells\u2019 complaint on petition for rehearing comes too late. <em>See, e.g., Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (issue not raised below); <em>Joseph v. New Orleans Electrical Pension &amp; Retirement Plan, </em>754 F.2d 628, 630-31 (5th Cir.1985) (issue not raised below or in appellate brief); <em>Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>732 F.2d 480, 488 n. 7 (5th Cir.1984) (same); <em>Jamestown Farmers Elevator, Inc. v. General Mills, Inc., </em>552 F.2d 1285, 1295-96 (8th Cir.1977) (issue raised only on rehearing would not be addressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Wells also seeks rehearing on her \u00a7 1983 claims against the town. She argues that the jury\u2019s finding, in interrogatory eleven, that the town \u201cfailed to properly test, train or supervise\u201d the defendant Rushing was sufficient to impose liability on the town. In response to interrogatory twelve, the jury found that this failure did not constitute gross negligence. In accordance with the instructions that followed, the jury, having found no gross negligence, did not consider interrogatory fourteen, which asked whether the failure to supervise caused harm to the deceased Karl Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">However, Wells not only failed to raise this issue below and on the initial appeal, but she relied on the gross negligence standard both in her brief and at oral argument. She will not now be heard to complain that simple negligence is sufficient. <em>See Singleton, supra; Joseph, supra; Jamestown Farmers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Finally, Wells again argues that Rushing\u2019s failure to appear at trial, and the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a delay to secure his presence, prejudiced the presentation of her claims against the town. As noted above, the jury found that the town failed properly to test, train, or supervise Rushing, but that this failure did not constitute gross negligence. In the original panel opinion we held that Rushing\u2019s live testimony at trial would have had only cumulative effect on this issue because Wells had access to and did adduce testimony concerning the town\u2019s supervision and training of Rushing. 755 F.2d at 381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In <em>Turpin v. Mailet, </em>619 F.2d 196, 202 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1016, 101 S.Ct. 577, 66 L.Ed.2d 475 (1980), the court wrote, in dicta, that a \u201csingle, unusually brutal or egregious beating administered by a group of municipal employees may be sufficiently out of the ordinary to warrant an inference that it was attributable to inadequate training or supervision, amounting to deliberate indifference or \u2018gross negligence\u2019 on the part of the officials in charge.\u201d In <em>Languirand v. Hayden, </em>717 F.2d 220, 227-28 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2656, 81 L.Ed.2d 363 (1984), we held that to support a \u00a7 1983 cause of action for failure to train police officers, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the failure \u201cconstitute[s] gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference\u201d and either a pattern of similar incidents or that \u201cserious incompetence or misbehavior was general or widespread throughout the police force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Wells argues that if, on remand, the jury concludes from the evidence and Rushing\u2019s live testimony that he did, in fact, murder Karl Harris and plant a \u201cthrow-down\u201d gun, then the jury might infer from this single \u201cegregious\u201d act that the town was grossly negligent and willfully indifferent with respect to training and supervising Rushing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Wells\u2019 argument adds nothing to her arguments on the main appeal. She does not indicate how Rushing\u2019s testimony would increase the likelihood that on remand the jury would find gross negligence, which it refused to find on the evidence at the initial trial. Indeed, it appears more likely that Rushing\u2019s testimony on his own behalf will, if anything, have the opposite effect. Moreover, Rushing\u2019s isolated act would be insufficient to subject the city to liability under the cases addressing the municipal duty to train. <em>See Languirand, </em>717 F.2d at 227-28 (evidence must show at least a pattern of similar incidents or that misbehavior was widespread); <em>Turpin, </em>619 F.2d at 202 (ordinarily policy not to be inferred from single incident). The conclusion we reached in the original panel opinion to the effect that Rushing\u2019s testimony against the town would be merely cumulative, 755 F.2d at 381-92, holds true on this issue as well: Rushing\u2019s testimony could have added nothing to that of the other witnesses in establishing the pattern or widespread practice necessary to imposing liability on the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">For the reasons set forth, the petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
