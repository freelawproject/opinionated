Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., </em>596 F.Supp. 153 (1984), which dismissed appellants\u2019 complaints under \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15, 26, for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The principal issue is whether <em>Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry., </em>260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922), has been overruled so far as its language extends to rates filed with but not investigated and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cICC\u201d), or, failing that, whether the reasoning underlying that language is so much in conflict with later developments that an inferior court should disregard it. While agreeing with appellants that much of the reasoning of <em>Keogh </em>seems outdated, we hold that its language has not been overruled and that if there is to be an overruling, that task is for the Supreme Court. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s principal ruling. However, we also hold that appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief was prematurely dismissed and that appellants should be allowed to replead their damages claims, if they so choose and properly can, to allege injury they have suffered as a consequence of acts of the defendants other than the fixing of rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-19\">The case before us is a consolidation of two separately filed suits. Both appellants, who were plaintiffs below, are corporations that purchase from the defendants freight transport by motor carrier between the United States and Canada. Appellee Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc. (\u201cNFTB\u201d) is a rate bureau whose permissible activities are described in an agreement filed with and approved by the ICC. <em>Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc. </em>\u2014 Agree<em>ment, </em>297 I.C.C. 494 (1955). The other appellees are Canadian motor carriers engaged in the transportation of freight between the United States and Canada. Both complaints were brought on behalf of appellants individually and as representatives of a class comprised of all other persons and businesses who purchased from defendants freight transport between the United States and the Province of Ontario, Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-20\">The complaints alleged substantially as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of the motor carrier appellees was a party to the collective ratemaking agreement approved by the ICC for the NFTB, which authorized the members of the NFTB to set rates collectively for motor carrier freight traffic between the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>ed States and Canada through authorized committees if the motor carriers adhered to the procedures set forth in the agreement and in ICC regulations. In accordance with the requirements of the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(b)(3)(B)(ii) (as amended), the rate bureau agreement preserved the right of each carrier to take independent action. The complaints alleged that at least as early as 1966 and continuing at least into 1981, appellees engaged in a conspiracy \u201cto fix, raise and maintain prices and to inhibit or eliminate competition for the transportation of freight by motor carrier between the United States and the Province of Ontario, Canada without complying with the terms of the NFTB agreement and by otherwise engaging in conduct that either was not or could not be approved by the ICC.\u201d More specifically, it was alleged that the appellees established a \u201cPrincipals Committee\u201d composed of the senior management officials of the NFTB carriers that had authority to operate outside the Province of Ontario. ' Although this Committee did not have ICC authorization or approval to engage in. rate-making, the appellants alleged that, through the Committee, appellees \u201cengaged in the joint setting of rates and related policies and also agreed upon methods by which to inhibit competition for the transportation of freight by motor carrier between the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada;\" set and controlled NFTB rate levels without complying with the notice, publication, public hearing or record keeping requirements of ICC regulations; planned \u201cthreats, coercion and retaliation\u201d against NFTB member carriers for exercising the right of independent action and carried out such threats; and filed tariffs with the ICC in furtherance of the conspiracy. As a result of the conspiracy, appellants alleged, rates for the transportation of freight by motor carrier between the United States and Ontario were fixed at artificial and non-competitive levels, competition between and among the appellee motor carriers was restrained, competition generally in trade and commerce in the transportation of freight by motor service between the United States and Canada was suppressed, and purchasers of freight transport between the United States and Ontario were deprived of free and open competition. The injury suffered was alleged by Square D to be that shippers \u201chave not been able to purchase transportation at rates determined by free and open competition and have been injured in their business and property in that they have paid more for motor freight transport between the United States and the Province of Ontario, Canada than they would have paid in a freely competitive market.\u201d Big D alleged substantially the same injury, although this was phrased in slightly different language. Appellants sought damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">Appellees moved, pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(c) and 12(h)(2), for judgment on the pleadings as to appellants\u2019 claim for damages on the basis of <em>Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry., </em>260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922). Appellants contended that <em>Keogh </em>had been overruled by the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, Pub.L. No. 80-662, 62 Stat. 472 (1948), (current version at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706), and also by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conf., </em>383 U.S. 213, 86 S.Ct. 781, 15 L.Ed.2d 709 (1966) and <em>ICC v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2458, 81 L.Ed.2d 282 (1984). Disagreeing with this and going beyond the terms of the motion, Chief Judge Curtin did not limit his holding to the damages claims, and dismissed the complaints in their entirety. This appeal followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">\n<em>The Keogh opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">In <em>Keogh, </em>a shipper of excelsior and flax tow brought an action under the Sherman Act alleging that rail carriers had restrained competition by combining to fix rates. The challenged rates had been duly filed by the carriers with the ICC and had been attacked there by shippers. The ICC suspended the tariffs pending investigation, but approved the new rates after extensive hearings in which Keogh participated; the challenged rates had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>made effective until after they had been so approved. The Supreme Court held that while the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d) does not immunize regulated carriers from antitrust liability in Government proceedings, a private shipper may not recover treble-damages because he lost the benefit of lower rates which he would have enjoyed but for the conspiracy. 260 U.S. at 161-62, 43 S.Ct. at 49. Rather than limiting its holding to cases where, as in <em>Keogh, </em>rates had been investigated and approved by the ICC, the Court said broadly that shippers could not recover treble-damages for overcharges whenever tariffs have been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 43 S.Ct. at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">Justice Brand\u00e9is advanced four reasons for this result. The first, and most important, turns on the existence of a remedy in the ICA respecting rates. He began by stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-6\">[a] rate is not necessarily illegal because it is the result of a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the AntiTrust Act. What rates are legal is determined by the Act to Regulate Commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjO\"><em>Id. </em>at 162, 43 S.Ct. at 49. He pointed out that under \u00a7 8 of the latter act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 8 (current version at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11705(b)), the exaction of any rate that is illegal under the IGA makes the carrier liable to the person injured thereby for the full amount of damages together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, recoverable either by complaint before the ICC or in an action in a federal court; thus if the conspiracy complained of in <em>Keogh </em>had resulted in rates which the ICC \u201cfound to be illegal because unreasonably high, or discriminatory, the full amount of the damages sustained, whatever their nature, would have been recoverable in such proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Brand\u00e9is then propounded a rhetorical question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-7\">Can it be that Congress intended to provide the shipper, from whom illegal rates have been exacted, with an additional remedy under the Anti-Trust Act? And if no remedy under the Anti-Trust Law is given where the injury results from the fixing of rates which are illegal, because too high or discriminatory, may it be assumed that Congress intended to give such a remedy where, as here, the rates complained of have been found by the Commission to be legal and while in force had to be collected by the carrier?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-10\">Justice Brand\u00e9is next developed a second, closely related argument. After reciting \u00a7 7 of the Sherman Act, which gives a right of action to one who has been injured in his business or property,\u201d he declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-11\">[ijnjury implies violation of a legal right. The legal rights of shipper as against carrier are measured by the published tariff. Unless and until suspended or set aside, this rate is made, for all purposes, the legal rate, as between carrier and shipper. The rights as defined by the tariff cannot be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aur\"><em>Id. </em>at 163, 43 S.Ct. at 49. This \u201cstringent rule\u201d was thought necessary \u201cbecause otherwise the paramount purpose of Congress \u2014 prevention of unjust discrimination \u2014 might be defeated\u201d: if a shipper were allowed to recover under \u00a7 7 of the Sherman Act \u201cfor damages resulting from the exaction of a rate higher than that which would otherwise have prevailed, the amount recovered might, like a rebate, operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That each shipper might bring a similar action under \u00a7 7 failed to answer this concern, since \u201c[u]niform treatment would not result, even if all sued, unless the highly improbable happened, and the several juries and courts gave to each the same measure of relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-12\">Third, Justice Brand\u00e9is thought \u201c[tjhat the character of the issues involved raises another obstacle to the maintenance of the action.\u201d The antitrust plaintiff could not prevail simply by proving \u201cthat some carrier would, but for the illegal conspiracy, have maintained a rate lower than that published;\u201d he also would have to prove \u201cthat the hypothetical lower rate would have conformed to the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>Act to Regulate Commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163\u2014 64, 43 S.Ct. at 49-50. This was a question that must be determined by the ICC, at least in the first instance. Justice Brand\u00e9is dismissed the suggestion that this difficulty could be met by a court\u2019s suspending its proceeding pending reference to the ICC, saying that \u201cby no conceivable proceeding could the question whether a hypothetical lower rate would under conceivable conditions have been discriminatory, be submitted to the Commission for determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 43 S.Ct. at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">Fourth and finally, Justice Brand\u00e9is found the plaintiff\u2019s damages to be purely speculative since all shippers of excelsior and tow were charged the same rates; hence, \u201c[t]he benefit [of lower rates] might have gone to his customers, or conceivably, to the ultimate consumer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 43 S.Ct. at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">\n<em>Evaluation of the Keogh opinion in the light of subsequent developments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Although the <em>Keogh </em>opinion has the \u201crelentless quality\u201d characteristic of Justice Brand\u00e9is,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> many of his arguments do not seem so compelling today as they did in 1922. Passing the first argument for the moment and turning to the second, the fear that recovery of antitrust damages would operate \u201clike a rebate\u201d to produce discrimination among shippers ignores the difference between a carrier\u2019s passing money under the table to a favored shipper and a court\u2019s deciding that a shipper had suffered antitrust injury. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Antitrust and Regulated Industries: A Critique and Proposal for Reform of the Implied Immunity Doctrine, </em>57 Tex.L.Rev. 751, 760 n. 26 (1979). Such a distinction was recognized by the Court in the context of the Shipping Act in <em>Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, </em>383 U.S. 213, 86 S.Ct. 781, 15 L.Ed.2d 709 (1966), where the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-11\">We believe that Congress was concerned with assuring equality of treatment by the [carriers], not with equality of treatment by juries in collateral proceedings. There is no reason to believe that Congress would want to deprive all shippers of their right to treble damages merely to assure that some shippers do not obtain more generous awards than others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 219 n. 3, 86 S.Ct. at 785. The argument that antitrust damages create discrimination contrary to the goals of the ICA is also inconsistent with the Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>I.C.C. v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2458, 2462, 81 L.Ed.2d 282 (1984) <em>(\u201cATA </em>\u201d) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-15\">[w]henever the Commission finds an effective tariff unlawful, injured parties can recover both damages under \u00a7 11705(b)(3) and whatever additional amounts the antitrust laws allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 2462. Furthermore, the argument is scarcely applicable to class actions like these, a means of avoiding Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 concerns that was unavailable in actions at law in 1922. <em>See In re Wheat Rail Freight Rate Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.Supp. 517, 535 (N.D.Ill.1984); F.R.Civ.P. 23, Notes of Advisory Committee; Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 72 at 470-72 (4th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-17\">Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 third reason, that an antitrust action would require the carrier to prove that a hypothetical lower rate conformed to the requirements of the ICA, seems even less compelling. The process in which the ICC would have to engage if a court requested it to determine whether lower rates produced by competition would be reasonable and non-discriminatory does not differ in essence from that which it must undertake in a reparations case, since damages under \u00a7 11705(b)(3) of the ICA are limited to the extent to which a tariff was unreasonable or discriminatory, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number><em>ATA, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2463 n. 5 (citing <em>Boren-Stewart Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry., </em>196 I.C.C. 120, 125-26 (1933); <em>Spencer Plant Foods, Inc. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., </em>302 I.C.C. 799, 800 (1958)) To the extent Justice Brand\u00e9is was concerned about the unprecedented nature of a proceeding in which the ICC answered only the question whether a particular lower rate would have been reasonable and non-discriminatory without issuing a final order of its own, a concern consistent with his aversion to advisory opinions and declaratory judgments, <em>see, e.g., Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass\u2019n, </em>277 U.S. 274, 288-90, 48 S.Ct. 507, 508-509, 72 L.Ed. 880 (1928), this concern has been overcome in the many later cases in which the Supreme Court has directed the suspension of judicial proceedings pending the referral of similar issues to the ICC. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Western Pac. R.R. </em>352 U.S. 59, 62-70, 77 S.Ct. 161, 164-168, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956) (construction and reasonableness of tariff referred to ICC in Tucker Act claim); <em>Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. v. River Terminal Corp., </em>360 U.S. 411, 420-22, 79 S.Ct. 1210, 1216-17, 3 L.Ed.2d 1334 (1959) (validity of contract clause referred to ICC in libel action); <em>Pennsylvania R.R. v. United States, </em>363 U.S. 202, 203-06, 80 S.Ct. 1131, 1132-33, 4 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1960) (construction and reasonableness of tariff referred to ICC in action under ICA); <em>see also United States v. Associated Transp., Inc., </em>505 F.2d 366, 369 (D.C.Cir.1974) (in exercising its exclusive jurisdiction to award reparations under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304a(5), court must allow ICC to determine what would have been the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate); <em>cf. Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., </em>356 U.S. 481, 496-99, 78 S.Ct. 851, 860-62, 2 L.Ed.2d 926 (1958) (legality of dual-rate system referred to Federal Maritime Board to pass on initially). <em>See generally </em>4 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, ch. 22 (2d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 fourth reason, that \u201cno court or jury could say that, if the rate had been lower, [the shipper] would have enjoyed the difference\u201d since the benefit \u201cmight have gone to his customers,\u201d 260 U.S. at 165, 43 S.Ct. at 50, is still less persuasive in view of later developments. Justice Brand\u00e9is himself was to hold in a suit alleging that unreasonably high rates were charged under the ICA that the possibility that a plaintiff had recouped overcharges from his customers was irrelevant in assessing damages. <em>Adams v. Mills, </em>286 U.S. 397, 406-08, 52 S.Ct. 589, 591-92, 76 L.Ed. 1184 (1932); <em>see also Southern Pac. Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., </em>245 U.S. 531, 533-34, 38 S.Ct. 186, 62 L.Ed. 451 (1918) (Holmes, J.). The Supreme Court has also rejected the argument that a plaintiff cannot recover damages it was able to pass on to its customers in the antitrust context. <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 487-94, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 2228-32, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968); <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., </em>405 U.S. 251, 263 n. 14, 92 S.Ct. 885, 891 n. 14, 31 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972); <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 723-26, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 2063-64, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). Indeed, in <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>the defendant relied on <em>Keogh </em>for its argument that plaintiff could not recover any damages; the Court labeled the damages argument made in <em>Keogh </em>\u201cdictum\u201d since, in the Court\u2019s view, the shipper there was held to have no cause of action under the antitrust laws \u201c[b]eeause the rates had been approved as reasonable after a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission____\u201d 392 U.S. at 491 n. 8, 88 S.Ct. at 2230 n. 8. The Court then went on to say, \u201c[w]e ascribe no general significance to the <em>Keogh </em>dictum for cases where the plaintiff is free to prove that he has been charged an illegally high price.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-9\">Even the first reason expressed for the result in <em>Keogh </em>no longer seems so self-evident as Justice Brand\u00e9is thought. Why is a rate \u201cnot necessarily illegal because it is the result of a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Anti-Trust Act?\u201d Justice Brand\u00e9is had recognized in the preceding paragraph of his opinion that a combination of carriers \u201cto fix reasonable and non-discriminatory rates may be illegal.\u201d 260 U.S. at 161-162, 43 S.Ct. at 49 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number><em>United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass\u2019n, </em>166 U.S. 290, 17 S.Ct. 540, 41 L.Ed. 1007 (1897); <em>United States v. Joint-Traffic Ass\u2019n, </em>171 U.S. 505, 19 S.Ct. 25, 43 L.Ed. 259 (1898)). Moreover, it has long been recognized that \u201c[a] zone of reasonableness exists between maxima and minima within which a carrier is ordinarily free to adjust its charges for itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. R.R. </em>294 U.S. 499, 506, 55 S.Ct. 462, 465, 79 L.Ed. 1023 (1935). Why then should the shipper\u2019s ability to recover the excess of an unreasonable over a reasonable rate under the ICA preclude him from recovering the excess of a reasonable (and <em>a fortiori </em>an unreasonable) rate over the lower but still reasonable rate that would have prevailed under free competition? Since <em>Keogh, </em>the Supreme Court has held that implied exemptions to antitrust liability are \u201cstrongly disfavored.\u201d <em>United States v. Philadelphia Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 350-51, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1734, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963). The Court has subsequently found that activity could be challenged under the antitrust laws despite the existence of an administrative agency with authority to regulate the activity. <em>See, e.g., Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, </em>373 U.S. 341, 357-60, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 1257-58, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963) (no exception found for rules subject to SEC disapproval promulgated by exchanges). Indeed, the Court has reached this result even where the agency is empowered to grant a remedy or agency approval has actually been obtained, and notwithstanding the fact that the agency considers effects on competition under the statutory scheme. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Philadelphia Nat\u2019l Bank, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 351-52, 83 S.Ct. at 1734-35 (approval of bank merger by Comptroller under Bank Merger Act does not impliedly exempt parties from antitrust laws); <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v.

Exposing ratemaking to competitive forces to as great an extent as possible was among the most significant aspects of this deregulation. H.R.Rep.

For example, \u00a7 11 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the most directly relevant legislation here, added subsection (d) to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10708. This bars the Commission from interfering with a rate proposed by individual carriers on the basis that it is too high or too low if the rate is within 10 percent of the rate one year prior to the effective date of the new rate. Paragraph (4) (redesignated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10708(d)(6) by the Bus Regulatory Reform Act) provides that rates implemented pursuant to this subsection \u201cshall be subject to the antitrust laws\u201d except that they may be jointly docketed and published pursuant to carrier agreements approved under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706. The House Report accompanying the bill explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-7\">The thrust of this new subsection is to provide for more pricing freedom and less government regulation and to balance freer entry into the industry, freer expansion of the industry, and the additional competition that will result from other provisions of the bill. The concept, then, is to spur competition both in service and in pricing. Plainly, the intent is to give the carriers and the shipping public the ability to structure their transportation systems and needs around a variety of service and price options. Another anticipated impact is that, by separating the new pricing flexibility from collective ratemaking with its attendant antitrust immunity, the carriers will establish many of their rates independently of one another. This will create a more competitive motor carrier system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">H.R.Rep.

All these cases, moreover, were suits by competitors rather than users of the service, so that many of the considerations relied upon in <em>Keogh </em>would not apply. <em>See Essential Communications, supra, </em>610 F.2d at 1122. Nevertheless, appellants have presented arguments challenging the current status of <em>Keogh </em>that, although they must ultimately be rejected, warrant detailed consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-11\">Appellants\u2019 contention that <em>Keogh </em>has been overruled by statute rests principally on the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, Pub.L. No. 80-662, 62 Stat. 472 (1948) (current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>version at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706), which authorized the formation of joint associations of carriers upon approval by the ICC and granted full immunity from the antitrust laws (as contrasted with the freedom from private suits by shippers for treble-damages recognized in Keogh) with respect to making or carrying out approved agreements. This argument appears neither to have been advanced nor considered in cases citing <em>Keogh </em>with approval decided since 1948. The legislative history of the ReedBulwinkle Act, however, refutes the contention that Congress intended to overrule the <em>Keogh </em>doctrine in enacting that legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The practice of forming organizations of carriers to facilitate joint action by participating members long antedated the ReedBulwinkle Act. <em>Keogh </em>itself dealt with such an organization. <em>See </em>260 U.S. at 159-60, 43 S.Ct. at 48. These organizations offered a practical means of dealing with the many matters, among the most important of which was ratemaking, as to which coordinated action was felt necessary. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1100, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1947), <em>reprinted in </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1844, 1849-54 (accompanying Reed-Bulwinkle Act). In its 1898 Annual Report, the ICC concluded that \u201cto one familiar with actual conditions it seems practically out of the question to establish rates that are relatively just without conference and agreement.\u201d 12 ICC Ann.Rep. 15-16 (1898). Similarly, the House Report accompanying the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, which repeats the Senate Report and incorporates additional material, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-6\">It is recognized by all who are familiar with the problems of transportation that the carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act cannot satisfactorily meet their duties and responsibilities thereunder, and the basic purposes of that act cannot be effectively carried out, unless such carriers are permitted to engage in joint activities to a substantial extent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfQ\">H.R.Rep. No. 1100, <em>supra, </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 1847.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">Nonetheless, legislation according express antitrust immunity to joint activity by land carriers was slow in coming. Transportation Act, 1920, Pub.L. No. 66-152, 41 Stat. 456, 480, 482, provided immunity from the antitrust laws for approved agreements respecting certain kinds of transactions, such as poolings, divisions, consolidations, mergers, acquisitions and the like, but failed to immunize many of the most important activities requiring joint agreements, such as ratemaking and establishing through routes and joint rates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress failed to immunize these activities earlier because for many years legislation was not deemed necessary. As the House Report on the Reed-Bulwinkle Act explains, joint carrier organizations had been operating openly with the full knowledge of the ICC, state regulatory bodies, shippers and others involved in the transportation industry. H.R.Rep. No. 1100, <em>supra, </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. '&amp; Ad. News at 1846. In many instances, joint ratemaking associations were \u201cmaintained with the approval and cooperation of the shippers ... and [were] encouraged by the Commission and various other agencies and departments of the Government as both necessary and desirable. In fact, various departments and agencies of the Government ... frequently utilized them to advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commissioner Clyde Aitchison of the ICC testified that during the early decades of the century both the Department of Justice and the courts understood that joint ratemaking by common carriers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>was necessary to the operation of the transportation system and did not challenge this activity under the antitrust laws as long as carriers preserved their right of independent action. <em>See Hearings on HR. 2536 Before the Senate Comm, on Interstate Commerce, </em>79th Cong., 2d Sess. 1133-48 (1946) [hereinafter cited as 1946 Senate Hearings]. However, in the early 1940\u2019s, the Department of Justice began to question the legality of the cooperative activities of the carriers. Officials of the Department pointed out that there was a range of \u201creasonable\u201d rates under the ICA and maintained that joint ratemaking needlessly kept rates at the upper end of this range in contravention of the policies underlying the antitrust laws. <em>See </em>1946 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 556-90 (testimony of Arne Wiprud, former Chief of Transportation Section, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice), 744-67 (testimony of Wendell Berge, Assistant Attorney General); <em>Hearings on S. 110 Before the Senate Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </em>80th Cong., 1st Sess. 65-81 (1947) (testimony of Wendell Berge) [hereinafter cited as 1947 Senate Hearings]; <em>Hearings on H.R. 221 and S. 110 Before the House Comm, on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </em>80th Cong., 1st Sess. 174-75 (1947) (testimony of Albert Boggess, Special Assistant to the Attorney General) [hereinafter cited as 1947 House Hearings]. This policy shift manifested itself in the form of a series of suits brought by the Department of Justice against carrier organizations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-4\">Efforts at Chicago in 1942 to indict certain railroads, motor carriers, and others under the antitrust laws for participating in those activities were stopped because it was believed that such prosecution would seriously interfere with the war effort. Early in 1943 an indictment under the antitrust laws of certain motor carriers and motor carrier rate associations was returned at Denver and, after trial, all of the defendants were acquitted by the verdict of a Federal court jury. In 1943 a certificate was issued by the Chairman of the War Production Board declaring rate bureaus and similar carrier organizations to be requisite to the prosecution of the war. In 1944 an injunction suit under the antitrust laws was brought by the Department of Justice in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska against the western railroads and the Association of American Railroads and others to enjoin them from carrying on various cooperative activities____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">H.R.Rep. No. 1100, <em>supra, </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 1846. In addition, in 1944 the State of Georgia filed a suit in the Supreme Court as <em>parens patriae </em>alleging rate-fixing by eastern and southern railroads. This suit led to the opinion in <em>Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R., supra, </em>where the Court dismissed the damages claims on the authority of <em>Keogh </em>but went on to hold that the State could maintain a suit to enjoin the alleged rate-fixing conspiracy since \u201cthat is a matter over which the Commission has no jurisdiction.\u201d 324 U.S. at 455, 65 S.Ct. at 725. The suit was still pending on its merits during the deliberations over the Reed-Bulwinkle Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">These suits, together with the expiration of the War Production Board\u2019s certificate of exemption in 1946, provided the immediate impetus for the enactment of the ReedBulwinkle Act. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1100, <em>supra, </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 1847; <em>cf. </em>1947 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 6 (testimony of J. Monroe Johnson, Director, Office of Defense Transportation). Congress was concerned with the effect of such antitrust actions on transportation policy: a recurring theme in the testimony at the hearings was that antitrust suits might conflict with the national transportation policy manifested in the ICA. <em>See, e.g., </em>1946 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 365-70 (testimony of Sam B. Winn, Chairman, Western Conference Commission), 1171-72 (testimony of Clyde Aitchison, Commissioner, ICC); 1947 House Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 9-11 (statement of Frederick Hamley, General Solicitor, NARUC). Congress recognized that it could not by legislation deal with each instance of joint action by carri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>ers to resolve whatever conflict may exist between the principles of the antitrust laws and the national transportation policy. H.R.Rep. No. 1100, <em>supra, </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 1848. Rather, in the words of the House Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-5\">The only practical approach to the problem is to grant to a competent administrative agency, as is proposed in the bill, the authority to resolve the conflict in specific instances of proposed joint action by carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-6\">Since this problem arises in the relatively circumscribed field of transportation, the agency which is .peculiarly well qualified to exercise this authority is the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill here reported, therefore, places this responsibility upon that Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-7\"><em>The bill leaves the antitrust laws to apply with full force and effect to carriers, so far as they are now applicable, except as to such joint agreements or arrangements between them as may have been submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission and approved by that body </em>upon a finding that, by reason of furtherance of the national transportation policy as declared in the Interstate Commerce Act, relief from the antitrust laws should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">Appellants argue that the Reed-Bulwinkle Act was intended to be a comprehensive regulation of rate-making agreements: If the carriers acted within the terms of an approved agreement their conduct would be immunized from all antitrust liability, including the proceedings for redress by injunction and criminal prosecution left open by <em>Keogh </em>as interpreted in the <em>Georgia </em>case; on the other hand, if they acted pursuant to an unapproved agreement or without complying with the terms of an approved agreement, they were to be subject to damages liability, <em>Keogh </em>notwithstanding. There would be some force in this contention if the Committee Report had said merely \u201c[t]he bill leaves the antitrust laws to apply with full force and effect to carriers ... except,\u201d etc. However, the Committee was at pains to insert the qualifying phrase \u201cso far as they are now applicable.\u201d <em>Keogh </em>had ruled that the antitrust laws were not applicable so as to allow shippers to maintain suits for damages resulting from filed tariffs. Beyond this, the legislative history contains no suggestion of any intention to overrule <em>Keogh, </em>and it is somewhat difficult to suppose that an act for relief of railroads silently operated against them in so material a respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">This silence in the legislative history is particularly significant in that the Congress that enacted the Reed-Bulwinkle Act was undoubtedly familiar with the <em>Keogh </em>doctrine. <em>Keogh </em>had been expressly reaffirmed and applied in the <em>Georgia </em>case, which received extensive and detailed consideration in the hearings: more than a dozen witnesses testified about the case, and the opinion of the Supreme Court was made a part of the Committee record; indeed, Arne Wiprud, formerly of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, read to the Committee the passage from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion reaffirming the limitation on shippers\u2019 rights to recover treble-damages. 1946 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 581. Several other witnesses discussed the <em>Keogh </em>decision itself. Wendell Berge, then the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, read passages from the opinion to the Committee, including the passage recognizing an exception for antitrust liability in Government proceedings. 1946 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 799; <em>see also </em>1947 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 73. Commissioner Aitchison, the importance of whose testimony is underscored by its having been quoted at length in the Committee Reports, ended his explanation of the history of rate regulation and the antitrust laws with a discussion of the <em>Keogh </em>and <em>Georgia </em>cases. He explained to the Committee that \u201cthe net result of the <em>Keogh </em>decision,\u201d which was \u201cto limit the force of section 7 of the Sherman Act, as related to wrongs for which there was a money-damage remedy afforded under the Interstate Commerce Act,\u201d did not go far enough because it left open the possibility of proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>by the Government. 1946 Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 1148-49. He urged the Congress to extend antitrust immunity to Government and private injunction actions challenging agreements that had been approved by the ICC. No one suggested, however, that <em>Keogh </em>should be overruled, and there is no basis under the circumstances to infer that Congress intended to do so by implication, particularly since neither the purposes nor the operation of the <em>Keogh </em>doctrine and the Reed-Bulwinkle Act conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">The immunity established in 1948 in the Reed-Bulwinkle Act remained, with modifications not relevant here, until 1980. In that year, Congress passed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793 (the \u201c1980 Act\u201d). Section 14, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706, revised the requirements for a carrier to obtain immunity from antitrust liability and limited the scope of the available immunity. Appellants do not argue that this legislation overruled <em>Keogh, </em>but assert only that \u201c[pjassage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 ... again confirmed that antitrust immunity is conditioned upon compliance with a Congressionally approved regulatory plan.\u201d As discussed above, the Reed-Bulwinkle Act had no such effect with respect to the <em>Keogh </em>doctrine; a brief review of the legislative history confirms that this conclusion applies as well to the 1980 Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">The immunity from the antitrust laws granted in the Reed-Bulwinkle Act was among the chief concerns in the debates ' over the 1980 Act. According to-the House Report, \u201c[n]o issue has received more attention during the debate before the Committee than whether this immunity should be allowed to continue. The debate centered on whether there continues to be a reasonable public quo in return for the collective ratemaking quid of the Reed-Bulwinkle Act.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1069, <em>supra, </em>at 27, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2309. After extensive hearings conducted over a two-year period, the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed eliminating antitrust immunity for all collective rate-making, although it recommended retaining immunity for joint tariff publication and interline arrangements. <em>Committee on the Judiciary, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., Federal Restraints on Competition in the Trucking Industry: Antitrust Immunity and Economic Regulation </em>151 (Comm. Print 1980); <em>see also id. </em>at 45-69, 145-51. The ICC, on the other hand, urged more modest revisions, in particular the withdrawal of immunity for joint agreements respecting individual carriers\u2019 single-line rates. <em>See Motor Carrier Act of 1980: Hearings on S. 2245 Before the Senate Comm, on Commerce, Science and Transportation, </em>96th Cong., 2d Sess. 1509, 1865-68 (statement of Darius Goskins, Chairman, ICC). Representatives of other organizations made various recommendations for retaining the Reed-Bulwinkle Act, revising it in minor ways or substantially altering it. <em>See id. passim. </em>The predominant opinion was critical of the existing rate bureau process and recommended that the immunity it enjoyed from the antitrust laws be curtailed substantially; Congress acquiesced in this. S.Rep. No. 641, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 13-15 (1980). As finally passed, the 1980 Act significantly revised the antitrust immunity provided in the Reed-Bulwinkle Act. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1069, <em>supra, </em>at 29-30, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2311-12 (summarizing scope of permissible collective ratemaking). However, no mention appears to have been made of <em>Keogh, </em>and apart from the particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>lar changes made by \u00a7 10706 Congress did not expand antitrust liability beyond that which existed under the Reed-Bulwinkle Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Appellants\u2019 strongest argument that the Supreme Court has overruled <em>Keogh, </em>albeit <em>sub silentio, </em>is based on <em>Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conf, </em>383 U.S. 213, 86 S.Ct. 781, 15 L.Ed.2d 709 (1966). Carnation, a shipper in foreign commerce, alleged that the Pacific Westbound Conference, an association of carriers by water approved under the Shipping Act by the Federal Maritime Commission (\u201cFMC\u201d),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> increased the rate for shipping evaporated milk pursuant to an agreement with the Far East Conference, another approved association. The rates had been filed with the FMC as required by 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 817(a); however, at the time the events alleged occurred, the Shipping Act also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-6\">Every common carrier by water ... shall file immediately with the Federal Maritime [Commission] a true copy ... of every agreement, with another such carrier ... fixing or regulating transportation rates or fares____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-7\">All agreements, modifications, or cancellations made after the organization of the [Commission] shall be lawful only when and as long as approved by the [Commission], and before approval or after disapproval it shall be unlawful to carry out in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any such agreement, modification, or cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-8\">Every agreement, modification, or cancellation lawful under this section shall be excepted from the provisions of [the antitrust laws]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814 (1958). Carnation alleged that Pacific Westbound and Far East agreed, without obtaining FMC approval, to surrender their right to take independent action and that Pacific Westbound maintained the increased rate only because Far East would not agree to its being lowered. This conduct, Carnation contended, forfeited the express immunity from antitrust liability provided in \u00a7 814 and was unlawful <em>per se </em>under the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-12\">The carriers argued that the Shipping Act repealed all antitrust regulation of ratemaking activities of the shipping industry and that the exclusive remedy for shippers aggrieved by carriers\u2019 rates was before the FMC. The carriers relied for this argument on <em>United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard Steamship Co., </em>284 U.S. 474, 483-88, 52 S.Ct. 247, 250-51, 76 L.Ed. 408 (1932), where the Court affirmed the dismissal of an antitrust action to enjoin a dual-rate system because the FMC had primary jurisdiction, and <em>Far East Conf. v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 570, 576-77, 72 S.Ct. 492, 495, 96 L.Ed. 576 (1952), where the Court applied <em>Cunar\u00e1 </em>to bar a similar challenge by the United States as shipper. Carnation argued that these cases were distinguishable on the ground that the plaintiffs there sought an injunction that would have interfered with the FMC\u2019s performance of its functions respecting the conduct challenged. The carriers responded that the doctrine that an administrative remedy supersedes antitrust remedies originated in a treble-damages action, citing <em>Keogh, </em>which, they pointed out, was relied on in <em>Cunar\u00e1 </em>and <em>Far East.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-13\">The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Shipping Act displaced the antitrust laws entirely and held that \u201cthe implementation of rate-making agreements which have not been approved by the Federal Maritime Commission is subject to the antitrust laws.\u201d 383 U.S. at 216, 86 S.Ct. at 783. The Court reasoned that Congress would not have created an expressly limited immunity such as the one found in \u00a7 814 if it had intended to immunize the industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>completely from antitrust liability. <em>Id. </em>at 216-20, 86 S.Ct. at 783-85. <em>Cunar\u00e1 </em>and <em>Far East </em>were distinguished on the ground that these cases \u201cmerely hold that courts must refrain from imposing antitrust sanctions for activities of debatable legality under the Shipping Act in order to avoid the possibility of conflict between the courts and the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 86 S.Ct. at 785. However, <em>Cunar\u00e1 </em>and <em>Far East </em>\u201cpermit courts to subject activities which are clearly unlawful under the Shipping Act to antitrust sanctions so long as the courts refrain from taking action which might interfere with the Commission\u2019s exercise of its lawful powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 86 S.Ct. at 786. An award of treble-damages for past and completed conduct which clearly violated the Shipping Act would not interfere with the authority of the FMC, <em>id. </em>at 222, 86 S.Ct. at 787, although to avoid conflict with the agency, the question whether the conduct challenged clearly violated the Shipping Act (in <em>Carnation </em>this depended upon whether the rates were filed pursuant to approved or unapproved agreements) did require preliminary resort to the FMC, <em>id. </em>at 222-23,. 86 S.Ct. at 787. Accordingly, the Court directed that the action be stayed pending the conclusion of proceedings before the agency, with instructions to allow the suit to proceed if the FMC found that the agreements were not approved. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 86 S.Ct. at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">The Court did not refer to <em>Keogh </em>in its .opinion. Since, as appellants argue here, the result in <em>Carnation </em>appears on its face to conflict with the holding in <em>Keogh </em>that filed tariffs define the legal rights between shipper and carrier \u201cunless and until disapproved\u201d by the agency, they deem this omission to imply that the Court intended to overrule <em>Keogh </em>but for some reason was unwilling to say so. We think it more plausible that, if the Court intended to overrule <em>Keogh </em>or even seriously to question that decision, it would have discussed or at least mentioned the fact. Moreover, a sound basis existed for distinguishing <em>Keogh </em>and finding, as the Court apparently did, that the filing of tariffs under the Shipping Act does not limit the rights of shipper vis-a-vis carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">As has been pointed out above, in the years after <em>Keogh </em>was decided, implied exemptions to the antitrust laws fell into strong disfavor. By the time <em>Carnation </em>was decided in 1966, the necessity of implying a repeal of the antitrust laws was measured by the pervasiveness of the regulation of the industry in question and the authority of the regulatory agency to perform the antitrust function of regulating competition with respect to the challenged practice. <em>See </em>Hale &amp; Hale, <em>Mergers in Regulated Industries, </em>59 Nw.U.L.Rev. 49, 54-56 (1964); Note, <em>The Antitrust Immunity Doctrine and United States v.

Compared to the ICA, the Shipping Act is a very limited regulatory scheme. It imposes only a few general duties, and the central purpose of the statute was to provide for industry self-regulation through agreements between carriers under the aegis of the FMC, which was to approve or disapprove these agreements with an eye to the prevention of certain practices deemed unjustly or unfairly discriminatory. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 811-816; <em>see Federal Maritime Bd. v. Isbrandtsen Co., </em>356 U.S. 481, 487-91, 78 S.Ct. 851, 856-58, 2 L.Ed.2d 926 (1958); <em>Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v.

The ICA and the Shipping Act differ signif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>icantly with respect to the relative powers of the ICC and the FMC concerning rate regulation. As the Senate Report accompanying the 1961 amendments to the Shipping Act noted, \u201c[w]hereas Congress has vested rate control powers and responsibilities in Government regulatory agencies concerned with domestic surface and air transportation, it has heretofore given to the maritime regulatory agencies no similar mandate over international shipping rates.\u201d S.Rep. No. 860, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1961), <em>reprinted in </em>1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3108, 3112; <em>see also Federal Maritime Bd. v. Isbrandtsen Co., supra, </em>356 U.S. at 490-91, 78 S.Ct. at 857-58; 1947 Senate Hearings, <em>supra, </em>at 593-94 (statement of Arne Wiprud) (arguing that the Shipping Act is not a valid precedent for the Reed-Bulwinkle Act).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the FMC can and does take effects on competition into account in approving conference agreements under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814, <em>see Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 243-46, 88 S.Ct. at 1008-10; <em>Mediterranean Pools Investigation, </em>9 F.M.C. 264, 288-90 (1966), the Shipping Act does not give the Commission any mandate to regulate <em>rate </em>competition and, indeed, the statutory scheme was designed to minimize the role of the FMC in .this regard. <em>See </em>DOJ Report, <em>supra, </em>at 61-62 &amp; n. 143. The FMC has only \u201climited ratemaking authority\u201d over foreign commerce, <em>id. </em>at 37, 47, and, consequently, its ability to award reparations is also circumscribed, <em>cf. </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 821(a). After a hearing it may disapprove a rate that it finds to be \u201cso unreasonably high or low as to be detrimental to the commerce of the United States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 817(b)(5). However, the Commission is without power to establish a new \u201creasonable\u201d rate and can only require the conference or carrier to file a more acceptable one. The FMC\u2019s sole rate-making power is the power to alter rates \u201cto the extent necessary to correct ... unjust discrimination or prejudice\u201d towards shippers or ports under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 816. Unlike the ICC, the FMC cannot establish through routes, joint classifications and joint rates, and cannot suspend a proposed tariff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fair &amp; Guandolo, Transportation Regulation 46-47, 200-209 (7th ed. 1972); DOJ Report, <em>supra, </em>at 36, 47. Thus, the pervasive authority of the ICC respecting the rates and business of carriers under its jurisdiction is absent from transportation subject to the more limited scrutiny of the FMC. <em>See In re Ocean Shipping Antitrust Litig., </em>500 F.Supp. 1235, 1241 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (distinguishing <em>Keogh </em>because \u201c[t]he FMC wields relatively weak power to supervise tariffs\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>ATA, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. 2458, has even less force. The Court there was called upon to decide whether the ICC could declare effective tariffs that later investigation revealed to have been agreed upon in violation of section 14 of the 1980 Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706, retroactively ineffective. This would entitle shippers to rates as if the unlawful tariff had never existed and thus require the carriers to pay reparations equal to the excess of what the carriers actually collected over the rates in effect prior to those declared unlawful. Such a remedy would often expose carriers to damages liability greatly in excess of their potential liability in an action before the ICC under \u00a7 11705(b)(3), which is limited to the extent to which an unlawful tariff was unreasonable or discriminatory and which thus gives the carrier the full benefit of the available range of lawful rates. The carriers argued that this new remedy was unnecessary because suits under \u00a7 11705(b)(3) and antitrust damages created adequate disincentives to the filing of unlawful tariffs; the ICC disagreed, and the Court sided with the Commission. <em>Keogh </em>was not mentioned in the opinion and was only cited twice in the briefs for minor propositions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court clearly assumed that shippers can recover treble-damages for filed tariffs that embody antitrust violations, but only <em>after </em>the ICC finds a tariff that was filed and became effective to be unlawful. <em>See </em>104 S.Ct. at 2462 (\u201cWhere the Commission finds an effective tariff unlawful, injured parties can recover both damages under \u00a7 11705(b)(3) and whatever additional amounts the antitrust laws allow\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 2466-67 (opinion of the Court), 2471 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). Thus, appellants read too much into the opinion in asserting that this result overrules <em>Keogh </em>with respect to tariffs that have been approved or have not been disapproved, although <em>ATA </em>does render <em>Keogh </em>inapplicable where the ICC has expressly found a filed tariff to be unlawful. This is of no aid to appellants, however, since the tariffs challenged here were not declared unlawful by the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">\n<em>Injunctive Relief and Damages from Anticompetitive Acts Other than Agreements to Fix Rates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-8\">Although appellees had moved for judgment on the pleadings only with respect to appellants\u2019 claims for damages and not with respect to their claim for an injunction, a position well advised in light of <em>Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R., supra, </em>324 U.S. at 454-55, 65 S.Ct. at 724-25, Chief Judge Curtin dismissed the complaint in its entirety. He did not explain or even discuss why he dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>the claims for injunctive relief. The issue whether appellants could obtain an injunction had not been briefed. There is only a passing reference in a footnote in appellees\u2019 memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss to the effect that entry of the consent decree in the Government\u2019s action against NFTB would moot the injunction claims, and an equally brief response in a footnote in appellants\u2019 memorandum in opposition to this motion that the injunction claims \u201care not at issue\u201d and thus \u201cneed not be dealt with.\u201d The injunction claims were neither raised nor discussed during the oral argument before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>The district court has no authority to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard. <em>Lewis v. New York, </em>547 F.2d 4, 5-6 &amp; n. 4 (2 Cir.1976) (\u201cFailure to afford an opportunity to address the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>motion to dismiss is, by itself, grounds for reversal\u201d); <em>Schlesinger Investment Partnership v. Fluor Corp., </em>671 F.2d 739, 742-43 (2 Cir.1982); <em>see also Dodd v. Spokane County, </em>393 F.2d 330, 334 (9 Cir.1968); <em>Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, </em>482 F.2d 372, 374 (1 Cir.1973). Appellees urge that we nonetheless affirm the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the injunction claims because remand \u201cwould be a futile gesture in light of the injunction already obtained by the Government\u201d in <em>United States v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, supra </em>note 1, 1984-2 Trade Cas. at H 66,-167. However, although the consent decree is far reaching, several of its provisions are limited in duration and applicability. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at parts VI, XIII. Moreover, as appellants have the right to seek relief beyond that obtained by the Government, <em>Madyun v. Thompson, </em>657 F.2d 868, 871-72 (7 Cir.1981), there may well remain additional matters as to which injunctive relief is appropriate. These issues cannot be determined on the sparse record before us. We must, therefore, remand to allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to show whether they are entitled to injunctive relief. To avoid waste of time and money, the district court may find it appropriate to address at the outset the issue of mootness raised by appellees on the basis of the Government consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">In addition, appellants should be afforded an opportunity on remand to amend their complaint to state a claim for damages consistent with <em>Keogh. </em>That case applies only where the damages sought relate to filed tariffs, whether these result from a combination to file higher tariffs or from a combination to prevent others from taking independent action to file lower tariffs. <em>See </em>260 U.S. at 161-63, 43 S.Ct. at 49; <em>cf. City of Groton, supra, </em>497 F.Supp. at 1049-52 (dividing claims into those relating to filed tariffs and those relating to anti-competitive behavior \u201cbeyond the mere promulgation of rates\u201d and applying <em>Keogh </em>only to the former); <em>City of Groton, supra, </em>662 F.2d at 928-34 (reversing the district court but adopting the same analytical framework). A shipper may recover damages if it can show that carriers caused injury to the shipper\u2019s business or property other than by higher tariffs, such as by impeding its ability to transport its goods to other markets and thus decreasing its sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">Appellants alleged that appellees conspired together and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-8\">[t]he aforesaid combination and conspiracy consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding and concert of action among the defendants and co-conspirators, the substantial terms of which were to fix, raise and maintain prices <em>and to inhibit or eliminate competition </em>for the transportation of freight by motor carrier between the United States and the Province of Ontario, Canada without complying with the terms of the NFTB agreement <em>and by otherwise engaging in conduct that either was not or could not be approved by the ICC.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEC\">Square D Complaint at 1122 (emphasis added); Big D Complaint at 1119. Appellants alleged further that appellees established a \u201cPrincipals Committee\u201d to further the conspiracy and that this committee \u201cengaged in the joint setting of rates and related policies <em>and also agreed upon methods by which to inhibit competition for the transportation of </em>freight____\u201d Square D Complaint at 11 23(a) (emphasis added); Big D Complaint at U 20(a). At oral argument on the motion to dismiss, appellants\u2019 counsel explained to the court that these allegations charged appellees with having done more than simply file excessively high tariffs. In addition, counsel explained, appellees agreed \u201cnot to solicit or to try to attract certain types of traffic,\u201d and engaged in boycotts and other acts which interfered with the ability of non-conspiring carriers to provide transportation services in order to discourage these carriers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>taking independent action and to coerce them into accepting the conspirators\u2019 anti-competitive strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Chief Judge Curtin held that \u201c[wjhatever the breadth of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the complaint essentially focuses on what plaintiffs claim are unjust and excessive rates.\u201d To be sure, the portions of appellants\u2019 complaints that state the nature of the injury suffered allege only injury caused from having to pay rates higher than those that would otherwise have prevailed. Square D Complaint at II 26; Big D Complaint at 111122, 23. However, the acts charged in the allegations quoted above could also support a claim that appellees injured appellants\u2019 business by impeding appellants\u2019 ability to market and sell their goods. As Professors Wright and Miller have indicated, \u201c[ajmendment should be refused only if it appears to a certainty that plaintiff cannot state a claim.\u201d. 5 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1357 at 612-13 (citing cases); <em>see also S.S. Silberblatt, Inc. v. East Harlem Pilot Block, </em>608 F.2d 28, 42 (2 Cir.1979) (leave to amend should be granted if plaintiff \u201chas at least colorable grounds for relief\u201d). Thus, on remand, appellants should be afforded an opportunity, if they believe the facts justify it, to amend their complaint to state a proper claim for damages. Such a claim would, of course, be subject to any appropriate motions by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Insofar as the judgment dismissed appellants\u2019 claims for damages in respect of filed rates, it is affirmed. Insofar as it dismissed the claim for an injunction, it is reversed and the cause is remanded for further hearing.

NASD, </em>422 U.S. 694, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975), may be read to suggest a more stringent rule, namely, that merely entrusting an agency with authority over challenged activity requires exempting that activity from antitrust liability to avoid subjecting regulated entities to \"duplicative and inconsistent standards.\u201d 422 U.S. at 735, 95 S.Ct. at 2450. However, there need be no \"duplicative and inconsistent standards\" in the context of rates for transport inasmuch as the ICC\u2019s conclusion that a rate is within the \"zone of reasonableness\u201d and the antitrust court\u2019s conclusion that the rates were unlawfully fixed at too high a price within this range do not conflict. Moreover, these decisions appear to require that the challenged practice have obtained some kind of stamp of approval from the agency through the agency\u2019s active exercise of\u2014 or deliberate choice not to exercise \u2014 its regulatory authority. <em>See Gordon, </em>422 U.S. at 668-82, 689-91, 95 S.Ct. at 2604-11, 2614-15; <em>NASD, </em>422 U.S. at 728, 730-35, 95 S.Ct. at 2448-50. Only a very small percentage of tariffs filed with the ICC are investigated because the sheer volume of filings makes investigation of the vast majority impossible. <em>Cf.

Consequently, the investigation and approval or disapproval by the ICC of a small fraction of the tariffs filed would not seem to signify regulatory approval by the Commission of uninvestigated tariffs like those challenged here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">. Even more significant restrictions were imposed upon the authority of the ICC to regulate rate competition among rail carriers. Rail carriers may now establish any rate for transportation or other services unless the ICC determines that a carrier has \"market dominance\" respecting the transportation to which a particular rate applies. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10701a. A difficult test must be met by a shipper wishing to show that a carrier has such dominance. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10707, 10709.

The United States Shipping Board was created in 1916 to enforce the Shipping Act. Its functions were transferred in succession to the United States Shipping Board Bureau in 1933, the United States Maritime Commission in 1936, the Federal Maritime Board in 1950, and, finally, the Federal Maritime Commission in 1961.

The limited authority of the FMC under the Shipping Act stands in contrast not only to the powers and duties of the ICC respecting land carriers, but also to the equally extensive authority conferred upon the ICC to regulate domestic shipping in the Transportation Act of 1940, Pub.L.

In its brief, <em>Carnation </em>argued, persuasively it seems, that <em>Keogh </em>should be limited to the pervasive regulatory schemes enforced by the ICC and not applied to water carriage subject to the much less intrusive supervision of the FMC under the Shipping Act. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 43-48, <em>Carnation, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">. <em>Keogh </em>was cited in a footnote in the brief of a group of railroads as <em>amici curiae </em>as additional authority for the proposition that \u201d[e]ven for an admitted violation of the Act's substantive provisions, a shipper is not entitled to a refund \u2018without proof of actual damages.\u2019\" Brief of Aberdeen &amp; R.
