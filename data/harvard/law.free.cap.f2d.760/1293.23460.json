We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-17\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-18\">Korody-Colyer Corporation sued for declaratory judgment that Patent No. 3,555,972 is invalid. One basis for the appealed judgment is the district court\u2019s determination that the patent is unenforceable because of inequitable conduct during prosecution of the application in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That determination was based on the court\u2019s Findings that: (1) the applicant was fully aware of certain prior art, and of its materiality, before and during prosecution; (2) a reasonable examiner would have considered that art important in determining whether to allow the application to issue as a patent; (3) the applicant did not disclose that art to the PTO, though its internal correspondence referred to part of that art as \u201cmost relevant\u201d; (4) the non-disclosed prior art references were more pertinent than those considered by the examiner during prosecution; and (5) the failure to disclose that art, if not deliberate concealment, was at the very least a calculated recklessness with regard to the truth. In its Conclusions the court further stated that the non-disclosure was a \u201csubstantial cause\u201d and \u201ccrucial factor\u201d in obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>patent and that it showed a \u201cculpable state of mind\u201d. <em>See Argus Chemical Corp. v. Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., Inc., </em>759 F.2d 10 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">On consideration of the briefs and the oral argument, and a careful review of the record, we ascertain, in light of the foregoing, no basis on which the appealed judgment may be reversed. Appellant argues strenuously that the non-disclosed art was no more pertinent than that before the examiner, but has not convinced us that the district court\u2019s fact findings to the contrary are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Fed.R. Civ.P. Because the holding of unenforceability in view of inequitable conduct fully supports the judgment, it is unnecessary to discuss the issue of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">The award of reasonable attorney fees and costs is a matter committed to the discretion of the district court. It may be overturned only on a clear showing that that discretion has been abused. <em>Rosemount, Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1540, 1548-49, 221 USPQ 1, 8 (Fed.Cir.1984) and cases there cited. A search of the record reveals no basis on which an abuse of discretion may be found in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">. The district court\u2019s Conclusion 4 was that \"fraud on the Patent Office\u201d renders the patent \"invalid\". This court has said that \u201cinequitable conduct\u201d more properly describes what has been called \u201cfraud on the Patent and Trademark Office\u201d and that such conduct renders a patent \u201cunenforceable\", rather than \"invalid\u201d. <em>J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. Lex Tex Ltd., Inc., </em>747 F.2d 1553, 1559, 223 USPQ 1089, 1092 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
