Appellant challenges his extradition from California to Nevada and contends that Nevada officials are holding him in violation of Nevada law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ANMx\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">On April 24, 1980, appellant Lamont Hudson (\u201cHudson\u201d) was arrested in Nevada for possession and sale of a controlled substance. A criminal complaint was filed on May 2, 1980, and Hudson was held to answer on July 8. He entered a plea of not guilty, and continued on bail pending trial on October 13. He failed to appear for calendar call on October 8. A new trial date of December 8, 1980 was set but subsequently vacated when Hudson\u2019s attorney withdrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">Trial dates in February and May 1981 were vacated because of Hudson\u2019s incarceration in California for another felony conviction. On August 26, 1981, a Nevada bench warrant was issued for Hudson\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">On October 1, 1981, the Clark County District Attorney sent a request for temporary custody to the California Correctional Center at Susanville. On January 28, 1982, the California Correctional Center offered to deliver temporary custody of Hudson. Hudson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in California Superior Court, challenging his extradition to Nevada. The California court denied the motion on May 21, and Hudson was transported to Nevada to stand trial on May 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-15\">On February 7, 1983, Hudson filed a motion to dismiss the information in Nevada District Court. The Nevada court denied the motion on March 4, 1983. Hudson subsequently appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court. His petition was denied on August 25, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-16\">On September 20, 1983, Hudson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, District of Nevada, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Hudson then entered a plea of guilty on September 30, 1983, in the Nevada court and was subsequently sentenced to seven years in the Nevada State Prison. On January 23, 1984, the district court denied the petition for habeas corpus. Hudson filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-17\">Hudson applied for a Certificate of Probable Cause under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. The district court denied the application on March 23, 1984, but this court granted the application on April 24, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-18\">Hudson urges us to grant him relief on the grounds that he was not brought to trial in a timely manner, and that Nevada\u2019s failure to obtain the endorsement of its governor invalidated the detainer. The Nevada officials argue that Nevada\u2019s Extradition Act does not apply to extraditions conducted under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, and that Hudson\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from challenging his extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-20\">This court reviews a petition for writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo. See Roth v. United States Parole Commission, </em>724 F.2d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-22\">\n<em>The Extradition Act Applies to Extraditions Conducted Under the Interstate Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-23\">Hudson was extradited under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers [\u201cInterstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Agreement\u201d], 18 U.S.C. app. Ill, codified in Nevada at Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 178.620, <em>et seq. </em>The Interstate Agreement and the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act [\u201cExtradition Act\u201d] both establish procedures for the transfer of a prisoner in one jurisdiction to the temporary custody of another jurisdiction. <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 443, 101 S.Ct. 703, 709, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981). The Interstate Agreement is an interstate compact approved by Congress. Its interpretation therefore presents a question of federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 101 S.Ct. at 708; <em>see also Brown v. Wolff, </em>706 F.2d 902, 905 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">The Extradition Act contains more specific procedural safeguards than the Interstate Agreement. It has been incorporated into the state laws of the 48 states which have adopted it and is codified in Nevada at Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 179.177, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Cuyler </em>that the Interstate Agreement preserves a prisoner\u2019s procedural safeguards existing under state or federal law, except those expressly withheld by the Agreement itself. <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. at 450, 101 S.Ct. at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">The Nevada officials assert that because Nevada requested Hudson\u2019s extradition under the Interstate Agreement, it was not required to comply with the technical provisions of the Nevada Extradition Act. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">\n<em>The Nevada Officials\u2019 Failure to Obtain the Governor\u2019s Endorsement Invalidated the Detainer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 178.620, Art. IV(d) specifically dispenses with section 179.183\u2019s requirement that the governor of the <em>sending </em>state approve the requested detainer. In <em>Housewright v. Lefrak, </em>Nev., 669 P.2d 711 (1983), however, the Nevada Supreme Court clearly established which detainer procedures require executive approval by the <em>demanding </em>state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">In <em>Housewright, </em>the court defined a \u201cdetainer\u201d as an \u201cinformal notice of charges pending in another jurisdiction, ... not a request that the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated ... transfer the prisoner.\u201d <em>Housewright, </em>669 P.2d at 713. Therefore, a detainer may be filed by a district attorney without approval of the demanding state\u2019s governor. When a state officially requests another state to act on a detainer by filing a request for temporary custody to obtain involuntary transfer of a prisoner under Article IV, however, the demanding state\u2019s governor <em>must </em>approve the request \u201cas a procedural safeguard attendant to extradition proceedings retained by the Agreement on Detainers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">On October 1, 1981, the Clark County District Attorney issued a request for temporary custody under Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 178.-620, Art. IV(d). However, there is no indication in the record, nor do the Nevada officials claim, that the Governor of Nevada ever approved the request as required by Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 179.223. In pertinent part, the statute says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-14\">1. When the return to this state of a person charged with crime in this state is required, the district attorney <em>shall </em>present <em>to the governor </em>his written application for a requisition for the return of the person charged____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-16\">3. ... One copy of the application, <em>with the action of the governor indicated by endorsement </em>thereon ... shall be filed in the office of secretary of state____ The other copies shall be forwarded <em>with the governor\u2019s requisition. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-19\">Because the Clark County District Attorney did not seek or obtain the governor\u2019s approval, the detainer procedure used to secure Hudson\u2019s extradition was invalid. However, we cannot agree with Hudson that the detainer\u2019s invalidity alone is sufficient ground for granting habeas relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-20\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-21\">\n<em>Hudson\u2019s Guilty Plea Precludes Him From Seeking Habeas Corpus Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-22\">As a general rule, one who voluntarily and intelligently pleads guilty to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>criminal charge may not subsequently seek federal habeas corpus relief on the basis of pre-plea constitutional violations. <em>Haring v. </em>Prosise, 462 U.S. 306, 319-20, 103 S.Ct. 2368, 2376, 76 L.Ed.2d 595 (1983); <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 266, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1607, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>Mitchell v. Superior Court, </em>632 F.2d 767, 769 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 940, 101 S.Ct. 2021, 68 L.Ed.2d 327 (1981). A defendant may only attack the \u201cvoluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea,\u201d <em>Tollett, </em>411 U.S. at 267, 93 S.Ct. at 1608, by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">Hudson concedes that he entered a guilty plea upon advice of counsel. However, he contends that because he was not informed that such a plea would foreclose subsequent habeas relief, he should now be allowed to challenge the extradition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Hudson has not alleged, nor does the record indicate, that the advice from Hudson\u2019s attorney was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. Therefore, his guilty plea precludes habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">Hudson also relies on <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974) to support his habeas petition. <em>Blackledge </em>is easily distinguishable from the matter before us. In <em>Black-ledge, </em>the government brought a felony charge in alleged retaliation for a defendant\u2019s exercise of his statutory right to a trial <em>de novo </em>on his misdemeanor conviction. The Supreme Court held that the \u201cvery initiation of the proceedings against [the defendant] operated to deny him due process of law.\u201d <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 30, 31, 94 S.Ct. at 2103, 2104. The defendant\u2019s due process claim invalidated the very charge on which he was being held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">By contrast, Hudson\u2019s attack on his extradition does not support a claim that his Nevada conviction was improperly rendered. Thus, <em>Blackledge </em>does not entitle Hudson to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">\n<em>Hudson Is Barred From Raising A Speedy Trial Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">It is well settled that when a defendant\u2019s dilatory tactics prevent trial from commencing within the statutory period, the state will not be charged with responsibility for the delay. <em>Brinkman v. State, </em>95 Nev. 220, 592 P.2d 163, 165 (1979); <em>Hardison v. State, </em>93 Nev. 551, 571 P.2d 107, 108 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 178.620, Art. IV(c) requires trial to begin within 120 days of the prisoner\u2019s arrival in the receiving state; however, the trial court may grant continuances for good cause. If the defendant is not tried within that period, the charges will be dismissed with prejudice, absent good cause shown. Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 178.-620, Art. IV(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-13\">.  Hudson was delivered to Nevada on May 28, 1982. He filed his motion to dismiss on February 7, 1983, and had then been in the custody of Nevada prison officials for 255 days, 135 more than allowed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-14\">In its points and authorities in opposition to Hudson\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Nevada officials state that Hudson \u201cengaged in every conceivable delatory [sic] tactic imaginable to avoid going to trial____ This Court is well aware of the actions taken by the defendant.\u201d After hearing argument, the Nevada District Court denied the motion. Hudson concedes in his Emergency Petition for Writ of Prohibition the court found that any delays were due to Hudson\u2019s many requests for continuances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-16\">The Nevada state court record is not included as part of the record on appeal; therefore, the number and nature of Hudson\u2019s pre-trial motions cannot be determined. However, Hudson never refutes the district court\u2019s finding that trial delays were due to his continuances, nor does he challenge the government\u2019s character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>ization of his motions as dilatory. Under the holdings of <em>Brinkman </em>and <em>Hardison, supra, </em>Hudson is precluded from raising a speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
