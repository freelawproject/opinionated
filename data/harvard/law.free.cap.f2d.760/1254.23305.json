First and second actuators associated with each storage bin actuate the control elements as the load carrier approaches a selected storage bin. The automatic controls responsive to the first actuator reduce the speed of the load carrier in advance of arriving at the selected bin. In response to the second actuator the controls then stop the load carrier .precisely at that bin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">The sensors of the \u2019814 patent and the pair of actuators of the \u2019640 patent produce electrical signals which register in the automatic controls the location and status of the load carrier being regulated. These signals may be generated in alternative manners depending on the nature of the sensors and actuators: photoelectrically, using reflectors and photoelectric cells, or electromechanically, using limit switches and limit pins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>B. <em>Prosecution History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">The original application disclosing the inventions now claimed in the \u2019814 and \u2019640 patents was U.S. Patent Application S.N. 449,874, filed July 28, 1954, and entitled \u201cAutomatic Production Systems\u201d (the 1954 application). It was initially subjected to a requirement to restrict examination of the application to one of three distinct inventions identified by the examiner. Lemelson in response elected to prosecute the Group II set of claims directed to an article transfer device, which, it is not disputed, included both the load sensing means and the dual reflectors now claimed in the \u2019814 and '640 patents, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">Subsequently, in a second office action, the examiner stated that the elected Group II set of claims included \u201cclaims specifically directed to ... plural species of controls.\u201d Since claims generic to those species were not considered by him to be patentable, Lemelson was \u201crequired to elect a single disclosed species\u201d to which his claims would be restricted if no generic claim were ultimately allowed. The examiner was of the opinion that following the required election, most of the matter disclosed in the application would be \u201csuperfluous to the elected embodiment,\u201d and thus further required the applicant to indicate those portions of the specification that pertained thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Lemelson in response made his election, which was considered incomplete by the examiner. Prosecution continued through several claim substitutions to a <em>fifth </em>office action in 1959. This action, while continuing to note the failure of Lemelson to restrict disclosure in the application to the subject matter elected for prosecution, entered a final rejection of all pending claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">Lemelson appealed the final rejection and in 1960 cancelled the entire specification of the 1954 application and its then pending claims, substituting a substantially streamlined new specification and new claims. The 1954 application was abandoned on October 18, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">Prior to that abandonment, however, Lemelson requested that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Patent Office) prepare and file on his behalf a certified copy of his <em>original </em>1954 application. According to Lemelson, this met the requirements of then operative Rule 147<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for effecting a valid filing without his signature of a divisional application entitled under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 121<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to \u201cthe benefit of the filing date of the original [1954] application.\u201d The result was U.S. Patent Application S.N. 152,702 (the Rule 147 divisional application), which was accorded a filing date of October 17, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">Simultaneously with the request to prepare the divisional application, Lemelson instructed the Patent Office to cancel all claims not pertaining to the Group I claims designated by the examiner in the parent 1954 application as being directed to an automatic production system. These claims were accordingly elected for prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>cution in the Rule 147 divisional application. It is not disputed that the elected automatic production system did not include a load sensing means or dual reflectors, features now claimed in the two patents in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">While the Rule 147 divisional application was yet pending, Lemelson filed continuation-in-part applications that did contain claims relating to these features. These were U.S. Patent Application S.N. 430,075 filed on February 3, 1965, and U.S. Patent Application S.N. 446,326 filed April 7, 1965 (the CIP applications). U.S. Patent Application S.N. 561,307, filed June 7, 1966, a continuation of the former, matured into the \u2019814 patent, while the \u2019640 patent issued directly from the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Triax admitted that devices embodying the inventions claimed in the \u2019814 and \u2019640 patents were on sale and in public use as early as 1963. As the CIP applications were filed more than one year after the admitted sale and public use, the entitlement of the CIP applications to earlier filing dates is crucial to the validity of the patents upon which this suit is premised. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">C. <em>Action of the District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">This case was originally filed by Triax in 1973 and consolidated with two others by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation the following year. <em>In re Triax Company Patent Litigation, </em>385 F.Supp. 590, 185 USPQ 149 (J.P.M.D.L.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">On May 9, 1980, Triax filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b) to separate certain issues for trial from others in the case. TRW, in opposing the motion, further requested leave to file a motion for summary judgment claiming in the words of the district court \u201cthat admissions made by the plaintiff in answers to interrogatories [had] ... disposed of issues of fact and [would] ... allow the court to determine the validity of the Lemelson patents as a matter of law.\u201d The Triax motion was denied on June 27, 1980, but TRW was invited to file a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">On October 21, 1980, the TRW motion was filed. It argued that \u201cthe inventions claimed by the two patents in suit were <em>not </em>continuously disclosed in a patent application pending before the U.S. Patent Office as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120,\u201d because those inventions were \u201cdeliberately\u201d can-celled by Lemelson from the 1954 application and the Rule 147 divisional application more than one year before the filing of the CIP applications. Triax responded on November 26, 1980. The district court, agreeing with TRW, granted the motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">The court below stated that when required by the Patent Office to restrict the 1954 application to one elected species of controls, \u201cLemelson elected to prosecute the photoelectric cell method, including the dual reflector system, rather than the electromechanical method.\u201d 217 USPQ at 339. Based on this, it termed \u201cvoluntary\u201d the cancellation from the 1954 application of disclosure of the inventions claimed in the patents in suit. <em>Id. </em>\u201cLemelson not only cancelled the subject matter which the Patent Office ordered restricted from the grandparent [1954] application ..., but he also voluntarily cancelled the subject matter of the [\u2019814 and \u2019640] patents in issue which pertained to claims he had elected to prosecute as a result of that restriction.\u201d 217 USPQ at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">The voluntary cancellation was held to have \u201celiminated the legal equivalence of description necessary to claim a continuity of disclosure,\u201d producing \u201ca \u2018hiatus\u2019 in disclosure\u201d between the 1954 application prior to the submission of the substitute specification in 1960 and the CIP applications. 217 USPQ at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-15\">It was contended below by Triax that the filing of the Rule 147 divisional application reinstated all matter cancelled from the original 1954 application. Acknowledging that this presented a question yet to be addressed by the courts, the district court termed \u201csimply untenable\u201d any proposition that submission of the unsigned divisional application under Rule 147 afforded \u201cthe equivalent of sufficient continuity of disclosure under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>relation back under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120\u201d for the inventions claimed in the patents in suit. 217 USPQ at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">D. <em>Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">There has been no contention raised that the claims of the \u2019814 or \u2019640 patents are other than fully supported by the specification of the 1954 application. Nor has it been argued that the two patents in suit are not related to the 1954 application through a continuous chain of co-pending applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">Rather, the issue presented is whether throughout the prosecution of that entire chain of applications a legally adequate disclosure of the inventions ultimately claimed in the \u2019814 and \u2019640 patents was continuously maintained. As this is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment, particular attention must be directed to verifying the absence of contested issues of material fact, if the grant is to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">A. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">1. <em>Governing Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">In any type of lawsuit the purpose of summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is to avoid an unnecessary trial. <em>Chore-Time Equipment, Inc. v. Cumberland Corp., </em>713 F.2d 774, 779, 218 USPQ 673, 675 (Fed.Cir. 1983). Summary judgment is thus an important means of conserving judicial and other resources, but it must be employed carefully, \u201cfor an improvident grant may deny a party a chance to prove a worthy case.\u201d <em>D.L. Auld Co. v. Chroma Graphics Corp., </em>714 F.2d 1144, 1146, 219 USPQ 13, 15 (Fed.Cir.1983). It appears that just such an improvident grant has occurred in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">In the appeal of a grant of summary judgment, such factual inferences as are material to the grant are not reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, as if they were findings of fact made following a trial of issues. <em>Silverstein v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 999, 1001 (7th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1041, 90 S.Ct. 1362, 25 L.Ed.2d 652 (1970). As a district court has no genuine discretion in determining whether to grant summary judgment, <em>Luckett v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>618 F.2d 1373, 1377 (10th Cir.1980), a reviewing court must determine de novo, <em>M/V American Queen v. San Diego Marine Construction Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1483, 1487 (9th Cir.1983), that the strict standard to be applied by the district court has indeed been met. <em>See Trnka v. Elanco Products Co., </em>709 F.2d 1223, 1225 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Exnicious v. United States, </em>563 F.2d 418, 423 (10th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">That standard is plainly stated in Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-12\">The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">To affirm a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must accordingly determine that the record demonstrates an absence of any actual dispute as to factual inferences which would have a material impact on the entitlement of the summary judgment movant to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See British Airways Board v. Boeing Co., </em>585 F.2d 946, 951 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 981, 99 S.Ct. 1790, 60 L.Ed.2d 241, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>441 U.S. 968, 99 S.Ct. 2420, 60 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1979). For summary judgment, fact-finding is an inappropriate exercise, at either the appellate or the district court level. If a dispute requiring a finding exists as to any material fact, summary judgment is improper. <em>Fountain v. Filson, </em>336 U.S. 681, 683, 69 S.Ct. 754, 755, 93 L.Ed. 971, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>337 U.S. 921, 69 S.Ct. 1153, 93 L.Ed. 1730 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-14\">The issue of material fact required to be present by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) in order to entitle a party to proceed to trial in the face of an adverse motion for summary judgment need not be resolved conclusively in favor of the party asserting its exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>ence. All that is required is a showing of sufficient evidence supportive of the existence of the claimed factual dispute to require a judge or jury to resolve the differing versions of the truth through a trial. <em>First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1592, 20 L.Ed.2d 569, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>393 U.S. 901, 89 S.Ct. 63, 21 L.Ed.2d 188 (1968). Further, as an additional precaution against denying a party its chance to prove a worthy case, any doubt as to the presence or absence of disputed issues of material fact must be resolved in favor of the presence of disputed issues, or in other words in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Petersen Manufacturing Co. v. Central Purchasing, Inc., </em>740 F.2d 1541, 1546, 222 USPQ 562, 565-66 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. American Can Co., </em>724 F.2d 1567, 1571, 220 USPQ 584, 588 (Fed.Cir.1984). We are persuaded that the evidence in this case demonstrates the existence of a disputed, highly material issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">2. <em>Treatment Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">Essential to the conclusion by the district court that the \u2019814 and \u2019640 patents are invalid is its assessment of what species of controls for the Group II invention was chosen by Lemelson in response to the requirement to elect a single of such disclosed species. The court stated that \u201cLemelson elected to prosecute the photoelectric cell method, including the dual reflector system, rather than the electromechanical method.\u201d 217 USPQ at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">The question of what species is actually elected responsive to a requirement to do so is one of fact. Given its grant of summary judgment and the materiality thereto of the identity of the elected species, it must be assumed that the district court concluded that no genuine issue had been demonstrated in the record before it as to that factual question. In this conclusion we cannot concur, and it is upon such a basis that we vacate for continued proceedings. The discussion that follows is directed largely toward demonstrating from the record before us why the identity of the elected species could not be considered free from genuine dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">Lemelson on appeal contends that in response to the examiner\u2019s requirement to elect one species of controls, he elected a \u201ccounting means\u201d of controls. It is understood that by use of the term \u201ccounting means,\u201d Lemelson is attempting to designate controls that determine the location of the load carrier by counting feedback pulse signals generated each time the load carrier passes one of the storage locations in the array of bins. \u201cCounting means\u201d of controls are then to be distinguished from controls that slow the carrier prior to stopping it at a designated storage location, as in the \u2019640 patent, or controls that vary its movement depending on the presence of loads on the load support or within a bin it is entering, as in the \u2019814 patent. The feedback pulses of the \u201ccounting means\u201d of control may be generated photoelectrically or electromechanically, thus giving rise at least conceptionally to corresponding variants of the generalized \u201ccounting means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">This argument is based essentially on materials appearing in the file wrapper of the 1954 application,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which we assume was before the district court when it decided to grant summary judgment. Our examination of the file wrapper reveals the identity of the elected species of controls to be an extremely unclear question. Although aspects of the prosecution history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>depicted therein might serve to evidence that Lemelson elected a \u201cphotoelectric species\u201d of controls, other aspects of that history, by no means insignificant, point to contrary inferences, including the \u201ccounting means\u201d advanced by Lemelson. Some particulars will serve to illustrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">3. <em>Examination of the Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">(a) <em>Requirement for Election of Species</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8T\">Contrary to the either/or implication of the statement by the district court that Lemelson elected to prosecute \u201cthe photoelectric cell ... rather than the electromechanical method,\u201d the examiner\u2019s initial requirement for election in no way suggested the existence of but two species of controls, or drew a clear dichotomy between photoelectric and electromechanical methods. He referred only to \u201cplural species of controls such as [shown in] Figs. 5, 7, 8, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 25\u201d and invited the applicant to elect that species to which the application should be restricted. As best can be determined, throughout the entire prosecution history, the examiner offered no explicit characterization of the nature of the plurality of species he observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">(b) <em>Election of Species by Lemelson</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKXA\">Lemelson\u2019s initial attempt at election is no more helpful. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-9\">In accordance with the requirement for election, new claims 38 to 41 have been added which read on the provisionally elected species illustrated in Figs. 24, and also shown in Figs. 28, 7, 8 and 27. The new claim 38 is generic and reads on this species. Claims 39 to 41, and 32 to 36 also read on this species.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">The applicant, like the examiner, failed to make any explicit characterization of the provisionally elected species.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">The figures designated as illustrating it depict in various levels of detail, including some alternative configurations, an automatic warehousing system which could be fairly characterized as employing controls which are \u201cphotoelectric,\u201d or \u201ccounting,\u201d or both. No inference one way or the other in the matter is compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-14\">The claims put forward by Lemelson as reading on the elected species give contrasting, but also mixed, indications as to what he had actually selected. The new claims 39-41 depended directly or indirectly from new claim 38. In claim 38<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the degree of motion of the carriage along the predetermined path of the conveyor recited is controlled by a \u201cfeedback signal generating means for indicating by pulse signal transmission ... the position of said carriage along said path,\u201d a recitation consistent with a counting species of controls and broad enough to include photoelectric or electromechanically signal generation. In claim 38 signal generation was accomplished using photoelectric scanning parallel to the travel path in order to produce a series of feedback pulses, each corresponding to passage of the carriage by stations along its path of travel. By contrast, in claim 35, also selected by Lemelson as \u201creading on this species,\u201d electromechanical means were recited as performing the same function, this despite the failure of Figs. 7, 8, 24, 27, or 28 to illustrate electromechanical controls. None of the claims designated by the applicant recite structures or functions corresponding to the load sensing means now claimed in the \u2019814 patent or the dual reflectors for effecting carriage deceleration and stopping, as claimed in the \u2019640 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-15\">TRW argues that the selection of Fig. 28 by Lemelson as illustrating the elected species shows that the device now claimed in the \u2018640 patent was part of the species elected for prosecution in the 1954 application.

width=\"757\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">FIG. 28</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">69 located on the mobile load carrier directs a beam of light upon the stationary framework 151 and 152 at the open ends of an array of storage bins. Reflectors, such as reflector 70, attached to framework 151 and 152 so as to correspond to a single storage location, return light to a photoelectric cell 68 when movement of the carrier brings one of them within the beam produced by light source 69. Photoelectric cell 68 in turn produces an electrical signal which is amplified in a vacuum tube circuit 163 to actuate a relay 164'. Signals from relay 164' are processed by a feedback pulse counting means PRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">TRW points out that, adjacent to reflector 70, Fig. 28 also depicts a second reflector 70a which is capable of affecting photoelectric cell 68 in order to slow the carriage prior to its being stopped precisely at reflector 70. Second reflector 70a is thus the second of the dual reflectors claimed in the \u2018640 patent. Its presence in Fig. 28 is asserted by TRW to evidence that the dual reflectors were within the scope of the species of controls elected by Lemelson for prosecution in the 1954 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">With this contention we cannot agree. First, the enumeration of figures in which an elected species is illustrated cannot always be interpreted as meaning that everything in those figures is part of the elected species. To do so here would presume such clairvoyant foresight on the part of Lemelson in preparing his application that he would have been able to produce figures, the depictions of which corresponded precisely to the boundaries of distinct inventions and species thereof undetermined until prosecution. The 1954 application contained 52 pages of written disclosure, 29 figures, and 20 pages of claims. It evidences no such degree of order or preplanning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">Also, Fig. 28 is fully operable, even absent the inclusion of second reflector 70a. The description of that feature and the possibility of carriage slow-down prior to stopping appear in a separate location in the specification from where the rest of Fig. 28 is initially described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">Among the figures designated as illustrating the subject matter elected for prosecution, none other than Fig. 28 depicts photoelectric scanning circuitry in any degree of detail. Thus, the portions of that figure that illustrate such circuitry complement the embodiments in the other figures elected by Lemelson, which also show a reflector 70. On the other hand, none of the other figures contain a second reflector. That aspect of Fig. 28 involving second reflector 70a is actually in conflict with the embodiment depicted in Figs. 7, 8, 24, and 27. In view of the diminutive disclosure of specific circuitry in the 1954 application, a situation noted on several occasions throughout prosecution by the examiner, it would have been reasonable for Lemelson to designate Fig. 28 as illustrating his elected species of controls, whether or not it contained depictions of extraneous elements not relevant thereto, such as second reflector 70a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">In addition, all of the claims elected by Lemelson at this point, and subsequently in prosecution of the 1954 application, were concerned with feedback pulses used to locate the carriage; no recitation was made of a species of controls which would slow it prior to stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-13\">In the absence of statements of the examiner regarding his view on the identities of the \u201cplural\u201d species of controls, and without a clear expression by Lemelson of what species he considered he was electing, it would be unwarranted to insist rigidly that everything in the figures he designat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>ed, particularly in Fig. 28, was necessarily part of the elected species. The inclusion of second reflector 70a in originally filed Fig. 28, prior to any restriction of the specification to elected subject matter, may support an inference that the elected species of controls included the dual reflector means of slowing and then stopping the carriage. Nevertheless, a contrary inference is also supportable from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">Matters are less evenly divided regarding whether the load sensing means claimed in the \u2018814 patent was part of the species of controls elected by Lemelson. At this point, and subsequently throughout prosecution of the 1954 application, none of the expressions of the examiner or Lemelson touched on controlling the load support in its movements into and out of selected storage bins. No claims presented for prosecution recited or suggested such functions or associated structure. Figure 26, the sole figure depicting any sort of load sensing means, was \u25a0 never designated by Lemelson as being in any way illustrative of the elected species of controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">The evidence is not clear that Lemelson elected either a species of controls for the entire material handling system or for all carriage movements. It may alternatively be inferred that he elected a species of controls which employed the counting of feedback pulses in order to locate the carriage of the apparatus at a preselected position in its path of travel, be it photoelectric or electromechanical. The balance of the prosecution history in no way eliminates a dispute as to this factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">(c) <em>Continued Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">The third office action, dated April 11, 1958, found Lemelson's election to have been incomplete for reasons related, not to the designated claims, but to the figures selected to illustrate the species. These, it said, covered \u201calternate forms of control elements for various portions of the controls\u201d and thus failed to \u201cpresent a <em>single </em>preferred embodiment of the invention.\u201d The applicant was again directed to designate those portions of the specification that were \u201climited to the <em>single elected </em>embodiment.\u201d (Emphasis in original, both instances.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">The inventor\u2019s response on October 14, 1958 (the 1958 response) cancelled claims 32-36 and 39-41, those designated in the preceding response as reading on the elected species. New claims 42-49 were added, the broadest being claim 42, which was accurately described by Lemelson as reciting a \u201cconveying means as a self-contained unit with its own servo drives which are automatically controlled by an automatic controller operated by feed-back signals generated as a result of movement of the conveyor relative to the rack.\u201d No distinction was made in claims 42-44 and 49 between photoelectric and electromechanically generated feedback signals. The balance of the new claims was limited to photoelectric scanning, but no claim included either the load sensing means or dual reflectors now claimed in the \u2018814 and \u2018640 patents, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">In the 1958 response, Lemelson stated that \u201cFig. 25 broadly illustrates the elected invention.\u201d Surprisingly, the system of Fig. 25 utilizes electromechanical controls. In his words, he elected for prosecution \u201cthe feed-back scanning means of Figs. 7 and 28 to be utilized in the system of Figs. 24 and 25.\u201d Though Fig. 7 illustrated photoelectric scanning and Fig. 25 depicted electromechanical switches, it was argued that both performed the same function and accordingly they should be \u201cretained as alternative forms of the same invention.\u201d The applicant identified by page number in the specification the individual descriptions of Figs. 7 and 24-28, but retained in the application all figures and specifications \u201cpending the filing of a divisional application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">(d) <em>Withdrawal by Examiner of Claims to Nonelected Species</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">In the fourth office action, dated April 8, 1959, the examiner continued to press for restriction of the specification to the \u201celected and claimed invention.\u201d For the first time, the presence was noted in the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>tion of allowable subject matter in the form of that recited in claim 48. The controls recited in claim 48 employed counting of feedback pulses generated by photoelectric scanning as the carriage moved along its path of travel. This claim did not recite or suggest either structure or functions corresponding to the load sensing means or dual reflectors claimed in the patents in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">Claims 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 25, 30, and 37 were \u201cwithdrawn [by the examiner] from further consideration in the case as being directed to the non-elected species.\u201d The reference of the examiner to claims 17, 25, and 37, in particular, as being \u201cdirected to the non-elected species\u201d is telling. The district court found that the species of carrier controls elected by Lemelson was \u201cthe photoelectric cell method ... rather than the electromechanical method.\u201d 217 USPQ at 339. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that claims 17, 25, and 37 each recite various configurations of controls that utilize photoelectric cells. Thus, if only from the viewpoint of the examiner, the elected species of controls could not have encompassed all use of photoelectric cells, and the nonelected species of controls did not consist exclusively of electromechanical means of controls. Subsequent events may, notwithstanding, have relevance to the identity of the elected species of controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">(e) <em>Restriction of the Specification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">Prosecution continued with Lemelson on October 12, 1959, retaining claim 48 in the application but cancelling the balance of those under consideration and substituting for them new claims 50-53. Claim 50, the sole independent claim in the new group, recited a \u201cscanning relay\u201d for generating position-indicating feedback pulses by scanning \u201cidentifying means\u201d located along the path of travel. Claim 50 was asserted to be a rewritten version of claim 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">This was disputed in the fifth office action, dated October 30, 1959, which noted again that Lemelson had yet to restrict disclosure of the specification to the subject matter elected for prosecution. The examiner then entered a final rejection of all pending claims and continued to refer to claims 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 25, 30, and 37 as \u201cdirected to non-elected species.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">Minor amendments to the specification were submitted on November 9, 1959, and to the claims on March 22, 1950. The latter were refused entry as not placing the claims in condition for allowance or in better form for appeal in a sixth office action dated April 28, 1960, which continued to note that the specification remained in need of correction, apparently in order to restrict its disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">Lemelson appealed the final rejection while at the same time trying to get his application in condition for allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">Following an interview with the examiner, Lemelson\u2019s attorney on August 11, 1960, cancelled the entire specification of the 1954 application and its then pending claims, substituting a substantially streamlined new specification and new claims 54-56 (the substitute 1954 application).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">Although not explicitly stated in the file wrapper, the new specification appears to have been submitted to meet the continuing, long-standing requirement of the examiner to delete from the 1954 application all matter not related to the elected invention and species of controls. Thus, the new specification eliminated from immediate consideration by the examiner, but certainly not from the file wrapper itself, substantial disclosure directed toward the support of claims for nonelected inventions in Groups I and II and, within Group II, for other species of controls than that elected for prosecution. Among the disclosure eliminated was that related to the load sensing means, now claimed in the \u2019814 patent, and the dual reflectors whereby carriage slow-down precedes its actual predetermined stopping point, as now claimed in the \u2018640 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-14\">(f) <em>Allowance and Abandonment of the 1954 Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-15\">The substitute 1954 application was deemed by the examiner to have placed the application in condition for allowance, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>cept for minor informalities. Following yet another interview, these informalities were corrected, and on April 18, 1961, the application containing three independent claims was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">In each allowed claim a \u201ccontrol apparatus\u201d was recited for positioning the carriage horizontally and the load support vertically. Each control apparatus was recited as \u201cincluding a predetermining counting relay means ... to stop [the carriage] ... upon receipt of a predetermined number of position indicating feedback signals.\u201d These were generated by \u201ca scanning relay\u201d mounted on the carriage each time it scans one of a \u201cplurality of sensitized markers\u201d used to identify the position of each storage bay. While the relay means thus recited may be photoelectric, those controls are, in addition, a form of \u201ccounting means,\u201d as this term is used by Lemelson. None of the claims ultimately allowed recited functions or structure which would slow the carriage before it stops at a predetermined storage bay or would control the movement of the load carrier into or out of such a bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">The substitute 1954 application became abandoned six months after its allowance for failure of the applicant within that time to pay the fee necessary for issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">4. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">The statement of the district court that Lemelson elected the photoelectric species of controls really constituted a finding of fact, a choice among possible inferences to be drawn from subsidiary facts presented in the evidence of record, and a bar to the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-8\">On summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. A study of the record in this light leads us to believe that inferences contrary to those drawn by the trial court might be permissible. The materials before the District Court having thus raised a genuine issue as to ultimate fact ... it was improper for the District Court to decide the applicability of the rule on a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-12\"><em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962). From our reading of the record, it cannot be said that one explanation is the only possible interpretation of what species was elected. As the identity of that elected species is a fact essential to the legal conclusion of invalidity, the requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 that there be no genuine issue of material fact was not met. <em>See Cooper v. Ford Motor Co., </em>748 F.2d 677, 679-80, 223 USPQ 1286, 1288 (Fed.Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">The memorandum and order of the district court granting summary judgment is accordingly vacated and this case is remanded for further appropriate proceedings. No opinion is hereby rendered as to the ultimate appropriate resolution of the factual issue observed to be present. <em>See Waganer v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>486 F.2d 955, 960 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-14\">B. <em>Additional Comments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-15\">The following guidance is included as to some matters addressed by the district court in its memorandum in support of summary judgment and which may again need to receive its attention on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-16\">1. <em>\u201cHiatus\u201d of Disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"A757\">In order for the \u2018814 and \u2018640 patents to be entitled under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the filing date of an earlier application in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>the chain of applications of which they are part, it must be shown that as to the inventions claimed there has been \u201ccontinuing disclosure through the chain of applications, without hiatus.\u201d <em>In re Schneider, </em>481 F.2d 1350, 1356, 179 USPQ 46, 50 (CCPA 1973). <em>Accord In re Hogan, </em>559 F.2d 595, 609, 194 USPQ 527, 540 (CCPA 1977); <em>In re Goodman, </em>476 F.2d 1365, 1368, 177 USPQ 574, 576 (CCPA 1973). The district court held such a \u201chiatus\u201d to have resulted in relation to the patents in suit due to Lemelson\u2019s 1960 cancellation of matter in the 1954 application and to have continued until the filing of each of the CIP applications. 217 USPQ at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">We agree that a \u201chiatus\u201d occurred in relation to any subject matter claimed in those patents which is also part of the species of controls elected for prosecution in the 1954 application. Nevertheless, it was error to conclude that the hiatus began with the 1960 cancellation of matter in the 1954 application. Even assuming, arguendo, that this cancellation was \u201cvoluntary\u201d as indicated by the district court, any of the cancelled matter could have been reinstated into the 1954 application by Lemelson without raising any new matter objection, at least until the abandonment of that application in 1961. The hiatus we would observe runs from this latter event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">Lemelson argues for continuity of disclosure between the CIP applications and 1954 application through the link of the Rule 147 divisional application, because that application consisted of a complete copy of the original 1954 application. Contrary to the then applicable statutory requirements for being accorded the status of a complete application,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> however, the Rule 147 appli<em>tion </em>on which Lemelson is forced to rely to show a continuity of disclosure was not signed and thus does not on its own right establish continuity of disclosure as to all matter disclosed in the original 1954 application of which it was a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-11\">Rule 147 is narrower than 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 and describes the unique circumstances under which in 1961 an application could have been filed without signature of the applicant. These circumstances were that the subject of that Rule 147 application had to be a \u201cnon-elected invention\u201d disclosed in the parent application. Thus, the unsigned Rule 147 divisional application at issue here could only establish continuity of disclosure for any invention or species thereof not elected for prosecution in the parent 1954 application. Explicitly, the Rule 147 divisional could not be an application legally effective to maintain disclosure before the Patent Office of any Group II invention utilizing the species of controls elected for prosecution in the 1954 application, whatever that is ultimately found to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">2. <em>Claims of the Patents in Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-13\">Accordingly, any claims of the \u2018814 and \u2018640 patents which read on the species of controls of the Group II invention elected for prosecution in the 1954 application would be invalid due to the \u201chiatus\u201d in disclosure discussed above. It would be improper, however, in evaluating validity to view each patent in suit as an indivisible unit by looking to a purported invention of each. Rather, the scope of each individual claim must be examined on its own merits, apart from that of other claims, even in the same patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Accord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number><em>Shelcore, Inc. v. Durham Industries, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 621, 624, 223 USPQ 584, 586 (Fed. Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">If every claim of one of the patents in suit is determined after a trial to read on the elected species of controls, it would then be correct to conclude that such a patent is totally invalid. Even assuming, arguendo, that the elected species of controls is the \u201cphotoelectric\u201d method, however, such a situation does not automatically follow here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">The specification of each of the two patents in suit discloses <em>both </em>photoelectric and electromechanical methods of effecting the control functions of slowing the carriage prior to stopping it at a preselected storage bin, as in the \u2018640 patent, and detecting loads on the load support or in a storage bin, as in the \u2018814 patent. Thus, even if the elected species of controls is found to encompass one of these two methods, claims in these patents to control functions which are accomplished by the other method could yet be valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">We admonish care, therefore, in sweeping conclusions about the validity of these patents. Some claims of each appear not to be limited to one or the other type of controls, but are broad enough to read on the photoelectric or electromechanical means. Others appear to be narrower and tailored to read exclusively on either one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">Accordingly, on remand, for purposes of ascertaining whether TRW has carried its burden on invalidity, inquiry is clearly required into the scope of each individual claim in the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">III.
