Both hospitals are qualified health care providers under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (the \u201cMedicare Act\u201d). Memorial and Herrin brought this action in the district court seeking review of the defendants\u2019 (collectively referred to as the \u201cSecretary\u201d) disallowance of Medicare reimbursement for several categories of costs. Both hospitals contested, among other things, the Secretary\u2019s decision to disallow the interest paid on money borrowed to establish a bond reserve fund. In addition, Memorial objected to the Secretary\u2019s decision to offset against allowable education costs the family practice grant funds received by Memorial from the Public Health Service. Following the magistrate\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grant of summary judgment to the Secretary on these two issues, the hospitals appealed. We now affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">The Medicare Act provides that qualified providers of health care services to Medicare beneficiaries will be reimbursed for the lesser of the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of those services or their \u201ccustomary charges\u201d with respect to those services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b)(l) (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cReasonable cost\u201d is very broadly defined by the Act, to be defined more specifically in regulations promulgated by the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982). In addition to these regulations, the Secretary issues the Provider Reimbursement Manual (\u201cPRM\u201d) to give guidance in interpreting the regulations. This case involves a challenge to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation and application of various provisions in the regulations and PRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Providers are normally reimbursed under Medicare through private organizations (usually insurance companies) acting as \u201cfiscal intermediaries,\u201d under contract with the Secretary. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h (1982). The intermediaries determine the amount of reimbursement due to a provider based on the cost report submitted by the provider at the close of each fiscal year. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.406(b), 405.453(f) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>(1984). If a provider disagrees with its intermediary\u2019s reimbursement determination, it may obtain review by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d) if the amount in controversy is $10,000 or more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a) (1982); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1835 (1984). The Board has the authority to \u201caffirm, modify, or reverse a final determination of the fiscal intermediary with respect to a cost report,\u201d and may consider issues and evidence not considered by the intermediary in making its final determination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(d) (1982). The Board\u2019s decision constitutes final agency action unless, within sixty days after the provider is notified of the Board\u2019s decision, the Secretary reverses, affirms, or modifies the Board\u2019s decision on her own motion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l) (1982). The Secretary has delegated this power to the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (\u201cHCFA\u201d), who has redelegated the authority to the Deputy Administrator. <em>See Indiana Hospital Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>544 F.Supp. 1167, 1177-78 (S.D. Ind.1982) (upholding validity of these delegations), aff<em>'d, </em>714 F.2d 872 (7th Cir.1983) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1274, 79 L.Ed.2d 679 (1984). A provider may obtain judicial review of \u201cany final decision of the Board, or of any reversal, affirmance, or modification by the Secretary. ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Memorial and Herrin filed timely appeals with the Board to contest their intermediary\u2019s disallowance of seven items of costs for cost years ending March 31, 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. Only two of those items, the offset of Memorial\u2019s family practice grant against allowable educational costs and the disallowance of interest on the hospitals\u2019 bond reserve fund, are presented in this appeal. The Board conducted a hearing on October 6, 1981, and in a 2-1 decision dated April 6, 1982, upheld the intermediary\u2019s determination to offset Memorial\u2019s family practice grant and modified the intermediary\u2019s decision with respect to interest on the bond reserve fund. PRRB Decision No. 82-D77, 1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 1131,944, at 9603-04. The Deputy Administrator of the HCFA, acting as the Secretary\u2019s delegate, affirmed the Board\u2019s disposition of these issues on June 2, 1982. HCFA Deputy Administrator Decision, 1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) K 32,046, at 10,031-32. The hospitals then sought judicial review of this final administrative decision in the district court. \u25a0 After the parties consented to trial by magistrate, both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The magistrate granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment on these two issues on September 21, 1983. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Our scope of review on appeal is narrow, and we must defer to the Secretary\u2019s judgment unless her actions were \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982). The presumption of regularity afforded the Secretary\u2019s decision under this standard does not, however, shield it from a \u201cthorough, probing, in-depth review.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). With this in mind, we now address the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">II. FAMILY PRACTICE GRANT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"A6CH\">A. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The Medicare regulations specify that a provider may be reimbursed for the \u201cnet cost\u201d of \u201capproved educational activities,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.421(a) (1984), including training programs for interns and residents. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.421(c). For the cost years at issue in this case, net educational costs were determined by deducting from the cost of approved educational activities \u201cany reimbursements from grants, tuition, and specific donations.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-421(b)(2) (1978). The regulation on grants and gifts similarly provided that while unrestricted grants did not have to be deducted to determine allowable costs, grants \u201cdesignated by a donor for paying specific operating costs\u201d were to be offset against operating costs in determining allowable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>costs. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.423 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Provider Reimbursement Manual provided an exception to the offset requirement for \u201cseed money\u201d grants, defined as grants \u201cdesignated for the development of new health care agencies or for expansion of services of established agencies____\u201d PRM \u00a7 612.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Public Health Service (\u201cPHS\u201d) received authorization from Congress in 1971, through an amendment to title VII of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), to make grants to hospitals to \u201cplan, develop, and operate, or participate in, an approved professional training program ... in the field of family medicine____\u201d Pub.L. No. 92-157, \u00a7 107(b), 85 Stat. 457 (1971) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 295e-l). On February 13, 1974, Memorial applied for one of these family practice training grants. PHS approved a three-year grant on June 29, 1974, and Memorial\u2019s training program began the following month. Memorial received $131,893 and $64,254 in grant funds for its 1977 and 1978 fiscal years, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Memorial alleges that there was \u201cconsiderable doubt within HEW whether the family practice grants should be offset against the cost of approved educational activities.\u201d <em>See </em>PRRB Decision No. 82-D77, 1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) U 31,944, at 9602. This confusion was highlighted by a sequence of events in the Atlanta regional office of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\u201cHEW\u201d) (predecessor agency to the Department of Health and Human Services) in 1975-76. On January 22, 1975, the Atlanta office issued a letter to intermediaries within that region (not the region in which Memorial is located), instructing them to treat family practice grants as seed money grants exempt from offset under section 612.2 of the PRM. The letter was withdrawn in July 1976 by order of the Bureau of Health Insurance, which administered the Medicare program before the transfer of functions to the HCFA in 1977. Despite the inconsistent treatment of family practice grants within that region, however, and despite some internal debate over the proper position to adopt, the Department\u2019s consistent practice was to require the deduction of family practice grants in determining allowable educational costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">On April 8, 1977, Congressman Paul Rogers, who was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Public Health Service legislation), wrote to HEW Secretary Califano asking him to reconsider the Department\u2019s policy of offsetting family practice grants on the basis that it was undermining federal and state efforts to encourage family practice training programs. He stated that \u201c[t]o require monies received from primary care training be deducted is, in large measure, negating the action of the Congress and State legislatures in appropriating monies for such training.\u201d In a response to Congressman Rogers dated January 18, 1978, Califano stated that family practice grants were \u201crestricted grants\u201d subject to offset under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.421 and 405.423, and that they should have been treated as such by the Atlanta regional office. Califano further stated, however, that in order to support Congress\u2019s and the Administration\u2019s priority of encouraging more doctors to become primary care physicians, the Department intended to propose appropriate modifications to its existing regulations in order to exempt family practice grants from the offset requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">On August 10, 1979, the Secretary proposed these modifications in a notice of proposed rulemaking. 44 Fed.Reg. 47,117 (Aug. 10, 1979). A final rule was issued nearly a year later. 45 Fed.Reg. 51,783 (Aug. 5, 1980). The rule amended 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.421 by revising and redesignating subsection (b)(2), the general offset provision, as subsection (g)(1), and adding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>new subsection (g)(2) which provided that \u201c[e]ffeetive for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1978, grants and donations that the donor has designated for internship and residency programs in family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics are not deducted in calculating net costs.\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. at 51,787. Because the family practice grant exception to the general offset requirement was only made retroactive to cost years beginning on or after January 1, 1978, however, the family practice grant monies received by Memorial in its cost reporting periods ending March 31, 1977 and 1978 (cost years 1977 and 1978) are subject to the previously existing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Memorial\u2019s intermediary offset Memorial\u2019s family practice grant funds in determining allowable educational costs. Memorial appealed to the Board, arguing that its family practice grant was exempt from offset either as a seed money grant under section 612.2 of the PRM or as a \u201clast dollar\u201d grant in accordance with longstanding agency policy. Memorial also asserted that if the former regulation required offset of family practice grants, it was contrary to the statute authorizing such grants (the Public Health Service Act) and therefore invalid. The Board affirmed the intermediary\u2019s determination, holding that the family practice grants were neither seed money grants nor last dollar grants. The Deputy Administrator of the HCFA affirmed the Board\u2019s decision without further discussion. The magistrate upheld the agency\u2019s actions after also finding that family practice grants were neither seed money grants nor last dollar grants and that their offset was not contrary to statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Memorial\u2019s contention that family practice grants qualify as seed money grants, and are thus exempt from offset, is based on section 612.2 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">Grants designated for the development of new health care agencies or for expansion of services of established agencies are generally referred to as \u201cseed money\u201d grants. \u201cSeed money\u201d grants are not deducted from costs in computing allowable costs. These grants are usually made to cover specific operating costs or group of costs for services for a stated period of time. During this time, the provider will develop sufficient patient caseloads to enable continued self-sustaining operation with funds received from Medicare reimbursement as well as from funds received from other patients or other third-party payers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">This section describes three essential characteristics of a seed money grant: (1) the grant is designated for the development or expansion of a health care agency, (2) the grant is made to cover specific operating costs for a stated period of time, and (3) the provider will become self-sustaining by the end of that period. Memorial contends that family practice grants exhibit each of these three characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">Memorial argues that its family practice grant displays the first feature of a seed money grant because it was designated for the development of the hospital\u2019s Family Practice Center, which Memorial argues qualifies as either a new health care agency or an expansion of services of an established agency. The Center was constructed specifically to house Memorial\u2019s family practice training program. The facilities occupied a two-story wing of the hospital, including two treatment rooms, twelve examining rooms, twelve consultation rooms for residents, and nurses\u2019 stations. Memorial\u2019s grant application contemplated that because of the program\u2019s emphasis on training through actual patient care, the Center would \u201cprovide comprehensive primary care for approximately 5% of the families of the Carbondale area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Memorial asserts that its grant demonstrates the second characteristic of a seed money grant because it was made to cover costs for a three-year period beginning July 1,1974, and ending June 30, 1977. The last characteristic is present, according to Memorial, because the training program was expected to become nondependent on feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>al funds by the end of that period. The PHS regulations then in effect provided that \u201c[t]he ability to continue the project on a self-sustaining basis\u201d was one of the factors to be considered by the Secretary in awarding a family practice grant. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 57.1605(a)(4) (1974). The PHS booklet describing the grants emphasized that \u201c[tjhese grants are to meet an acceptable objective within a definite period of time rather than providing long term, continuing support of ongoing programs.\u201d Memorial\u2019s grant application expressly stated its expectation that non-federal funds would be available to support the program after the grant terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The Secretary defends the agency\u2019s decision not to classify family practice grants as seed money grants not so much by disagreeing with the contentions made by Memorial (although she does disagree with Memorial\u2019s assertion that the third characteristic exists<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>), as by pointing out a distinction Memorial failed to make. The Secretary asserts that section 612.2 has consistently been interpreted by the agency to apply only to grants for <em>services, </em>rather than to <em>training </em>grants, and that family practice grants are training grants not covered by section 612.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Memorial disputes the Secretary\u2019s classification of family practice grants as training grants, arguing that training and the provision of services are not mutually exclusive and that family practice grants fulfill both needs. It cites as support for this position the health care services provided to the community through the Family Practice Center and the letter sent out by the Atlanta regional office informing intermediaries that family practice grants were to be treated as seed money grants because the grants were \u201cmade for the purpose of extending services.\u201d This letter was withdrawn, however, after Medicare\u2019s central office instructed the regional office that the seed money exception did not apply to family practice training grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The Secretary finds support for her position that family practice grants are training grants rather than grants for the provision of services in the statute authorizing the grants. The title of the act authorizing family practice grants was the \u201cComprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971.\u201d Pub.L. No. 92-157, 85 Stat. 431 (1971). The purpose of the act was \u201cto amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to provide increased manpower for the health professions, and for other purposes____\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 258, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (\u201cHouse Report\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News .1610. The statute created and authorized family practice grants by adding a new section 767 to the Public Health Service Act, headed: \u201cGrants for training, traineeships, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>fellowships in family medicine.\u201d Pub.L. No. 92-157, \u00a7 107, 85 Stat. 457 (1971) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 295e-l). The legislative history of the 1971 statute reveals that Congress created family practice grants specifically to train more family physicians, in an attempt to slow or reverse the trend away from the general practice of medicine and into specialties. House Report at 25-26, <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1625-26. The Committee specifically provided that at least 75% of family practice grant funds \u201cshall be for the support of the students, interns, residents, and other health professionals to encourage and assist them to receive such training.\u201d House Report at 26, <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1626.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Memorial\u2019s own grant application provides additional support for the Secretary\u2019s position that family practice grants are training grants rather than grants for the provision of services. The application form is headed \u201cTraining Grant Application,\u201d and requires a detailed description of Memorial\u2019s proposed training program. Memorial\u2019s application provided this summary of its program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">The purpose of the program is to produce primary care physician manpower for areas of need in Southern Illinois through specialty training in Family Medicine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">Important characteristics of the program are three years of training in an approved Family Practice residency, sponsored jointly by a community hospital and a new three-year medical school, emphasizing the provision of family and community-oriented comprehensive and continuing patient care by teams of physicians, nurse clinicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, nutritionists, health educators, etc. The training experience is planned to simulate as closely as is possible the anticipated conditions of the delivery of comprehensive health care by such teams of health professionals, with strong emphasis on health maintenance through health education and prevention of illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">It appears from the above excerpt and the legislative history of family practice grants that the primary purpose of the grants is to train physicians in family practice medicine. Memorial\u2019s emphasis on the provision of health care services to the community is really an emphasis on the quality of the training experience that its trainees will receive \u2014 an experience \u201cplanned to simulate as closely as is possible\u201d the actual practice of family medicine in the community. Although an incidental benefit of Memorial\u2019s family practice training program was undoubtedly the furnishing to the community of some services that had not previously been provided, the primary purpose of the program was to train primary care physicians for the southern Illinois region.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Although we might be inclined to uphold the Secretary\u2019s finding that family practice grants are not seed money grants under section 612.2 of the PRM if based on this service versus training grant distinction, however, it appears that this was not the basis for the agency\u2019s decision. Rather, the PRRB held that family practice grants did not meet the criteria for seed money grants because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYIx\">[s]eed money grants as addressed in Section 612 of [the PRM] concerns [sic] only developing new home health agencies or expanding the services of established agencies. Seed money provides for the establishment of a new state of art (home health care) in patient care. It does not relate to the expansion of existing hospital or physician services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">PRRB Decision No. 82-D77, 1982 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 1131,944, at 9604. A home health agency is a public or private organization which \u201cis primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing services and other therapeutic services\u201d on a visiting basis in a patient\u2019s home. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(m), (o) (1982). The Secretary now concedes that \u201cthe Board appears to have misconstrued\u201d section 612.2 of the PRM:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atp\">The Board\u2019s reference to home health agencies appears to arise from section 612.3 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, which describes the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>of general grant rules to certain specific Public Health Service grants, not including family practice grants. That section specifies that certain grants received to assist States to develop new home health agencies would be considered seed money grants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Brief of Appellee at 21 &amp; n. 13. The Deputy Administrator affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to offset family practice grants against allowable educational costs without further discussion. Thus, the only ground for the agency\u2019s finding that Memorial\u2019s grant was not a seed money grant seems clearly erroneous and has expressly been disavowed by the Secretary on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Under these circumstances, we believe the magistrate erred in proceeding to affirm the agency\u2019s decision under a different theory, the training versus service grant distinction, rather than remanding to the agency. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), prohibits appellate courts from affirming an agency\u2019s decision on grounds other than those stated by the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 63 S.Ct. at 459; <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); <em>People of the State of Illinois v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>722 F.2d 1341, 1348 (7th Cir.1983). The rationale for this rule is that courts would then be making determinations of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-7\"><em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. at 88, 63 S.Ct. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The Secretary urges us to disregard <em>Chenery </em>in this case because the issue essentially involves \u201clegal conclusions\u201d regarding the applicability of section 612.2. We believe, however, that the question of whether family practice grants qualify as seed money grants under that section is not so much a legal question as a question of agency policy. As Memorial points out, family practice grants arguably meet the literal requirements of section 612.2. Counsel for the Secretary on appeal argues that section 612.2 does not cover these grants because of a longstanding agency distinction between service and training grants in addition to an agency determination that family practice grants are training grants. This is precisely the sort of policy determination that must be made by the agency itself rather than by lawyers and judges on appeal. Although the Secretary\u2019s arguments on appeal sound reasonable to us, we are not absolutely convinced that the agency would embrace this position on remand. <em>Cf. People of the State of Illinois v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>722 F.2d 1341, 1348 (7th Cir.1983) (futile to remand if sure that agency would reinstate its decision). We must therefore reverse the magistrate\u2019s decision insofar as it affirms the Secretary\u2019s determination under section 612.2 of the PRM, with instructions to remand this portion of the case back to the agency for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Although the magistrate quite thoroughly addressed Memorial\u2019s last two contentions \u2014 that the family practice grants are exempt from offset as \u201clast dollar\u201d grants and that if offsetting the grants against educational costs is required by Medicare\u2019s regulations then those regulations are contrary to statute and therefore invalid \u2014 we do not address these issues in light of our disposition of the seed money grant question.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">III. BOND RESERVE FUND ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"AT0b\">A. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">In 1978, the city of Carbondale, Illinois issued $9.5 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds under an agreement with Memorial and Herrin Hospitals. The agreement provided that the city would issue the bonds and lend the net proceeds of the bond issue to the hospitals, and that the hospitals would repay the loan plus scheduled interest at rates varying from 4.35% to 7.2%. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Of the $9.5 million in proceeds, most was used by the hospitals to retire their outstanding indebtedness, on which they w\u00e9re then paying 8-10% interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Approximately $375,000 of the proceeds were used to pay for the costs of issuance and underwriters\u2019 discount. The remainder, $809,-133, was used to establish a bond reserve fund, as required by the bond underwriters as a condition for issuing the bonds. The purpose of the reserve fund was to provide assurances to bondholders that payments would be made on the bond indebtedness. The fund was required to have a minimum balance \u201cof not less than Maximum Annual Principal and Interest Requirements.\u201d The hospitals invested and earned interest income on the money in this bond reserve fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In their cost reports for cost years 1978-80, the hospitals claimed as an allowable Medicare cost all of the interest expense they incurred in connection with the 1978 bond issue, based on 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(a) (\u201cnecessary and proper\u201d interest expense is allowable cost). That regulation further provides that in calculating \u201cnecessary\u201d interest expense, the allowable interest costs must be reduced by \u201cinvestment income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(iii). \u201cIncome from funded depreciation,\u201d however, \u201cis not used to reduce interest expense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFunded depreciation\u201d was defined by the Provider Reimbursement Manual, for all times relevant to this action, as \u201cthe practice of setting aside cash, or other liquid assets, in a fund separate from the general funds of the provider to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated, or for other capital purposes.\u201d PRM \u00a7 226. In the belief that their bond reserve fund qualified as funded depreciation, the hospitals did not offset from their claimed interest expense the income they earned on the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The intermediary allowed the interest expense incurred by the hospitals in connection with the bond issue. The intermediary then offset, however, the investment income earned on the bond reserve fund based on its determination that the fund was not funded depreciation. The intermediary took the position that borrowed money could not be used to establish funded depreciation. Because the hospitals funded their bond reserve fund with bond proceeds, therefore, the intermediary determined that the fund did not qualify as funded depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The Board modified the intermediary\u2019s decision, holding that while interest income did not have to be offset against allowable costs, the interest paid on the amount borrowed to fund the bond reserve fund would be disallowed. In so holding, the Board determined that the hospitals\u2019 bond reserve fund <em>was </em>funded depreciation. As a consequence, it applied section 226.5 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, which at that time provided that \u201c[w]hen a provider borrows money to make deposits of funded depreciation, interest paid by the provider on the money borrowed for this purpose is not allowable as cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">The Deputy Administrator of the HCFA affirmed the Board\u2019s decision disallowing the interest expense as an allowable cost, stating that the interest expense was not \u201cnecessary\u201d under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419 because that part of the underlying loan was not made to satisfy the hospitals\u2019 financial need and was not for a purpose related to patient care. The magistrate upheld the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Resolution of this issue is complicated by the fact that the Secretary has taken two different approaches to the situation where, as here, a provider borrows money to establish funded depreciation. The two agency approaches are illustrated in this case by the intermediary\u2019s decision to offset interest income and the Board\u2019s modification to exempt interest income from offset while disallowing interest expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The first of the two agency approaches to this situation, as illustrated by the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>termediary\u2019s decision, is to allow the interest expense under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(a), but to offset all investment income under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(iii). The offset requirement is held to apply on the theory that an account established with borrowed funds cannot qualify as funded depreciation under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(iii). This approach will be referred to as the \u201cincome offset\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The second manner in which the Secretary has treated this situation, as illustrated by the Board\u2019s decision, is to treat the fund as funded depreciation. Under this approach, income earned on the fund is exempt from offset under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-419(b)(2)(iii), but the interest paid on money borrowed to establish the fund is disallowed because it is not a \u201cnecessary\u201d expense under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2), as interpreted by section 226.5 of the PRM. This approach will be referred to as the \u201cinterest disallowance\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The hospitals urge a third approach \u2014 one which treats their interest expense as an allowable cost and does not require the offset of investment income earned on the bond reserve fund. They argue that the interest expense associated with the bond issue is a necessary interest expense under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419 and that income earned on the fund need not be offset because it qualifies as funded depreciation. They further argue that section 226.5 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, which at that time disallowed interest expense on money borrowed for funded depreciation, was invalid as a \u201cblanket disallowance\u201d of costs under <em>Northwest Hospital, Inc. v. Hospital Service Corp., </em>687 F.2d 985, 992 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We are substantially aided in our review of this issue by the First Circuit\u2019s consideration of the same issue in <em>Cheshire Hospital v. New Hampshire-Vermont Hospitalization Service, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 1112 (1st Cir.1982). In that case, Cheshire Hospital incurred almost $9.5 million in debt through the issuance of revenue bonds by a state health authority. As required by the bond agreement, $880,000 of the proceeds were used to establish a bond reserve fund. In determining Cheshire\u2019s reimbursable costs, the intermediary utilized the income offset approach, allowing the interest expense but reducing it by the interest income earned on the fund. The Board and Secretary affirmed the intermediary\u2019s use of the income offset approach. The First Circuit, after discussing the agency\u2019s two approaches to this issue and concluding that both were consistent with the Medicare Act and regulations, ordered a remand to the Secretary with instructions to choose only one of the two approaches and to clarify that it alone would be applied in cases of this sort. 689 F.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Four months after the <em>Cheshire Hospital </em>decision, the Secretary revised sections 226 and 226.5 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual to make clear that the agency would henceforth use the income offset approach to situations where a provider borrows money for funded depreciation. For cost reporting years beginning on or after December 1, 1982, section 226.5 provides that funds established with borrowed money will not qualify as funded depreciation, that interest on such borrowing is an allowable cost, and that income earned on the borrowed funds must be offset against interest expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The First Circuit\u2019s determination in <em>Cheshire Hospital </em>that both the income offset and interest disallowance approaches were reasonable interpretations of agency regulations was based on a careful analysis of the purpose of those regulations. The court found that the first purpose of the regulatory structure was to discourage Medicare-subsidized borrowing for funded depreciation. 689 F.2d at 1118-19. The court noted that the regulation defining funded depreciation describes it \u201cas a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets, suggesting that funded depreciation is to be financed by conserving operating revenues rather than through borrowing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125. The regulatory history of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419 further supports the argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>regulation was not intended to subsidize borrowing to finance funded depreciation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUY\">The regulation in question was adopted pursuant to a suggestion made by the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council. The minutes of the Council\u2019s meetings indicate that one of the main reasons the Council decided to encourage funded depreciation was to obviate the need for providers to borrow funds for replacing depreciable assets, thereby reducing the amount of interest expense which would have to be reimbursed by Medicare. This purpose would obviously be thwarted if providers were permitted to borrow in order to finance funded depreciation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-5\"><em>Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1125 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The income offset approach achieves the purpose of discouraging borrowing to finance funded depreciation by \u201cassuring] that a provider will not borrow money at Medicare\u2019s \u2014 and the taxpayer\u2019s \u2014 expense when it has investment funds available which could be applied to fill the need for capital\u201d and by \u201cguaranteeing] that a provider will borrow only what is needed to fulfill capital requirements related to providing services under [Medicare], since the return on any excess borrowing will be recaptured\u201d under the offset rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1118 (quoting <em>Illinois Central Community Hospital, Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>1981 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 31,421, at 9120 (D.D.C. July 10, 1981)). The interest disallowance approach likewise deters borrowing to finance funded depreciation by ensuring that Medicare will not subsidize the cost of the borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The income offset approach has a second purpose in addition to discouraging excess, borrowing, and that is to limit the amount of a provider\u2019s reimbursement to the actual or net cost of its borrowing. <em>Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1119; <em>accord Abbott-Northwestern Hospital, Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>698 F.2d 336, 343 (8th Cir.1983). The income offset approach achieves this purpose by limiting reimbursement to the cost of the borrowing less any benefit derived therefrom. Such a determination \u201cclearly serves the purpose of the Medicare Act which limits reimbursement to costs actually incurred by the provider.\u201d <em>Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The interest disallowance approach, on the other hand, provides that interest paid on money borrowed to establish funded depreciation is not an allowable cost at all. This rule comes from section 226.5 of the PRM, which in turn comes from 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2). That regulation provides that only \u201cnecessary\u201d interest is an allowable cost, and states that loans resulting in investments are not considered necessary for Medicare purposes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(i); <em>Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1125. The regulation further provides that in order to be a necessary expense, interest must be incurred on a loan made for a purpose reasonably related to patient care. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(ii). The HCFA Deputy Administrator found that application of section 226.5 of the PRM in this case was consistent with both of those provisions since the portion of the bond proceeds used to establish the bond reserve fund was not borrowed to satisfy a financial need of the provider <em>(i.e., </em>resulted in excess funds or investments) and was not reasonably related to patient care. In regard to the first finding, the First Circuit has remarked that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">[s]ince funded depreciation accounts may be reasonably considered as investments, albeit investments with the limited purpose of replacing depreciable assets, a rule which disallows interest reimbursement on loans used to finance these accounts would appear to be a reasonable interpretation of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-11\"><em>Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1125-26. As for the second finding, we find no abuse of discretion in the Deputy Administrator\u2019s determination that the part of the loan used to finance the bond reserve fund was not reasonably related to patient care. It is true that the reserve fund was a necessary condition for the new bond issue, that the new bond issue was used to retire outstanding debt carrying higher interest rates, and that the outstanding debt had been incurred for hospital construction and equipment. We do not doubt that the hospitals benefitted financially by refinancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>this old debt. But we hesitate to interpret the regulations as requiring the classification of every expense that even tangentially results in some financial benefit to a provider\u2019s overall operations as an expense reasonably related to patient care. We therefore believe that it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Administrator to interpret the regulations\u2019 \u201creasonably related to patient care\u201d standard as requiring a more direct connection between the interest expense and patient care.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, we agree with the First Circuit that both the income offset and interest disallowance approaches are reasonable interpretations of Medicare\u2019s regulations and are in accordance with the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Lastly, we address the hospitals\u2019 contention that section 226.5 of the PRM, as in effect during the cost years in question, was invalid as a \u201cblanket disallowance\u201d of all interest expense incurred on money borrowed for funded depreciation. <em>See Northwest Hospital, Inc. v. Hospital Service Corp., </em>687 F.2d 985, 992 (7th Cir.1982) (invalidating blanket disallowance of interest expense incurred on money borrowed from related parties). Contrary to the hospitals\u2019 position, we believe that section 226.5 is clearly distinguishable from the rule invalidated in <em>Northwest Hospital. </em>That rule disallowed any interest paid to related parties regardless of the purpose or reasonableness of the underlying loan. This court refused to apply the regulation because its blanket disallowance was \u201cbroader than either the language or the purpose of the Medicare statute can be construed to authorize.\u201d 687 F.2d at 992. We emphasized in that case, however, that we did not question the Secretary\u2019s authority to adopt, as a general matter, prophylactic rules designed to avoid potential abuse or the burden of multiple individual determinations. <em>Id.; see Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 776, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2472, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (while prophylactic rules might in certain cases be underinclusive or overinelusive in light of their intended purpose, they are \u201cwidely accepted response[s] to legitimate interests in administrative economy and certainty of coverage\u201d). We did not disapprove of all blanket disallowances, therefore, but rather only those so broad that their application is inconsistent with the rationale offered for the regulation, as was the case there. <em>See Northwest Hospital, </em>687 F.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Section 226.5 of the PRM was in effect a blanket determination that money borrowed for funded depreciation was never \u201cnecessary,\u201d and that interest expense on that borrowing was therefore not a necessary expense under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419. In contrast to the rule in <em>Northwest Hospital, </em>however, this blanket disallowance was a very narrow rule and was entirely consistent with the rationale for the regulation disallowing unnecessary interest expense. Funded depreciation gets special treatment under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(b)(2)(iii) as an incentive for providers to conserve funds for the replacement of depreciable assets. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(e) (1984). When a provider borrows money to establish a funded depreciation account, however, and that account then earns investment income free from the offset requirement, it is not unreasonable for the Secretary to take away the special treatment. The disallowance in section 226.5 applied only to interest on money borrowed to establish funded depreciation. The hospitals concede that in all but the \u201crare case,\u201d borrowing to create funded depreciation is not necessary. In their own case, however, they argue that it was absolutely necessary to use bond proceeds to establish the bond reserve fund because there were no other resources available to contribute to the fund. Because section 226.5 failed to allow for this rare case where borrowing was necessary to create funded depreciation, the hospitals argue, it was invalid as a blanket disallow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>anee. This is the type of blanket disallowance, however, that we implicitly approved in <em>Northwest Hospital </em>as an essential tool of the administrative process. It was narrowly drawn and was consistent with the rationale of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419. We therefore reject the hospitals\u2019 assertion that section 226.5 was invalid under the principles enunciated in <em>Northwest Hospital.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">In conclusion, we affirm the magistrate\u2019s finding that it was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to apply the interest disallowance rule to the hospitals\u2019 bond reserve fund. In so doing, we are mindful that it may be arbitrary and capricious for an agency to apply one rule in some cases and the other in other cases without acknowledging or explaining the inconsistency. <em>See Cheshire Hospital, </em>689 F.2d at 1126. We do not believe that a remand is necessary in this case, however, as the agency has now adopted a consistent position for cost reporting years beginning on or after December 1, 1982. We therefore affirm the Secretary\u2019s application of the interest disallowance rule to Memorial and Herrin Hospitals in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">This court\u2019s decision on the family practice grant issue was not intended to be a final remand.

The Secretary contends that Memorial\u2019s grant does not exhibit the third feature of a seed money grant because section 612.2 requires a provider to become self-sufficient by the end of the grant period using funds received from <em>patient </em>revenues, not from other sources. Memorial stated in its grant application that it hoped to become nondependent on federal funds by the end of the grant period because it expected the state of Illinois to subsidize from 50 to 100% of the cost of resident education after the grant expired. If the state did not subsidize the full cost, the hospital and the School of Medicine would share the remaining costs, with income from patient care by residents defraying \"a portion of\u201d those costs. Memorial argues that section 612.2 clearly contemplates self-sufficiency based on revenues from non-patient sources because it anticipates the development of self-sustaining operation with funds received from Medicare reimbursement, other patients, \"or other third-party payers.\"</p>\n<p id=\"A5ZZ\">Because this dispute was not addressed by the Board, Deputy Administrator, or magistrate, we similarly decline to address it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-11\">.

These documents merely illustrate the agency's alternate income offset approach, however, so uniformly take the further position that income earned on the bond reserve funds must be offset against allowable interest expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
