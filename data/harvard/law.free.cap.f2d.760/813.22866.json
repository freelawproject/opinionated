Kuna of five counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and one count of making a false statement to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Kuna appeals, arguing that during trial the district court constructively amended the mail fraud counts in violation of the fifth and sixth amendments, that the evidence was insufficient to support either the mail fraud counts or the false statement count, and that the district court improperly imposed restitution as a condition of probation on the false statement count. We affirm Kuna\u2019s conviction, but vacate the condition of probation requiring restitution and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">The facts, as shown by the government at trial, reveal that from July 1979 through December 1979, Kuna and John DeLeeuw solicited Michigan residents to invest in Steve Kuna &amp; Associates (Associates), a limited partnership which was to be formed to engage in business as a \u201cmarket-maker/specialist\u201d on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). Kuna &amp; De-Leeuw were the general partners of Associates; Kuna was the managing general partner. Eventually over thirty investors invested approximately $1.3 million in Associates. The $1.3 million was placed in an escrow account at the Michigan National Bank (MNB), with which Kuna had executed an escrow agreement before soliciting investors. The terms of the escrow agreement provided that the offering proceeds were to be held in escrow until the conditions listed on the offering memorandum were satisfied. The offering memorandum had provided that the offering proceeds would be held in escrow until at least $600,000 had been deposited, until Associates was registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and the Michigan Securities Bureau (MSB), and until Associates was approved for CBOE membership. The offering memorandum did describe the investment as involving a \u201chigh degree of risk,\u201d but it also stated an intention to use trading strategies that would minimize the risk of loss. In his oral representations to po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tential investors, Kuna described the investment as a conservative one.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In December 1979, MNB transferred the offering proceeds to Continental Bank in Chicago, following receipt of a letter from MSB granting permission to release the funds. At the time, however, Associates had not applied for registration with the SEC nor had it applied for membership with the CBOE. On December 19, 1979, Kuna applied to the CBOE stating that he was a sole proprietor and would be trading with his own funds. He entered into an agreement to clear his trades with First Options of Chicago, Inc. in his own name on January 25, 1980. On January 30, 1980, he began trading on the CBOE in his own name but with Associates\u2019s funds. On February 19, 1980, Kuna applied for registration with the SEC as a broker-dealer stating that he would be trading as a sole proprietor with his own funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">During the time that Kuna was trading on the CBOE with Associates\u2019s funds, he provided his limited partners with monthly reports which included a figure representing the monthly net liquidating balances in Associates\u2019 account. These monthly reports were mailed out on the letterhead of Doherty Zable &amp; Co., a Chicago accounting firm. The figures supplied to Doherty Zable by Kuna were false. Kuna stipulated at trial to the actual net liquidating balances in the First Options account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">In July 1980, the CBOE became aware\" that Kuna was trading with partnership funds and that he had failed to disclose on his CBOE application the fact that he had previously been sanctioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Kuna then applied for CBOE membership on behalf of Associates on July 31, 1980. The CBOE permitted Kuna to resume trading only if he advised his investors of his previous failure to properly obtain CBOE membership. Kuna sent a letter telling investors that Associates had failed to comply with certain technical registration problems, but that the problem had been rectified.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Kuna resumed trading in October 1980, and proceeded to lose all of Associates\u2019 money in high risk trading. On November 17, 1980, First Options froze Associates\u2019s account and proceeded to liquidate it; Kuna informed DeLeeuw that he had lost all the partnership money and admitted to DeLeeuw and to Associates\u2019 attorney and accountant that he had supplied the partners with false financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">During November 1983, the grand jury returned a fifteen count indictment against Kuna. After a bench trial, the district court acquitted Kuna on counts one through five, which charged mail fraud involving the mailings of the monthly reports for March, May, June and July 1980. The court convicted Kuna on counts six through ten, which charged mail fraud involving the mailings of the monthly reports for August, September and October, 1980. The court also convicted Kuna on count fifteen, involving the false statement to the SEC. The court sentenced Kuna to two years imprisonment on counts six through ten, the sentences to run concurrently. On count fifteen the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Kuna on five years\u2019 probation with the condition that Kuna make restitution to the partners of $1.2 million, less any accounts paid to them. The court also ordered that Kuna not practice as a broker-dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">The defendant\u2019s primary argument is that at trial the district court constructively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>amended the indictment to charge the defendant with a scheme he had not been charged with in the indictment, thereby depriving the defendant of his fifth and sixth amendment rights to know the charge against him. The defendant relies on the fact that at trial the court stated \u201cI think that if the government had their choice right now, they would reindict this crime and charge a <em>George </em>-type fraud, a deprivation of the fiduciary obligations owed to the limited partners____ But they didn\u2019t charge it.\u201d Tr. 563. The defendant also highlights the fact that when the court ruled on the case, the court stated: \u201cI have narrowed the scheme charged by the government in a significant way.\u201d Tr. of Ruling 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The ten mail fraud counts of defendant\u2019s indictment charge that the defendant, in a scheme to \u201cdefraud and to obtain money and property by false and fraudulent pretenses and representations, and attempting so to do, did knowingly cause to be placed into the United States mail\u201d envelopes to the various partners of Associates containing total equity reports for various months. Count one details the history of the scheme. The district court found that the government had proved a scheme beginning in August 1980, rather than in February 1980, and rejected the government\u2019s theory that Kuna had intended at the outset to defraud his investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The defendant argues that the district court\u2019s actions constitute a constructive amendment of the indictment. Defendant asserts that the indictment charged a scheme to obtain the investors\u2019 money by false pretenses but that the government proved a scheme to prevent the discovery of the false pretenses. The government argues that at most there existed a variance between the scheme alleged in the indictment, which was broad, and the scheme proven at trial, which was narrower. The government argues further that the variance was not fatal because it did not actually prejudice the defendant: Kuna was able to prepare a defense and was able to ensure that he will not again be prosecuted for the same offense because of the variance in this case. The indictment charged Kuna with a scheme embracing the mailings of the false reports which was the scheme the district court found to have been proven. Count one of the indictment alleged that Kuna \u201cwould and did convert assets of Associates to his own use and benefit ... and would and did conceal the financial condition of Associates by submitting and causing the submission of false information to the partners of associates.\u201d Indictment, U 4. The indictment also charged that Kuna \u201cwould and did cause financial reports to be sent to the partners of Associates from the office of Doherty Zable in Chicago. The false reports misrepresented the dollar value of Associates\u2019 assets at First Options.\u201d Indictment, 1114. Finally, the indictment charged that as of \u201cSeptember, 1980, defendant ... did not disclose to the partners of Associates that monthly total equity reports which he had caused to be sent them did not accurately state the financial condition of Associates.\u201d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">It does not surprise us that in construing the same set of facts the defendant cries \u201camendment,\u201d while the government murmurs \u201cvariance.\u201d While there exists only a \u201crather shadowy distinction\u201d between amendments and variances, C. Wright, Fed.Prac. &amp; Prox. Criminal \u00a7 516 (1982), a finding of one rather than the other achieves a crystal clear difference in result: \u201c[ajmendments have been held to be prejudicial <em>per se, </em>while variances may be subject to the harmless error rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Beeler, </em>587 F.2d 340, 342 (6th Cir.1978). Despite the defendant\u2019s strenuous efforts to depict this as an amendment ease, we think there was only a variance of the indictment at trial, and that this variance was harmless to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">In <em>United States v. Miller, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985), the Supreme Court neatly distinguished constructive amendments from variances: an amendment occurs when \u201cthe offense proved at trial was not fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>contained in the indictment, for trial evidence had \u2018 \u201camended\u201d \u2019 the indictment by <em>broadening </em>the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1816. A variance occurs where the trial evidence \u201cnarrowed the indictment\u2019s charges without adding any new offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Miller, </em>the defendant had been charged with defrauding his insurer both by consenting to the burglary in advance and by lying to the insurer about the value of his loss. The trial proof, however, focused only on Miller\u2019s inflation of his claims. The government moved to strike the part of the indictment that alleged knowledge of the burglary, alleging that even without this allegation the defendant still had violated \u00a7 1341. The entire indictment was sent to the jury, which found Miller guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The Supreme Court first noted that Miller could not have been surprised at trial by the absence of proof of alleged complicity in the burglary, and that the indictment was also sufficient to allow Miller to plead it in the future as a bar to subsequent prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1814. The Court also took special care to examine <em>Ex Parte Bain, </em>121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887), a case upon which Kuna heavily relies. The Court noted that <em>Bain </em>stands for two propositions: first, that \u201ca conviction cannot stand if based on a offense that is different from that alleged in the grand jury\u2019s indictment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 1818, and, second, that \u201cthe striking out of parts of an indictment invalidates the whole of the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first aspect of <em>Bain </em>has been approved in numerous cases, most principally in <em>United States v. Stirone, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), on which Kuna also relies. The Court concluded, however, that the first proposition did not support Miller because the offense for which Miller was convicted \u201cwas clearly and fully set out in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 105 S.Ct. at 1819. The Court explicitly rejected Bain\u2019s second proposition as inconsistent with \u201cprior legal understanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A narrowing of the indictment, therefore, does not constitute an amendment which renders the indictment void. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">In <em>Stirone </em>the Court found a constructive amendment of an indictment at trial. The indictment in <em>Stirone </em>charged the defendant with interference with the interstate importation <em>of </em>sand, while the evidence at trial showed the defendant interfered with the interstate exportation of steel. The Court held that this deprived the defendant of his \u201csubstantial right to be tied only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury,\u201d and that there was no way of knowing whether the grand jury would have been willing to charge the defendant with the exportation offense. <em>Id. </em>at p. 217, 80 S.Ct. at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">In a case preceding <em>Miller, </em>but essentially at one with its conclusion, this court construed <em>Stirone </em>and held that a constructive amendment is found where a \u201ccomplex set of facts\u201d is presented to the jury during the trial which is distinctly different from the set of facts set forth in the charging instrument. <em>United States v. Muelbl, </em>739 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (7th Cir. 1984). Alternatively, to find a constructive amendment the crime charged in the indictment must be \u201cmaterially different or substantially altered at trial, [so that] it is impossible to know whether the grand jury would have indicted for the crime actually proved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Muelbl </em>the defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute or possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine and methaqualone. The district court had instructed the jury to convict the defendant if they found that he was a member of a conspiracy to distribute any one of the three controlled substances. This court held that no constructive amendment occurred due to this instruction, reasoning that the grand jury must have found a conspiracy to distribute with respect to each of the drugs individually when they charged a conspiracy to distribute all the drugs collectively. The court reasoned that unlike <em>Stirone, </em>in which the evidence at trial proved a separate and unindicted act, no \u201ccomplex set of facts\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>had been proven at Muelbl\u2019s trial which differed from the conspiracy to distribute the drugs for which Muelbl had been indicted. This court concluded further that it was possible to know that the grand jury would have indicted on the proven conspiracy, since that conspiracy was a part of the larger indicted conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">There was no \u201ccomplex set of facts\u201d proven at Kuna\u2019s trial which differed from the facts charged in Kuna\u2019s indictment. While the indictment did charge that Kuna \u201cintended to devise\u201d a scheme to defraud Associates\u2019 investors, Indictment 113, and used the phrase \u201cwould and did\u201d throughout the indictment to describe Kuna\u2019s scheme, the indictment charged more. The indictment also charged Kuna with concealing financial information to Associates\u2019s partners and causing false financial statements to be sent to them. The scheme proven therefore was simply a narrower version of the scheme alleged. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985). We think this is sufficient to show that the scheme proven was included in the scheme charged and thus, under <em>Miller, </em>there was no amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Moreover, to the extent that a variance existed, we think it was a harmless error in this case. A variance between allegation and proof is not fatal unless the defendant has been thereby deprived of an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense or has been exposed to a risk of being prosecuted twice for the same offense. <em>Muelbl, </em>739 F.2d at 1181; <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>711 F.2d 789, 795 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 397, 78 L.Ed.2d 339 (1983). Neither of these infirmities is present in this case. Kuna was able to identify with great certainty the acts for which he was placed in jeopardy: the mailings of March through July for which he was acquitted, and the mailings of August through October for which he was convicted. Counts one through ten informed Kuna exactly what mailings were at issue, and paragraphs four, fourteen and eighteen of Count one charged that the monthly reports were false and part of a scheme to mislead investors. Kuna was able to prepare a defense comprising the whole period of time and was in fact successful in defending against the allegations regarding the first part of it. Moreover, the district court in this bench trial did not think that a different set of facts or different scheme had been proved. The court stated that \u201cbasically I believe the government has proved I think all of the paragraphs [of the indictment] describing the scheme.\u201d Tr. of Ruling at 4. Therefore, Kuna was able to anticipate the government\u2019s entire case and prepare his defense. The district court\u2019s verdict will protect Kuna against another prosecution for a scheme relating to both the period of time charged, and that proven at trial. We hold, therefore, that any variance was harmless, and reversal is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on either the mail fraud counts or the count involving the making of false statements to the SEC. We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Moreover, the district court\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3532, 82 L.Ed.2d 837 (1985); <em>United States v. Tallman, </em>437 F.2d 1103, 1104-05 (7th Cir.1971). We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s arguments on insufficiency and therefore treat them summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">The district court found that Kuna\u2019s trading was much riskier than that described in the offering memorandum, and that Kuna concealed his risky trading from Associates\u2019s partners by sending them false financial reports. The Judge further found that \u201cif the defendant had disclosed the correct financial information, the private investors would have conducted an investigation, would have learned that he had converted funds to his own use, would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>learned that he was trading more riskily than at least they perceived and as I perceive was described in the offering circular.\u201d Tr. of Ruling 2-3. The district court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence. Investors testified at trial that they had been lulled into a false sense of security by the monthly financial reports. The defendant presented no defense, but did stipulate to the exhibit displaying the disparity between the actual net liquidating balance and the monthly reports to the partners. The defendant\u2019s conviction therefore is supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The defendant also argues that insufficient evidence was introduced to prove that his application for registration as a broker-dealer with the SEC was false because he could have intended to register in his own name as a sole proprietor and engage in a business separate and independent of Associates\u2019s business. The defendant introduced no evidence at trial to support this theory. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal acknowledges that in his application to the SEC he stated that he had obtained his CBOE membership with his own funds, that all capital required to conduct his business would be furnished by them and that he would operate his business as a sole proprietor with all income accruing to him. It is undisputed that on the date of his application to the SEC, Kuna had already traded in his own name on the First Options account. The account contained the funds of the investors in Associates and profits from the fund were to accrue to the partners. The evidence shows therefore that Kuna\u2019s statements in his application that the capital, membership and profits belonged to him alone were proven to be false and we see nothing erroneous in the district court\u2019s finding of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The district court convicted Kuna on count fifteen, the false statement count, suspended his sentence and placed him on probation for five- years. As a condition of probation, the district court ordered Kuna to make restitution to the limited partners in the amount of $1,200,000, less any amounts already paid to them. The statute under which the probation was imposed provides that a defendant on probation may be required to make restitution \u201cto aggrieved parties for actual damages or losses caused by the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651. Kuna\u2019s false statement submitted to the SEC knowingly misstated that he intended to purchase his CBOE membership with his own funds, to operate his business as a sole proprietorship, and to furnish his own capital. This offense does not involve aggrieved parties to whom restitution can be made, nor does it involve actual damages or losses which can be restored to the aggrieved parties, because the investors, the only aggrieved parties in this lawsuit, were not injured by the filing of this false statement. Nor did the district court find that the injury and loss proven at trial was attributable to the false statements. In fact, the court's findings indicate that it thought the injury and loss was attributable to Kuna\u2019s risky trading. We therefore vacate the condition of probation and remand the case to the district court. In so far as the district court imposes a sentence consistent with the sanctions it originally intended to impose, and consistent with this opinion, the Double Jeopardy clause is not affected. <em>See United States v. Covelli, </em>738 F.2d 847, 862 (7th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>714 F.2d 689, 707 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">In conclusion, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction for the reasons stated above and we vacate the condition of probation and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-7\">.
