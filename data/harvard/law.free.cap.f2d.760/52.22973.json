The district court dismissed each of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Appellate jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-26\">The following facts are undisputed. Plaintiffs are warehousemen who were members of defendant Warehouse Employees Union Local 169 (\u201cLocal 169\u201d) and who were employed by defendant Perloff Brothers, Inc. (\u201cPerloff\u201d) at its Packer Avenue warehouse in Philadelphia. In December of' 1982 Perloff began to consolidate its business operations, including those of its wholly-owned subsidiary Alfred Lowry &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Brother, Inc. (\u201cLowry\u201d), into its Packer Avenue warehouse. Lowry had been located in Camden, New Jersey, and had employed members of defendant Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union Local 676 (\u201cLocal 676\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">A jurisdictional labor dispute arose with respect to Perloff s consolidated operations at the Packer Avenue warehouse. Subsequently, an agreement was reached between Perloff, Local 169, and Local 676 to submit the dispute to binding resolution before Teamsters Joint Council No. 53 (\u201cJoint Council\u201d). The Joint Council awarded jurisdiction over the warehouse to Local 676, and that decision was affirmed by the International Brotherhood of Ware-housemen and Teamsters (\u201cInternational\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Plaintiffs allege that, prior to the agreement among the defendants to submit the dispute to binding resolution, Local 676 \u201cthreatened violence, illegal strikes [and] other unfair labor practices.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint, 1112. They allege that it did so \u201cfor the purpose of coercing and inducing [Perloff] to unlawfully breach [a collective bargaining] agreement with plaintiffs and deprive them of job positions, seniority and other benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They further allege that Perloff, Local 676, and Local 169 \u201cconspire[d] to violate the rights due plaintiffs under the agreement by agreeing among themselves to unlawfully terminate plaintiffs\u2019 employment and arbitrarily award jurisdiction to [Local] 676 in violation of the agreement, depriving [plaintiffs] of their rightful job positions, seniority and other benefits.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint, II17.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Local 169 carried out the scheme to deprive them of their rights by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">(a) failing to exhaust grievance procedures under said contract between [Perloff] and [Local] 169;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">(b) failing to present at a hearing before Teamsters Council No. 53 ... and in a subsequent appeal ... to the International Brotherhood of Warehousemen and Teamsters the true factual situation which would have established violations of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and their entitlement to redress for said violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">(c) failing to seek judicial and injunctive relief for said violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">(d) failing to inform and deliberately misinforming plaintiffs of steps being taken to protect plaintiffs\u2019 rights, thereby depriving plaintiffs of the opportunity of pursuing other avenues to protect their rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint, 1116. Finally, plaintiffs allege that Perloff breached the collective bargaining agreement by terminating them and denying them the seniority and benefits to which they were entitled by virtue of their collective bargaining agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">II. Section 301 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">The district court cited <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2290, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), for the proposition that no section 301 recovery is available against either plaintiffs\u2019 union or their employer unless the union breached its duty of fair representation. The district court noted that a union breaches this duty if its acts are \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d 586 F.Supp. 456, 462 (quoting <em>Findley v. Jones Motor Freight, </em>639 F.2d 953, 957 (3d Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 190, 87 S.Ct. 903, 916, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967))). It then stated that \u201cplaintiffs have not alleged that the actions of the union were arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith, but rather state that the union\u2019s efforts on their behalf were inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court, therefore, dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 section 301 claims against both Local 169 and Perloff for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">As quoted above, however, plaintiffs did allege, among other things, that Local 169 conspired to violate their rights under the collective bargaining agreement, deliberately misinformed them of steps being taken to preserve their rights, and failed to present the true factual situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to the Teamsters Joint Council No. 53. our view, bad faith is implicit in these allegations. An overly restrictive reading of a complaint is inconsistent with the mandate that \u201cpleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(f); <em>Richardson v. Pennsylvania Department of Health, </em>561 F.2d 489, 492 (3d Cir.1977) (pleadings should be construed liberally). Thus, the district court committed legal error in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 section 301 claims for failure to allege bad faith. <em>See Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp, </em>561 F.2d 434, 444-46 (3d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978). In</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">Plaintiffs also argue that, even assuming their union did not breach its duty of fair representation, <em>DelCostello </em>does not require dismissal of the claim against Perloff because there are \u201c[n]o questions of exhausting remedies or the finality of binding arbitration.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 brief at 22. This argument was not addressed in the district court\u2019s opinion, and it is not clear whether it was presented to that court. Because this claim must be remanded, we will permit the district court to resolve this issue in the first instance. Furthermore, because it was not reached by the district court, we do not address defendants\u2019 alternative ground for affirmance that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">III. Section 303 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The district court held that plaintiffs were without standing to bring a section 303(b) claim against Local 676. Since the issue is a legal one, our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Section 303 in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiY\">Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason or [sic] [an unfair labor practice under section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)] may sue therefor in any district court of the United States ... and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF6\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187(b) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(D) in relevant part recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">It shall be an unfair labor practice ... to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person ... when ... an object thereof is ... forcing or requiring any employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization ... rather than to employees in another labor organization____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii)(D) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">At first blush, the language of section 303 does not appear to impose a standing requirement. Still, \u201c[e]very circuit considering the issue ... has flatly rejected [a] limitless interpretation of standing under section 303(b).\u201d <em>Charvet v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, </em>736 F.2d 1572, 1575 (D.C.Cir.1984). According to those courts, the requirement that any injury be \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged unfair labor practice imposes a standing requirement. <em>Id.; Fulton v. Plumbers and Steamfitters, </em>695 F.2d 402 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 273, 78 L.Ed.2d 254 (1983). <em>See W.J. Milner &amp; Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 349, </em>476 F.2d 8, 13 (5th Cir.1973) (Godbold, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">We agree that the \u201cby reason of\u201d language in section 303 contemplates a standing requirement. We would have preferred to say that the alleged violation of section 8(b)(4) must be the legal cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injury. However, since the case law has formulated the issue in terms of standing, we will employ that terminology in the interest of uniformity. <em>Cf. Bogosian, </em>561 F.2d at 447 n. 6. Under either formulation, the issue is whether plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">As the District of Columbia Circuit has noted, \u201c[t]he practical reasons justifying the view that section 303 imposes significant standing requirements are quite simple. Absent such requirements, unlimited liability ... might produce financial disaster for unions and inhibit the exercise of the right to strike,\u201d thus \u201c \u2018subverting] our national labor policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charvet, </em>736 F.2d at 1575 (quoting <em>Milner, </em>476 F.2d at 12 and <em>Fulton, </em>695 F.2d at 408). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>plain, therefore, \u201cthat some rational limiting standard was intended by Congress.\u201d <em>Milner, </em>476 F.2d at 13 (Godbold, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Plaintiffs argue, however, that they satisfy the section 303 standing requirement. A number of circuits have addressed the broad issue of whether employees ever have standing to sue under section 303, and those courts have reached conflicting conclusions. <em>E.g., compare Wells v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 181, </em>303 F.2d 73 (6th Cir.1962) (employees have standing) <em>with Fulton, </em>695 F.2d 402 (employees lack standing). The legislative history, at least to some degree, lends support to both views. On the one hand, it appears that Congress believed \u201cthe small employer, often with less than 50 employees, and the farmer or farm trucker\u201d were the \u201cmain victims\u201d of section 8(b)(4) violations. S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 54 (1947) (supplemental views), <em>reprinted in, </em>1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, at 460 (1948). On the other hand, in reference to section 8(b)(4) secondary boycotts, there is language indicating that Congress intended \u201cto protect genuinely neutral employers and their employees.\u201d S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 78, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 2318, 2382.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">An examination of the sequence of events alleged by plaintiffs, however, demonstrates that we need not resolve the broad question of whether employees ever have standing under section 303. The relevant allegations are as follows. Initially, in the course of a jurisdictional dispute, Local 676 engaged in conduct that violated section 8(b)(4). Subsequently, Local 676, Local 169, and Perloff, conspiring to arbitrarily assign jurisdiction over the plant to Local 676, settled the jurisdictional dispute. A hearing before the Joint Council and a subsequent appeal before the International were used by defendants as the vehicle to carry out their conspiracy. In these proceedings, defendant Local 169 deliberately failed to present the facts necessary to protect plaintiffs\u2019 rights. As a result, Local 676 received jurisdiction over the warehouse and plaintiffs were injured by the loss of their jobs, seniority, and other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We assume, without deciding, that employees may have section 303 standing under appropriate facts. In this case, however, plaintiffs\u2019 union entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the jurisdictional dispute that had given rise to Local 676\u2019s prior alleged violations of section 8(b)(4). That agreement operates as a superseding cause of any injury to plaintiffs that might otherwise have been caused, within the meaning of section 303, \u201cby reason of\u201d Local 676\u2019s alleged violations. Moreover, it is irrelevant for section 303 purposes that plaintiffs allege the agreement was really a conspiracy to deprive them of their rights. Assuming the truth of that allegation, plaintiffs\u2019 injury would be a result of the conspiracy and not \u201cby reason of\u201d the prior unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Since we have joined several other circuits in holding that the \u201cby reason of\u201d language imposes standing requirements, and since plaintiffs\u2019 claim as a matter of law does not satisfy this statutory requirement, it follows that plaintiffs have no standing to sue Local 676 pursuant to section 303. In other words, Local 676\u2019s alleged conduct was not the legal cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. In reaching this conclusion we find it unnecessary to determine what bearing, if any, cases construing section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1982) have on the interpretation of section 303. <em>See Fulton, </em>695 F.2d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">If plaintiffs did have standing to sue under section 303, the union that had arguably engaged in a violation of section 8(b)(4) in the course of a jurisdictional dispute would have little incentive thereafter to settle the dispute. This follows from the fact that, if a settlement were reached, the violating union would still be subject to section 303 liability. Any dissatisfied member of the competing union, by reaching back to the prior section 8(b)(4) violation, could recover from the violating union for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>injuries sustained as a consequence of the settlement. Such a result would be inconsistent with the general intent of Congress to promote industrial peace. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers, Local 1212, </em>364 U.S. 573, 577, 81 S.Ct. 330, 333, 56 L.Ed.2d 302 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Plaintiffs argue, in the alternative, that section 301 provides a basis for its claim against Local 676. However, Local 676 contends in its brief that this argument was not presented to the district court, and plaintiffs do not challenge that contention. Thus, we decline to consider this argument on appeal. <em>See Toyota Industrial Trucks U.S.A., Inc. v. Citizens National Bank of Evans City, </em>611 F.2d 465, 470 (3d Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated insofar as it holds that plaintiffs failed to state section 301 claims against Local 169 and Perloff. It will be affirmed insofar as it dismisses plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Local 676 for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The case will be remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. Judge Sloviter joins this opinion, finding nothing inconsistent in the concurring opinion of Judge Gibbons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b153-7\">GIBBONS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">I join in the judgment of the court. I write separately, however, to disassociate myself from any approving reference to the analysis made by the court which decided <em>Fulton v. Plumbers and Steamfitters, </em>695 F.2d 402 (9th Cir.1982). The district court, relying on <em>Fulton, </em>concluded that employees of the target of a secondary boycott could never have standing to sue under section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187 (1982), even if those employees could show an injury, separate from that of their employer, proximately caused by the violation. The <em>Fulton </em>court reasoned that the standing doctrines developed under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1982), should apply under the similarly-worded section 303, and that standing should be afforded only when the plaintiff is a member of a class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted. It suggested that the secondary boycott provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act were enacted solely for the protection of farmers and small businesses, not of their employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The <em>Fulton </em>approach to section 303 standing is entirely too mechanical. It is, moreover, inconsistent with the third circuit caselaw interpreting section 4 of the Clayton Act. <em>See International Association of Heat &amp; Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v. United Contractors Association, </em>483 F.2d 384, 397-98 (3d Cir. 1973) (Union members who can prove injury separate from that of their employer may recover under Clayton Act), <em>amended, </em>494 F.2d 1353 (3d Cir.1974); <em>Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, </em>552 F.2d 90, 99 (3d Cir.1977) (manufacturer\u2019s sales representative may seek Clayton Act recovery on account of restraints in distribution). Permitting employees to recover for illegal secondary activity if they can prove lost wages proximately caused by that activity involves no problem of duplicate recovery. Their employer obviously will not be permitted to recover wages which it did not pay, and the employees will not be permitted to recover profits lost by the employer. <em>Compare, e.g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977) (limiting Clayton Act standing to direct purchasers, not ultimate consumers, to avoid problems of duplicate recovery). Moreover there can be instances, and this is one, where the activity complained of will not proximately cause any injury to an employer. In such a situation the employees may be the victims with the largest incentive to sue to vindicate the policies of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">I agree, however, that in this case the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under section 303. That is so because, as Judge Seitz points out, the injury complained of was not proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>mately caused by the allegedly illegal secondary activity. Under both section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act and section 4 of the Clayton Act, a plaintiff seeking money damages must satisfy traditional tort law standards of proof of injury. <em>See Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 529-35, 103 S.Ct. 897, 904-07, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983). It does not advance the inquiry to couch proximate cause analysis in terms of standing. Indeed that slippery term is frequently used as a means of stating a result while refraining from making the analysis required to justify it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
