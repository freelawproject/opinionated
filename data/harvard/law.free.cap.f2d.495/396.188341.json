On January 15, 1973, the district court entered an order affirming the Secretary\u2019s position, and this appeal followed. We vacate and remand for further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"> The standard of review in cases of this nature is prescribed in \u00a7 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), as follows: \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d Under the law, the Secretary, not the courts, is charged with reconciling inconsistencies in the evidence. Thus, if his findings are supported by substantial evidence, his decision must be upheld. E. g., Underwood v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 850 (4th Cir. 1962). The courts are not to try the case de novo. At the same time, they must not abdicate their traditional functions; they cannot escape their duty to scrutinize the record as a whole to determine whether the conclusions reached are 'rational. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The'claimant filed an application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits on July 25, 1967. Her primary complaints concern pain and stiffness of the right arm, which began in January, 1967, and bad vision; additional complaints include recurrent neck pain, toxemia, and uncontrollable bowel movements. She has also complained of headaches, confusion and nervousness since about April, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The record contains the reports of nine physicians who have examined the claimant on various occasions. Each report contains a statement of the objective medical findings made by the examining physician. After<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> considering the record, the Appeals Council, on June 16, 1970, made a number of specific findings. Among them was the statement that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s impairments, individually and in combination, would not prevent her from performing light and sedentary work within the scope of her vocational training and experience.\u201d We find this assertion difficult to reconcile with Dr. Blum\u2019s conclusion that \u201cany type of occupation might be quite difficult when it involves bookkeeping, and reading or clerical work of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">When Dr. Blum, an ophthalmologist, examined the claimant, he found her vision to be 20/200 in each eye without glasses and only 20/80 with glasses. He also found that she was unable to use her eyes together properly because of a large strabismus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These medical findings are neither disputed nor contradicted by other medical evidence. Indeed, Dr. Goldberg\u2019s earlier examination tends to corroborate Dr. Blum\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The Appeals Council discounted these medical findings with the observation that the claimant\u2019s congenital visual impairment did not prevent her from doing clerical work or operating an automobile. This court, however, considers the decision of the Appeals Council to have been without foundation when it substituted its opinion for that of the ophthalmologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">On remand, the Secretary should conduct further inquiry <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>into Mrs. Oppen-heim\u2019s eye condition with a view to determining her ability to perform sustained work of a clerical nature. Dr. Blum states such work would be \u201cquite difficult.\u201d Accordingly, the scope of the inquiry should at least be directed toward determining the meaning of Dr. Blum\u2019s phrase, \u201cquite difficult,\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">At the same time, the Secretary should consider that the objective medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>cal facts in this record indicate the existence of a debilitating elbow condition which surgery has failed to cure; visual difficulties such as nearsightedness, strabismus, and congenital nystagmus; a sometimes severe gastrointestinal problem with a possibly psychogenic background; and recurrent neck pain, stemming from a 1961 auto accident, which occasionally necessitates use of traction and a cervical collar. The issue before the Appeals Council is not only the existence of these problems, but also their degree of severity, and whether, together, they impaired the claimant\u2019s \u201cability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Despite its assertion to the contrary, the report of the Appeals Council tends to fractionalize the several ailments and to treat each in isolation. On remand, we wish the Secretary to consider whether the combination of medical problems, both chronic and acute, impair the claimant\u2019s \u201cability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Other than Dr. Blum\u2019s statement, the only opinion evidence on this point is that of Dr. Lister who reported that he considered the claimant \u201cto be totally disabled from any form of gainful employment.\u201d This expert judgment is neither met nor contradicted by any other expert judgment. A physician\u2019s statement, of course, is not conclusive of the ultimate fact in issue, Mrs. Oppenheim\u2019s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. It does, however, reflect Dr. Lister\u2019s opinion of the severity of the claimant\u2019s various impairments and her ability to adapt to them. Dr. Lister has treated Mrs. Oppenheim since 1956. As we noted in Vitek v. Finch, 438 F.2d 1157, 1160 (4th Cir. 1971), \u201c[w]hile the Appeals Council is not bound by this assessment, this court has emphasized that the opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician is entitled to great weight, for it reflects an expert judgment based on a continuing observation of the patient\u2019s condition over a prolonged period of time.\u201d Accord, Underwood v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 850 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">It is not sufficient for the Secretary to say, as here, that the claimant suffers several physical impairments yet can do \u201clight and sedentary work within the scope of her vocational training and experience as an office manager, bookkeeper or office clerk.\u201d It must be shown medically that she can perform the physical activities those jobs require without serious aggravation to present physical impairment or to general health.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">.
