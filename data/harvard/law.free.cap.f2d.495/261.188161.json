Rose, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy (the Academy) was \u2014 at the time this complaint was filed \u2014 a third year student at the New York University Law School and a member of the Law Review. Together with other students and members of the Review, Rose has been conducting a survey of disciplinary systems at various Service Academies; the study is slated for publication in a forthcoming issue of the Review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to document discussion of the Academy\u2019s Honor and Ethics Codes, Rose asked the Academy in autumn 1971 to give him copies of ease summaries of Honor and Ethics Code adjudications, which were kept in the Academy\u2019s files. The Department of the Air Force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>refused on the ground that these summaries are exempted from compulsory-release by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), which permits an agency to withhold certain information to avoid unwarranted invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Rose joined with appellants Charles P. Diamond and Lawrence B. Pedowitz (who were then, respectively, the current and former Editor-in-Chief of the Review) in this lawsuit under the Act to compel disclosure of the disputed items \u201cwith personal references or other identifying information deleted . . .\u201d. Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted appellees (collectively the Agency) summary judgment on the issue of the case summaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although ultimately ruling against appellants, the judge agreed with them in large part. The Agency put forth two grounds in the district court to support its non-production of the documents: the Act\u2019s \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d exemption, referred to above, and the court\u2019s \u201cequitable discretion\u201d to deny disclosure. The judge rejected both arguments. However, he ruled for appellees on a third ground not advanced by them, that the summaries were covered by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) for an agency\u2019s internal rules and practices. Attacking the district court\u2019s order refusing them access to the summaries, appellants prosecute this appeal. We reverse and remand for further proceedings conforming with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">We begin by stressing that the Freedom of Information Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was passed in an effort to cure the defects of former section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964), which \u201cwas generally recognized as falling far short of its disclosure goals and came to be looked upon more as a withholding statute than a disclosure statute.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Courts have noted that the Act\u2019s remedial purpose was to pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny. See, e. g., Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, 467 F.2d 787, 791 (6th Cir. 1972); Bristol-Myers Co. v. FTC, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 424 F.2d 935, 938, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 46, 27 L.Ed.2d 52 (1970). They have accordingly held that exemptions must be narrowly construed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 823 (D.C.Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977, 94 S. Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974); Soucie v. David, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 448 F.2d 1067, 1080 (1971). This liberal reading of the Act\u2019s disclosure provisions is supported not only by legislative history but, more importantly, by the statutory language, as well. The Act mandates release of documents to \u201cany person\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(subject to explicitly defined exemptions) ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> grants to the district courts jurisdiction to enjoin improper withholding after a hearing \u201cde novo\u201d in which \u201cthe burden is on the agency to sustain its action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) (3); and further calls for disclosure \u201cexcept as <em>specifically </em>stated in this section.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With this background in mind, we turn to a discussion of the applicability of Exemption Two, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2), the provision thought by the district court to support the Agency\u2019s refusal to turn over the contested summaries to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">As already indicated, until the district court ruled none of the appellees had thought to rely on Exemption Two in refusing to turn over the case summaries. That section of the Act, see note 8 supra, shields from required disclosure all \u201cmatters that are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency .\u201d. In some instances, the scope of the exemption may be open to considerable doubt since the Senate and House Reports diametrically clash.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The former cites as examples of excluded material \u201crules as to personnel\u2019s use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.\u201d Senate Rep. 8. The latter, on the other hand, exempts from disclosure \u201c[ojperating rules, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>guidelines, and manuals of procedure for Government investigators or examiners\u201d but not \u201c \u2018matters of internal management\u2019 such as employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures. . . . \u201d House Rep. 10. 1966 U.S.Code Cong &amp; Admin. News p. 2427. The Senate Report is thought by many to comply with the statutory language better than the House Report, whose thrust is most frequently toward non-disclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This court has not yet taken a firm stand on the issue. Cf. Frankel v. SEC, 460 F.2d 813, 816 &amp; n. 5 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 889, 93 S.Ct. 125, 34 L.Ed.2d 146 (1972); Polymers, Inc. v. NLRB, 414 F.2d 999, 1006 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 570, 24 L.Ed.2d 502 (1970). We conclude, however, that the difference of approach between the House and Senate Reports would not affect the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">If we adopt the Senate construction of Exemption Two, case summaries of Hon- or and Ethics Code adjudications clearly fall outside its ambit. Such summaries have a substantial potential for public interest outside the Government. Appellants have drawn our attention to various items such as newspaper excerpts, a press conference by an Academy officer and a White House Press Release, which illustrate the extent of general concern with the working of the Cadet Honor Code. As the press conference and the Press Release show, some of the interest has been generated \u2014 or at least enhanced \u2014 by acts of the Government itself. Of course, even without such official encouragement, there would be interest in the treatment of cadets, whose education is publicly financed and who furnish a good portion of the country\u2019s future military leadership. Indeed, all sectors of our society, including the cadets themselves, have a stake in the fairness of any system that leads, in many instances, to the forced resignation of some cadets. The very study involved in this case bears additional witness to the degree of professional and academic interest in the Academy\u2019s student-run system of discipline. Moreover, as we later describe in greater detail, see Part III infra, the case summaries themselves have great impact on the lives and careers of subject cadets. Both of these factors \u2014 the legitimate public interest and the future effect on cadets \u2014 differentiate the summaries from matters of daily routine like working hours, which, in the words of Exemption Two, do relate <em>\u201csolely </em>to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Similarly, even the House Report, which is usually more agency-oriented, does not sanction withholding the summaries. As we have already noted, the House Report in this respect seems to permit greater disclosure of \u201cmatters of internal management,\u201d except where knowledge of administrative procedures might help outsiders to circumvent regulations or standards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Release of the summaries, which constitute quasi-legal records, poses no such danger to the effective operation of the Codes at the Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Speculating about a different kind of threat to the effectiveness of the Code, the Agency claims that publication of this material might gravely undermine the whole basis of the Honor Code system, whose proceedings are cloaked in confidentiality. The matter of confidentiality is further discussed in Part III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>infra. It is enough here to point out that appellants have sought only \u201csanitized\u201d versions of the ease summaries with names \u201cor other identifying information\u201d removed. In response to the redaction point, the Agency argues \u201cthat there is no way in which the total success of the deletion process can be guaranteed\u201d and that \u201cthe functioning of the Honor and Ethics Codes would be seriously impaired even if inadvertent disclosure is a mere possibility.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But \u201ctotal success\u201d \u2014 in editing, as in anything else \u2014 is an impossible standard and surely not one imposed by a statute based upon a general philosophy of full agency disclosure to the public. Given this policy, as well as the injunction to construe exceptions to the Act strictly, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c), we think it clear that the Agency\u2019s withholding of the case summaries (as edited to preserve anonymity) cannot be upheld by reliance on the second exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Agency also argues that the summaries sought by appellants fall within the purview of Exemption Six of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), which covers \u201cpersonnel and .medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy .\u201d As already indicated, Judge MacMahon did not agree with appellees on this point, but they renew their argument in this court. On its face, Exemption Six appears relevant; we are dealing here with \u201cpersonnel\u201d or \u201csimilar files.\u201d But the key words, of course, are \u201ca clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d a wholly conclusory phrase, which requires a court to apply the statutory standard without any definite guidelines. Under these circumstances, precedent lends only marginal aid. Each case involves an essentially unique investigation into the nature of the privacy interest invaded and the extent of the proposed invasion, viewed in the light of contemporary mores and sensibilities as applied to the particular facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The data pertinent to our inquiry concern the characteristics and use of the Honor and Ethics Code case summaries. These, the Agency tells us, are extracts of the significant facts in each case heard by the Honor Committee and in some important cases heard by the Ethics Committee. (The Ethics program is administered more informally.) As a matter of custom and procedure, information regarding such cases is required to be held in the strictest confidence. The summaries are, however, posted in the forty squadrons and, upon their official release, Honor Representatives are permitted to discuss any feature of the cases with the cadets for their education. The documents are also distributed to Academy personnel who have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d (In not guilty or so-called \u201cdiscretion\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> cases the name of the accused is deleted; in guilty cases it is not.) Therefore, in practice, the curtain of confidentiality appears to shield these records from the glare of external publicity but not from the eyes of present cadets \u2014 and future ones, who can read the summaries of past proceedings in the Honor and Ethics Code reading files.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">These being the facts, one might ask in what way release of the summaries\u2014 with names omitted \u2014 could increase the potential for invading the privacy of affected cadets. To be sure, some cases might be recognized by readers of the Law Review article even in the absence of names, by virtue of the circumstances alone. However, it can be argued, only current and former cadets and Academy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>officials possess the frame of reference which would enable them to reconstruct the incidents described in the summaries, for only they had had access to these records originally. Under these conditions, one might conclude that disclosure of the summaries poses no greater threat to privacy than the Academy itself countenanced through limited distribution and official posting of the items, and that it therefore constitutes no \u201cinvasion\u201d at all. This reasoning was substantially the basis of the district court ruling that Exemption Six did not bar disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This approach, however, ignores certain practical realities. First, a person\u2019s privacy may be as effectively infringed by reviving dormant memories as by imparting new information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. Prosser on Torts 827-28 (4th ed. 1971). For example, a senior officer and ex-cadet might, upon reading a summary or a reference to it, realize for the first time that a man under his command had once been the subject of Academy discipline. It would be cold comfort to the junior officer to be told that his chief had always \u201cknown\u201d this fact anyway, although he had long forgotten it or had never made the ultimate connection among various bits of knowledge until the article jogged his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Then, too, publication of even anonymous summaries could expose the histories of formerly accused cadets to persons other than Air Force officers. Despite the continuing injunction of secrecy, no one can guarantee that all those who are \u201cin the know\u201d will hold their tongues, particularly years later when time may have eroded the fabric of cadet loyalty. Finally, we must remember that none of the parties to this lawsuit is committed first and foremost to the interests of affected cadets. It is no slur on appellees to note that they are primarily defending the integrity of their own procedures while appellants, of course, are pressing for disclosure. In these circumstances, we will not hold that the Agency\u2019s internal dissemination of the summaries lessens the concerned cadets\u2019 right to privacy, as embodied in Exemption Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">However, while release of even nameless case histories might constitute an \u201cinvasion\u201d of protected interests, the inquiry does not end there. The statute requires the Agency to show that the invasion is \u201cunwarranted\u201d \u2014 indeed, that it is \u201cclearly\u201d so. The only opinion at all in point, Getman v. NLRB, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 450 F.2d 670 (1971), held that law professors engaged in an NLRB voting study could compel that agency to provide them with names and addresses of eligible employee voters since disclosure would not entail an impermissible intrusion into privacy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But <em>Getman </em>was a much stronger case for plaintiffs than ours since release of the desired information would subject the employees named to nothing more than a telephone request to submit to a voluntary interview. 450 F.2d at 674-675. Here, by contrast, identification of disciplined cadets \u2014 a possible consequence of even anonymous disclosure \u2014 \u2022 could expose the formerly accused men to lifelong, embarrassment, perhaps disgrace, as well as practical disabilities, such as loss of employment or friends. Viewing this potential for serious harm from the perspective of our society\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>panding concern for the protection of privacy, cf. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), we refuse to hold that appellees must now, without any prior inspection by a court, turn over the summaries to appellants with only the proper names removed. Such a procedure \u2014 posing, as it does, grave risks to the reputations of affected cadets \u2014 might \u201cconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In order to keep faith with the Act\u2019s overall mandate, however, we equally decline to hold at this time that Exemption Six covers all, or any part of, the summaries in issue. Rather, we follow appellants\u2019 alternative suggestion and remand with instructions to the district court to conduct an in camera inspection of the Honor and Ethics Code case histories, which it has never examined. Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, 467 F.2d 787 (6th Cir. 1972); Soucie v. David, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 448 F.2d 1067 (1971); Bristol-Myers Co. v. FTC, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 424 F.2d 935, cert, denied, 400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 46, 27 L. Ed.2d 52 (1970). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3), see note 9 supra, the \u201cburden\u201d was on the Agency \u201cto sustain its action\u201d in failing to make the case summaries available. Having failed to carry that burden of justification under Exemption Six in the trial court by means of affidavits or testimony, the Agency must now produce the summaries themselves in court, Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.\u00a7. 73, 93, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), and cooperate with the judge in redacting the records so as to delete personal ref-erenees and all other identifying information. Cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The practice of furnishing abstracts of cases, while preserving anonymity, is not unknown to the law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We think it highly likely that the combined skills of court and Agency, applied to the summaries,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> will yield edited documents sufficient for the purpose sought and sufficient as well to safeguard affected persons in their legitimate claims of privacy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">We cannot close this section of the opinion without one further comment. We have read out brother Moore\u2019s dissent with a sense of wonderment, since it states that we place our \u201cstamp of approval upon\u201d an \u201cegregious invasion of constitutional rights of privacy.\u201d We, of course, do no such thing. We have refused to hold, in the second paragraph before this one, that the Agency is required, without any prior inspection by a court, to turn over the summaries to appellants with only the proper names removed. In addition, we have stated immediately above that personal references and all other identifying information should be deleted from the case summaries. If, in the opinion of the district judge, this is not sufficient to safeguard privacy, then the summaries should not be disclosed to appellants. Obviously, the problem would be a simple one if the Freedom of Information Act did not exist or if the only interest to be considered were that of the cadets. But construing Exemption Six is a much more complex process than is indicated by the dissent which fails to refer to the legislative history of the Act, the policy behind it or the cases construing it. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>any event, we believe that the in camera procedure required here will further the statutory goal of Exemption Six: a workable compromise between individual rights \u201cand the preservation of public rights to Government information.\u201d House Rep. 11, 1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 2428 <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">As a final point, the Agency contends that the courts have a broad equitable power to decline to order release when disclosure would damage the public interest, and urges that we exercise this jurisdiction to withhold the summaries completely. Judge MacMahon rejected this argument, holding that Congress did not leave to the courts a general option of refusing to enforce the Act\u2019s requirement of disclosure even though no statutory exemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\"> Much ink has been spilled on this issue, both by courts and commentators, and we are told that the legislative history is indeterminate<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that the appellate decisions are divided.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We are not sure how real the conflict is in most instances, since even the courts that are cited as opposing the notion of general equity power to refuse disclosure recognize that a truly exceptional case might require it. Tennessean Newspapers, Inc. v. Federal Housing Administration, 464 F.2d 657, 662 (6th Cir. 1972); Soucie v. David, 145 U.S. App.D.C. 144, 448 F.2d 1067,1077 (1971). It may be that the true controversy is over the definition of an exceptional case, since we are clear that generally the Act constrains the use of broad judicial discretion to <em>block </em>disclosure. Cf. Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974) (dictum \u2014 broad equitable power to enforce the Act). In any event, in the context of Exemption Six the issue is not a substantial one, since the language of the exemption requires a court to exercise a large measure of discretion. This was pointed out by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a court frequently cited for the view that the federal courts have no general equitable jurisdiction to refuse disclosure when no exemption applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">\u201cAny discretionary balancing of competing interests will necessarily be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to give agencies, and courts as well, definitive guidelines in setting information policies. . . . But Exemption (6), by its explicit language, calls for such balancing and must therefore be viewed as an exception to the general thrust of the Act. S.Rep., at 9, explains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 enunciates a policy that will involve a balancing of interests between the protection of an individual\u2019s private af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fairs from unnecessary public scrutiny, and the preservation of the public\u2019s right to governmental information. The application of this policy should lend itself particularly to those Government agencies where persons are required to submit vast amounts of personal data usually for limited purposes. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">We note in passing that no other exemption specifically requires balancing. In view of the Act\u2019s basic purpose to limit discretion and encourage disclosure, we believe that Exemption (6) should be treated as unique, and that equitable discretion should not be imported into any of the other exemptions. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Getman v.

While this case was under advisement, we asked the parties to brief the question of mootness, in view of the possibility that publication of plaintiffs\u2019 article would moot the issue. In their response, both sides affirmed their belief that the matter of disclosure of the case summaries was still properly before us. We agreed with this conclusion and therefore proceeded to consider the case on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-8\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AhbM\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"AOP\">I must express a most vigorous dissent to the majority\u2019s judicial stamp of approval upon the egregious invasion of constitutional rights of privacy which their opinion authorizes. At a time when the courts are more and more being called upon to protect an individual\u2019s character from being unnecessarily besmirched, when much is being said and written about prison rehabilitation, I am amazed that any court should countenance \u2014 much less authorize \u2014 the curiosity satisfying efforts of three law school students who, merely to write a Law Review note, would pry into and seek to disclose the former transgressions of Air Force cadets. This is not a case in which the courts can attempt to justify their interposition on the theory that Congress has failed to act and that, therefore, the courts must legislate. Here there is a definite statute of prohibition which the majority now overrides.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">When an Air Force cadet is accused of lying, stealing or cheating at the Academy, he is protected by the greatest possible confidentiality. This may arise in part from the fact that this charge has been made possible by the principle of toleration which in grammar schoolyard parlance means \u201ctattletale\u201d or as phrased in the record as \u201cThe backbone of the Honor Code is the toleration clause which requires that every cadet report any suspected violation of the Code\u201d (App. 120). Thus, not only must the cadet be protected but also the non-tolerator (tattler).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">The hearings, as would be expected, are as sacrosanct as are (or should be) jury room proceedings, namely, \u201call matters discussed at the hearing are confidential and should not be discussed outside the room with anyone other than an Honor Representative\u201d (App. 164-65). The summaries of each case are kept confidentially restricted except in a small area.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">In passing the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, Congress carefully and specifically excluded from public gaze:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">If doctor-patient files are protected, how much the more should files dealing with quasi-criminal or possible charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ter-besmirching facts to be kept secret. The disclosure of disease, be it venereal or mental, can be remedied or cured. The drawing of a bar sinister across the escutcheon of a young man entering upon his life\u2019s career, cannot be erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Air Force officials, mindful of their duty to protect their cadets, responded in a manner which should have received the highest judicial commendation instead of disapproval. The Academy\u2019s Honor and Ethics Executive, in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 request for the case summaries, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">I regret that Academy policy requires denial of public access to honor case files, including selected ones in the Honor Code Reading Files. All of these cases are documented as \u2018For Official Use Only\u2019 and are disseminated for internal use only to the Honor Representatives and those few staff personnel who have a continuing need to understand the workings of the Cadet Honor Code. It would be in poor faith with all cadets who have met honor hearings to allow their cases to come into the public eye. To permit the use of honor cases for such purpose would tend to set a precedent that may operate to the detriment of innocent persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">To be accused or found guilty of an honor violation is an emotionally trying experience that should, in due respect for the rights of the individual concerned, be as limited as possible. Society in general does not understand the difference in the lying, cheating and stealing that constitutes a Cadet Honor violation as opposed to the degree of criminality required in society at large to cause an equally serious type of censor [sic: censure]. The problems of such misunderstanding and the unnecessary embarrassment that could result seems to exceed the value to be gained from making the case files available to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZz\">In denying the request, the Commandant of Cadets stated (App. 30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">The Air Force Academy will be unable to provide you sample ethics cases. The sample ethics cases used in the Honor Code Reading File are designated \u2018For Official Use Only\u2019. It is intended that these cases will be used for the edification of the Cadet Wing and Academy staff only. Indiscriminate release of this information to persons without a need to know could be counter to the best interest of the individuals concerned and the Air Force Academy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">When the request reached the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, the futility of any attempted deletion was pointed out in the statement (App. 35):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">A release of the honor hearing eases and ethics cases would constitute an unwarranted invasion into the privacy of former cadets of the Academy. Some cases may be recognized by the reader by the circumstances alone without the identity of the cadet given. This being the case then the reader could easily connect the incident with the particular cadet involved. Additionally, they are internal documents which are not meant for mass circulation. They are stamped \u2018For Official Use Only\u2019 and are afforded subscribed routing and handling procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The reasons for confidentiality and non-disclosure cannot be better summarized than by the Commandant\u2019s Executive for Honor and Ethics, who stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">There is no way of determining just how these facts will or could be used. This data could find its way to the relatives, friends and classmates of cadets and supply the missing link in disclosing the identity of a guilty cadet. No person who has made a mistake and been punished should have to have this mistake follow him for the rest of his life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">And, indeed, merely to satisfy the desire of plaintiffs to write a Law Review note, no court should aid and abet a project which could result in having a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cadet\u2019s \u201cmistake follow him for the rest of his life.\u201d (App. 211a).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Deletion of names suggested by the majority would be of no avail. In addition to names, identifiable facts would have to be eliminated. Eliminating all determinative essentials would only create a hypothetical situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">As the Commandant of Cadets so logically explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">The use of these case files or write-ups, even if the identity of the individual were not given, could still be an invasion of privacy as the incident may have been so notorious that the reader would immediately recognize the cadet who was the subject of the Honor or Ethics Hearing. In certain instances, the Cadet Wing has given the Honor Committee the prerogative to grant discretion to a cadet who has been voted guilty and to allow him to return to the Cadet Wing. The man who has learned his life-long lesson of honor can be a great asset to the Wing and to the Air Force. His retention is therefore not only justified; it is desired. . . . Therefore, every effort is made to avoid disclosure of the cadet\u2019s name so that he may return to the Wing unblemished to continue his education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The majority recognize that their decision even with anonymous disclosure \u201ccould expose the formerly accused men to lifelong embarrassment, perhaps disgrace, as well as practical disabilities, such as loss of employment or friends.\u201d These accused cadets are the real parties in interest; yet, as the majority concedes, \u201cnone of the parties to this lawsuit is committed first and foremost to tlie interests of affected cadets.\u201d Even the unborn child is in many situations entitled to his (or her) guardian <em>ad li-tem </em>and Gideon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was deemed to be entitled to be heard through counsel. But accused cadets are to be subjected to possible lifelong disgrace or loss of employment without any spokesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Of course, Congress never intended any such result. Nor does the Act so decree. Lest any implication to this effect might be gleaned therefrom, Congress wrote therein a specific prohibition against an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Consider briefly the majority\u2019s suggested protection against \u201cthis potential for serious harm\u201d. First, the Air Force must remove from all case summaries, estimated in open court as involving one hundred to two hundred summaries, all proper names. Then these nameless but not factless summaries are to be turned over to the District Court. There the majority are sure that \u201cthe combined skills of court and Agency, * * * will yield edited documents * * * sufficient * * * to safeguard affected persons in their legitimate claims of privacy.\u201d But for what purpose and at what cost? The purpose is clear, i. e., to have the Air Force and the District Court co-author a student contribution to a legal periodical. Time cost is another matter. Assuming only one hundred and fifty summaries, vital name excision should be capable of accomplishment in ten minutes per summary \u2014 an inconsequential twenty-five hours. However, careful Court editing to eliminate identifying facts would be much more time-consuming. Seventy-five hours of Court time would be conservative. In these days when there is so much clamor about the desirability of speedy trials, I am unwilling to subscribe to, or acquiesce in, any opinion which saddles such a needless burden upon an important branch of our military forces and, in my opinion, an equally important judicial branch. Hence, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-14\">. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 325, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
