The ordinance defines, requires a city permit for, regulates, and restricts abortion clinics. The district court abstained. We reach the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>and hold the ordinance to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">The ordinance in question which is set out in full as Appendix A of this opinion, attempts to regulate any public place wherein abortions are performed with the exception of public hospitals. Abortions as defined by the ordinance include \u201cthe termination of human pregnancy * * * except those found on advice of a licensed physician to be necessary to preserve the life of the mother.\u201d The penalty for noncompliance constitutes a misdemeanor carrying a fine of from $250 to $500 or 90 days imprisonment or both. See Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">The plaintiff-appellants are Dr. Parker H. Word, M. D., a practicing St. Louis, Missouri physician and Reproductive Health Services, Incorporated, a non-profit medical service corporation existing under the laws of Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">United States District Judge Regan invoked the doctrine of abstention and dismissed the case without prejudice urging that \u201cplaintiffs should institute and prosecute in the state courts an appropriate proceeding respecting the validity of the ordinance on state as well as federal grounds.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">On October 17, 1973 this court granted appellants\u2019 motion for injunction pending appeal and expedited the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">\n<em>Abstention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-10\">It is now clear from the decisions in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973) that a sweeping regulation of the abortion decision and its implementation raises clear questions of constitutional dimension regarding a medical doctor\u2019s right to practice. Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>at 188, 93 S.Ct. 739; Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>at 165 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 705. <em>See also </em>Nyberg v. City of Virginia, 495 F.2d 1342 (CA8 1974) also decided today. Abstention would serve no valid purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">This is not one of those \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d where the federal courts need refrain from ruling on federal constitutional claims. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437-439, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971); Zwiclder v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L. Ed.2d 444 (1967); Hathaway v. Worcester City Hospital, 475 F.2d 701, 705 (CA1 1973). The issue in this ease relates to the facial constitutionality of the St. Louis city ordinance when viewed against the backdrop now available in the <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>decisions. That determination can be made on the record before us. We choose to make that determination. <em>See, </em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, <em>supra </em>at 439 of 400 U.S., 91 S.Ct. 507; Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375-379, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">\n<em>The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">i [2, 3] A careful reading of the United States Supreme Court decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> establishes the following broad bases for our decision in this case (and in Nyberg v. City of Virginia, 495 F.2d 1342, also decided today):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-14\">(1) The \u201cfundamental\u201d right of privacy includes the abortion decision. Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>153-156 [of 410 U.S.], 93 S.Ct. 705.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-15\">(2) Even so, no woman has a right to an abortion \u201cat whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses;\u201d there is no right to abortion on demand. Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>at 153, 93 S.Ct. at 727; Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>at 189 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 739.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-16\">(3) The state interest in protecting the health of the pregnant woman and the separate interest of protecting potential human life become compelling at certain points in the pregnancy term (at the end of the first and second trimesters respectively) then and there affording the state the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>nity to reasonably regulate the abortion procedure. Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>162-164 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 705; Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>194-195 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 739.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-5\">(4) The state regulation must be reasonably and legitimately related to the recognized state interests set out above. Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>162-166 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 705; Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>194-195 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 739.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-6\">(5) Prior to the compelling points (during the first trimester of the pregnancy term) the abortion decision and its effectuation is \u201cinherently, and primarily a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician.\u201d Roe v. Wade, <em>supra </em>at 166 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. at 733. <em>See also </em>Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>192-200 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 739.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARh\">The city ordinance in question here reflects no recognition of the fundamental rights involved and the commensurate restrictions on state action. Neither are we cited to any persuasive data convincing us that the stringent regulatory measures in the act are necessary to protect either the state\u2019s interest in maternal health or future life. No other medical procedures or surgical operations are cited to us where the city or state regulates at the peril of criminal sanctio\u2019ns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-8\">We hold that St. Louis city ordinance No. 56579 is, by reason of its failure to exclude the first trimester of pregnancy, an invalid and overbroad enactment infringing unreasonably upon fundamental rights. <em>Doe </em>and <em>Roe, both supra; </em>Nyberg v. City of Virginia, 495 F.2d 1342 (CA8 1974) also decided today. It is additionally invalid because its stringent requirements are not legitimately related to recognized objectives of the state to protect maternal health and potential human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">Appellee argues that this result is not warranted since the ordinance here does not prohibit abortion but merely regulates the \u201cpersons, conditions and procedures under which abortions are to be performed.\u201d While we agree with ap-pellee that the ordinance does not proscribe abortions, we do not agree that that fact, of itself, removes the ordinance from the constitutional realm of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe. </em>The <em>Doe </em>decision clearly struck down portions of the Georgia statute governing abortion procedures. Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>192-200 of 410 U. S., 93 S.Ct. 739. We learn from <em>Doe </em>that sweeping regulation of the abortion procedure without regard for the conflicting interests involved will not withstand constitutional scrutiny. <em>Accord, Nyberg, supra </em>and citations (at 1345 of 495 F.2d) also decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">Viewed another way, there is reason to strike down this ordinance. The ordinance seeks to protect interests that are already adequately protected by (1) the physician\u2019s medical judgment and professional, ethical standards and (2) the city and state health regulations which are in effect and which have application to clinical procedures in general. The extra layer of regulation which this ordinance imposes becomes unreasonably burdensome of the patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">The ordinance requires that any clinic seeking to perform abortions for a reason other than to preserve the mother\u2019s life must obtain a permit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To obtain the permit the applicant must disclose, among other things, what he has done for the last five years; the names of all physicians who will use the facilities to perform abortions; names of all nurses; training and past experience of the applicant ; description of the facilities; fees to be charged; plat showing dimensions of the premises, and; working agreement with the hospital. We think that this myriad of requirements is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>duly restrictive of a physician\u2019s right to administer his judgment as to an operation that is now established to be, within the first trimester of pregnancy, safer than childbirth. We are referred to no other single surgical procedure where doctors are required to \u201cprove up\u201d their overall fitness as they are here. As the court states in Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>at 199 of 410 U.S., at 751 of 93 S.Ct.: \u201cIf a physician is licensed by the State, he is recognized by the State as capable of exercising acceptable clinical judgment.\u201d To single out physicians and their patients who seek abortions and subject them to this ordinance\u2019s overview substantially limits the physician\u2019s right to practice and the patient\u2019s right to her doctor\u2019s independent judgment. Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>at 197, 93 S.Ct. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">The abortion clinic permit is subject to restrictions, among others, that the facilities should be kept clean; that the Health Commissioner shall inspect and certify that sanitation standards are up to par with those applicable to clinics in general, and; that the clinic shall comply with all laws and local ordinances relating to health, sanitation and safety. These restrictions accomplish nothing not already accomplished by the health regulations in force and to which the ordinance itself refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">In short, viewing the ordinance as a whole, its requirements are not based upon differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the act in which they are found. Morey v. Doud, 354 U.S. 457, 465, 77 S.Ct. 1344, 1 L.Ed.2d 1485 (1957); Doe v. Bolton, <em>supra </em>at 194 of 410 U.S., 93 S.Ct. 739. The restrictions of the instant regulation do not stand up as legitimate and reasonable for the protection of recognized state interests in maternal health and potential human life. The Supreme Court stated in Roe v. Wade: \u201cThe State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, <em>like any other medical procedure, </em>is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient.\u201d 410 U.S. 113, 149-150, 93 S.Ct. 705, 725 (emphasis supplied). The ordinance at issue here tenders a cumbersome procedural overview on abortion only. State interests are not served and private rights are usurped. Compare Cleveland Bd. of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct, 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">Just as the procedural requirements of the Georgia statute in Doe v. Bolton the overview imposed by this ordinance cannot withstand constitutional examination. Because we cannot say that this extra layer of restriction placed upon abortion is legitimately related to the recognized objectives of state regulation and further, because the ordinance employs limitations that unduly penalize those patients who seek and those doctors who choose to perform abortions, we find it necessary to strike down ordinance No. 56579 in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">We find it unnecessary to grant in-junctive relief, for we assume city officials will give full credence to this decision that the ordinance in question is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of an order declaring the city ordinance unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-12\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Ordinance 56579</p>\n<p id=\"ary-dedup-0\">(Sub.

No abortion clinic shall perform an abortion upon any female person under the age of twenty-one years of age, unless the written consent to said abortion shall be obtained from either the husband, one of the natural parents or legal guardian of said female person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">Section Six.

The insurance policy required hereunder shall contain a provision for a continuing liability thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery thereon, that the liability of the insurer shall not be affected by the insolvency or the bankruptcy of the insured. Every insurance policy required hereunder shall extend for the period to be covered by the permit applied for and the insurer shall be obliged to give written notice to the Director of Health and Hospitals and to the insured before any cancellation or termination thereof earlier than its expiration date and the cancellation or other termination of any such policy shall automatically revoke and terminate the permit hereunder until another policy of insurance complying with the terms hereof shall have been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-14\">F.
