They were all denied Youth Corrections Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentences, and received twenty years to life on the murder counts, and lesser, concurrent, sentences for the other convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the felony murder and armed robbery convictions, and vacate the assault with a deadly weapon convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also reverse Stevens\u2019 sentence, and hold in abeyance the contentions of Branic and Baskerville with respect to the trial court\u2019s refusal to impose youth sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">The evidence showed that appellants entered a jewelry store, and while Bas-kerville stood guard, Branic and Stevens forced both proprietors \u2014 one of whom was the seventy-five year old father of the other \u2014 into a back room. Both men were handcuffed and instructed to lie on the floor. The younger man asked if his father could sit on a chair because of his age, but was told to \u201cshut up.\u201d Adhesive tape was then wrapped around the victims\u2019 months. The son was still able to speak, and tried, in Hungarian, to calm his father. In response, one of the robbers removed the tape from the son\u2019s mouth, stuffed the son\u2019s handkerchief in his mouth, and replaced the tape. Appellants then took approximately $4000 in merchandise and cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">Shortly after the robbers fled, the younger proprietor ran to a neighboring store for help. He returned to assist his father, but was unable to remove his handcuffs. The police arrived and also attempted unsuccessfully to remove the father\u2019s cuffs. During this effort the father became pale and began to perspire. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-14\">Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that the trial court\u2019s instructions on felony murder were deficient in so far as they did not require the jury to find that death was a foreseeable result of appellants\u2019 behavior. Relying on People v. Stamp, 2 Cal.App.3d 203, 82 Cal.Rptr. 598 (1970), the court instructed the jury that they had to find that appellants committed \u201can unlawful act which proximately caused th[e] death,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he proximate cause of death is that cause which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the death, and without which the result would not have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-15\">The D.C.Code felony murder statute requires that a homicide committed during a felony be done \u201cpurposely\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>unless the felony is \u201carson, rape, mayhem, robbery, or kidnapping,\u201d in which case the homicide may be committed \u201cwithout purpose so to do.\u201d 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401. We have previously<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indicated that by eliminating the element of \u201cpurpose\u201d with respect to these five serious felonies, Congress intended to apply the common law felony murder rule to them<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 that is, that a homicide committed in the course of their perpetration is murder because the \u201cmalice\u201d required for murder can be <em>implied </em>from the commission of the felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The doctrine of implied malice obviates the need for the government to prove that death was \u201cforeseeable\u201d when the homicide occurs during any of these five specified felonies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, nothing in the court\u2019s instruction warrants reversal of appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\"> Appellants Branic and Stevens challenge the admission into evidence of their line-up identifications. We have viewed the pictures of the line-up, and find that the line-up was not suggestive. Relying on Spriggs v. Wilson, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 177, 419 F.2d 759 (1969), and United States v. Allen, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 84, 408 F.2d 1287 (1969), appellants also contend that the line-up identifications were inadmissible because the police refused their counsels\u2019 request for any descriptions which had previously been provided by witnesses viewing the lineup.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not in agreement as to whether the police were required to give such identifications. We do agree, however, that the refusal in this case was harmless since the line-up was not suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">Baskerville attacks a tentative ruling by the trial court to the effect that <em>if </em>he testified, the prosecutor <em>might </em>be allowed to impeach him with a prior statement he gave to the police in which he denied participation in the instant offense, admitted committing another robbery, and claimed that Branic and Stevens told him that they had committed the instant offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court diligently tried to keep out evidence of the \u201cother\u201d robbery because of its potentially prejudicial impact, but felt that if Baskerville testified the prior statement might be admissible because the two offenses were so highly related.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We need not decide \u2014 solely on the basis of speculation as to what appellant might have said \u2014 whether, or to what extent, the prior statement could be admitted since the court\u2019s tentative ruling did not influence appellant\u2019s decision not to testify. Counsel for Baskerville, at the urging of co-counsel and appellant himself, advised the court that \u201c[i]n view of all the circumstances, it is the consensus . . . that Mr. Baskerville will not take the stand.\u201d So far as the record indicates these \u201ccircumstances\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>did not include the court\u2019s ruling that the prior statement might be admissible for impeachment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">Appellant Stevens \u2014 who was twenty-one years old at the time of the jury verdict \u2014 was not considered for youth sentencing because he was twenty-two at the time' he was sentenced. The Youth Act defines a \u201cyouth offender\u201d as \u201ca person under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction,\u201d and defines \u201cconviction\u201d as \u201cthe <em>judgment </em>on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contend-ere.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(e), (h) (emphasis supplied). However, for the reasons given by Judge Youngdahl in United States v. Carter, 225 F.Supp. 566 (D.C. D.C.1964), we reject a formalistic reading of the statute and hold that \u201cfor purposes of determining whether a defendant qualifies as a \u2018youth offender,\u2019 the time of \u2018conviction\u2019 is the time the verdict is returned or a plea of guilty is taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567. Thus, we remand Stevens\u2019 case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Branic and Baskerville claim that the trial court\u2019s reasons for denying youth treatment were insufficient. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in Dorszynski v. United States, 414 U.S. 1091, 94 S.Ct. 721, 38 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973), to decide whether the sentencing judge need give reasons when he denies youth treatment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sound judicial administration requires that we withhold consideration of appellants\u2019 claims until the Supreme Court has acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1132-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"avd-dedup-0\">.
