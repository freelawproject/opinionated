Mitchell appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of the several contentions raised on appeal, we conclude that the district court erroneously failed to instruct the jury in two respects and that at least one of the errors, constituted reversible error. We reverse the judgment entered on the conviction and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">For the tax year in question, defendant was employed as a policeman for Arlington County, Virginia. In addition, he had part-time employment as a security guard or a security guard supervisor for the Pomponio Corporations (Pomponio), World Instruction and Translation, Inc., and R &amp; R Ties, Inc., three private employers who wanted security guards at various locations where building operations were being conducted. The basis of the prosecution was that defendant had materially understated his income from Pomponio.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-24\">The government offered evidence that defendant was employed as an independent subcontractor to provide security at Pomponio\u2019s various building operations, and that his duties were to hire and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>schedule security officers and, at times, to work as a security guard himself. Both parties agree that defendant received a sum equal to $3.00 per hour for all hours for which the time records, prepared by defendant and submitted to Pomponio, indicated that security had been provided. Prom this sum defendant paid the other guards $2.50 per hour for the time they had worked, retaining $.50 per hour for himself. He kept full compensation of $3.00 per hour for the time that he himself served as a guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The indictment alleged that defendant reported his gross income as $11,604.69, but that he should have reported it as $56,970.00. The government offered proof that defendant had been paid approximately $41,000 by Pomponio in 1969 as an independent subcontractor. Defendant claimed, however, that he was an employee or agent of Pomponio and not an independent contractor. He testified that he considered himself an employee of Pomponio, that he worked under the supervision of Pomponio\u2019s head security officer, that he was simply timekeeper for the other guards, and that he was given orders by Pomponio\u2019s head security officer and other Pompo-nio employees. His testimony was partially corroborated by that of another employee of Pomponio. In response to defendant\u2019s argument that he was an employee rather than an independent subcontractor, the government offered two computations. One, based upon Pomponio\u2019s records, showed that even as an employee of Pomponio, defendant should have reported the net amount of $14,246; and the other, based upon defendant\u2019s records, showed that defendant should have reported the net amount of $11,489.50.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">On the basis of the defense evidence that the defendant was an employee or agent of Pomponio, the district court was requested to instruct the jury, first, that if it found that Pomponio \u201chad the right to prescribe not only what the results of John Mitchell\u2019s work should be, but also to direct the means and methods by which John Mitchell should do the work, then John Mitchell was an agent of Pomponio,\u201d and second, that if the jury found that the defendant was an agent, it \u201cmust find that the checks made payable to him were not to be included in his gross income except to the extent of 500 per hour worked by others and $3.00 per hour for the time worked by him.\u201d The district court denied these requests and this denial constituted the first error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Defendant also asserted a second defense. Its evidentiary basis was defendant\u2019s testimony that he had his 1969 return prepared by Mr. Joseph A. Whitehead who operated a Montgomery Ward tax service. Defendant testified that he gave all of his tax information \u2014 including his records of his income and expenses from Pomponio \u2014 -to a young man in Mr. Whitehead\u2019s office, that the young man told him to return later in the day, and that when he returned Mr. Whitehead was completing the return. According to defendant, after a brief conversation, Mr. Whitehead gave him the return, and then, without reviewing the return because he was tired from having worked for twenty-four consecutive hours, defendant signed the return and filed it. Based on this testimony, defendant asked that the jury be instructed that if it found that defendant provided full information regarding his taxable income and expenses for 1969 to a person holding himself out as qualified to prepare federal income tax returns for others, and that defendant adopted, signed and filed his return as prepared without having reason to believe that it was incorrect, then defendant should be found not guilty. The district court refused this instruction and its refusal was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">The government does not dispute that defendant\u2019s requested instructions were accurate as statements of law. We think that there was a foundation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>evidence for them and, as a consequence, they should have been granted. The district court\u2019s charge to the jury should have at least included the substance of the requested instructions in language sufficiently precise to instruct the jury in the defendant\u2019s theory of defense. <em>See </em>Bursten v. United States, 395 F.2d 976, 981-982 (5 Cir. 1968); Perez v. United States, 297 F.2d 12, 15-16 (5 Cir. 1961). Absent militating circumstances, the district court\u2019s failure to give the requested instructions constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">A. With regard to the requested agency instructions, the government argues that if the district court erred in failing to give the instructions, the error was harmless because even if the defendant were found to have been an agent of Pomponio, the government\u2019s case of underreporting would not be defeated. The only effect of such a finding would be to reduce the amount that the defendant should have reported as income from Pomponio. Instead of listing $41,000 in gross income from Pomponio (and presumably entering the other guards\u2019 salaries as business expenses), if the defendant were an agent or employee of Pomponio, he should have shown \u2014 depending on which set of records is accepted as accurate \u2014 -gross income from Pomponio of $14,246 or $11,489, the part of the total $41,000 payment from Pomponio which represents his own $3.00 per hour salary for guard work and the $.50 per hour commission for the other guards\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It is true that defendant\u2019s agency defense was not a complete defense, because even if accepted defendant could have still been found guilty of the crime charged. It would be easier, however, for the trier of the fact to find bad faith or evil motive in an underreport-ing of $41,000 than of $14,000 or $11,000. We therefore think that the differences in the amounts of underre-porting, depending upon whether defendant was a subcontractor or an agent, were sufficiently great that defendant\u2019s requested instructions should have been granted since the crime charged required proof of willfulness \u2014 - an element of fraud or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">On the other hand, most of the prejudice stemming from refusal of the agency instructions was neutralized when the district court told the jury that while \u201cyou are the sole judges of the facts, I don\u2019t have the slightest doubt in my mind that Pomponio did not intend to pay him some seven or eight hundred dollars a week as a salary or anything else.\u201d This was an express indication that the district judge did not accept the government\u2019s theory that the defendant received $41,000 in gross income from Pomponio. Were refusal of the agency instruction the sole issue on appeal, we would be inclined to hold that the error was harmless. But since the case must be tried anew, we indicate our view that the requested agency instructions should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">B. That the refusal of defendant\u2019s requested instruction in regard to his alleged use and reliance on an expert tax preparer constituted reversible error stands on a surer foundation. Given defendant\u2019s evidence on this point, the instruction should have been granted. Bursten v. United States, supra. Although the government argues that the instruction was given in substance, we read the record differently. It is true that the jury was told that defendant had testified that \u201che understood that Mr. Whitestone [sic] was going to figure it all out for him [prepare the return] \u201d and later that if defendant understated his gross income \u201cin good faith, then you should acquit him.\u201d But these oblique references to defendant\u2019s defense of reliance on expert advice were separated by other comments; and both from the separation and their inherent ambiguity, we conclude that defendant did not receive the precise and specific charge to which he was entitled. Bursten v. United States, 395 F.2d at 981-982.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">In light of these conclusions, we find it unnecessary to consider defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Reversed; new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-12\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">Any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">Willfully makes and subscribes any return . . . verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalty of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter .. . shall be guilty of a felony</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-26\">.
