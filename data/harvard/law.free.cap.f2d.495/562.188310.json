CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b626-30\">This is an appeal from a preliminary order of the district court enjoining and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>restraining Rhode Island prison officials and state police, and their agents,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201c1. from perpetrating or suffering to be perpetrated the physical and mental abuse, brutalization and beatings of plaintiffs and members of plaintiffs\u2019 class by the defendants and their agents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">2. from taking any action in retaliation against plaintiffs and members of plaintiffs\u2019 class or of depriving plaintiffs and members of plaintiffs\u2019 class of any and all rights and privileges on account of plaintiffs and members of their class participating, assisting, or volunteering any facts or circumstances in the furtherance of this lawsuit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The court issued the order soon after Rhode Island prison inmates had brought suit, individually and as class representatives, alleging that prison rules<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had been suspended and that they were being subject to unconstitutional treatment in the form of beatings, mental abuse, inhumane and unsanitary conditions, mail censorship, and the like.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs had requested \u201corders for the protection of plaintiffs and their class . to insure a complete and thorough investigation of the claim raised herein.\u201d The court thereupon held a three day hearing on that request, and then dictated from the bench a Memorandum and Order reciting that inmates had testified to \u201ca parade of horribles\u201d such as beatings, gassing and \u201cstrip\u201d lockups, and that they feared further harassment and beatings. The court went on to announce that, for reasons to be stated, it need not make specific factual findings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201cwhich would either stigmatize law enforcement or brand the inmates\u2019 allegations as prisoner paranoia. It suffices that I do find serious accusations have been made and give the-plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt that they fear for the harassment \u2014 that is, retaliation if they co-operate in the preparation of the substantive action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">The court supported its position by distinguishing a \u201cwrit\u201d in aid of jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1651, from ordinary protective orders, F.R.Civ.P. 26(c), or preliminary injunctions, F.R.Civ.P. 52. Characterizing its order as the former, it stated that it need not comply with the ordinary requirement that the court make findings of fact and state \u201creasons for its issuance.\u201d F.R.Civ.P. 65(d). <em>Cf. </em>F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Instead, analogizing to Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969), the court found that such an order was essential 'to guarantee a \u201cfair and meaningful evidentiary hearing\u201d and an \u201cadequate inquiry\u201d into plaintiffs\u2019 claims. It found no need, as a predicate to issuance of the protective \u201cwrit\u201d, to consider the usual criteria for preliminary injunctions, such as probability of success and balancing of equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">The state officials appeal on the ground that the preliminary order could not be entered without the findings disclaimed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">We think the court unnecessarily confused its substantive power to protect its inquiry into plaintiffs\u2019 complaints with the procedural requirements governing the use of such power. The latter incorporate the common sense rule that a court should let the parties and an appellate court know why it acts, and on what factual basis. United States v. Merz, 376 U.S. 192, 84 S.Ct. 639, 11 L. Ed.2d 629 (1964); United States v. Forness, 125 F.2d 928, 942 (2d Cir. 1942). Whether proceeding under the All Writs Act or not, a district court has no license to ignore that requirement. <em>Cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 414 U.S. 168, 177 n. 4, 94 S.Ct. 414, 422 n. 4, 38 L.Ed. 388 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">All the court seems to have meant here is that its order, being intended to combat the subjective fear of the inmates rather than any as yet well-established likelihood of official misconduct, did not need to be buttressed by a finding that the latter was probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In other words, the court took the position that where the purpose of an in-junctive order of this sort was to reassure fearful witnesses and thereby to assist the court\u2019s fact-finding, the actual likelihood of the enjoined conduct was secondary. Such a theory, if correct, as in these unique circumstances we believe it was, does not exempt the court from the requirement that it make relevant findings; it merely alters the character of such findings. The findings necessary to support such a protective order are simply that the plaintiffs reasonably fear retaliation and that the court\u2019s fact-finding may be materially impaired unless there is provided the tangible protection of a suitable court order. Normally, perhaps, in order to show that retaliation is reasonably feared it might be necessary to show that it was objectively probable; however, in a prisoner setting, given the charges and counter charges revealed here, a court might well conclude that an inmate would be fearful of retaliation even without an entirely objective basis: rumor, suspicion, and the dependency of the inmate might parlay even a low objective probability of misconduct into a substantial subjective fear. <em>Cf. </em>Smith v. Robbins, 454 F.2d 696 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Here we think the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs \u201cfear for the harassment \u2014 that is, retaliation if they co-operate in the preparation of the substantive action\u201d was sufficient to support a protective order. We give weight not only to the. court\u2019s finding, but to the extensive evidence <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of prison unrest, by whomever caused; the discretion customarily allowed to a trial court in such matters; and the court\u2019s undoubted desire to avoid inflammatory statements which might appear to prejudge issues yet to be tried. Hence when the court spoke of giving the plaintiffs \u201cthe benefit of the doubt,\u201d we do not, under the circumstances, read this as undercutting the force of its finding of actual fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\"> We are concerned, however, by the wording of the order itself. Paragraph 1 is indistinguishable from a preliminary injunction; its language is not tailored to its protective purpose and, what is more, under whatever label, it is too vague. Those enjoined, since under threat of judicial punishment, are entitled to be told \u201cprecisely what conduct is outlawed.\u201d Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U. S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 715, 38 L.Ed.2d 661 (1974). <em>See </em>Sucrs. De A. Mayol &amp; Co. v. Mitchell, 280 F.2d 477 (1st Cir.), cert. denied 364 U.S. 902, 81 S.Ct. 235, 5 L. E.2d 195 (1960). Paragraph 1 prevents \u201cbrutalization\u201d, whatever that may be thought to mean, and \u201csuffering to be perpetrated . . . mental abuse.\u201d Such phraseology is too indefinite,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it is also unfortunate because it suggests, as doubtless plaintiffs meant it to suggest, that those enjoined are capable of any enormity. While defendants are in professions where skins must be reasonably thick, they may not be forced, in the absence of \u00a3he specific findings here lacking, to endure language like that. Accordingly we find paragraph 1 to exceed the court\u2019s authority, both because of its vagueness and because it crosses the line from a limited protective order, which we hold permissible, to a more ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>pansive preliminary injunction appropriate only upon express findings that the prohibited conduct is likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Paragraph 2 is, on the other hand, sufficiently within the court\u2019s discretionary authority. Paragraph 1 of the order is therefore stricken, and the order as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. The rules had been promulgated in settlement of a civil rights action. Morris v. Travisono, 310 P.Supp. 857 (D.R.I.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-16\">. Defendants denied any brutal conduct, although they admitted that one suicidal inmate was kept naked in a cell for three days- and that tear gas had been used to control a raucous group of inmates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. <em>Cf. </em>Maine v.

Similar terms, such as \u201cmolesting\u201d or \u201charassing\u201d, have been held too vague. <em>See, e. g., </em>Alberti v. Cruise, 383 F.2d 268 (4th Cir. 1967). <em>Cf. </em>Galena v. Onassis, 487 F.2d 986 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
