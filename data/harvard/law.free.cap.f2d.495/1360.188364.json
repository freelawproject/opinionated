The report contains information reflecting the high and low prices of his securities as well as dividend rates, current yields and price earning ratios and lists the performance of leading market indicators for various periods of time. The report is not directed to investors in general, but to the particular subscriber whose portfolio is being analyzed. It is not sold separately and has no independent value apart from the services, which differentiates this case from In re First-america Corp., 127 USPQ 94 (TTAB 1960); In re American Savings and Accounting Supply, Inc., 172 USPQ 406 (TTAB 1972), and Ex Parte Greyvan Lines, Inc., 99 USPQ 343 (Com. of Pat. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>The issue presented for resolution, as aptly stated by the solicitor, is \u201cwhether appellant\u2019s reports to its subscribers are \u2018goods\u2019 within the contemplation of the Trademark Act or whether the reports are in fact the services or the <em>sine qua non </em>manifestations of the financial reporting services offered by appellant.\u201d We think the record amply supports the finding of the board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-5\">* * * applicant is engaged not in the sale of reports but solely in the furnishing of financial reporting services to its subscribers, as it likewise is that the reports submitted to its subscribers are merely incidental to and the ultimate result of its services. Such being the case, we are in full agreement with the Examiner that applicant\u2019s reports do not constitute goods in trade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">In our view, appellant\u2019s reports are a far cry from constituting goods in trade but are simply the conduit through which it renders services limited to individual subscribers-. The reports are the essence or gist of appellant\u2019s services as they are unique for each subscriber. They are not goods or commodities in trade. In re Compute-Her-Look, Inc., 176 USPQ 445 (TTAB 1972). See also Ex Parte Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, 118 USPQ 165 (Com. of Pat. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">We observe that neither the examiner nor the board specified the statutory basis for refusing registration in the instant ease except to conclude that the reports are not \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of the Act. It is obvious, however, that since the present application was refused on the ground that appellant\u2019s reports are not \u201cgoods in trade\u201d but in fact constitute a service, the decision below was manifestly predicated on sections 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1052 and 1127). Although the Act does not define \u201cgoods,\u201d the definition of a \u201ctrademark\u201d in section 45 declares that it is used \u201cto identify goods\u201d and section 2 refers to \u201cgoods in commerce.\u201d Both of these sections carry the necessary implication that a prerequisite to obtaining a trademark is that the subject matter to which it is applied must be goods. Presumptively at least, Congress, when it enacted the Trademark Act of 1946, was aware of Supreme Court decisions indicating that a trademark is applicable to a \u201cvendible commodity.\u201d See Hearings on H.R. 9041 before House Subcomm. on Trade-Marks of House Comm. on Patents, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 126 (1938); Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., 179 U.S. 665, 673, 21 S.Ct. 270, 45 L.Ed. 365 (1901), and American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, Commissioner, 269 U.S. 372, 380, 46 S.Ct. 160, 70 L.Ed. 317 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-10\">Upon thorough assessment of appellant\u2019s briefs and the instant record, we are not persuaded of reversible error in the decision below. Accordingly, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">LANE, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1424-15\">.
