The procedures in that hearing were found inadequate as a matter of law. The appellants do not attack that ruling. The second prong of the decision dealt with the challenge to the action of the classification board at a hearing held one day after the invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>disciplinary hearing. The board based reclassification, at least in part, on the disciplinary findings; the district court ruled that this procedure was also defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We are urged by appellee to affirm the decision below on broad constitutional grounds. We decline the invitation, noting that new regulations governing classification hearings are being developed. It is sufficient ground for relief in this case that the concededly invalid disciplinary hearing, held on the previous day, was to some uncertain extent taken into account in appellee\u2019s reclassification. We think that both fairness and common sense require a new classification hearing. &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">On this narrow basis the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-17\">. The appellants also challenge the denial of summary judgment by the district court in a damage claim based on the same facts. As this matter has been referred to a magistrate and factual findings have not yet been made, it is not a final determination and is not appealable, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This part of the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
