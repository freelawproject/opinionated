Tenney, District Judge, 353 F.Supp. 264 (S.D.N.Y.1972), denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"pA8u\">The action was brought to recover damages claimed to have been sustained as the result of defendants\u2019 trading or recommending trading of common stock of Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc. (Douglas) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1966. Such acts or transactions are alleged to have violated Sections 10(b) and 15(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78o(c)(l) (1970); Rules 10b-5 and 15c-l and 2, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.106-5 and 240.156-1 and 2 (1973), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Applying to the admitted facts before us what we believe to be controlling principles of law as enunciated by the Supreme Court and by our Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">In summarizing here the facts necessary to a determination of the legal issues raised on this appeal, we must take as admitted the well-pleaded material facts alleged in the complaint, as the district court did, 353 F.Supp. at 268, since the order under review denied defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The course of events which culminated in the instant action occurred during the period April 1966 through July 1966. During this period, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (Merrill Lynch) was engaged as the prospective managing underwriter of a proposed Douglas offering of $75,000,000 principal amount of a new issue of 4%% convertible subordinated debentures. A registration statement for this offering was filed with the SEC on June 7; it became effective on July 12, with Merrill Lynch the managing underwriter. On June 7, Douglas had released an earnings statement which reported the results of operations for the first five months of its 1966 fiscal year, i. e. through April 30, 1966.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This statement indicated that Douglas had earned 85 cents per share on its common stock during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>During the period June 17 through June 22, Merrill Lynch and certain of its officers, directors and employees (the individual defendants) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were advised by Douglas\u2019 management of certain material adverse inside information regarding Douglas\u2019 earnings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This information was essentially that (a) Douglas would report substantially lower earnings for the entire first six months than it had reported for the first five months of its 1966 fiscal year; (b) Douglas had sharply lowered its estimate of earnings for its full 1966 fiscal year in that it now expected to have little or no profit for that year; and (c) Douglas had substantially reduced its projection of earnings for its 1967 fiscal year. This information was given to Merrill Lynch solely because of its position as the prospective underwriter for the Douglas debenture issue. The individual defendants and Merrill Lynch knew or should have known that the information had not yet been publicly announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">During the period June 20 through June 24, Merrill Lynch and the individual defendants disclosed this confidential information to the following Merrill Lynch customers (the selling defendants), most of whom were institutional investors: Investors Management Co., Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Anchor Corporation), Madison Fund, Inc., J. M. Hartwell &amp; Co. (predecessor of J. M. Hartwell &amp; Co., Inc.), Hartwell Associates, Park Westlake Associates, Van Strum &amp; Towne, Inc., Fleschner Becker Associates, A. W. Jones &amp; Co., A. W. Jones Associates, City Associates, Fair-field Partners, Burden Investors Services, Inc. and William A. M. Burden &amp; Co. The selling defendants knew or should have known that this information had not yet been publicly announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">During the period June 20 through June 23, the selling defendants either sold from existing positions or made short sales of more than 165,000 shares of Douglas common on the NYSE. This was approximately one-half of the total number of Douglas shares sold on the NYSE during this period. These sales were made prior to Douglas\u2019 public disclosure of the revised earnings information on June 24 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and without the sellers having disclosed this information to the investing public, including plaintiffs. As a result of these sales, the individual defendants and Merrill Lynch received commissions from the execution of the selling defendants\u2019 orders and also received compensation in the form of customer directed \u201cgive ups\u201d \u2014 i. e. division of commissions earned by other brokers who executed orders for the selling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">On June 23, plaintiff Gibson purchased an unspecified number of shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of Douglas common on the NYSE; his purchase was prior to the public release on June 24 of Douglas\u2019 revised earnings report. The other four plaintiffs\u2014 Maurice Shapiro, Isadore Shapiro, Nai-gles and Saxe \u2014 purchased an unspecified number of shares of Douglas common on the NYSE on June 24; their purchases were made without knowledge of the material adverse earnings information released by Douglas that day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Beginning about June 22 or 23, the market price of Douglas common on the NYSE took a sudden and substantial drop.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This coincided with and, according to the complaint, was caused by the substantial sales by the selling defendants on the basis of material inside information, the disclosure of which after plaintiffs\u2019 purchases precipitated a further severe drop in the market price of Douglas common.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On August 21, 1970, plaintiffs commenced the instant action in the Southern District of New York. They sued on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated who purchased Douglas common during the period June 21 through June 24, 1966. Essentially the complaint alleges that defendants were under a duty to disclose to the general investing public, including plaintiffs, the material inside information regarding Douglas\u2019 earnings; that defendants defrauded plaintiffs by not disclosing such information, in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws; that plaintiffs would not have purchased Douglas stock if they had known of the information withheld by defendants; and that plaintiffs sustained substantial damages as a result of the acts of defendants. Plaintiffs do not claim to have purchased specific shares of Douglas stock sold by any of the selling defendants. The complaint demands damages sustained by plaintiffs and an accounting of profits realized by defendants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">After the pleadings were closed and certain limited discovery proceedings had taken place, both sides brought on motions before Judge Tenney. Plaintiffs moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c), for an order declaring that the action be maintained as a class action. Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In support of their motion, defendants contended that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the information defendants withheld was not material; that there was no privity between plaintiffs and defendants; that scienter was absent; and that plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish causation and reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">On December 26, 1972, Judge Tenney filed a well reasoned opinion, 353 F. Supp. 264, denying the motions by both sides.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In denying defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, the judge carefully considered but rejected each of defendants\u2019 contentions. He held in substance that Merrill Lynch and the individual defendants violated a duty which they owed to plaintiffs when these defendants disclosed material inside information to the selling defendants ; that the selling defendants in turn.violated a duty which they owed to plaintiffs when they sold the Douglas stock without disclosing the material inside information which had been divulged to them; that the conduct of all-defendants had caused plaintiffs to sustain damages; and that accordingly the complaint stated a claim upon which relief can be granted against all defendants under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Since there was no issue before Judge Tenney on defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the measure of damages to which plaintiffs would be entitled or other appropriate relief to be fashioned in the event plaintiffs were successful after trial on the merits, he made no determination on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">On February 22, 1973, upon motion by defendants, Judge Tenney amended his earlier order by adding the certification<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1970) to permit appeal from an interlocutory order. On March 27, 1973, we granted leave.to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Upon the basis of the foregoing summary of the facts and prior proceedings, we turn directly to the legal questions presented. They are essentially whether defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and, if so, whether they are liable in damages to plaintiffs ior such violations. The district court held as a matter of pleading that both questions must be answered in the affirmative. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Our starting point is the statute and the implementing rule. Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act in relevant part makes it unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any facility of any national securities exchange \u201c[t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission [SEC] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>est or for the protection of investors.\u201d One such prescription is Rule 10b-5 which provides in relevant part that \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d, it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any facility of any national securities exchange \u201c(a) [t]o employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (b) [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) [t]o engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person <em>11</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">As we have stated time and again, the purpose behind Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is to protect the investing public and to secure fair dealing in the securities markets by promoting full disclosure of inside information so that an informed judgment can be made by all investors who trade in such markets. E. g., Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787, 793 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822 (1970); SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 848 (2 Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom. Kline v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976 (1969). We recently held in Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, 464 F.2d 876, 890 (2 Cir. 1972), that \u201c[t]he essential purpose of Rule 10b-5 . is to prevent corporate insiders and their tippees from taking unfair advantage of the uninformed outsiders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Moreover, in applying the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws to the facts of this case, it is important to bear in mind that \u201cCongress intended securities legislation enacted for the purpose of avoiding frauds to be construed \u2018not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u2019 \u201d Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 151 (1972), quoting from SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195 (1963). This policy of flexible, nontechnical construction of the securities laws has provided the underpinning for the results in recent cases involving specific violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws. E. g., Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12 (1971); SEC v. Glen-Arden Commodities, Inc., 493 F.2d 1027, 1033-34 (2 Cir. 1974); International Controls Corp. v. Vesco, 490 F.2d 1334, 1345 (2 Cir. 1974). See Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341, 357, 363 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 910 (1973).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Here, upon the question of whether Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 were violated, the critical facts \u2014 admitted for purposes of this appeal \u2014 are that Merrill Lynch, a prospective managing underwriter of a Douglas debenture issue, and some of the officers, directors and employees of Merrill Lynch, divulged to certain of \u2019 its customers, the selling defendants, material adverse inside information regarding Douglas\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>earnings; the selling defendants, without disclosing to the investing public this inside information, sold Douglas common stock on a national securities exchange; and as a result of such trading Merrill Lynch and the individual defendants received commissions and other compensation, the selling defendants minimized their losses, but the investing public comprised of uninformed outsiders, including plaintiffs, who purchased Douglas stock during the same period sustained substantial losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Our holding that such conduct on the part of all defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is based chiefly on our decision in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sul-phur Co., <em>swpra,, </em>where we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201canyone in possession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is disabled from disclosing it . . ., must abstain from trading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.\u201d 401 F.2d at 848.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Defendants argue, however, that <em>Texas Gulf </em>is inapplicable here because, first, that was an SEC injunction action and not a private damage action and, second, Rule 10b-5 does not impose upon these defendants a duty to disclose the material inside information in question to these plaintiffs who did not purchase the actual stock sold by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Although <em>Texas Gulf </em>was an SEC injunction action, the strong public policy considerations behind our \u201cdisclose or abstain\u201d rule there are equally applicable here. In short, whether invoked in an SEC injunction action or in a private damage action, \u201cthe Rule is based in policy on the justifiable expectation of the securities marketplace that all investors trading on impersonal exchanges have relatively equal access to material information . . . .\u201d SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 848.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 796. Since one of the primary goals of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws would be frustrated if our \u201cdisclose or abstain\u201d rule enunciated in <em>Texas Gulf </em>were to be limited to SEC injunction actions and held inapplicable to private damage actions, we reject such ground of distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">We also reject defendants\u2019 second asserted ground for distinguishing <em>Texas Gulf\u2022 </em>\u2014 that our \u201cdisclose or abstain\u201d rule is not applicable here because the only duty owed by defendants was to purchasers of the specific shares of Douglas stock sold by defendants and the transactions here involved were not face-to-face sales to plaintiffs. This argument totally misconstrues our <em>Texas Gulf </em>rule. 401 F.2d at 848. It also ignores the fact that these transactions occurred on an anonymous national securities exchange where as a practical matter it would be impossible to identify a particular defendant\u2019s sale with a particular plaintiff\u2019s purchase. And it would make a mockery of the \u201cdisclose or abstain\u201d rule if we were to permit the fortuitous matching of buy and sell orders to determine whether a duty to disclose had been violated. See Painter, Inside Information: Growing Pains For The Development Of Federal Corporation Law Under Rule 10b-5, 65 Colum.L.Rev. 1361, 1372, 1377-78 (1965).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>very point, we stated in Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, <em>supra, </em>that our \u201cdisclose or abstain\u201d rule enunciated in <em>Texas Gulf </em>\u201capplies whether the securities are traded on a public stock exchange or sold through private placement.\u201d 464 F.2d at 887. To hold that Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 impose a duty to disclose material inside information only in face-to-face transactions or to the actual purchasers or sellers on an anonymous public stock exchange, would be to frustrate a major purpose of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws: to insure the integrity and efficiency of the securities markets. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., <em>supra, </em>480 F.2d at 357. We decline defendants\u2019 invitation to sanction a result which Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 clearly were intended to foreclose. See Astor v. Texas Gulf Sul-phur Co., 306 F.Supp. 1333, 1340-42 (S.D.N.Y.1969). We hold that defendants owed a duty \u2014 for the breach of which they may be held liable in this private action for damages \u2014 not only to the purchasers of the actual shares sold by defendants (in the unlikely event they can be identified) but to all persons who during the same period purchased Douglas stock in the open market without knowledge of the material inside information which was in the possession of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We find untenable the contentions of the respective defendants that, upon the issue of whether they violated the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, a distinction should be drawn between their roles as non-trading \u201ctippers\u201d and trading \u201ctippees\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">With respect to Merrill Lynch and the individual defendants (the non-trading \u201ctippers\u201d), their divulging of confidential material inside information to their customers who sold Douglas stock on the basis of such information clearly violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. In SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 852, 856, we held that two \u201ctippers\u201d viol\u00e1ted the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by disclosing material inside information to individuals who subsequently entered into transactions on the basis of that information, and we remanded to the district court for determination of an appropriate remedy. Upon remand, the district court held one of these \u201ctippers\u201d liable for \u201ctipping\u201d and awarded appropriate relief. SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 312 F.Supp. 77, 95 (S.D.N.Y.1970), modified on other grounds, 446 F.2d 1301, 1307-08 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1005 (1971). We find <em>Texas Gulf </em>controlling with respect to the liability of the non-trading \u201ctippers\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">With respect to the selling defendants (the trading \u201ctippees\u201d), <em>Texas Gulf </em>strongly suggests that the same duty to \u201cabstain or disclose\u201d should be imposed upon them. Although the issue of \u201ctip-pee\u201d liability was not squarely before us in <em>Texas Gulf, </em>we did say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cAs Darke\u2019s \u2018tippees\u2019 are not defendants in this action, we need not decide whether, if they acted with actual or constructive knowledge that the material information was undisclosed, their conduct is as equally violative of the Rule as the conduct of their insider source, though we note that it certainly could be equally reprehensible.\u201d 401 F.2d at 852-53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In Ross v. Licht, 263 F.Supp. 395, 410 (S.D.N.Y.1967), the court observed, \u201cIf [defendants] were not insiders, they would seem to have been \u2018tippees\u2019 . and subject to the same duty as insiders.\u201d See Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, <em>supra, </em>464 F.2d at 887, 890; Cady Roberts &amp; Co., 40 S.E.C. 907, 912-13 (1961). Cf. Kuehnert v. Texstar Corp., 412 F.2d 700, 702-05 (5 Cir. 1969). We are not persuaded by the selling defendants\u2019 argument that as tippees they were not able to make ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>fective public disclosure of information about a company with which they were not associated; for the duty imposed is not a naked one to disclose, but a duty to abstain from trading unless they do disclose. Since upon the admitted facts before us the selling defendants knew or should have known of the confidential corporate source of the revised earnings information and they knew of its nonpublic nature, they were under a duty not to trade in Douglas stock without publicly disclosing such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In short, for the reasons set forth above, we hold that all defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We turn next to the remaining major legal question presented: assuming that defendants did violate the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws by trading in or recommending trading in Douglas common stock (as we have held above), whether they are liable in a private action for damages to plaintiffs who during the same period purchased Douglas stock in the open market without knowledge of the material inside information which was in the possession of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The essential argument of defendants on this question is that, even if they did violate Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, their conduct did not \u201ccause\u201d damage to plaintiffs;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that it was Douglas\u2019 precarious financial condition, not defendants\u2019 securities law violations, which precipitated the sudden, substantial drop in the market price of Douglas stock and hence the losses sustained by plaintiffs; that, since plaintiffs had no prior or contemporaneous knowledge of defendants\u2019 actions, they would have purchased Douglas stock regardless of defendants\u2019 securities law violations; and that, since defendants\u2019 sales were unrelated to plaintiffs\u2019 purchases and all transactions took place on anonymous public stock exchanges,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> there is lacking the requisite connection between defendants\u2019 alleged violations and the alleged losses sustained by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">The short, and we believe conclusive, answer to defendants\u2019 assertion that their conduct did not \u201ccause\u201d damage to plaintiffs is the \u201ccausation in fact\u201d holding by the Supreme Court in Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 153-54 (1972), upon the authority of which we conclude that the requisite element of causation in fact has been established here by the uncon-troverted facts that defendants traded in or recommended trading in Douglas stock without disclosing material inside information which plaintiffs as reasonable investors might have considered important in making their decision to purchase Douglas stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">In order more fully to deal with the arguments which have been vigorously urged upon us by defendants\u2019 counsel, however, we believe it may be helpful to back up a bit from our conclusion based on <em>Affiliated Ute </em>and particularly to indicate briefly the decisional law regarding the requisite element of causation that preceded the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">We consistently have held that causation is a necessary element of a private action for damages under Rule 10b-5. E. g., Chasins v. Smith, Barney &amp; Co., 438 F.2d 1167, 1172 (2 Cir. 1970); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Co., 419 F.2d 787, 797 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822 (1970). Indeed, we have refused \u201cto facilitate outsiders\u2019 proof of insiders\u2019 fraud\u201d by \u201creading out of [Rule 10b-5] so basic an element of tort law as the principle of causation in fact.\u201d List v. Fashion Park, Inc., 340 F.2d 457, 463 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 811 (1965). This is consistent with \u201cthe basic concept that causation must be proved else defendants could be held liable to all the world.\u201d Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc., 418 F.2d 1276, 1292 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913 (1970). And we have recognized that the aim of Rule 10b-5 \u201cis to qualify, as between insiders and outsiders, the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>\u2014 not to establish a scheme of investors\u2019 insurance.\u201d List v. Fashion Park, Inc., <em>supra, </em>340 F.2d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As one branch of their absence of causation argument, defendants contend that there was no privity between themselves and plaintiffs. We hold here, as we have held before, that privity between plaintiffs and defendants is not a requisite element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action for damages. For example, we have upheld Rule 10b-5 claims for relief where there have been no direct transactions between plaintiffs and defendants. Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 796-98; Heit v. Weitzen, 402 F.2d 909, 913 (2 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 903 (1969). See Astor v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 306 F.Supp. 1333, 1341-42 (S.D.N.Y.1969). As the Tenth Circuit stated in Mitchell v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 446 F.2d 90, 101 (10 Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1004 (1971), \u201c[p]erhaps the first step is to realize that the common law requirement of privity has all but vanished from 10b-5 proceedings while the distinguishable \u2018connection\u2019 element is retained.\u201d And we recognized in Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc., <em>supra, </em>418 F.2d at 1291, that \u201c[b]efore there may be a violation of the securities acts there need not be present all of the same elements essential to a common law fraud. . . . \u201d See Ruder, Texas Gulf Sulphur \u2014 The Second Round: Privity and State of Mind in Rule 10b-5 Purchase and Sale Cases, 63 Nw.U.L.Rev. 423, 432-33 (1968). In short, causation as an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action can be established notwithstanding lack of privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">As a further refinement of their absence of casuation argument, defendants contend that, even if privity between plaintiffs and defendants is not required, it is still necessary to show a \u201cconnection\u201d between defendants\u2019 nondisclosure conduct and plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of Douglas stock \u2014 in the sense that the former induced the latter \u2014 before a Rule 10b-5 claim can be established. It is true that prior to the Supreme Court decision in <em>Affiliated Ute </em>the so-called connection requirement was stated in terms of causation and reliance. For example, we have noted that the reason for the req\u00fairement of reliance \u201cis to certify that the conduct of the defendant actually caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury\u201d, List v. Fashion Park, Inc., <em>supra, </em>340 F.2d at 462, and we have held that \u201c[t]o the extent that reliance is necessary for a finding of a 10b-5 violation in a non-disclosure case . . .,</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">the test is properly one of tort \u2018causation in fact.\u2019 \u201d Chasins v. Smith, Barney &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d at 1172. See Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 797. Cf. SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 860. While the concepts of reliance and causation have been used interchangeably in the context of a Rule 10b-5 claim, the proper test to determine whether causation in fact has been established in a non-disclosure case is \u201cwhether the plaintiff would have been influenced to act differently than he did act if the defendant had disclosed to him the undisclosed fact.\u201d List v. Fashion Park, Inc., <em>supra, </em>340 F.2d at 463. See Chasins v. Smith, Barney &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d at 1172. Cf. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341, 373-75 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 910 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Even on the basis of the <em>pre-Affiliat-ed Ute </em>decisions discussed above, therefore, we would reject defendants\u2019 essential causation argument, namely, that, absent an allegation that plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of Douglas stock was induced by defendants\u2019 non-disclosure of material inside information, the requisite element of causation is lacking. On the contrary, the Rule 10b-5 causation in fact requirement is satisfied by plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they would not have purchased Douglas stock if they had known of the information withheld by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As must be apparent from our discussion above, we believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Affiliated </em>Ute\u2014 which we regard as controlling on the issue of causation in the instant case \u2014 is a logical sequel to our prior decisions in such cases as <em>List, Heit, Globus, Crane, </em>and <em>Chasins. </em>Moreover, <em>Affiliated Ute </em>specifically applied to a Rule 10b-5 damage action the causation in fact standard enunciated by Mr. Justice Harlan in Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 385 (1970), where, in a case involving a cognate provision of the 1934 Act (Section 14(a)), the Court approved dispensing with any requirement of proof of reliance as a prerequisite to recovery in a private damage action. See note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In <em>Affiliated Ute, </em>members of a large class of holders of stock deposited in a bank alleged that two employees of the bank in arranging for sales of this stock had failed to disclose to plaintiffs facts regarding the bank\u2019s and the employees\u2019 positions as market makers and facts regarding the true value of the stock, in violation of Rule 10b-5. The Supreme Court, in reversing the Court of Appeals which had held that there could be no recovery under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 without a showing of reliance, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, involving primarily a failure to disclose, positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery. <em>All that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in the making of this decision. . . . </em>This obligation to disclose and this withholding of a material fact establish the requisite element of causation in fact.\u201d 406 U.S. at 153-54. (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">As applied to the instant case, this holding in <em>Affiliated Ute </em>surely warrants our conclusion that the requisite element of causation in fact has been established by the admitted withholding by defendants of material inside information which they were under an obligation to disclose, such information being clearly material in the sense that plaintiffs as reasonable investors might have considered it important in making their decision to purchase Douglas stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Defendants argue that the <em>Affiliated Ute </em>rule of causation in fact should be confined to the facts of that case which involved face-to-face transactions. We disagree. That rule is dependent not upon the character of the transaction\u2014 face-to-face versus national securities exchange \u2014 but rather upon whether the defendant is obligated to disclose thei inside information. Here, as we have held above, defendants were under a duty to the investing public, including plaintiffs, not to trade in or to recommend trading in Douglas stock without publicly disclosing the revised earnings information which was in their possession. They breached that duty. Causation in fact therefore has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Our holding that causation in fact has been established despite the fact that all transactions took place on a national securities exchange is consistent with the underlying purpose of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \u201cto prevent inequitable and unfair practices and to insure fairness in securities transactions generally, whether conducted' face-to-face, over the counter, or on the exchanges. The Act and the Rule apply to the transactions here, all of which were consummated on exchanges.\u201d SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 847-48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>(2 Cir. 1968), cert, denied sub nom. Kline v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976 (1969) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that defendants are liable in this private action for damages to plaintiffs who, during the same period that defendants traded in or recommended trading in Douglas common stock, purchased Douglas stock in the open market without knowledge of the material inside information which was in the possession of defendants.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Finally, having held that all defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and that they are liable to plaintiffs in this private action for damages, we leave to the district court the appropriate form of relief to be granted, including the proper measure of damages. This comports with the procedure followed in other cases where appellate courts have determined issues of liability for violations of the securities laws. Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 386-89 (1970); J. I. Case v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433-35 (1964); Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341, 379-80 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 910 (1973); Crane Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787, 803-04 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">In the instant case there are especially compelling reasons for following this procedure. Since the appeal comes to us from an interlocutory order denying defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, there was no issue before the district court and of course no adjudication below on the form of relief to be granted. Among the questions to be determined which will have an important bearing on the form of relief is whether the action is to be maintained as a class action and, if so, the parameters of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>class; as to this, the district court understandably was unable to make a determination on the facts presented by the pleadings. 353 F.Supp. at 280. See note 10, <em>supra,. </em>Another closely related question bearing upon the relief to be granted as to which the district court had insufficient data upon which to make a determination, 353 F.Supp. at 279-80, is just when Douglas\u2019 news release regarding its revised earnings forecast on the morning of June 24, 1966 became effectively disseminated, especially in the light of SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 854 n. 18 (2 Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom. Kline v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976 (1969). Other questions bearing upon the appropriate form of relief which must await trial include the extent of the selling defendants\u2019 trading in Douglas stock, whether such trading effectively impaired the integrity of the market, what compensation if any was paid by the selling defendants to Merrill Lynch for the inside information, what profits or other benefits were realized by defendants, what expenses were incurred and what losses were sustained by plaintiffs, and what should be the difference, if any, in the extent of liability imposed on the individual defendants and the selling defendants, respectively. Moreover, we do not foreclose the possibility that an analysis by the district court of the nature and character of the Rule 10b-5 violations committed may require limiting the extent of liability imposed on either class of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In leaving to the district court the fashioning of appropriate relief, including the proper measure of damages, we are not unmindful of the arguments pressed upon us by all defendants that the resulting judgment for damages may be very substantial in amount \u2014 in the words of defendants\u2019 counsel, a \u201cDraconian liability\u201d. This is an additional reason for leaving to the district court the appropriate form of relief to be granted \u2014 a determination that can best be made after an evidentiary hearing and on the basis of appropriate findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In short, we decide today only those legal questions properly before us on this appeal from the interlocutory order denying defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. We leave all other issues to the district court, including the fashioning of appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">.

As the author recognizes, \u201cSince in any active market disclosure to a particular individual is not feasible, the duty to disclose, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>such a duty exists, must be owed to all members of that ill-defined class of stockholders who, with the benefit of inside information, would alter their intention to [buy].\u201d Painter, 65 Colum.L.Rev. at 1378.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. While defendants urged upon the district court the absence of other elements of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action \u2014 e. g., standing, materiality and scienter, 353 F.Supp. at 270-73, their chief emphasis on this appeal is directed at the asserted absence of causation and reliance and the absence of privity between plaintiffs and defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. The similarity between certain arguments made here and some discussed above under part II of this opinion is recognized. The issue here is the existence of the essential elements of a private action for damages \u2014 whether these plaintiffs may recover damages \u2014 while the issue under part II was whether violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 had been established. We shall assume familiarity here with our discussion of similar arguments above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. Following our remand in <em>Texas Gulf, supra, </em>401 F.2d at 804, the district court ruled on motions for summary judgment by certain defendants in a related shareholders\u2019 action. Astor v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 306 F.Supp. 1333 (S.D.N.Y.1969). Shareholders of Texas Gulf had brought a Rule 10b-5 action against defendants who had purchased Texas Gulf stock on the basis of material inside information during the same period that plaintiffs had sold. Plaintiffs alleged that they would not have sold their stock had they known of the undisclosed information. No privity existed between plaintiff-sellers and defendant-buyers. Defendants bad made no affirmative misrepresentations. The transactions were executed on an essentially anonymous market. 306 F.Supp. at 1341. On the basis of these facts, the court, applying the <em>List </em>test, found that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint stated a claim for relief under Rule 10b-5 and accordingly denied defendants' motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. Defendants argue that, rather than the instant private action for damages, there are adequate sanctions against those who violate Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the form of administrative and injunctive proceedings which can be brought by the SEC. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The short answer is that such proceedings and the private action for damages are not mutually exclusive remedies. As we recently stated in Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., <em>supra, </em>480 F.2d at 356:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">\u201cthe Supreme Court, as well as other federal courts including our own, have recognized that vigorous enforcement of the federal securities laws, jiarticularly the anti-fraud provisions, can be accomplished effectively only when implemented by private damage actions. In J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426 (1964), the Supreme Court emphasized that private actions provide \u2018a necessary supplement to Commission action\u2019 and that \u2018the possibility of civil damages or injunctive relief serves as a most effective weapon in the enforcement\u2019 of the securities laws. 377 U.S. at 432. See Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 783 (2 Cir. 1951); Speed v. Transamerioa Corp., 235 F.2d 369 (3 Cir. 1956).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">In like vein, defendants contend that the recovery of illegal profits resulting from an insider\u2019s misuse of corporate information should be left to derivative stockholders actions as in Schein v. Chasen, 478 F.2d 817 (2 Cir. 1973), remanded on other grounds sub nom. Lehman Bros. v. Schein, - U.S. - (1974), and Diamond v. Oreamuno, 24 N.Y.2d 494, 248 N.E.2d 910, 301 N.Y.S.2d 78 (1969). What we said above regarding the role of the private action for damages in the overall program for vigorous enforcement of the federal securities laws applies with equal force here. Moreover, derivative actions for such relief are not uniformly available in all states.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
