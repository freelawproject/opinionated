The District Court imposed a single general sentence of fifteen years imprisonment for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Johnson moved for correction of his sentence in the District Court under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He contended that under Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957), and its progeny, it was illegal to impose a general sentence for violating both subsections (a) and (d) of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 for a single bank robbery. , The District Court denied the motion and this appeal resulted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The District Court correctly stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">(1) a single offense had been committed;</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">(2) a consummated bank robbery may encompass several of the graduated offenses proscribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113;</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">(3) <em>Prince </em>precluded the imposition of separate sentences for the violation of each subsection; and</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">(4) a single general sentence for violating (a) and (d) was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">The District Court\u2019s disposition is in accord with our opinion in Gerberding v. United States, 471 F.2d 55 (8th Cir. 1973). There, we remanded to the District Court for the imposition of a single general sentence where the defendant was convicted of violating more than one subsection of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, and was given separate sentences. <em>See also, </em>United States v. Corson, 449 F.2d 544, 551 (3rd Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
