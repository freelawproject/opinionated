Concluding that their contentions are meritless, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-22\">In November, 1970, the United States indicted James Burke, Henry Hill, Louis Lopez, Raul Charbonier and Luis Charbonier<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on five counts. The charges consisted of (1) making extortionate extensions of credit; <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>using ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>tortionate means of collecting debts;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) interstate travel in furtherance of extortion; (4) interstate travel for promotion of an illegal gambling enterprise; and (5) use of interstate telephone facilities in an unlawful gambling enterprise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>The scheme that led to the indictments was crude but effective. Raul Charbonier owned the Char-Pal, a combination lounge-liquor store in Tampa, Florida. His friend Gaspar Ciaccio also owned and operated, in conjunction with his brother Fano Ciaccio, a lounge-liquor store, the Temple Terrace Lounge, located not far from Charbonier\u2019s establishment. Early in 1970, Raul Charbonier approached Gaspar Ciaccio with a gambling proposition. Raul could obtain a rigged line or odds sheet on baseball games during the upcoming season from his cousin Pupi in New York, and he offered Ciaccio the opportunity to bet on the games using the line. Gaspar Ciac-cio informed his friend Dr. Felix Lo-Cicero of the opportunity and introduced him to Charbonier. In June, 1970, after Charbonier explained the scheme in detail to Ciaccio and LoCieero and enlisted them, they began betting. Charbonier guaranteed that the line was rigged so Ciaccio and Dr. LoCieero would win. The system allowed only bets on the team designated as the favorite in any particular game, at the odds specified. The gamblers could select any number of games on the list to bet on. Charbonier received the line by telephone from New York and phoned the daily lists to either Ciaccio or LoCieero.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">The betting began with bush-league sums in early June, 1970. As promised, Ciaccio and LoCieero won consistently in the beginning, and they increased the amounts of their bets as the season progressed. By the All-Star game break in July, they had compiled $7,500-$8,000 in unpaid winnings. The wagers by that time had reached the major leagues \u2014as much as $1,000 per game. The All-Star game marked the end of Ciac-cio\u2019s and LoCicero\u2019s hitting streak. After winning the bet on that game, they began striking out consistently. By early August, both had not only lost their previously-compiled winnings but were deeply in the hole. Although they had paid over $7,800, Ciaccio and Lo-Cicero still owed over $13,000 when they called the game. 'When a friend of Ciac-cio\u2019s, Tony M\u00e1rchese (who was a bit more knowledgeable about gambling and baseball) saw one of the odds sheets Charbonier supplied Ciaccio, he informed Ciaccio, that, contrary to Char-bonier\u2019s promise of a line rigged to win, the odds were deceptively rigged to insure losing bets. Ciaccio and LoCieero informed Charbonier that they refused to play any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">LoCieero paid Charbonier another $1,000 on August 24 and had no further contact with him until October 8. The Charboniers did not forget Ciaccio. Raul Charbonier pressed Ciaccio to pay his remaining losses several times between August and October. Ciaccio refused to pay the amount because he believed he had been duped. Once Char-bonier assured Ciaccio that, if he did not pay the debt, Charbonier\u2019s cousin would come down from New York and \u201che would bring some people down here and get the money one way or another.\u201d Raul added to his lineup about that time by substituting his brother Luis as a pinch-hitter. In later August, Luis demanded that Ciaccio pay up. Ciaccio again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">To complete the lineup, Cosmo Rosado, James Burke, Henry Hill and Louis Lopez flew from New York to Tampa the night of October 8 arriving about 9:45 p.m. Rosado rented a car and informed the rental agent that he would use the car for an indeterminate time up to five days without a local address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">Around 10:30 that night, Luis Char-bonier and Rosado, accompanied by the others from New York, accosted Ciaccio in his own lounge. After some serious haggling about Ciaccio\u2019s debt, Luis Charbonier and Rosado told Ciaccio to accompany them to Charbonier\u2019s lounge. When Ciaccio refused, Burke nudged a gun against his ribs. Having thus received an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse, Ciac-cio went along, surrounded by the five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>antagonists. Foregoing any further pleasantries, Hill and Lopez, sitting on either side of Ciaccio in the back seat of the car on the way to the other lounge, began beating him. Lopez split open Ciaccio\u2019s forehead with a pistol. Hill and Lopez stated that they would kill Ciaccio, but that it would not be worthwhile since they wanted their $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Raul Charbonier greeted Ciaccio, when they arrived at the Char-Pal, with, \u201cI told you this was going to happen to you, didn\u2019t I? I told you this.\u201d At the Char-Pal the collectors placed Ciaccio in the stockroom and beat on him some more. While Gaspar Ciaccio was enduring his status of punching bag, Raul Carbonier called Gaspar\u2019s brother, Fano Ciaccio, at the Temple Terrace Lounge. Raul explained to Fano that they had his brother and they were \u201cworking him over.\u201d Raul said, \u201cThese fellows are from up North and they want their $8,000.\u201d Fano went to the Char-Pal Lounge to negotiate with Charbonier. After Fano explained he did not have the $8,000, Rosado told him that he could have a week to produce it. Subsequently, Raul Charbonier brought Gaspar back to the Temple Terrace Lounge. Some friends helped Gaspar change his bloody clothes and took him to a nearby hospital, where he was treated and the wound in his forehead was stitched up. Gaspar Ciaccio, who was away from work for a week after the beating, borrowed $8,000 from relatives and paid it to Charbonier by the end of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Raul Charbonier had not forgotten LoCicero either. About midnight on the same night as Ciaccio\u2019s beating, Char-bonier called LoCicero. Charbonier informed LoCicero that they had Gaspar, they had gasoline in the car, and they wanted to come over to see LoCicero. Charbonier agreed that, if LoCicero would promise to pay the balance in the morning, he would keep them away from him. LoCicero agreed. He offered a thumbnail sketch of his reaction: \u201cI was scared as hell.\u201d At the earliest opportunity, he paid Raul Charbonier $4,000 to cancel the gambling debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">Early on October 9, Rosado turned in the rental car at the airport. Rosado, Burke, Hill and Lopez returned to New York that same morning, flying through Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">On November 24, 1970, six days after the federal indictment was returned, state officials charged these defendants with kidnapping, extortion and assault with intent to murder Gaspar Ciaccio. The state case proceeded expeditiously and was tried in early March, 1971. All defendants were acquitted. The federal case was delayed by various legal maneuverings of the defendants until October, 1972. The trial court directed a verdict of not guilty on Count V as to Burke, Hill and Lopez, because no evidence of phone calls by them existed. The jury found the Charboniers guilty on all counts and Burke, Hill and Lopez guilty on Counts I through IV. The court sentenced each individual to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">\n<em>Evidentiary Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">Burke, Hill and Lopez contend pro forma that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions. The contention is frivolous in light of the overwhelming and detailed testimony by Ciaccio and others about these appellants\u2019 conduct. But Burke, Hill and Lopez seriously insist that massive infusions of inadmissible hearsay denied them a fair trial and their respective rights to confront the witnesses against them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>First, they complain of Ciaccio\u2019s and LoCicero\u2019s testimony about the operation of the gambling scheme during the spring and summer. They assert as inadmissible hearsay virtually everything the witnesses said that Raul Charbonier said- or did. These statements, rather than hearsay, as appellants assert, were \u201cverbal acts,\u201d statements which were elements of the crimes charged. With the exceptions discussed below, none of the statements or acts attributed to Char-bonier referred to Burke, Hill and Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">The issue, then, is whether this non-hearsay evidence was admissible in the trial against Burke, Hill and Lopez. Doubtless it was relevant. It established and detailed the gambling scheme which was the context for the extortionate extensions of credit and the extortionate collection methods. Additionally, the gambling supplied the element which made the interstate travel and use of interstate telephone facilities illegal. No issue of prejudice or necessity for cautionary instructions arose because these defendants were not mentioned as involved in the original arrangements or operations of the gambling scheme. Whether these particular acts of Charbonier were attributable to Burke, Hill and Lopez was essentially irrelevant. As to them, it was only the action of October 8th to which federal criminal liability could be ascribed. To the extent the jury may have associated these defendants with the origination of the gambling, it was permissible under the traditional principle that the acts of one partner in crime are admissible against the others when it is in furtherance of the criminal undertaking. Orser v. United States, 362 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">The witnesses did relate a few statements by the Charboniers referring to Cosmo Rosado, the \u201ccousin from up North\u201d and to \u201cpeople\u201d that his cousin would \u201cbring down here and get the money one way or another.\u201d Most clearly incriminating to these three appellants was the phone conversation between Raul Charbonier and LoCicero of October 8th, related by LoCicero on the witness stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-9\">I received a telephone call and the words were, \u201cDoc, this is Raul. They have Gaspar in the car. They have gasoline in the car. And they want to come over to see you. If you guaranty me you will pay the balance by tomorrow I will tell them not to come over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-10\">I related at that time that I thought that matter had been settled. Says, \u201cNo. They want their money now.\u201d Says, \u201cWell you come to my office tomorrow and I will have the money for you.\u201d He said, \u201cThat is good enough for me.\u201d And hung up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\"> Again, these statements were not hearsay but were statements which constituted the very activity in combination with which the defendants were charged. As such, they were admissible and attributable to Burke, Hill and Lopez. Additionally, these statements did not deny these appellants the Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against them. Although the rationale for admission of these statements is not the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the analysis of these \u201cverbal acts\u201d in light of the confrontation clause necessarily follows many of the same guidelines. The declarants, as defendants, were unavailable to the government; sufficient indicia of reliability, both as to Charbonier\u2019s threatening purpose and as to the reference on October 8th to \u201cthey,\u201d meaning Burke, Hill and Lopez,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was supplied by overwhelming independent evidence of these appellants\u2019 activities; also, m light of the direct evidence of Burke\u2019s, Hill\u2019s and L\u00f3pez\u2019 participation, references to \u201cthey\u201d were not \u201ccrucial\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>government\u2019s case nor \u201cdevastating\u201d to the defense. Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970); Park v. Huff, 493 F.2d 923 (5th Cir. 1974); Davenport, The Confrontation Clause and the Coconspirator Exception in Criminal Prosecutions: A Functional Analysis, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 1378 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Appellants insist not only that the evidence was inadmissible but that they were prejudicially misled by a preliminary statement that the conspiracy rules of evidence were not applicable and by the failure of the prosecution to define the scope and purpose of any conspiracy or joint venture in crime. We find no evidence in the record of disadvantage or prejudice to appellants. They were afforded full opportunity to present their objections, which they did \u2014promptly, thoroughly and unctuously. The trial judge, at an appropriate time, found that sufficient independent evidence of the \u201cco-partnership,\u201d \u201cjoint venture,\u201d or common undertaking of a criminal objective existed to establish that relationship between defendants, to reinforce the reliability of the extra-judicial statements, and to furnish the necessary relevance of the evidence. Orser v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Two more minor evidentiary questions warrant discussion. First, appellants insist that Gaspar Ciaccio\u2019s testimony about his statements to his treating doctor on the night of October 8th after his beating were inadmissible hearsay. Assuming appellants are correct that the statements about his beating were not necessary for medical diagnosis or treatment, the testimony was still admissible to support Ciaceio\u2019s story after the defense had attacked Ciaccio\u2019s story as a recent fabrication. McCormick, Evidence (2d) \u00a7 251 (1972). Secondly, appellants claim that the testimony of a government agent relating an interview with Raul Charbonier on November 13, 1970, was inadmissible. We agree that it was inadmissible simply as irrelevant, if for no other reason. During the interview, Charbonier denied the whole gambling and extortion scheme. Additionally, it was not in furtherance of the criminal goal for which defendants were charged. And it lacked any reference to any other defendant. Whatever effect the statement may have generated, however, it was not substantial or prejudicial enough to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">Earl Cram, a witness, had seen Gaspar Ciaccio come out of his lounge on October 8th surrounded by four of the defendants and Rosado. After cross-examination of Cram, defendants sought to show his bias by introducing statements by Cram, after defendants\u2019 acquittal in state court, that he was unhappy with, and skeptical of, that trial\u2019s outcome. Defendants did not show material differences from the state trial in Cram\u2019s testimony or any other way in which his testimony was biased by the state trial outcome. Additionally, the district court had earlier ruled that evidence of the state acquittal was irrelevant and it was within his discretion to foreclose the defendants\u2019 attempt to refer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">Direct examination of Gaspar Ciaccio lasted until late on a Friday afternoon before a three-day weekend. The district judge granted permission for the prosecutor to \u201cwork with\u201d Ciaccio over the weekend in order to discuss the upcoming cross-examination. Defendants urge that this deprived them of the \u201ctimely thrust of naturalness\u201d inherently essential to cross-examination. The defense had the full weekend to prepare its cross-examination and they have not shown any prejudice resulting from the two-hour conference between Ciaccio and the prosecutor. Thus, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">\n<em>Severance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">Appellants insist that the district court erred in failing to grant a severance of the Charboniers\u2019 trial from that of Burke, Hill and Lopez. Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P., provides that a motion for a severance is addressed to the discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>tion of the trial judge. Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954); Smith v. United States, 385 F.2d 34 (5th Cir. 1967). To challenge successfully the refusal of a trial judge to grant a motion to sever, an appellant must show \u201cprejudice resulting in the denial of a fair trial.\u201d United States v. Martinez, 486 F.2d 15 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Nakaladski, 481 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1973). In Byrd v. Wainwright, 428 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir. 1970), we enumerated guidelines for evaluating motions for severance based on a desire to offer exculpatory testimony of a co-defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">We agree that the defendants satisfied two of the criteria. (1) Burke, Hill and Lopez subpoenaed the Charboniers as witnesses and, although tardily, sufficiently communicated to the trial judge that they desired to use the Charboniers as witnesses; (2) the appellants timely made (although over a year after indictment) the requisite motions and renewed them during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">On the other hand, we cannot say that these appellants satisfied the other criteria sufficiently to warrant a conclusion that the district court abused its discretion. (1) The Charboniers filed affidavits which tracked exactly the language of the indictments but expressed it in the negative. These affidavits failed to clearly show what the Charboniers would have testified to. The movants made no showing that the Charboniers\u2019 testimony would be exculpatory in effect or would raise strong doubts as to Burke\u2019s, Hill\u2019s and Lopez\u2019 guilt. <em>Byrd, swpra </em>at 1020-1021. (2) The likelihood that the Charboniers would testify if tried separately was enhanced by the Charboniers\u2019 affidavits to that effect, but that likelihood was diminished by the failure to show why the Charboniers would have been willing to testify at a separate trial but not in the joint one. The usual reason for such a strategy is inconsistent or antagonistic defenses\u2014 the testimony that exonerates the mov-ant will implicate the co-defendant witness. <em>Byrd, supra </em>at 1022; United States v. Johnson, 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1973). Appellants made no such showing to the trial judge. (3) Considerations of judicial economy and administration weigh heavily in favor of the district court\u2019s decision. By various manuevers defendants delayed commencement of the trial for almost two years after indictment, the trial itself required nearly three weeks, and separate trials would have required virtual duplication of great effort and expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">\n<em>Miscellaneous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">Appellants urge that the following remark by the prosecutor during rebuttal argument was improper comment on the failure of the defendants to take the stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-11\">Defense counsel stated that, while they were not there and I wasn\u2019t ther\u00e9 \u2014I want to point out to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the people who were there were all the witnesses who testified to the facts and all of the defendants, and they were there when this occurred; and you have the testimony as to what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">In the context presented, countervailing arguments by counsel that neither the prosecutor\u2019s nor the defense counsel\u2019s statements constitute evidence in the case, we cannot conclude that this statement \u201c . . . was manifestly intended or was \u2018of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 \u201d United States v. White, 444 F.2d 1274, 1278 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Appellants also insist that the prosecutor below engaged in other serious misconduct sufficient to deny them a fair trial. After reviewing the record of the incidents, statements and arguments alleged to have been prejudicial, we conclude that they were not so misleading, inflammatory or prejudicial as to deny defendants a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">In the state trial, Fano Ciaccio had denied that he knew of his brother\u2019s gambling. At the federal trial, he acknowledged that his earlier statement was false and explained that he had been afraid at the time to expose his knowledge of the gambling because of the treatment received by his brother. Additionally, due to language difficulties Fano was confused and made misstatements on cross-examination which he or the prosecutor had to correct. On these factors, defense counsel requested the district judge to specially instruct the jury about admitted perjurious testimony and to apply the maxim \u201cfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\u201d to Fano\u2019s testimony. The trial judge refused to so instruct the jury, but he allowed defense counsel to argue the point to the jury. In light of all the circumstances and the thorough instructions given by the court, we cannot conclude the failure to give these instructions was error. Cf. Luna v. Beto, 395 F.2d 35 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">Finally, appellants\u2019 contention that the federal government was precluded by doctrines of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel from trying these defendants under these charges after the state court acquitted them is foreclosed by Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959), and Ab-bate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959); see United States v. Vaughan, 491 F.2d 1096 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">.
