Because in this case the two issues merge, we treat them as one, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The indictment charges the appellant with \u201cthreaten [ing] physical violence . in furtherance of a plan to obstruct . . . commerce by extortion .\u201d To attack his conviction he sets up the following logical construct: (A.) under the particular variant of the \u00a7 1951(a) crime charged, an indispensable element of the offense is a plan to obstruct commerce by extortion; (B.) the government\u2019s proof went to something else, to wit, a plan to make money; (C.) therefore there was a variance and insufficient evidence. The validity of appellant\u2019s construct depends upon an implied but unstated term. Since that term is wrong, the construct falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">The unstated term is that the \u201cplan to make money\u201d proved by the government is something other than a plan to obstruct commerce by extortion. That proposition in turn rests upon the notion that a specific intent to obstruct commerce is a necessary element of a \u00a7 1951(a) plan. That is not the case. It is settled law that to prove a crime under the first clause of \u00a7 1951(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government need not show that the accused set out with the specific conscious purpose or desire to obstruct commerce. United States v. Addonizio, 451 F.2d 49, 77 (CA3, 1972). We hold that a <em>plan </em>to obstruct by extortion, which the government must prove as a necessary element of a crime under the fourth clause of \u00a7 1951(a), need only be shown to be a plan to embark upon a course of extortionate behavior likely to have the natural effect of obstructing commerce. Since the government in the present case has amply proved such a plan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the conviction appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\">.
