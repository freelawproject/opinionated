Appellant had been apprehended as an international arrival from Chile at John F. Kennedy International Airport by FDEA agents; his suitcases contained 16 glassine envelopes filled with 13 pounds of a white powder substance. After conviction, he was sentenced on the two counts to concurrent terms of five years\u2019 imprisonment (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2)) and 10 years\u2019 special parole. It is unnecessary to state the facts in detail except as they bear upon the issues presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">The <em>Miranda </em>argument is not a new one in this court. The warnings were read to appellant in Spanish from a form, now happily no longer in use, which, the appellant argues \u2014 not without some justification \u2014 could have misled him in that it failed to alert him of his rights in the event he was indigent to have an attorney prior to and during the agent\u2019s questioning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>would have us hold this warning insufficient by following Seventh,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ninth,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tenth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and possibly Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> decisions on this point. At least six state courts have also found such warnings to be insufficient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Opposing appellant\u2019s position are decisions of this circuit, one of the most pertinent being Massimo v. United States, 463 F.2d 1171, 1174 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1117, 93 S. Ct. 920, 34 L.Ed.2d 700 (1973), as well as decisions of the Eighth Circuit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> probably the Fifth Circuit,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and at least five state courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are, of course, bound by the decisions of this circuit unless they cah be distinguished from the facts of this case \u2014 in terms of the warning itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In Massimo v. United States, <em>supra, </em>this court held proper a warning which said that the defendant had the right to talk with a lawyer before questioning, to have a lawyer present during questioning, and that \u201cWe have no way of furnishing you a lawyer but one will be appointed for you, if and when you go to court.\u201d 463 F.2d at 1173. The court, <em>id., </em>accepted the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Lacy, 446 F.2d 511, 513 (1971), that it is immaterial that an accused is told an attorney will be appointed later if he has first been informed that he has a right to counsel before answering any questions. In United States v. Carneglia, 468 F.2d 1084, 1090 (2d Cir. 1972), this court upheld a warning that advised the defendant \u201cif he could not afford an attorney, why one would be appointed for him if and when he went to court.\u201d This warning followed the statement that \u201che had the right to speak to an attorney before being questioned.\u201d In United States v. Lamia, 429 F.2d 373, 375-376 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 907, 91 S.Ct. 150, 27 L.Ed.2d 146 (1970), the appellant had been advised of his right to have counsel present during questioning and this court upheld the sufficiency of the warning \u201cif he was not able to afford an attorney, an attorney would be appointed by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Although the law among the circuits and numerous state courts is contradictory on this question, the Supreme Court, with only one Justice dissenting, recently declined to accept review of a case presenting this question. Wright v. North Carolina, cert. denied, 94 S.Ct. 1452 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissented with opinion from denial). The law in this circuit is, in any event, well settled and, absent en banc consideration, controls the disposition of this question against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">There is no substance to appellant\u2019s second point on appeal- \u2014 -that there was no proof that the white powder found in appellant\u2019s luggage was cocaine. Government counsel in opening stated there was a stipulation that if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>chemist were called he would testify that the substance was in fact 12.7 pounds of cocaine with a purity of 15 per cent. Defense counsel in opening said he was not disputing that a laboratory analysis would show that the white powder was cocaine. In his summation, he referred again to this stipulation: \u201cWe stipulated \u2014 agreed with the Government \u2014 that if a chemist were called he would testify he has made an examination of the substance and found it to be a narcotic drug.\u201d The charge of the court referred, without objection, to the stipulation \u201cthat the white substance taken from the suitcase is cocaine.\u201d While better practice would be to adduce the stipulation itself, the comments in the record here amount to doing so for all practical purposes. <em>See </em>United States v. Rodriguez, 241 F.2d 463 (7th Cir. 1957); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2594 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The trial court\u2019s \u201cconscious avoidance\u201d charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is said to be erroneous because it allegedly relieved the jury of the obligation of affirmatively finding knowledge. Almost exactly the same charge given at the trial of another case involving narcotics was considered before this panel on the same day and immediately prior to this one. United States v. Joly, 493 F.2d 672, 674-676 (2d Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Joly, </em>as here, it was argued that an inference of knowledge that naroctics were being transported is not possible where a number of equally supportable possibilities as to the contents of a container exist (jewelry, watches, gold, etc.). <em>Joly </em>upheld the charge on the basis that \u201cthe legitimacy of the basic inference of knowledge [from possession] does not automatically disappear because other evidence arguably points the opposite way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. Here appellant was a longtime airline employee; the suitcases seemed unusually heavy to him by his own admission; he testified he was propositioned twice by Galardo, a fellow worker to take the suitcases to a hotel in New York; and according to his own story he was to receive $300 for delivering the suitcases to an unknown party in New York. These facts justify the charge as given by the trial court and sustained in United States v. Joly, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-10\">.
