John William Acuff. On this appeal he argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The factual background of this appeal is as follows. Bozeman, a merchant seaman whose documents had been revoked, filed an appeal for administrative clemency and for the return of his documents with the United States Coast Guard. During the pendency of this appeal, he on occasion discussed its progress with Lt. Acuff. On June 1, 1973 at approximately 11:30 A.M., Thomas Williams, a clerk-stenographer at the office of the Coast Guard commandant in Washington, D. C., received a phone call from a caller identifying himself as Robert William Bozeman. During the course of a fifteen minute conversation, the caller twice threatened to kill Lt. Acuff. That same afternoon, after Williams had informed his superiors of the call, the Washington Coast Guard office briefed the Jacksonville office on the threat. When Lt. Midgett of the latter office called Bozeman\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Clermont, Fla., someone identifying himself as Bozeman answered, and, after being asked about the Washington phone call, his response, was, \u201c[i]f that is the only way I can get my documents back . to kill him, I guess I will have to do it.\u201d Subsequently, Bozeman visited Lt. Acuff\u2019s Jacksonville office. Two customs agents were present at the time<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one, Ledford, testified that he heard Bozeman say, \u201cAcuff was a sorry excuse for a human being or a man and that he didn\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d Another agent, Dukes, testified that Bozeman said, \u201cAcuff was a sorry excuse for a human' being and he should be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">Bozeman argues that the trial judge erred in not granting his motion for an acquittal because the government\u2019s proof failed to show (1) he actually made the\u2019alleged threatening call of June 1; (2) that a threat was actually made; and (3) that the threat was made knowingly and intentionally. As to (2), Bozeman relies on Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>L.Ed.2d 664 (1969); in which the defendant, alluding to the possibility of being drafted, stated to a discussion group at apolitical gathering, \u201c[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.\u201d The Court held that \u201c[t]aken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners [laughter],\u201d this was not the sort of statement prescribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While it is true that the statements made to Lt. Midgett and in the hearing of the customs officers were phrased in conditional terms, the testimony of Williams makes it clear beyond cavil that the June 1 threat, the subject of this information, was express and unequivocable, to wit, \u201cI will kill him.\u201d Considering this testimony in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see </em>Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1944), this statement meets the test of what amounts to a threat under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c), <em>i. e., </em>\u201c[this] communication \u2018in its context\u2019 would \u2018have a reasonable tendency to create apprehension that its originator will act according to its ten- or\u2019,\u201d United States v. Holder, 302 F. Supp. 296, 301 (D.Montana 1969) aff\u2019d 427 F.2d 715 (9th Cir. 1970), citing Landry v. Daley, 280 F.Supp. 938, 962 (D.C.Ill.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">As to (1), relying on,United States v. Smith, 5 Cir., 433 F.2d 1266, cert. denied 401 U.S. 977, 91 S.Ct. 1206, 28 L.Ed.2d 328 (1970), Bozeman argues that since there was no proof either Williams or Midgett recognized his voice or that he was physically -present in Clermont, Florida at the time of the June 1 call, the government failed to create a jury issue as to his identity as the caller. This issue is one often contested in 875(c) cases and \u201c[i]t is [clear] beyond dispute that identification of a telephone caller may be [established] by circumstantial evidence.\u201d United States v. Holder, supra; Spindler v. United States, 336 F.2d 678 (9th Cir. 1964); Seeber v. United States, 329 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1964). In <em>Smith </em>a voice identification and proof of Smith\u2019s physical presence near the phone booth to which the call was traced at about the time of the call were elements considered by the court as bearing on identity. However, our reading of <em>Smith </em>is that these are relevant considerations, not essential ones. In the instant case, Williams\u2019 testimony that the caller claimed to be Bozeman, telephone company records of a call from Bozeman\u2019s mother\u2019s house to a Washington Coast Guard number on the same date and at the same times as Williams testified the call was made; Midgett\u2019s testimony indicating an admission by someone identifying himself as Bozeman that he made the threatening call; and the customs agents\u2019 testimony as to subsequent statements by Bozeman taken together were a sufficient basis for a jury to conclude that Bozeman was the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Finally, as to his point 3, Bozeman argues that Williams\u2019 description of the caller as being irrational makes it clear that the government failed to prove that the alleged threat was wilfully and intentionally made. He is correct in asserting that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. 875(c) requires proof that the threat was made knowingly and intentionally. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. LeVison, 418 F.2d 624 (9th Cir. 1969); United States v. Dutsch, 357 F. 2d 331 (4th Cir. 1966); and Seeber v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>United States, <em>supra. </em>However, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see </em>Glasser v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Squella-Avendano, 478 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1973); was sufficient to support the conviction. On cross-examination, Williams did once use the adjective \u201cirrational\u201d in describing his evaluation of Bozeman\u2019s telephone threat. However, in light of the remainder of Williams\u2019 testimony, as well as the testimony of Lt. Midgett and the two customs officers concerning subsequent statements made by Bozeman relevant to the issue of intent, Dutsch, <em>supra, </em>and LeVison, <em>supra, </em>ample proof was provided of this element of the crime. In these circumstances the jury, which was properly instructed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> could have found that this threat was made knowingly and intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875 (c) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap9\">\u201cWhoever transmits in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aig\">.
