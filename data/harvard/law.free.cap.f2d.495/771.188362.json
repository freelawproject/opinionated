Supp. 280 (1973) sustaining appellee\u2019s claim that the subject merchandise was improperly classified. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">THE IMPORTATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">The merchandise consists of two kinds of transistorized printed wiring board assemblies, one invoiced as a \u201ccontrol board\u201d and the other as a \u201cprotective circuit board.\u201d Both assemblies are used as parts of a pulse modulation system for operating fork lift trucks. In such a system, the motor is supplied with energy in distinct pulses spaced at equal intervals of time through a solid state switch device in the battery circuit. The control board provides electrical pulses to control the opening and closing of the device. The pulses are varied in width by the operator to provide stepless control of the motor speed. According to appellee\u2019s witness Evans, the protective circuit board monitors the control board and \u201cinduces a large con-tactor to open the power circuits\u201d in case of malfunction of the control board.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">THE CLASSIFICATIONS AND STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The importations were classified under TSUS item 685.90 reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">Electrical switches, relays, fuses, lightning arresters, plugs, receptacles, lamp sockets, terminals, terminal strips, junction boxes and other electrical apparatus for making or breaking electrical circuits, for the protection of electrical circuits, or for making connections to or in electrical circuits; switchboards (except telephone switchboards) and control panels; all the foregoing and parts thereof .............17.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">The claimed classification as approved by the Customs Court was TSUS item 692.40, which reads in pertinent part: Fork-lift trucks, platform trucks and other self-propelled work trucks, * * *; and parts of the foregoing trucks and tractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-17\">Other tariff provisions involved are: <em>General Headnotes and Rules of Interpretation:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-18\">10. <em>General Interpretative Rules. </em>For the purposes of these schedules\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-19\">* -X- * -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-20\">(e) in the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-21\">(i) a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of articles of that class or kind to which the imported articles belong, and the controlling use is the chief use, i. e., the use which exceeds all other uses (if any) combined;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-22\">(ii) a tariff classification controlled by the actual use to which an imported article is put in the United States is satisfied only if such use is intended at the time of importation, the article is so used, and proof thereof is furnished within 3 years after the date the article is entered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">(ij) a provision for \u201cparts\u201d of an article covers a product solely or chiefly used as a part of such article, but does not prevail over a specific provision for such part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">THE DECISION OF THE CUSTOMS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The Customs Court held that the importations were excluded from TSUS item 685.90 \u201cbecause they are unrelated to electrical power circuits,\u201d relying on United States v. General Electric Co., 441 F.2d 1186, 58 CCPA 152, C.A.D. 1021 (1971). Accordingly, it was deemed unnecessary to consider \u201cthe common meaning of the terms employed in item 685.90 to describe the articles covered thereby.\u201d As to item 692.40, the court held that the provision for parts of fork-lift trucks in that item \u201cis not a tariff classification which is controlled by the chief use principle of general rule 10(e)(i).\u201d It then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">* * * General Interpretative Rule 10(ij) states, among other things, that a provision for \u201cparts\u201d of an article covers a product solely or chiefly used as a part of <em>such </em>article. Thus, \u201cactual use\u201d of the imported merchandise governs a \u201cparts\u201d tariff classifi'cation provision, subject, of course, to the relative specificity principle written into general rule 10(ij). And \u201cactual use\u201d is excepted from the chief use principle set forth in general rule 10(e) (i) relied upon by the defendant. In this connection, it is to be noted that our appeals court in C.A.D. 1021 sustained the \u201cparts\u201d classification contended for by the importer on the basis of the record evidence of the \u201cactual use\u201d of the imported parts without regard to any consideration of the chief use principle set forth in general rule 10(e) (i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">Hence, in line with the require- ' ments of general rule 10(ij), plaintiff need only prove here the <em>actual use </em>of the imported boards as a predicate for classification under item 692.40. And the court is satisfied from the instant record that plaintiff has established the imported boards to be parts of fork-lift trucks within the meaning of item 692.40 consistent with the requirements of general rule 10(ij).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asa-dedup-0\">Having found that appellee\u2019s evidence established that the importations were actually used in the manufacture of fork-lift trucks by the importer, Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, the court found the claim for classification of the imported control and protective circuit boards under item 692.40 as parts of fork-lift trucks to be sustained by the record, which included testimony of two witnesses for appellee and one for appellant along with certain exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">With great deference to the fact that the learned trial court heard the witnesses and observed the initial presentation of the exhibits, we think the court erred in its application of <em>General Electric </em>to the present facts. There the goods were jacks for insertion into radio circuits to convey audio signals to earphones. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-15\">We cannot agree with appellant\u2019s argument that rule 10(ij) requires that the provision of item 685.90 for \u201cother electrical apparatus for making or breaking electrical circuits\u201d must prevail over the provision for parts of radio reception apparatus in item 685.-22. This is because we think the Customs Court was correct in its holding that the imported jacks, used in low current audio circuits, are not specifically provided for in item 685.90 since the items enumerated therein all relate to electrical power circuits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">We then expressed the opinion that the jacks there were \u201cnot * * * the type of article [that] Congress intended to encompass by item 685.90\u201d and concluded that \u201c \u2018other electrical apparatus for making or breaking electrical circuits\u2019 in item 685.90, TSUS, is not a specific provision [rule 10 (ij)] for the imported jacks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">In <em>General Electric </em>and in Midland International Corporation v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>62 Cust.Ct. 164, C.D. 3715, 295 F.Supp. 1101 (1969), cited therein, it was held that the items in 685.90 relate to power circuits, as contrasted to audio circuits. There is no contention and no evidence indicating that the circuits here involved are low current audio circuits. The testimony of appellee\u2019s own witnesses is that 500 to 800 amperes may pass through the \u201cmajor power circuit.\u201d The control board itself carries five to ten amperes. The present importations participate directly in the operation of the switch elements that control energization of the motor. Thus they <em>do </em>relate to the main power circuit and <em>General Electric </em>does not constitute authority for excluding the present importations from item 685.90.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The Customs Court thus should have considered the common meaning of the terms employed in item 685.90 in light of the evidence of record, before holding the classification of the District Director erroneous. On examination'of the evidence, we are convinced that the importations are within the common meaning of at least certain of the articles in 685.90, including particularly \u201cother electrical apparatus for making or breaking electrical circuits, for the protection of electrical circuits, or for making connections to or in electrical circuits; * * * control panels; * * * and parts thereof.\u201d We therefore hold that appellee has failed to carry the first portion of its burden, i. e. to overcome the presumption that the District Director\u2019s classification was correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See New York Merchandise Inc. v. United States, 459 F.2d 1047, 59 CCPA 127, C.A.D. 1052 (1972); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2635(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">The Customs Court further erred in holding that the actual use of the importations in issue governs their tariff classification. That holding is not supported by rule 10(ij), supra, which limits the provision for \u201cparts\u201d of an article to a product \u201csolely or chiefly used\u201d as a part of such article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court apparently considered the reference to \u201cactual use\u201d in the parenthetical expression in general rule 10(e) (i) as creating an exception to rule 10(ij). But that parenthetical expression means that \u201cactual use\u201d is to be considered only when the tariff classification under review is <em>controlled </em>by actual use. Nothing in the law argued by the parties or in the evidence of record demonstrates that either item 685.90 or item 692.40 is so controlled. Hence, rule 10(ij) was fully applicable herein and appellee, to sustain its claimed classification as \u201cparts of fork lift trucks,\u201d was required to prove sole or chief use as such. The evidence of record does not convince us that the present importations are solely or chiefly used as parts of fork lift trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">The Customs Court\u2019s reference to our decision in <em>General Electric </em>as sustaining a \u201cparts\u201d classification is mistaken. The subject of \u201csole\u201d or \u201cchief\u201d vs. \u201cactual\u201d use is not discussed in that opinion. The decision of the Customs Court, which we sustained in <em>General Electric, </em>specifically held that the importer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>established chief use, as required by rule 10(ij). (63 Cust.Ct. 140 at 145)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Appellee has thus failed to meet the second portion of its burden, i. e. to establish that the claimed classification is correct. See New York Merchandise Inc. v. United States, supra. The judgment of the 'Customs Court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">. An effort, based on General <em>Electric, </em>to incorporate a requirement for use with electric power in TSUS item 685.15, \u201cinsulated electrical conductors, other,\u201d was not accepted by the court in United States v. Ampex Corp., 59 CCPA 134, 460 F.2d 1086, C.A.D. 1054 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">. Appellee argues in his brief that mention of \u201cElectrical apparatus for the protection of electrical circuits; control panels; and parts thereof\u201d in the District Director\u2019s reference to item 685.90, in affirming the classification in response to the protest, limits the presumption of correctness to the speci-tied articles. We think appellee\u2019s argument is wrong. It is apparent from the record that all the items in 685.90 were considered in issue throughout the proceedings below. Moreover, limitation of the presumption is not entitled to our consideration because it was raised here for the first time. See United States v. Superwood Corporation, 52 CCPA 57, C.A.D. 858 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b838-14\">. There is evidence that articles similar to the control board were sold to a submarine builder and to the Post Office a few years prior to the time of the present importations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
