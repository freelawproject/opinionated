On this point the opinions filed by Judges Tamm and Leventhal are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-18\">Following the reinstatement of the complaint plaintiffs will be entitled to a decree, but a question may arise as to its proper scope. No further legal question arises if the pertinent groups and officials of the Christmas Pageant of Peace conclude that the creche will be discontinued as to future Pageants. If the creche is retained, and the Government decides to terminate all sponsorship or connection with the Pageant, appropriate plaques should be ordered by the District Court, as set forth in Judge Leventhal\u2019s opinion. If the creche is retained and the Government wishes to maintain a connection with the Pageant \u2014 say, limited to the financial aid presently provided and/or technical sponsorship \u2014 it will have to prepare new regulations or amendments to the existing regulations. These regulations or modifications would have to be grounded in neutral principles and criteria that assure non-discriminatory definition of the events that are afforded any such Government aid or technical sponsorship. It is the opinion of the -Court, however, that if the Government promulgates the regulations and the Christmas Pageant of Peace qualifies for financial aid or technical sponsorship thereunder, such Government involvement will not be constitutionally defective.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Of course, any proposal for retention of Government connection with the Pageant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>have to be accompanied by a proposal for appropriate plaques.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Opinion filed by Circuit Judge TAMM in which Circuit Judge ROBB concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b132-6\">TAMM, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In Women Strike for Peace v. Hickel, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 29, 420 F.2d 597, 602 (1969), a decision dealing with the right of access to Government owned property, Judge Leventhal noted that the Government\u2019s co-sponsorship of the Cnristmes Pageant of Peace \u201c[might] raise more questions than it answers.\u201d One of those questions, specifically that relating to the First Amendment\u2019s establishment and free exercise clause, has been tortuously wending its way through the courts since July 4, 1969, and today hopefully reaches final disposition. Mr. Justice Powell has recently noted that cases arising under the First Amendment clauses \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting- an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\u201d have presented \u201csome of the most perplexing questions to come before this Court.\u201d Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, <em>760, </em>93 S.Ct. 2965, 2959, 37 L.Ed 2d 948 (1973)-Thus case, we unhappily anthropomorphize, is similarly disposed to perplex, confuse, and even frustrate, so sensitive and complex are the issues it pi-,- -'&lt;&gt;w</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">We will not unduly quantify uuv opinion with a re-recitation of facts already ably and extensively set out in Judge Leventhal\u2019s opinion herein, in the 1970 opinion of this court remanding this very action to the district court for further fact-finding, Allen v.

The propriety of that three-part test is well established, as Mr. Justice Powell stated recently in <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 772-773, 93 S.Ct. at 2965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">[T]he now well defined three-part test that has emerged from our decisions is a product of considerations derived from the full sweep of the Establish-V; Clause cases. Taken together these decisions dictate that to pass muster under the Establishment Clause the law in question, first, must reflect a clearly secular legislative purpose, e. <em>g., </em>Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 [89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228] (1968), second, must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, <em>e. g., </em>McGowan v. Maryland, [366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961)]; School District of Abmgton Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 [83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844] (1963), and, third, must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion, e. <em>g., </em>Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n, [397 U.S. 664, 90 S. Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697] (1970)] See Lemon v. Kurtzman, [403 U S. 302, 612-614, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971)]; Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 678 [91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790] (1971).

Judg\u00ab Levc 'tuai has pointed out in his opinion we are unable to follow \u201cthe familiar analysis of the intent of a legislature\u201d and rather must \u201cdiscern the purposes of activities of officials of the Executive Branch.\u201d Qur <em>de novo </em>look at the record has convinced us when considering both the stated purposes of the Pageant and the r~n/&gt;T,s of the Government officials involved over \u201eiio py.\u00b0t two decades as reflecting upon flic Govermentv ~dhor<em>\u2022mvi, </em>tc thus\" s\u00ed.ytfd. purpures, that the C-uvc-iui^rA\u2019s i\"vo,'rmi,f-i,t in <em>thn </em>Pag-</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>eant of Peace \u201creflect [s] a clearly secular . . purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The Pageant itself is an outgrowth of the traditional National Community Christmas Tree Celebration, and as the record amply demonstrates evolved in 1954 as a vehicle for bolstering tourism in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On a more philosophical level its continually expressed purpose has been that of manifesting this \u201cnation\u2019s desire for \u2018Peace on Earth, Goodwill Toward Men.\u2019 \u201d The Pageant is conducted each year at the approximate time of the celebration of the national legal holiday of Christmas, and is meant to serve as \u201ca visible expression of this Nation\u2019s aspiration to foster peace, understanding and friendship between the nations of the world and the American People.\u201d The creche itself, while obviously a religious symbol, is part of a commemoration of \u201cthe Nation\u2019s celebration of Christmas as a national holiday, by depicting all the traditional aspects of our national history associated with Christmas.\u201d While the creche is utilized neither to promote nor profane any religion, it is \u201cintended to be reverential to the religious heritage aspect of Christmas.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">These are the express purposes for both the existence of the pageant as a whole and the creche as one of its many integral parts, and they have been consistently stated throughout the history of the Pageant. We can find nothing in the record to convince us that the Government\u2019s involvement, which is similar in kind to its cooperation with other national celebration events, <em>e. g., </em>The Cherry Blossom Festival, the President\u2019s Cup Regatta, and the National Independence Celebration, is predicated upon any other, non-secular purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We note, however, that \u201cthe propriety of purposes may not immunize from further scrutiny a law which either has a primary effect that advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>religion, or which fosters excessive entanglements between Church and State.\u201d <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 774, 93 S.Ct. at 2966.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">II. Primary Effect</p>\n<p id=\"AEn\">The Government\u2019s participation in the Pageant is twofold: (1) Various Government officials play an active role in its management and organization, occupying two of the five positions on the Executive Committee, and two of the ten positions on the important Program Committee;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *(2) the Government \u201ccosponsors\u201d the Pageant and provides labor assistance in the assembly, dismantling, cleaning and restoration of the area, along with various materials and equipment for use in the Pageant. The expense involved is more than nominal \u2014in 1968, for example, the cost to the Government for the services it expended amounted to nearly $72,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since 1968, however, the Government has refrained from supplying any assistance in the assembly, storage, or maintenance of the creche. The Christmas Pageant of Peace, Inc. bears the cost of electricity used to light the creche and is solely responsible for its use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we find the former type of participation infirm under the entanglement test discussed <em>infra, </em>for purposes of discussion of the primary effect of the Government\u2019s involvement we will consider only the effect of its financial assistance and nominal co-sponsorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The recent <em>Nyquist </em>opinion elucidates that Government action may have multiple \u201cprimary\u201d effects, in the sense that the constitutional propriety of an action depends not on whether the primary effect is legitimately secular but on whether the action in any way has the \u201cdirect and immediate effect of advancing religion,\u201d or conversely \u201conly a \u2018remote and incidental\u2019 effect advantageous to religious institutions.\u201d <em>Ny-quist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 784, 93 S.Ct. at 2971 n. 39. It matters not in our analysis whether this may be considered a widening of the primary effect test beyond previous precedent (although Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s discussion should belie such a consideration, <em>see Nyquist, supra, </em>784 U.S. at 413, n. 39, 93 S.Ct. 2955) for our review of the record convinces us that the Government\u2019s limited involvement in the Pageant of Peace can have no more than a \u201cremote and incidental\u201d effect advantageous to religious institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">In Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973), the Supreme Court iterated the guidelines to be followed in administering the primary effect test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion [1] when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or [2] when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7\">The first of these categories recognizes that religion can so permeate a specific activity that its \u201creligious and secular . functions are in fact inseparable,\u201d Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 680, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 2097, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971), while the second recognizes that even if the religious and secular functions are separable, without proper controls (whose extensiveness vary proportionately with the degree of religious permeation, <em>see Hunt, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 734, 93 S.Ct. 2868) the Government involvement may nonetheless have a primary effect of aiding religious activity. <em>See Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 774, 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>S.Ct. at 2966, where maintenance and repair grants for parochial elementary and secondary schools were struck down because, as the Court stated, \u201c[n]o attempt is made to restrict payments to those expenditures related to the upkeep of facilities used exclusively for secular purposes, nor do we think it possible within the context of these religion-oriented institutions to impose such restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Supreme Court has yet to find aid to an institution constitutionally defective because religion so permeated the institution that the secular and sectarian functions were inseparable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It has noted, however, a very real distinction between the degree of permeation that exists in parochial elementary and secondary schools as compared to Church-related institutions of higher learning. <em>See Hunt, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 734, 93 S.Ct. 2868; <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 776 n. 32, 93 S.Ct. 2967; <em>and </em>Lemon v. Kurtz-man, 403 U.S. 602, 615-620, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). Yet, even in the instance of aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools, institutions which the Court referred to in <em>Lemon, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 616, 91 S.Ct. 2105, as involving \u201csubstantial religious activity and purpose,\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> aid in the form of secular textbooks was permitted in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968). In <em>Tilton, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 681, 91 S.Ct. at 2097, the Court specifically took note that \u201c[in Allen] the Court refused to assume that religiosity in. parochial elementary and secondary schools necessarily permeates the secular education that they provide.\u201d The Court has also twice specifically rejected such a proposition with respect to Church-related institutions of higher learning, in <em>Tilton, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 680-681, 91 S.Ct. 2091, and <em>Hunt, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 663, 93 S.Ct. 2868. In <em>Tilton </em>the Court enumerated factors which might suffice to invalidate Government aid to educational institutions under this category of the effect test. Among these were religious restrictions on admissions, required attendance at religious activities, compelled obedience to the doctrines and dogmas of a particular faith, required instruction in theology and doctrine, and a general purpose of propagating a particular religion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">While we recognize that comparisons of the situation <em>sub judice </em>with the aid-to-education decisions of the Supreme Court can be misleading, we do not believe that the record shows the Pageant to be the type of institution with which the Court was concerned when it spoke of one \u201cin which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.\u201d The governing body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of the Pageant, the Christmas Pageant of Peace, Inc., is a non-sectarian, nonpartisan, non-profit civic organization organized and promoted by the Washington Board of Trade; its reason for existence is not the furtherance of a religious mission, but, bluntly speaking, the furtherance of tourism in the District of Columbia; it accomplishes this through a Pageant celebrating the national legal holiday of Christmas, dedicated to peace and understanding and following the admirable theme of \u201cPeace on Earth, Goodwill Toward Men;\u201d the Pageant itself is not subsumed in religiosity, but rather the creche, the only religious symbol in the celebration, is one of many integral displays and is manifestly utilized only to emphasize the religious heritage aspect of the Christmas holiday; finally, although good motives cannot save impermissible actions, the Supreme Court has made clear that analysis of activities and reason for being can have a direct bearing on the permeation of religiosity in any institution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would be carrying the logic of the primary effect test to an unwarranted extreme to find in this case that appellant\u2019s proof that the creche was a patently religious symbol met its burden of showing that the Pageant is \u201can institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.\u201d <em>See Hunt, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 746 n. 8, 93 S.Ct. at 2876.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Such a finding does not save the Government\u2019s involvement with the Pageant from further scrutiny, for its association with the Pageant \u2014 an activity we classify as \u201csubstantially secular\u201d \u2014may nevertheless be prohibited because of its contact with an ostensibly \u201csectarian\u201d aspect thereof, the creche.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The Government, of course, must comply with the mandates of the Constitution. Where it becomes involved in activities that are subject to First Amendment scrutiny it must take pains to limit its involvement in such a way that it results in no \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d effect advantageous to religion. Failure to so limit its involvement can (as in <em>Nyquist, supra) </em>render such involvement constitutionally defective, and the degree of religiosity permeating the activity with which it is involved can have a direct bearing on what controls it must establish. As the Court stated in <em>Hunt, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 746, 93 S.Ct. at 2875:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lemon </em>and the plurality opinion in <em>Tilton </em>are grounded on the proposition that the degree of entanglement arising from inspection of facilities as to use varies in large measure with the extent to which religion permeates the institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Although that language appeared in the discussion of excessive entanglement, we find it accentuates the fact that we are involved in a balancing test, considering variables such as the degree of sectarianism in the institution or event with which the Government is involved, the extent of the Government\u2019s involvement, and the controls placed thereon<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that balancing test which determines whether the Government involvement has more than a \u201cremote and incidental effect beneficial to religious institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We do not agree with Judge Leventhal that the Supreme Court\u2019s admonishment in Levitt v. Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472, 480, 93 S.Ct. 2814, 2819, 37 L.Ed.2d 5091 (1973), that \u201cthe State is constitutionally compelled to assure that the state-supported activity is not being used for religious indoctrination,\u201d can somehow work to procedurally change the burden of proof as to the ultimate effect of the Government\u2019s involvement once the appellant has offered evidence that the creche is a patently religious symbol.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The relevance of our disagreement on that factor is minimal, however, for <em>de novo </em>review of the record convinces us that the evidence clearly shows, when considering the nature of the Government\u2019s involvement and the overall effect of the creche, that the Government\u2019s involvement is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">We do not dispute that the creche is an obvious religious symbol, nor do we consider lightly the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses concerning its effect upon them. Yet when we engage in the inevitable \u201cline drawing\u201d that this and other First Amendment problems require, <em>see </em>United States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8mm. Film, 413 U.S. 123, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 37 L.Ed.2d 500 (1973), we do not find the Government\u2019s involvement constitutionally infirm. In reaching such a conclusion we are particularly impressed by the following factors: (1) the secularized nature of the Pageant and, to a certain degree, of the Christmas holiday season itself; (2) the utilization of the creche only to manifest the religious heritage aspect of the Christmas celebration, as only one of many \u201ctraditional aspects of our national history associated with Christmas\u201d; (3) the presence of explanatory plaques on the grounds of the Pageant which state, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The National Park Service sponsors the Pageant on the basis that this National Celebration Event is wholly see-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ular in character, purpose, and main effect. The illuminated creche display is intended to be reverential to the religious heritage aspect of Christmas; but that display is not meant, and should not be taken, either to promote religious worship, or profane the symbols of any religion;</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">(4) the fact that the Government involvement is limited to the non-creche aspects of the Pageant, and apparently is similar in kind to that regularly supplied by the Government to other national celebration events; and finally, (5) the fact that the creche should not be considered in isolation but as an integral part of the whole of the Pageant, and that the question with which this court is faced is not whether the creche, considered in isolation, has a religious effect, but whether the Government\u2019s limited involvement in the Pageant \u2014 an admittedly secular event whose only \u201creligious\u201d content is that it recognizes the religious heritage aspect of Christmas by means of an admittedly religious symbol \u2014 has more than a \u201cremote and incidental\u201d effect advantageous to religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">III. Excessive Entanglement</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 674, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), a decision upholding the constitutionality of property tax exemptions for religious organizations, the Supreme Court enunciated an \u201cexcessive entanglement\u201d approach to First Amendment questions. The Court noted that \u201cthe policy of neutrality\u201d required by the First Amendment \u201cseeks to minimize\u201d a kind of \u201cday-to-day\u201d relationship between Church and government, and that the policy of tax exemptions for Church property was enhanced because it furthered the desired insulation and separation between the two. One year later in <em>Lemon, supra, </em>the Court elaborated on the approach and, in what has been described as a \u201cdoctrinal departure,\u201d treated it as a distinct third test to be considered apart from either the purpose or primary effect tests.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Lemon, </em>basically dealt with aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools in the form of salary supplements for teachers. The Court noted, 403 U.S. at 619, 91 S.Ct. at 2114, that the religious permeation in the schools was of such a degree that \u201c[a] comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that [the] restrictions [implemented to prevent the funds from being used for religious purposes] are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected.\u201d Noting that \u201cwe cannot ignore here the danger that pervasive modern governmental power will ultimately intrude on religion and thus conflict with the Religion Clauses,\u201d 403 U. S. at 620, 91 S.Ct. at 2115, the Court concluded that the prophylatic administrative contacts required would \u201cinvolve excessive and enduring entanglement between state and church.\u201d 403 U.S. at 619, 91 S.Ct. at 2114. Importantly, <em>Lemon </em>also recognized a second branch of the entanglement test, the possibility that such Governmental action will result in intensified \u201c[p]olitical fragmentation and divisiveness on religious lines\u201d because of \u201cthe need for continuing annual appropriations and the likelihood of larger and larger demands as costs and populations grow.\u201d 403 U.S. at 623, 91 S.Ct. at 2116. The entanglement test is thus concerned with both administrative and political ramifications of Government involvement, and is geared to minimize interference, monitoring, and any divisive impact among the people.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>While the contacts and conflicts inherent in the Government\u2019s position on various committees of the Christmas Pageant of Peace, Inc. amount to considerably less than involvement in the everyday working affairs of a religious institution, and considerably less than the constant surveillance and interference discussed in <em>Lemon, </em>we must agree with Judge Leventhal that the membership of government officials on various of the committees presents entanglement difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Again, the involvement we consider here today is novel in terms of Supreme Court precedent and thus does not fit well in the pigeonholes of past decisions. The test, however, emanates from the principle that Government involvement with religion should be kept to a necessary minimum, and that there should be avoided not only the actual interference but also the potential for and appearance of interference with religion. Judge Leventhal has enumerated instances where Government officials have been placed in (at best) awkward positions because of the conflict between their roles as representatives of the Government and decision makers on the planning and other committees. Although the officials involved have maintained an admirable \u201ceven keel\u201d and desire for fairness in dealing with the sensitive matters thrust upon them, in view of the limited purpose such membership serves and the goal of minimal contacts, and considering the conflicts of the past, possibility for conflicts in the future, and inference; some may draw from the Government membership, this type of activity should not be engaged in by representatives of the Government and is constitutionally prohibited by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Although the Government could completely put an end to any semblance of entanglement by terminating its role m the Pageant, we cannot conclude that such action is constitutionally required. When the Government disassociates itself from membership un various committees its involvement can be limited to nominal co-sponsorship in terms of labor and equipment provided for the construction and disassembly of the non-creche aspects of the Pageant. The administrative contacts would be minimal \u2014certainly no greater than those found proper in <em>Tilton </em>and <em>Hunt </em>\u2014 for there need be only so much as is necessary to assure that the labor and equipment provided is not utilized for the creche. Political divisiveness would be minimal (especially in view of the regulations that we require to assure continued neutrality), and although continuing on a yearly basis the involvement would not be subject to pressures i v increased aid by way of continuing appropriations of the nature involved in <em>Lemon </em>and <em>Ny-quist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Supreme Court has in the past been influenced, either when considering involvement from the standpoint of entanglement or primary effect, by the \u201cneutrality\u201d of a specific Governmental action. Thus, in <em>Wain </em>Mr. Justice Harlan in his separate opinion noted that \u201cnoninvolvement is further assured by the neutrality and breadth of the exemption,\u201d 397 U.S. at 698, 90 S.Ct. at 1426, and in <em>Nyquist </em>Mr. Justice Powell, when discussing the effect of Governmental involvement, noted, 413 U.S. at 782, 93 S.Ct. at 2970 n. 38:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\"><em>Allen </em>and <em>Everson </em>differ from the present cace in a se.-end important respect.

Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 684, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952) that \u201c[t]he government must be neutral when it comes to competition between sects,\u201d but we find no evidence that neutrality is violated here. The unrefuted evidence in the record is that the Government\u2019s involvement with the Pageant is similar to the cooperation it provides \u201cto other private organizations which sponsor the production of officially recognized national celebration events, such as the Cherry Blossom Festival, the President\u2019s Cup Regatta, the National Independence (Fourth of July) Celebration.\u201d This cooperation is based on a desire to further the secularized themes of these events, booster tourism, and best utilize the \u201cpark areas in the very recreational aspects to which Congress has directed their primary dedication.\u201d <em>See </em>16 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 20-20g (1970). There has been no showing that the selection of the Pageant of Peace (which attracts nearly a half-million visitors a year<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>) as an event to support is based upon any other purpose, nor that it has any other primary effect. To assure that this neutrality continues and is not the subject of continuing controversy, we require that if the Government desires to continue its support of the Pageant it must promulgate regulations governing such involvement, as set out in the Court\u2019s Per Curiam opinion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Accordingly, we remand the ease to the District Court for proper disposition in accordance with the Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-13\"> Judge Leventhal is of the view that while he does not discern in what respect a new regulation that comports with the requirement of neutral principles and non-discriminatory criteria could run afoul of the Estab-lisliment clause, he would prefer to withhold any pronouncement on that issue pending the emergence of such regulation and of any legal controversy that may take shape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">. <em>See </em>Allen v.

Our interpretation of the \u201csubsumed\u201d test is one which automatically disqualifies any form of assistance or Covernmental involvement with a particular institution because the institution is so sectarian that even what would normally be considered its secular functions are subsumed in a religious mission. In Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 680, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 2097, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971), the Court stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Under this concept appellants\u2019 position depends on the validity of the proposition that religion so permeates the secular education provided by church-related colleges and universities that their religious and secular educational functions are in fact inseparable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The Supreme Court has recognized that parochial elementary and secondary schools are institutions which closely approach this limit, although Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968), would seem to belie the proposition that separating the secular from sectarian is in all instances impossible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\">. Some of the factors which the Court noted in <em>l,eti-on </em>in reaching such a conclusion ore the prorimity to parish churches, the religious symbols and statutory adorning the school buildings, religiously oriented extracurricular activities, and the dedicated efforts \u25a0 of the nuns who comprised ai&gt;proxi-mately two-thirds of the teachers to provide an atmosphere in which religious instruction and vocations are natural and proper parts of the life in such schools. These various characteristics make the schools \u201ca powerful vehicle for transmitting the Catholic faitli to the next generation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b135-15\">. <em>See </em>Tilton v.

The second part of the primary effect test, \u201c[a]id normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion . . . when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting,\u201d Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973), recognizes that unless restricted and controlled, Government involvement may advance religiosity even though the institution with which it is involved is not subsumed in a religious mission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b136-14\">. The Pageant, as previously discussed, is not subsumed in a religious mission, but it cannot be ignored that the religious symbol contained in the Pageant can have a religious effect, and the degree of this effect can vary according to how it is utilized. In turn, the effect of the Government\u2019s involvement therewith can vary according to the restrictions and controls placed thereon. A balancing of all of these factors determines if the effect of the Government\u2019s involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>is more than remotely or incidentally beneficial to religious institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The creche as used in the Pageant is not <em>supposed </em>to have a sectarian effect in the sense of advancing any religious belief. The reality of the situation \u2014 considering its status as a Christian religious symbol \u2014 leaves open for debate whether its use is susceptible to misinterpretation, and the Government\u2019s involvement looked upon as an imprimatur of the belief that it symbolizes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b137-14\">. In addition to the <em>Levitt </em>reference, Judge Leventhal draws support for his burden-shifting theory from Mr. Chief Justice Burger\u2019s statement in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed. 2d 745 (1971), that the State legislatures created statutory restrictions designed to guarantee that the State financial aid supported only the secular educational function \u201cin candid recognition that these programs approached, even if they did not intrude upon, the forbidden areas under the Religion Clauses.\u201d Our prior opinion noted that \u201c[p]erhaps an appropriate accompanying plaque, rather than a mere explanation in pamphlets with lesser circulation, might serve ... to allay the impression of Government sponsorship of religious belief . . . . \u201d Allen v. Hickel, 138 U. S.App.D.C. 31, 424 F.2d 944, 949 (1970). We look upon such remarks as indicating only that the Government must recognize its burden to separate out the secular from sectarian when it becomes involved in activities that purportedly raise First Amendment difficulties. This it is constitutionally required to do. Yet, the appellant bears the procedural burden of showing that the Government has failed in its constitutional obligations. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 746, n.8, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2876, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973), and Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 681-682, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971), where the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to introduce sufficient evidence to convince the Court that the religious and secular educational functions of Church-related institutions were inseparable resulted in a failure on its part to carry the burden of proving that a primary effect of the Government\u2019s involvement advanced religion. Thus, although it is the Government\u2019s obligation to comply with the mandates of the First Amendment it is the jilaintiff\u2019s burden to prove that the Government has failed in this obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. <em>See </em>Note, The Supreme Court, 1970 Term, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 108 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. <em>See id. </em>at 172-78:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The important factors now excluded from the effect criterion \u2014 the impact of the legislation on \u201cvoluntarism in matters of religion, mutual abstention of the political and religious caretakers, and governmental neutrality toward religion and between religion and non-religion\u201d [see Freund, Public Aid to Parochial Schools, 82 Ilarv.L.

Mr. Justice Harlan discussed his theory of what \u201cneutrality\u201d requires in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 696, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1425, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970). (Harlan, J., concurring) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">Neutrality in its application requires an equal protection mode of analysis. The Court must survey meticulously the circumstances of governmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders. In any particular case the critical question is- whether the circumference of legislation encircles a-class so broad that it can be fairly'' concluded that religious institutions could be thought to fall within the natural perimeter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The Pageant of Peace, while certainly not a religious institution, is an event which \u201cfall[s] within the natural perimeter\u201d of those activities to which the Government has in the past rendered support of one kind or another. It is a major tourist attraction which enhances business in the District, utilizes Park land in a recreational sense, and fosters a principle \u2014 this nation\u2019s desire for peace and understanding \u2014 with which the Government can indeed associate itself. These \u201cneutral principles\u201d govern the Government\u2019s involvement, and we cannot find in the record evidence to convince us that the one religious aspect of the Pageant gives an unwarranted and unconstitutional effect to that involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">Absolute neutrality is different from constitutional neutrality, and thus statements that the Government is not \u201cabsolutely\u201d neutral \u2014 in that here it co-sponsors an event with a Christian religious symbol while it does not co-sponsor one with a non-Christian or, to the extent possible, a non-secular symbol \u2014 do not move me to automatically conclude that its action is constitutionally defective. The primary effect test itself is proof of such a distinction, for an action of the Government not \u201cabsolutely\u201d neutral between religions or between religions and non-religion is not automatically unconstitutional \u2014 it is subject to scrutiny to determine if this lack of \u201cabsolute\u201d neutrality has more than a remote and incidental effect beneficial to a religious organization. As Mr. Justice Douglas noted in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313, 72 S.Ct. 679, 683, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952) : \u201cA fastidious atheist or agnostic could even object to the supplication with which the Court opens each session: \u2018God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, such a statement is not absolutely neutral, yet is it constitutionally defective?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b140-11\">LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Au9\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Residents of the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia brought an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Secretary of the Interior and subordinate officers of the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Park Services, challenging the government\u2019s sponsorship of the Christmas Pageant of Peace held annually on the Ellipse, a park adjacent to the White House, as a violation of the Establishment Clause.

The views set forth on that subject in this opinion, like the discussion of factual background, are in essence incorporated by reference in the majority opinion filed for the court by Judge Tamm. As to purpose and effect, the majority find that there are no constitutional problems once the entanglement problem is removed. On the purpose test, although I share the views of the majority in good measure, there are some questions that are not resolved to my satisfaction, and which I would defer pending developments on Lhe dis-entan-gloment. On ih. issue of effect, I have even greater questions, uuc to my disagreement with the approach of the District Court in certain respects, but on these matters my views apparently diverge from those of my brethren.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">With that extended prefatory note, this opinion will pioceed in more conventional manner, beginning with presentation of the prior proceedings and basic facts concerning the Pageant, continuing with views on the entanglement, purpose and effect issues, and concluding with comments on the problem of disposition and \u25a0 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">I. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS, AND DISTRICT COURT\u2019S FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In a prior stage of this litigation, this court held that appellants have standing to sue as residents of the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia served by the park lands involved in this dispute. Allen v. Hickel, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 34, 424 F.2d 944, 947 (1970). The Court also held that the record was too incomplete for making a finding under School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) as to whether the primary effect of the creche constituted \u201csubstantial religious impact\u201d. We also left room for further factual develop-' ment as to the purpose of government sponsorship of the Pageant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">In remanding the case to the district court, this court indicated its concern that the creche be presented in a manner \u201cdesigned to obviate or at least minimize offense to the sensibilities\u201d of citizens who did not believe in the religious message advanced by the creche or who might find the very display a profanation of their own beliefs. We suggested the possibility that an appropriate accompanying plaque might be able to allay the impression of Government sponsorship and set the proper tone in the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">On remand, the district court, in a memorandum opinion of Judge Pratt, issued on November 3, 1971,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held as to the purpose and primary effect tests of <em>Abington, </em>that there was neither a religious purpose in the Government\u2019s sponsorship of the Pageant, nor was the primary effect of the creche that of substantial religious impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">On tho question of purpose, Judge Pratt found it to be secular, since the Pageant was intended \u201cto provide a col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>orful,event during the Christmas season which would attract visitors to Washington and thereby increase the business of local merchants.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">As to effect, Judge Pratt accepted the premise, substantiated by unanimous testimony, that the Nativity Scene is a religious symbol. John Wogaman, an ordained Methodist minister, and a professor of Christian ethics at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, testified that the creche \u201chas a deeply religious significance.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> E. James Lieberman, a practicing psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry^ Howard University School of Medicine, put it this way: \u201cThe creche is a symbol, I think a very powerful symbol of the predominant religion or group of religions in our society.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The conclusion as to religious symbolism was shared by witnesses called by the Government. Reverend James G. Kalaris, a member of the Program Committee of the Pageant, believed that \u201chaving the Nativity Scene at the Pageant of Peace is celebrating the birth of Christ.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Father Joseph Corbett, the Roman Catholic representative on the Program Committee, stated that, as a priest, he considered the Nativity Scene a \u201cbasic and central religious symbol\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that for him the commemoration of the birth of Christ was the \u201ccentral core\u201d of the Pageant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Based on this record, the District Court observed that \u201cthe dominant theme running through most of the testimony was that the creche is a religious symbol\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201cIt cannot be gainsaid that the Nativity scene, portraying as it does the birth of Christ, has religious significance . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">The impact of the creche, although a clear religious symbol, was diminished, Judge Pratt concluded, by the secular setting of the Pageant as a whole. Moreover, the court indicated that plaques installed by the Government subsequent to this Court\u2019s remand order played a central role in obviating any possible \u201cgovernment stamp of approval\u201d affixed to the creche display.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">The court also held that a third test, formulated in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), after our first decision in this case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that \u201cexcessive government entanglement\u201d not be present, was also satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">For reasons which follow, the <em>de novo </em>review of the record, which the First Amendment requires,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> leads to a finding by all members of the court that although the purpose of Government involvement was not to promote religion, Government sponsorship and participation in the Pageant and in the decision of matters relating to the creche, constituted \u201cexcessive entanglement\u201d with religious matters in violation of the Establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">11. DESCRIPTION OF THE CRECHE AND PAGEANT</p>\n<p id=\"b142-20\">A. <em>Physical Layout of Pageant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-21\">At the evidentiary hearing, uncontro-verted testimony established the physical layout of the Pageant of Peace.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Pageant is held in the Ellipse adjacent to the White House. Ellipse Street, which runs parallel to E Street marks the northern boundary of the display. Two boardwalks called the Pathways of Peace, running south from Ellipse Street, are the principal means of entry to the Pageant. These boardwalks lead to the center of the Ellipse, where the large National Christmas Tree, which is lit by the President in the opening ceremony, provides a .colorful centerpiece. Three spokes, besides those of the Pathways of Peace, depart from the Tree and serve as pedestrian routes to the other exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Directly east of the Tree is a stage where various cultural and musical events are held during the period of the Pageant. To the south is a reindeer pen and a yule log and fire area. The creche containing the Nativity scene lies directly west. Access to the creche is not restricted to the spoke running westward from the Tree. It can be reached from the reindeer pen by a walkway, or from any point and direction when, weather permitting, people walk on the grass instead of the boardwalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The creche itself contains the traditional Nativity scene; Mary and Joseph are seen kneeling over the Christ child in a crib with the Magi, shepherds and animals in attendance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The depiction is life size and illuminated at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">B. <em>Theme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In 1970&gt; the last year for which there is evidence in the record, the Pageant formally began on December 16, when the President participated in the lighting of the National Christmas Tree. Typically, the opening ceremony also consists of presentations of various singing groups, speeches of government officials, and religious messages in keeping with the meaning of Christmas. After the opening, the Pageant continues to feature groups presenting a selection of traditional Christmas music, but the heart of the attraction is the various exhibits which the residents and tourists in Washington can see by touring the grounds of the Ellipse. The creche, of course, is one of these exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">C. <em>The Plaques</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">Following the suggestion in our earlier opinion, the sponsors of the Pageant placed three plaques entitled \u201cThe Story of the Christmas Pageant of Peace\u201d at locations within the Ellipse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Two of these plaques were placed at the entries of the north-south boardwalks. The third was put along the boardwalk running from the National Tree to the creche. The latter plaque was 110 feet from the creche.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">These plaques contain an extensive amount of text about the history of the Pageant, its attractions and themes. In \u25a0the eighth paragraph there appears the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">The National Park Service sponsors the Pageant on the basis that this National Celebration Event is wholly secular in character, purpose and main effect. The illuminated creche display is intended to be reverential to the religious heritage aspect of Christmas; but that display is not meant, and should not be taken, either to promote religious worship, or profane the symbols of any religion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">III. THE ENTANGLEMENT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">A. <em>The Pertinent Facts of Record </em>The Christmas Pageant of Peace, Inc. was first organized in 1954. Before that time government involvement with the celebration of Christmas consisted of a presentation to the President of the National Community Christmas Tree, a practice which originated with President Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Originally, this tree was erected in the Ellipse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>where it is today. In 1934, however, the presentation ceremonies were transferred to Lafayette Park. In 1939, the event was again moved to the Ellipse. In the 1941-1954 period, the presentation program was conducted on the Executive Mansion grounds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">From its inception, the Pageant was directed by a coalition of three groups: government, business and clergy. The government played a pivotal role, through the person of Edward J. Kelley, who was Superintendent of the National Park Service when the Pageant was organized in 1954. Kelley was one of the original incorporators, General Chairman of the Executive Committee, Director, and First Vice-President of the Pageant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Business leaders associated with the Washington Board of Trade also played a central role. Three prominent members were incorporators, officers and directors of the Pageant: Edward R. Carr, President, Edward M. Kirby, Second Vice-President, and Clarence A. Arata, Secretary<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Washington area Christian clergy were represented in the original organization of the Pageant through the Archbishop of Washington and the Executive Secretary of the Washington Federation of Churches, two of the \u201cofficial sponsoring organizations\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Other clergymen from the Archdiocese and the Washington Federation of Churches served as co-chairmen of the \u201cCommittee for Religious Cooperation.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The organizational structure of the Pageant has not changed much since 1954. The 1970 chart, the latest in the record, shows government officials holding two of the five positions on the Executive Committee,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and Theodore T. Smith of the National Capital Region, U.S. Park Service, was a member of the Program Committee and Chairman of the Grounds and Facilities Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The prominence of the church, at least in the sensitive Program Committee, was reflected in its strong participation through Rev. Msgr. D. Joseph Corbett of the Archdiocese of Washington, Rev. De-metrios G. Kalaris of Sts. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church, and Rev. John T. Tavlarides, of St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral. These members of the 1970 Program Committee worked side by side with the government members, Theodore Smith and Clinton C. Price of the D.C. Recreation Department.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The sponsorship of the government is highlighted in the annual printed program of the Pageant,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and even in the plaques which were intended to minimize this relationship. At the end of the text on the plaque, the following appears : \u201cDedicated by the Pageant Sponsors, Christmas Pageant of Peace, Inc. &amp; National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The entanglement of the government and organized religion was not confined to the formalism of an organizational chart. The organization of the Pageant required a complicated, and almost inescapable, set of actions and decisions by the government officials involved on religious matters: Guidelines on the organization\u2019s principles had to be approved; speeches promoting the Pageant had to be made; conflicting views as to the prominence of the religious motif compromised or placated, and money or services donated to finance the Pageant\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In 1956 \u201cbasic principles\u201d were privately agreed upon, by sponsors including the D.C. Recreation Board, for the organization of the Pageant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The two \u201cbasic concepts\u201d were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">1. That the Christmas Pageant of Peace must adhere to the <em>principle </em>of the Christian concept of Christmas \u2014 the celebration of Christ\u2019s birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">2. That the Christian concept must be maintained throughout the Pageant <em>programs </em>and the Pageant exhibits, (emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The important point here is not whether the government shared these beliefs. In fact, government officials seemed to have been greatly troubled by the adoption of these principles.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> What is of concern is that government officials were called on by virtue of their office to participate in the decision of such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The Department of the Interior, which through its jurisdiction of the National Parks was the agency of government most heavily involved with the planning of the event, made available its facilities to publicize the event. While these releases dwelled principally on secular themes, the religious message, and particularly the inspiration provided by the Nativity Scene,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> was identified, if only to accommodate the desires of the religious leaders participating in the event. This planning and publicity activity of government officials occasions more concern than remarks of officials, such as the Secretary of the Interior, at Pageant ceremonies, since there is latitude in such remarks for purely personal observations. Still the problem exists that the Secretary of the Interior, at least on one occasion, may have been led by assistants who planned the event, and their awareness of the intense interests of the clerical members of the executive group, to draw attention to the \u201creproduction of the nativity scene, so treasured in this season and in the life of all Christian communities.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">The role that the Government officials played in the Pageant also required them to be involved with allocating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>space and time to various religious groups who wished to participate in the event. Before discussing the questions that arose as to the Pageant as such, it may be instructive to take note of the occasion that arose in 1967, when a Jewish citizen proposed that there be displayed on the White House lawn a lighted Menorah \u2014 the article that holds the candles in the festival of lights holiday of Chanukah, a Jewish holiday, typically celebrated in December, that provides an occasion for rejoicing and gifts for children. Secretary Udall responded as follows :<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">The Menorah has religious significance . . . [DJisplay of a lighted Menorah on the White House grounds could be considered by some as a form of secularization of this religious symbol which could reasonably and properly be criticised. In addition, there is the very serious question under the constitutional provision regarding Federal involvement with a specific religious activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Thus the Secretary voiced concern over the propriety and validity of \u201cfederal involvement with a specific religious activity\u201d on Government property. Yet the Government officials assigned a major role in planning the Program of the Pageant were involved in program decisions that necessarily made selections among faiths. In 1966 Karl Ben-net Justus, Executive Director and editor of The Military Chaplain, applied'for a role as a clergyman in the opening ceremony of the Pageant. He was informed by the General Chairman of the Executive Committee, which included two Government officials: <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">[A]t all past pageants, it has been the practice of the committee to invite the two ecclesiastical leaders of the Protestant, Episcopal and Catholic Faiths to present alternately the Invocation and Benediction. Similarly, Archbishop Iakovas of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America has traditionally been invited to offer a Prayer for Peace during the program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">We have felt that by calling upon these leaders, the spirit and religious principles of all Christian Faiths have been represented.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Decisions of this kind differ from those pertaining to choices as to who will give a ceremonial invocation at a purely secular event. An added significance is attached because the Government is charged with selecting a group of clerical leaders whose faiths are compatible with the religious message of Christmas. Thus, the Government letter indicates that in its judgment the \u201creligious principles of all Christian Faiths have been represented.\u201d At a ceremonial event any religious faith, Christian or non-Christian, is satisfactory and neutrality between faiths is more likely in view of the vast number of ceremonial functions to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">In recent years the Government, partially in response to objections raised by the American Civil Liberties Union, has terminated all financial support for the event which is connected with the creche.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, the Government does continue to defer costs not directly connected with the creche, which include preparing the area to receive a showmo-bile, setting up the many walks, platforms, deer-yard and building, setting the tree, electrical, painting, carpentry, horticultural activities, and keeping the area and buildings policed for trash. After the event is terminated, the government bears the additional costs of labor, material and equipment used for dismantling and putting the Ellipse area back in the condition it was in before the Pageant. Total costs for these services were $72,789.78 in 1968-69.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">These expenses were for the benefit of the Pageant as a whole and all its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>parts, including the attraction and servicing of those visiting the creche.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Finally, the record reveals how the Government officials enmeshed in the planning of the Pageant drew on their personal sentiments. It makes no difference whether the official was one whose comments on Pageant materials in effect advocate the centrality of the religious message,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> or was one who acknowledged a personal opposition to the stress on religion in the Pageant, but felt that \u201cthe overall benefits outweigh my personal views and that full participation of all persons and agencies concerned is essential to its [the Pageant\u2019s] success.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">B. <em>Application of Pertinent Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"A83\">As long as the Government officials participated in the planning and sponsorship of the event, they could not escape religious entanglement, because the inclusion of the creche was a sine qua non of participation by church officials, and their participation in turn, was an essential element of the Pageant. Church leaders like Monsignor Corbett and Father Tavlarides were of the opinion that elimination of the creche would be \u201canother step toward a gradual attempt to abolish the worship of God.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If the government was to preserve the event with their participation, their point of view had to be accommodated. Even Mr. Carr, the long-standing President of the Pageant of Peace, who had come to the Pageant through his association with the Washington Board of Trade, took the position that taking the creche out of the Pageant would be like taking Christ out of Christmas.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiB\">The \u201centanglement\u201d test voiced in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) and Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), issued subsequent to our first review of this case,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> requires that allegations of violations of the establishment clause be considered in terms of whether Government involvement with religion leads to an \u201cimpermissible degree of entanglement.\u201d <em>Walz, supra, </em>at 675 of 397 U.S., 90 S.Ct. 1409.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\"><em>Walz </em>involved the question of the compatibility with the First Amendment of New York\u2019s grant of tax exemption to organizations and associations promoting \u201cmoral or mental improvement\u201d, which included all churches, as well as a wide range of other organizations.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The Chief Justice began his opinion by declaring \u201c . . . for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment the \u2018establishment\u2019 of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\u201d at 668, 90 S.Ct. at 1411. These were the three main evils to be guarded against. <em>Lemon, supra, </em>at 612 of 403 U.S., 91 S.Ct. 2105. In concluding that \u201centanglement\u201d was not present, the Court stressed the neutrality of the involvement and the even greater dangers which could arise from not exempting the churches from taxation. Justice Harlan made clear in his concurring opinion, \u201c . . . noninvolvement is further assured by the neutrality and breadth of the exemption.\u201d <em>Walz, supra, </em>at 698 of 397 U.S., at 1426 of 90 S.Ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The principle of neutrality, to avoid the danger of aiding one religion more than another or the religious more than the secular, is a necessity if a measure is to avoid foundering on the rock of involvement. The forms of financial aid upheld in recent years by the Supreme Court were given to all institutions on a non-discriminatory basis. <em>See </em>Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947) (reimbursements to parents of public as well as parochial school children for bus fares in connections with transportation to and from school); Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) (secular textbooks for all children in grades seven through twelve attending public and nonpublie schools); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (funds for the construction of facilities to be used for clearly secular purposes by public and nonpublie institutions of higher learning). This principle was recently reaffirmed in Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973), where the Court held unconstitutional the New York programs for direct \u201cmaintenance and repair\u201d aid, tuition reimbursement, and tax deductions for nonpublic schools, because the effect of such aid was to subsidize and advance the religious mission of sectarian schools. Justice Powell\u2019s majority opinion made it clear that it was sufficient that this was \u201can\u201d effect; it was not necessary that this be the \u201cprincipal or primary effect.\u201d 413 U.S. at 783 n. 39, 93 S.Ct. at 2971.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Essential to the result in <em>Walz </em>was the fact that \u201ceither course, taxation of churches or exemption, occasions some degree of involvement with religion.\u201d at 674 of 397 U.S., at 1414 of 90 S.Ct. Church support of the state and government involvement with church affairs, a corollary of tax enforcement, were dangers avoidable by an exemption policy. This fear of administrative intrusion came to the foreground in <em>Lemon, </em>which posed the problem of state financial support to non-public schools for the cost of instructional materials, in specified secular subjects. In order to prevent this support from being used by religious schools to promote religion, there would be \u201cA comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance required to ensure that these restrictions are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected.\u201d at 619 of 403 U.S., at 2114 of 91 S.Ct. These were programs, the Chief Justice stated, quoting from Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in <em>Walz, </em>\u201cwhose very nature is apt to entangle the state in details of administration . . . . \u201d at 615, 91 S.Ct. at 2112.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">In refusing to grant the injunction sought here, the District Court found no impermissible \u201centanglement.\u201d Our consideration of the documents in the record leads us to a contrary result. The District Court focused, erroneously in our view, on the impact of religious leaders on the event, which was considered to be relatively minor.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In contrast, <em>Walz </em>emphasized that the broad New York tax exemption did not require the Government to \u201csingle [d] out one particular church or religious group or even churches as such\u201d. Unlike the \u201cbreadth of the exemption\u201d Justice Harlan pointed to in <em>Walz, </em>the case before us is marked by a particularization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the religious symbols permitted on Government property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Neutrality assumes minimal connection. In the case of tax exemptions the exemption carried with it less involvement than would taxing churches. Here, the Government could easily put an end to its \u201centanglement\u201d by terminating its role in the Pageant, as in <em>Lemon. </em>Its present relationship with the Pageant by its \u201cvery nature is apt to entangle the state in details of administration.\u201d When the dispute arose within the Pageant concerning the role of the creche, the Government officials, committed to participation in the Pageant, had to accept the inclusion of the creche as the price for holding together the coalition of religious, business and government interests.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Government officials are inevitably involved in decisions as to the role of the creche and the publicity about it, decisions that must be made with the consent of all Pageant participants. At present, the Pageant may fairly be described as \u201cquasi-governmental\u201d in character.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The defendant officials cannot fairly avoid this by reference to Hunt v. Mc-Nair, 413 U.S. 734-736, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2871, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973). That case upheld South Carolina\u2019s creation of an Authority for a proposed issuance of revenue bonds, the purpose of which was to \u201cassist institutions for higher education in the construction, financing and refinancing of projects.\u201d Scrutinizing the potential for entanglement likely to arise out of the use of such funds by a College, which the court did not consider \u201cpervasively sectarian\u201d, for capital improvements, the Court was unable to conclude that there was a \u201crealistic likelihood\u201d that the \u201cAuthority could become deeply involved in the day-to-day financial and policy decisions of the College.\u201d at 2876. In our case, of course, there is no need to estimate potential involvement, since we deal with a full record on this matter, a record that shows actual involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">IV. THE ISSUE OF PURPOSE</p>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">The usual inquiry in an Establishment Clause ease is whether a challenged statute has a \u201csecular legislative purpose.\u201d Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). In this case, however, we are concerned with the results of actions of the Department of Interior in co-sponsoring an event with the private corporation, The Christmas Pageant of Peace. This has two implications: first, in our search for purpose we must abandon the familiar analysis of the intent of a legislature, and instead try to discern the purposes of activities of officials of the Executive Branch, and second, we must evaluate how the purpose of other sponsors of the Event may affect our determination of governmental purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">The plaintiffs have drawn our attention to a number of statements made by Department of Interior officials which may be construed as indicating that their particular purpose in holding the Pageant or including the creche may have been religious.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> On balance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>members of this Court agree that these statements should be held analogous to statements of legislators which may indicate \u201cmotives\u201d but do not present the \u201cnatural and reasonable effect\u201d of Executive Branch activity. <em>See </em>Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224-226, 91 S. Ct. 1940, 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). Use of informal statements to show purpose appears to us even more treacherous an undertaking than in the legislative context. The Christmas Pageant of Peace has been ongoing since 1954, and various officials have made their entrances and exits. Thus, purposes and \u201cmotives\u201d may have changed over time, a problem not at issue in ascertaining the purpose of a single legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Turning to more objective indication of purpose, the Pageant as a whole puts its main stress on Peace, and it is fair to conclude that it is probably with this goal that the Government has participated.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Although the plaques may have to be discounted, as plaintiffs claim, because written in light of this litigation, their message announcing the purpose of Peace is one that has been continually repeated in the official programs of the Pageant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Moving on to the purposes of the private sponsors of the event, it appears that religious leaders on the Board of the Pageant have insisted that the creche and its religious message be included within the Pageant.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Also officers of the Pageant not representing religious organizations, such as Edward Carr, the President, have made clear that preservation of the religious aspect of Christmas is an important part of the event<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> True, the Pageant was sparked by the quest for a Winter Event to attract visitors and business to Washington.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> But once this was crystallized in the concept of the Christmas Pageant of Peace, the business leaders accepted, and indeed promoted, the theme of a religious event as a necessary ingredient of substantial significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">If the issue of purpose were decisive, it would be necessary to assess the significance of the objectives of the private sponsors to be combined project. In the one sense the Government lends approval to their purposes by co-sponsoring the Event, even if the Government\u2019s own purpose is solely to promote peace. On balance, it does not appear necessary in this ease to resolve the difficult constitutional issue of \u201cpurpose,\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark> especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>since salient considerations have emerged more clearly in our consideration of the \u201centanglement\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">V. THE ISSUE OF EFFECT</p>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">In judging whether the activity of the Government has a \u201csubstantial religious impact\u201d in advancing religion, under the standard of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963), two questions must be asked. First, is the state aid, in the form of sponsorship and management, as well as funds, given to an institution or event of such a nature that \u201ca substantial portion of its- functions are subsumed in the religious mission\u201d? If so, can the state involvement be successfully cut off from the religious aspect of the event to avoid \u201csubstantial religious impact?\u201d Thus, the Supreme Court has upheld forms of state aid going to colleges, Hunt v. McNair and <em>Tilton, supra, </em>whose functions in substantial part, were not subsumed in a religious mission, and where religious institutions were clearly involved, has allowed types of aid, such as textbooks and transportation where \u201caid may be channelled to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.\u201d <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 775, 93 S.Ct. at 2967. In order to evaluate the nature of the event at issue here, some historical perspective is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In November, 1954, at a time when it had been the practice to limit the official celebration of Christmas to the National Christmas Tree on White House grounds, the Special Committee on the Christmas Program, chaired by Mr. Kelley of the National Park Service, reported to the D.C. Recreation Board that the Christmas event was to be expanded and moved to the Ellipse. The Report stated : \u201cThe program will follow somewhat the usual pattern, with the exception that it is being moved to the Ellipse to permit installation of a Nativity Scene, of life-size characters . . . \u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The creche was not only the reason for moving the ceremony to the Ellipse, but it was identified as part of the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the Pageant,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> even though the \u201cprincipal attraction\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> was the National Christmas Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">On the basis of the record,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> it is plain that a depiction of the Nativity scene is primarily of religious significance and constitutes a \u201cclear religious symbol.\u201d It cannot fairly be put as a mere historical event. As one witness said, when asked to compare the birth of Jesus with that of George Washington, \u201cit would be difficult to parallel the two, simply because Jesus is looked upon as being divine, His birth was that of a virgin. The creche scene depicts the actual event, the occasion of His virgin birth, which makes it quite unique and quite distinctive from the birth of George Washington . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">In my view, appellant has carried its burden of showing that, for the Pageant, \u201ca substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.\u201d <em>See </em>Hunt v. McNair, <em>supra, </em>413 U.S. at 746 n. 8, 93 S.Ct. at 2876.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">Judge Pratt, however, assumed that plaintiffs must not only show that the creche was a clear religious symbol but must also sustain the burden of proof on the issue of whether the creche had a substantial religious effect within the context of the entire Pageant, including the plaques. In my view, this analysis reflected legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In our prior opinion in this case we stated that we could not determine on the record before us whether or not the creche could be presented \u201cin a manner designed to obviate or at least mini-. mize offense to the sensibilities of citizens.\u201d 130 U.S.App.D.C. at 36, 424 F.2d at 949. The implications of this kind of Government approach were touched on by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). That case involved state aid to parochial and private schools by means of salary supplements to teachers. Many of the schools involved had obvious religious missions. In order to circumscribe the religious impact of these government funds, the two states involved, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, attempted to create \u201cstatutory restrictions\u201d which required the funds to be used in the teaching of nonreligious subjects. The Court noted that \u201cthese provisions are precautions taken in candid recognition that these programs approached, even if they did not intrude upon, the forbidden areas under the Religion Clauses.\u201d 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111. The Court did not engage in analyzing whether \u201cthese legislative precautions restrict the principal or primary effect of the programs\u201d since it resolved the case on entanglement grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The role of such statutory restrictions \u2014or in the case at bar the role of administrative actions taken to dilute religious impact \u2014 is made clear by <em>Nyquist, </em>where there were no restrictions on maintenance and repair funds, and by Levitt v. Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472, 93 S.Ct. 2814, 37 L.Ed.2d 5091 (1973), where the Court invalidated New York\u2019s program to reimburse private schools for certain costs of testing and record-keeping. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority, stated that \u201cthe State is constitutionally compelled to assure that the state-supported activity is not being used for religious indoctrination.\u201d This confirms my view that the burden on this issue rests with the State. Although in the instant case some restrictions have been put on the use of funds, in view of the more extensive nature of government involvement, extending to both participation and sponsorship of the event, the Government must bear the burden of showing that its activities or planning of the event have successfully diminished the religious impact of the creche.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In my view, it was the assumption of our prior opinion and the fair implication of the reference in Lemon v. Kurtz-man, <em>supra, </em>that once the plaintiffs have made a case for a clear religious symbol a presumption operates that this symbol has substantial religious impact. The burden lies on the Government to bring forth evidence rebutting the presumption. In this case, plaintiffs introduced not only testimony that the creche was a clear religious symbol, but also evidence, by way of a poll, to show that the creche had a substantial religious impact on its viewers. The Government raised various methodological questions about the polling procedure, attempting to discredit the sampling, interviewer technique and validity of questions asked to the viewers of the creche. The trial court apparently assumed that if questions as to method left plaintiffs\u2019 poll with little weight on the \u201ceffect\u201d question, the plaintiffs had not sustained their claim. However, assuming that the poll added nothing to their case, plaintiffs\u2019 demonstration that the creche was a clear religious symbol left the Government with the burden, not merely of minimizing plaintiffs\u2019 poll, but of making an affirmative showing that the setting of the. creche in the Pageant diluted its substantial religious effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Three possible reasons were raised by defendants for believing the effect of the creche is diluted: (1) the theme and physical layout of the Pageant do not highlight the creche; (2) the secular nature of Christmas as celebrated diminishes the potential impact; and (3) the plaques make clear to viewers that the creche is to carry no religious message. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>While the creche was not at the physical center of the Pageant and played no role in any of the programmed events, the fact remains that large numbers of the visitors to the Pageant have easy access to view the creche: It is a \u201cbackbone\u201d of the Pageant even though it is not as prominent as the National Christmas Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In stating that the potential religious impact of the creche was diminished by its secular setting, the District Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">[the creche] is seen in department stores, commercial establishments as well as in public places to symbolize the celebration of Christmas, a national holiday. This fact makes it especially difficult to accept the contention that the display of the creche in the Christmas Pageant of Peace has a significant religious impact .... (App. at 32).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">I find this reasoning unpersuasive. Its unstated premise is that the creche as seen in commercial settings has no substantial religious impact. ,What seems equally, if not more, likely is that the commercial establishments that display the Nativity scene, a clearly religious symbol, do so in order to invoke its emotional message, as a motivation for purchase of contemporary equivalents of frankincense and myrrh. Whether the commercial establishments are involved in a profanation of religion is not an issue before this court. The claim remains that this is one of the effects of the Government\u2019s involvement in the Pageant. Although the use of religious symbols by private enterprise is not of concern to us, the fact that the Government is involved in the Pageant makes the effect of this symbolism a matter for attention under the Establishment clause. The very issue of proof in this case is whether a secular Christmas setting does diminish the religious impact of the creche. On this important point the Government cannot sustain its burden by mere assertion.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Turning to the plaques, which are in evidence, they are, in my view, plainly insufficient to show requisite diminution of religious impact. These plaques do not even seem designed for this purpose. They are entitled \u201cThe Story of the Christmas Pageant of Peace\u201d and the statement of secular purpose is buried in the eighth paragraph of a lengthy textual message. One is reminded of a waiver clause tucked away in an insurance policy. In view of this fact and the additional fact that there were only three plaques placed in the Ellipse, only one in any proximity to the creche, there is little reason to believe that their message of secular purpose was read by many viewers or if read had any impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The government at trial made objections to the poll that was conducted, on the basis that the pollsters could not be sure that each of the respondents questioned had read the message on the plaques and that, therefore, any results showing that the creche conveyed a religious message were inconclusive.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> If the Government had committed itself to the design and display of truly effective plaques, this question need never have been asked. Any reliance placed by the trial court on this point seems clearly misplaced. Perhaps a plaque or other means could have been designed to obviate the religious impact of the creche, but the Government did not show that these particular plaques fulfilled that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">VI. COMMENTS ON DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"AkN\">The court is unanimous in reversing the judgment of the District Court because of excessive entanglement. The question is as to the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">1. No further legal question arises if the sponsors of the event conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the creche will be eliminated from the Pageant of Peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">2. If the non-government sponsors wish to retain the creche, the Government could avoid all Establishment issues by severing its connection with the Pageant and merely treating it like any other applicant for use of parkland.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Department of Interior Regulations provide that upon meeting certain conditions, which the Pageant has met in the past,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> a permit may be issued. 36 C.F. R. \u00a7 50.19 (1972). Under the Regulations there seem to be two types of events, \u201cpublic gatherings\u201d and \u201cNPS event\u201d, \u00a7 50.19(a)(1) and (5). An NPS event is defined as \u201cany celebration, commemorative, or recreational event, sponsored or co-sponsored by the National Park Service.\u201d Apparently, the permit for the Pageant was issued as an \u201cNPS event.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">There is no reason why the regulation cannot be amended \u2014 or perhaps the \u201cpublic gathering\u201d provision interpreted \u2014to authorize an issuance of a permit to the Pageant, in the absence of Government sponsorship and support, assuming non-diseriminatory availability of permits to like gatherings. As was stated in Women Strike for Peace (I), <em>supra, </em>\u201c[p]arks are a particular kind of community area that, under the Anglo-American tradition, are available, at least to some extent and on a reasonable basis, for groups of citizens concerned with expression of ideas.\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">It is clear that some parkland, such as Arlington National Cemetery, is already available to religious groups on a nondiscriminatory basis. <em>See </em>Satiacum v. Laird, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 475 F.2d 320 (1972). If the Government chooses to make other areas available, such as the Ellipse, permits must be granted on the same non-discriminatory basis.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">Principles of neutrality and non-discrimination do not require all groups to have access to the same parkland simultaneously. Access to the Ellipse during the holding of the Pageant may reasonably be limited by the Government out of consideration to possibilities of disturbance or interference with the objectives of the participants.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Women Strike for Peace v. Morton, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 472 F.2d 1273, 1293-1294 (Wright, J.) and 1299-1303 (Leventhal, J.) (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">If the Government proceeds by terminating its supportive relationship with the event, a question arises by reason of the extent to which the government has been associated in the public mind since 1954 with the Pageant. Vestiges of this association cannot be eliminated by simple termination of support both because of the past association and the misinterpretations that might occur in the future as a result of the participation of government officials, in their private capacities, in the event. On remand, the district court will retain jurisdiction of this case pending a decision by the participants as to which option they will take. If the decision is to have the government terminate its relationship with the Pageant, the district court will enter an injunction requiring the government to post a new set of plaques. These plaques should be designed for maximum exposure and readability to the sole purpose of stating that the government in no way sponsors the Pageant of Peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>event. This message should not, as is presently the case, be obscured by a lengthy description of the origins and nature of the Pageant.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">3. If the creche is retained, and the Government wishes to maintain a connection with the Pageant, the majority is of the view that a connection limited to the financial aid presently provided and/or technical sponsorship would not run afoul of the Establishment clause provided the connection is established in accordance with new regulations grounded in neutral principles and criteria that assure non-discriminatory definition of the events that are afforded any such Government aid or technical sponsorship. As indicated in the footnote to the per curiam statement, while I do not presently discern in what respect such a regulation could run afoul of the Establishment clause, I would prefer to withhold any pronouncement on that issue pending the emergence of the regulations as issued and of a concrete controversy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-15\">. 333 F.Supp, 1088 (D.D.C.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. 333 F.Supp. at 1092.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">.

Part of the rationale for the decision was that the City Council had approved issuing the permit for religious reasons. In Paul v.
