We are of the opinion that the evidence, as well as the inferences properly deducible therefrom, does not prove knowledge on the part of the company that the discharged employees had engaged in union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-25\">It is clear from the record that the company has sold only part of its physical assets, but not its business. The company is no longer in business and has no place of business. There is no basis, therefore, to order compliance with the cease and desist order with respect to the Section 8(a)(1) violation, being 1. (a), (b), (c), and (d) of said order, or with the notices provided in 2. (c) and (d) thereof. The law does not require the doing of a vain act. NLRB v. Schnell Tool &amp; Die Corp., 359 F.2d 39 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Enforcement is denied with respect to the Sec. 8(a)(3) violation, and, subject to the limitation in paragraph four hereof, enforcement is granted as to the Sec. 8(a)(1) violation. It is so ordered. No costs allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
