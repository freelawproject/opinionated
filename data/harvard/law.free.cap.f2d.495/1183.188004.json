(Hammond), an Indiana corporation, and Gary Mitchener, an Indiana resident, charging unfair competition and seeking injunctive and compensatory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Cyanamid\u2019s complaint alleged, in relevant part, that Mitchener, a former employee of Cyanamid and the MacGregor Lead Company of Chicago, Illinois, a company acquired by Cyanamid, violated his \u201ccontractual and fiduciary duty\u201d to Cyanamid when he left Cyanamid\u2019s employ in July of 1971 and became employed with defendant Hammond\u2019s Hal-stab Division in Indiana, and that Mitchener and Hammond engaged in acts of unfair competition, in that the defendants \u201clured away\u201d certain of Cy-anamid\u2019s employees and \u201cconspired to unlawfully compete with plaintiff and to unlawfully use plaintiff\u2019s secret, unique, confidential and valuable methods, techniques, products, customer specifications, data, processes and systems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss Cy-anamid\u2019s complaint, <em>inter alia, </em>for lack of proper venue under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391(a). The district court denied the motions upon oral argument, and entered an Order on May 14, 1973, denying the \u201cDefendants' motion to dismiss the within action for lack of venue under Section 1391(a) of Title 28 U.S.C.\u201d and certifying \u201cpursuant to section 1292(b) . . . that this matter involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d Accordingly, the defendants filed a petition for leave to appeal, which petition was granted by this Court on June 5,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Concisely stated, the issue here is whether the plaintiff corporation Cy-anamid is entitled to the privilege of laying venue in the District of New Jersey solely because it does business in that state. The relevant venue statutes in this diversity suit are 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1391(a) and \u00a7 1391(c). Section 1391(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-10\">\u201cA civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought only in the judicial district where all plaintiffs or all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-11\">Section 1391(c) provides:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">\u201cA corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business, and such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-13\">It is readily apparent, and not disputed, that two of the three venue options available to a plaintiff under \u00a7 1391(a) are clearly inapposite under the facts as stated, for New Jersey is neither the judicial district in which \u201call defendants reside\u201d nor is it the judicial district \u201cin which the claim arose.\u201d And, but for the presence of \u00a7 1391(c), it could likewise not be argued that the third venue option of \u00a7 1391(a), plaintiff\u2019s residence, applies here, since Cyanamid is a Maine corporation and, it has long been settled that \u201cthe \u2018residence\u2019 of a corporation, within the meaning of the venue statutes, is only in the \u2018State and district in which it has been incorporated.\u2019 \u201d Suttle v. Reich Bros. Construction Co., 333 U.S. 163, 166, 68 S.Ct. 587, 589, 92 L.Ed. 614 (1948), quoting from Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U.S. 444, 449, 12 S.Ct. 935, 36 L.Ed. 768 (1892). Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S. 165, 60 S.Ct. 153, 84 L.Ed. 167 (1939), represented the only judicial exception to this proposition, in that <em>Neirbo </em>held that a corporation had \u201cwaived\u201d its right to be sued only in its state of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>corporation when the corporation obtained a license to do business and appointed an agent for the service of process in another state. This exception, however, as the Supreme Court was careful to point out in the <em>Suttle </em>case, <em>supra, </em>333 U.S. at pages 167-168, 68 S.Ct. 587, did not imply that the \u201cresidence\u201d of a corporation for venue purposes had been redefined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">With the passage of \u00a7 1391(c), as part of the general revision of the Judicial Code in 1948, Congress expanded the venue options available to a plaintiff in suits against a defendant corporation, clearly going beyond the <em>Neirbo </em>exception, by providing that \u201c[a] corporation <em>may be sued </em>in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business.\u201d It is Cyanamid\u2019s contention that the second clause of \u00a7 1391(c), \u201cand such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes,\u201d evidences an intention on Congress\u2019 part to completely overrule the long-standing rule of the <em>Suttle </em>case and its predecessors, thereby extending the expanded venue options of the first clause of \u00a7 1391(e) to <em>plaintiff </em>corporations. We disagree, and cast our vote with the other circuit courts which have rejected the same contention. See Manchester Modes, Inc. v. Schuman, 426 F.2d 629 (2d Cir. 1970); Carter-Beveridge Drilling Co. v. Hughes, 323 F.2d 417 (5th Cir. 1962) (per curiam); Robert E. Lee Co. v. Veatch, 301 F.2d 434 (4th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 813, 83 S.Ct. 23, 9 L.Ed.2d 55 (1962).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">Although we recognize that there is a division of opinion among the district courts <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the text writers <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1391 (c)\u2019s somewhat nebulous language, in particular its latter clause, we remain unpersuaded that Congress, and the eminent and thorough staff of lawyers assembled to aid in the Judicial Code revision, would have made the change in the <em>Sut-tle </em>rule urged by Cyanamid via such imprecise language and without a clear indication to that effect in the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">We fail to see how the language \u201csuch corporation\u201d as used in the second clause of \u00a7 1391(c) can refer to anything other than the antecedent phrase \u201c[a] corporation <em>may be sued,\" </em>when this language is regarded in its normal syntactical usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>The late Chief Judge Sobeloff in his analysis in Robert E. Lee &amp; Co. v. Veatch, <em>swpra, </em>effectively disposed of Cyanamid\u2019s syntactical contention as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-4\">\u201cIt seems to us more probable that the term \u2018such corporation\u2019 was meant to limit the applicability of the subsection to defendant corporations, for the corporations referred to in the opening words of the section are those that are sued, not those that sue. This would certainly be the more natural usage of the \u2018such.\u2019 If the purpose of the subsection was to define the residence of all corporations, plaintiffs as well as defendants, the expected mode of expression would be \u2018a corporation may sue or be sued.\u2019 Moreover, had Congress designed to give the subsection the sweeping effect urged by the plaintiffs, a term like \u2018all corporations\u2019 would have been used in the second clause, instead of the restrictive term \u2018such corporation.\u2019 In summary, we think it would be inappropriate to read something into the statute which could have been so easily expressed, had this been within the congressional aim.\u201d 301 F.2d at 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">There is absolutely no support in the legislative history for Cyanamid\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1391(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the writings of several of the principal figures involved in the revision of the Judicial Code, some of which purport to identify the important changes adopted, fail to reveal any intent to change the <em>Suttle </em>rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, since the legislators and drafters of the Judicial Code emphasized that the Reviser\u2019s Notes explained all changes in the law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is of some import that only one obscure comment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> affording no sustenance to Cyanamid\u2019s contentions, relates to \u00a7 1391(c). Under these circumstances, we must be guided by the rule of statutory construction as stated by the Supreme Court in Anderson v. Pacific Coast Steamship Co., 225 U.S. 187, 199, 32 S.Ct. 626, 630, 56 L.Ed. 1047 (1912), and later reaffirmed in Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 227, 77 S.Ct. 787, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957), in a discussion of another venue provision involved in the 1948 Judicial Code revision: \u201c[I]t will not be inferred that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their effect, <em>unless such intention is clearly expressed.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">Cyanamid nonetheless argues that despite the awkward language and the legislative silence, its interpretation of \u00a7 1391(c) should still prevail, for otherwise the section\u2019s second clause would be redundant. This is not necessarily true, as was noted by Judges Sobeloff and Friendly, respectively, in the <em>Robert E. Lee &amp; Go., supra, </em>and <em>Manchester Modes, supra, </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>The latter clause of \u00a7 1391(e) can readily he regarded as a provision intended to be used in connection with other \u201cspecial\u201d venue statutes, for purposes of defining the \u201cresidence\u201d of a <em>defendant </em>corporation. Such was the application of the clause in Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, 384 U.S. 202, 86 S.Ct. 1394, 16 L.Ed.2d 474 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Alternatively, although with perhaps less facility, the second clause could have been aimed at the problem posed by the facts of the <em>Suttle </em>case. There, a Mississippi resident brought suit in the Eastern District of Louisiana against a partnership whose members resided in the Western District, and a Texas corporation which had qualified to do business in Louisiana. Then, as now under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1392(a), the applicable venue rule was that in a suit against two or more \u201cdefendants <em>residing </em>in different districts in the same State,\u201d venue was proper in either district. Although the Eastern District would have been a proper venue district under the <em>Neirbo </em>rule in a suit against the Texas Corporation alone, the Supreme Court nevertheless held that venue was improperly laid under these facts. The Court emphasized, as noted earlier, that <em>Neirbo </em>had not changed the <em>Suttle </em>definition of corporate residence. Therefore, since the Texas corporation technically \u201cresided\u201d only in Texas, the predecessor to \u00a7 1392(a) could not be employed to make the Western District partnership suable in the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 1391(c) applies only to defendant corporations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">The Order of the district court will be reversed, and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1248-14\">.

The use of the word \u2018found\u2019 made said section 111 ambiguous. The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was \u2018found,\u2019 was rejected in Camp v. Gress, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">. In light of our view of the language of \u00a7 1391(c), we find no merit in Cyanamid\u2019s remaining policy arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Additionally, we reject Cyanamid\u2019s argu-' ment that either Pure Oil Co. v.

Both of these cases dealt only with <em>defendants, </em>and indeed the very language Cyanamid quotes from Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in the <em>Pure Oil </em>case tends to support the theory that \u00a7 1391(c) was directed at the problem of corporations as <em>defendants, </em>with no thought given to corporations as plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-8\">\u201cThe effect of \u00a7 1391(c) was to broaden the general venue requirements in <em>actions against corporations </em>by providing a forum in any judicial district in which the corporate defendant \u2018is doing business.\u2019 See Moore, Commentary on the Judicial Code 193-194 (1949) ; 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 80, at 386 (Wright rev. 1960).
