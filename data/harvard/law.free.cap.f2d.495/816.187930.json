The testimony presented before the bankruptcy court established that for at least one year preceding the filing of an involuntary petition in bankruptcy on May 28, 1970, Freudmann, a diamond merchant, engaged in a calculated scheme to purchase diamonds on credit and immediately to sell them, for cash, at prices below cost. In effect, Freudmann was \u201ckiting\u201d diamonds by using the proceeds of his cash sales to meet notes as they fell due. As a result of this consistent pattern of transactions, Freudmann incurred debts of $107,315, from May 1, 1969, to April, 1970. Freudmann did not deny these activities; indeed, in his testimony before the bankruptcy court, Freudmann admitted the essential facts of this \u201cPonzi-like\u201d scheme, as the bankruptcy judge characterized it, but disclaimed any fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"> After several hearings, Bankruptcy Judge Herzog found that the pattern of Freudmann\u2019s behavior evidenced actual intent to defraud the creditors \u201cat the end of the line\u201d and, accordingly, denied Freudmann his discharge. 11 U. S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, Judge Gurfein, in a well-reasoned opinion reported at 362 F.Supp. 429 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), found that the evidence .supported the bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding and denied Freudmann\u2019s petition for review. After studying the record of proceedings in both the bankruptcy court and the district court, we agree that the clear pattern of purposeful conduct amply supported a finding of actual intent to defraud. Once the evidence established \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that Freudmann committed acts to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, the burden of proving that he had not committed such acts shifted to Freudmann. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(e). We do not believe that the courts below erred in finding that Freudmann\u2019s mere denials of fraudulent intent fell short of sustaining his burden. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-6\">. Section 14(c)(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c) (4), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-8\">(c) the court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has . . . (4) at any time subsequent to the first day of the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, transferred, removed, destroyed, or concealed, or permitted to be removed, destroyed, or concealed, any of his property, with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
