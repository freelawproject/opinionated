MORGAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1151-21\">Rev. Temperance E. Wright brought this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the United States, the State of Florida, and numerous federal, state and local officials. In his complaint, as amended, Rev. Wright sought an injunction, declaratory relief and money damages for violation of his constitutional and statutory rights resulting from dissemination of certain information gained from allegedly illegal wiretaps. The district court, after a hearing on jurisdiction, dismissed the complaint without prejudice, and Rev. Wright has appealed. Finding that there are two causes of action' which plaintiff should have been allowed to prove at a hearing on the merits, we must reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-22\">In his complaint, Rev. Wright alleged the following facts: Some time between September and December, 1971, Bernard Garmire, chief of the Miami, Florida, police department, began an investigation of possible influence and corruption in the Dade County court system. In connection with that investigation, members of the department began a surveil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>lance of Frank Martin, who is not a party to this action. In the spring of 1972, Garmire asked for and received assistance in his investigation from E. Wilson Purdy, Director of Public Safety for Dade County. In May, 1972, agents from the Department of Public Safety and the Miami Police Department observed Martin in activities which led them to believe that he was exerting influence on cases in the Dade County courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In June, 1972, as a result of the investigation, Garmire and Purdy asked Reu-bin Askew, Governor of Florida, to request authorization for the interception of wire communications, in compliance with state and federal statutes, F.S.A., Section 934.01 et seq., F.S.A., and 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq. (Ch. 119). Specifically, the two law enforcement officers wanted to tap a telephone in a service station at 2200 N.W. 12th Ave., Miami, where Martin is alleged to have been conducting his influence-peddling. Governor Askew, on the advice of his legal counsel, Edgar Dunn, refused the request because of inadequate compliance with the relevant statutes. A month or so later, Garmire and Purdy renewed their application, this time successfully. On July 26, 1972, Chief Justice James C. Adkins of the Florida Supreme Court approved a tap on the gas station telephone. The tap lasted until August 26, the maximum time allowed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5). On September 1, 1972, Justice Adkins approved a new tap on the same telephone, which lasted until September 14. In November, 1972, Justice Adkins extended for three months the time for formal notification of the existence of the first tap. See, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">About the same time, Garmire and Purdy asked Governor Askew to appoint a special prosecutor to act on the information gained in the taps, which the governor did on February 2, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Before the governor granted the request, his legal counsel, Dunn, examined some of the information contained in the taps. Some time between December, 1972, and February, 1973, the federal government entered the picture. Douglas McMillan, attorney in charge of the Justice Department\u2019s Miami strike force, started investigating Martin, and gained access to the information in the taps. McMillan began presenting information to a federal grand jury in January, 1973. On .February 3, 1973, deputies of the Department of Public Safety began serving some of the subjects of the tap, including Martin and Rev. Wright, with inventories of information gained in the taps. On February 5, 1973, Purdy made statements to representatives of the media describing some of the information revealed by the wiretaps, and these statements received considerable publicity, which Rev. Wright alleges has injured his reputation and endangered his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">Rev. Wright\u2019s complaint contains four counts. Many of the allegations and requests for relief in the four counts are repetitious and confusing, but in essence Rev. Wright has asked for the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">1. A declaratory judgment that F.S. A., \u00a7\u00a7 934.02(8) and 934.07 are inconsistent with Title 18 U.S.C., Ch. 119, and the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">2. A declaratory judgment that Ch. 119 pre-empts the field of interceptions of wire communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">3. A declaratory judgment that certain activities of the defendants, including the tap authorized July 26, 1972, violated the same federal statutes and constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">4. An injunction against any criminal prosecution of the plaintiff based on the taps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">5. An order sealing the results of the taps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-15\">6. Compensatory damages of $50,000 and punitive damages of $1,000,000 to redress violations of plaintiff\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>. 7. Compensatory liquidated damages of $100 per day and punitive damages of $1,000,000 for violation of plaintiff\u2019s rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">After a hearing on jurisdiction, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice on the grounds (1) that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because no civil rights violation was alleged, (2) that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, and (3) that the cases of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971), and Becker v. Thompson, 459 F.2d 919 (5th Cir. 1972), precluded equitable relief in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">In paragraphs 6 and 7 above, Rev. Wright asserts two causes of action for damages based on the illegal wiretapping of conversations to which he was a party. One cause of action (in Count III of the complaint) is based directly on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and the other (in Count IV of the complaint) is based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520. The district court dismissed these two causes of action along with the claims for equitable relief without an extended discussion of the reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-18\"> Dealing first with the Fourth Amendment claim, Rev. Wright has cited no jurisdictional statute which would allow the court to grant any relief against the federal defendants. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). With respect to the state defendants, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, cited by the plaintiff, provides a cause of action for violation of the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) provides jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the Fourth Amendment claim for' damages against the state and local officials should not have been dismissed either for lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim. See, <em>Bivens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number> We now must face the question of whether the plaintiff has cited any jurisdictional statute which would allow the district court to award damages under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520. The only possibly applicable jurisdictional statute cited by the plaintiff is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4), and that statute applies only if \u00a7 2520 is held to protect \u201ccivil rights.\u201d We hold, as has at least one other court, Kinoy v. Mitchell, 331 F.Supp. 379, 382 (S.D.N.Y.1971), that the right to be free from unauthorized or improperly authorized wiretapping, being one aspect of the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), is a civil right, within the meaning of \u00a7 1343(4). Therefore, the district court did have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s claims under 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 2520.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\"> Defendants argue strenuously that since the interceptions in question were all authorized by the order signed by Justice Adkins, they have a complete defense to the action. It is true that good faith reliance on a court order would be a defense both to the Fourth Amendment claims, Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967), Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 456 F.2d 1339 (2nd Cir. 1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and to the claims under \u00a7 2520. Nevertheless, the validity of the defense is not determined conclusively by the pleadings, and plaintiff should have the opportunity to prove his case. Abramson v. Mitchell, 459 F.2d 955 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Having decided that this case must be remanded, we note in passing that since the district court held its hearing in this case, the Supreme Court has reversed this court\u2019s decision in Becker v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>relied on in part by the district court in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claims for equitable relief. Steffel v. Thompson, 42 U.S.L.W. 4357, 415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974). Therefore, the district court will reconsider its treatment of plaintiff\u2019s claims for equitable relief in light of this reversal. See also, Wall v. American Optometric Ass\u2019n. et al., - F.Supp. - (N.D.Ga.1974) (3-Judge court) [No. CA \u2014 16414, April 19, 1974],</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">Finally, Rev. Wright has not made allegations of fact which would sustain a claim for relief against any federal official. Therefore, the federal officials\u2019 motions to dismiss were correctly granted.

Calandra, 42 U.S.L.W. 4104, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-8\">Any person whose wire or oral communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of this chapter shall (1) have a civil cause of action against any person who intercepts, discloses, or uses, or procures any other person to intercept, disclose, or use such communications, and (2) be entitled to recover from any such person \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-10\">(a) actual damages but not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $100 a day for each day of violation or $1,000, whichever is higher;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-11\">(b) punitive damages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-12\">(c) a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-13\">A good faith reliance on a court order or on the provisions of section 2518(7) of this chapter shall constitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought under this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-15\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1153-21\">.
