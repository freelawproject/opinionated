Finding no error in the district court\u2019s ruling, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">According to the complaint and exhibits filed below, on November 3, 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Willie Thompson, who was then an inmate of a United States penitentiary, sustained a work-related back injury while employed by the Federal Prison Industries. He was subsequently hospitalized, where he alleges his injury was aggravated as a result of negligence and malpractice on the part of one of the prison hospital\u2019s employees. Thompson\u2019s claim filed below sought $250,000 damages against the United States due to the wrongful conduct of its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, the district court correctly dismissed the suit, since it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant\u2019s claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. It is well established that the inmate accident compensation system as set forth in 18 U.S. C., \u00a7 4126 is the exclusive means of recovery for a prison-employee\u2019s work-related injuries, United States v. Demko, 1966, 385 U.S. 149, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258; Wooten v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 79; United States v. Cole, 5 Cir., 1967, 376 F.2d 848. Despite the appellant\u2019s allegation that the negligence of the hospital worker occasioned further injuries, for which he seeks damages, he is barred from litigating the matter under the Federal Tort Claims Act since the cause of his original injury was work-related and compensable under 18 U.S.C., \u00a7 4126, Jewell v. United States, N.D.Ga., 1967, 274 F. Supp. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">It should also be noted that the appellant\u2019s claim under 28 U.S.C., \u00a7 2671 was filed almost immediately after the district court denied his action seeking compensation under 18 U.S.C., \u00a7 4126. This Court recently vacated that ruling and remanded the cause for further proceedings 'on the claim, Thompson v. United States, 5 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 1082 [1974]. Thus it is obvious that the appellant has this avenue of redress available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the appellant\u2019s action under the Federal Tort Claims Act is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
