The district court relied on Pasquale v. Chandler, 350 Mass. 450, 215 N.E.2d 319 (1966), holding that in a medical malpractice suit, the cause of action accrues on the date of the act of malpractice. On appeal, the single issue is a question of first impression in Massachusetts law: Does a client\u2019s cause of action against an attorney for negligent certification of title to real estate \u201caccrue\u201d for purposes of M.G.L. ch. 260 \u00a7 2A, at the time the certification was given, at the time of discovery of the misrepresentation, or at the time when any misrepresentation should reasonably have been discovered?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Pursuant to Rule 3:21 of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, we certified the above stated question to that court for a definitive ruling of law. In its opinion of April 8, 1974 the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \u201cthe cause of action does not accrue until the misrepresentation is discovered or should reasonably have been discovered, whichever first occurs.\u201d Hendrickson v. Sears, Mass. (1974), 310 N.E.2d 131. The court further indicated that \u201c[Wjhere as here the alleged defect in the certified title is a recorded easement . . . [it] is \u2018inherently unknowable\u2019 to the client unless he duplicates the attorney\u2019s title search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. The Court was not called upon to answer whether the appropriate limitations section is \u00a7 2 or \u00a7 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">Here the complaint was filed within two years of date of discovery, June 15, 1970, and was therefore within the limitations period under either \u00a7 2 or \u00a7 2A. Whether the misrepresentation, though \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d, should reasonably have been discovered earlier, and, if so, whether the limitations period of \u00a7 2 or \u00a7 2A should apply, we leave to the district court. It is in any event now clear that the complaint was erroneously dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">The order of the District Court is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
