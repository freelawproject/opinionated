On March 12, May 21, May 28, and June 4, 1971, assessments were made against the taxpayer totaling $140,831.5,9 for withholding and federal unemployment taxes for periods from September 30, 1970, to March 31, 1971. On June 28, 1971, pursuant to the written consents of its directors, taxpayer assigned and transferred all of its assets to Nathan Yorke as assignee for the benefit of its creditors. Thereafter Yorke proceeded to liquidate its assets. On August 25, 1971, the Internal Revenue Service filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County, Illinois, a notice of tax lien with respect to the taxes previously assessed, and on the same date served a notice of levy on assignee Yorke. The notice of tax lien indicated that the $140,831.59 in taxes had been assessed against taxpayer and that after demand for payment, the taxes remained unpaid. The notice of levy stated that the taxpayer\u2019s properties \u201care hereby levied upon and seized for satisfaction\u201d of the taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">On September 14, 1971, an involuntary petition for bankruptcy was filed in the court below, and a receiver was appointed ten days thereafter. The taxpayer was adjudged bankrupt on September 28, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">Three weeks thereafter, the receiver filed an application for an order requiring assignee Yorke to turn over all of taxpayer\u2019s assets to the receiver. The Government urged that the bankruptcy court lacked summary jurisdiction to grant the application on the ground that possession of the property held by the assignee had been in the United States since August 25, 1971, when it filed its notice of tax lien and served its notice of levy upon assignee Yorke. However, on December 9, 1971, the referee in bankruptcy ruled that assignee Yorke held \u201cinalienable title\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s assets and that the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s notice of levy was a \u201cnullity.\u201d Therefore, he ordered the assignee to turn over to the receiver all of taxpayer\u2019s assets in the assignee\u2019s possession. After considering the Government\u2019s petition for review of the referee\u2019s order, the district court approved the order on January 11, 1972, and reaffirmed its approval on March 2, 1972. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\"> Here the four tax assessments against the taxpayer occurred in March, May and June 1971. The notice of tax lien and the notice of levy both recite that the taxes remained unpaid after demand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These notices are regular on their face. Where, as here, the receiver has not come forward with any evidence suggesting that demands were not made, we will accept the recitations in the notices. Therefore, by virtue of Sections 6321 and 6322 of the Internal Revenue Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 the Government\u2019s liens arose and attached to taxpayer\u2019s property on the dates of assessment and demand. The liens were thereafter valid and perfected against all persons except purchasers, holders of security interests, mechanic\u2019s lienors or judgment lien creditors, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>the liens became effective against those four classes when the notice of tax lien was filed on August 25, 1971. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(a). The receiver does not assert that assignee Yorke is in one of the four protected classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">Under Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6331-1 (a), \u201cLevy may be made by serving a notice of levy * * This regulation does not go beyond the authority of the statute, which provides: \u201cThe term \u2018levy\u2019 as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure <em>by any means.\u201d </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(b) (emphasis supplied). The regulation was implemented by the notice of levy served on assignee Yorke August 25, 1971, which advised him that taxpayer\u2019s properties \u201care hereby levied upon and seized * * Thus about three weeks prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the property levied upon was reduced to possession of the United States superior to that of the receiver. See United States v. Pittman, 449 F.2d 623, 627 (7th Cir. 1971); Rosenblum v United States, 300 F.2d 843 (1st Cir. 1962); United States v. Eiland, 223 F.2d 118 (4th Cir. 1955); see also Youngstown S. &amp; T. Co. v. Patterson-E.-C. of Ind., 227 F.Supp. 208, 217 (N.D.Ind. 1963); Consumers Power Co. v. Rubiner, 225 F.Supp. 926, 929 (E.D.Mich. 1963); United States v. Manufacturers National Bank, 198 F.Supp. 157 (N.D.N.Y.1961); In re Venda Manufacturing, Inc., 60-2 U.S. Tax Cas., |f 9480 (S.D. Cal.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">The receiver insists that actual possession is necessary to remove the Government\u2019s tax liens from the subordinate priority accorded them under Section 67c(3) of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, <em>Eiland </em>and <em>Rosenblum </em>are squarely to the contrary with respect to intangibles (such as involved here) and we consider them persuasive. As Judges Parker and Woodbury there pointed out, contrary cases relied upon by the present taxpayer dealt either with tangible property or with different language contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or state tax laws. See Givan v. Cripe, 187 F.2d 225 (7th Cir. 1951); United States v. O\u2019Dell, 160 F.2d 304 (6th Cir. 1947); City of New York v. Hall, 139 F.2d 935 (2d Cir. 1944); see also Division of Labor Law Enforcement v. Goggin, 165 F.2d 155 (9th Cir. 1947), reversed on other grounds, 336 U.S. 118, 69 S.Ct. 469, 93 L.Ed. 543. It is also significant that even <em>Givan </em>and <em>O\u2019Dell </em>recognized that possession could be either actual or constructive. Those cases contemplated that the levy would be complete when the Government had served a warrant of distraint in addition to its notice of levy. We see no reason why the language necessary to create constructive possession may not be printed in full on one piece of paper. Historically, service of notice has been sufficient to seize a debt. Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 297, 78 U.S. 268, 297, 20 L.Ed. 135. Finally, Judge Pell\u2019s careful discussion in <em>Pittman </em>demonstrates that under the Internal Revenue Code, levy is equivalent to seizure and gives the Government full legal rights in the property levied upon. 449 F.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-15\">Since possession of the property resided in the United States as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>the receiver, the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction summarily to adjudicate the controversy without the Government\u2019s consent. Cline v. Kaplan, 323 U.S. 97, 99, 65 S.Ct. 67, 89 L.Ed. 558; In re American National Trust, 426 F.2d 1059, 1065 (7th Cir. 1970). The United States is now entitled to have its claim adjudicated in a plenary suit. We respectfully decline to follow the contrary holding in In re United General Wood Products Corp., 483 F.2d 975 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">The district court\u2019s order approving the turnover order is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">.
