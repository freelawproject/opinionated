In this appeal he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. He further contends that the court erred (1) in failing to instruct on the weight to be given the testimony of an accomplice; (2) in giving an erroneous instruction on \u201cputting in jeopardy\u201d and (3) in refusing to give a lesser included offense instruction on the crime of larceny of a bank, 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2113(b). Finally he contends that the remarks of government counsel in final argument constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">On May 16, 1972 the East Des Moines National Bank branch at Pleasant Hill, Iowa, was robbed of $16,295. Two robbers entered the bank. One seized a customer and held a gun at her neck. The other robber pointed a gun at the branch manager. The robbers, later identified as Philip Carnes and Thomas Ellsworth Small, fled the bank and were observed making their getaway in an orange Chevelle with a black top.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">At the trial Small and Robert Daniel Smith both testified that they conspired with Carnes and appellant Cady to rob the bank. Smith testified that Cady\u2019s role was to obtain a car to be used in the robbery. He also testified that Cady knew the Pleasant Hill branch was the target bank. Cady delivered the car to Smith\u2019s house on the morning of the robbery, and, according to Smith, wiped off the door handles of the car. Carnes and Small left in the Chevelle; Smith followed in his Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">After the robbery Smith, Small and Carnes met and divided the loot. Smith testified that Carnes handed him $1,500, stating \u201cHere\u2019s fifteen hundred for Cady\u201d. Small testified that the agreement had been to pay Cady $1,000 for providing the car. Smith testified that he called Cady, met him at a tavern and drove back to Smith\u2019s house, where Cady was given the $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">Carnes testified for the defense, corroborating the details of the actual robbery, but exculpating Cady from any knowing participation. He testified that he told Cady that he needed to borrow a car for a few days to get around to see friends to borrow money; that he never at any time discussed robbing a bank with the defendant. He testified that arrangements to borrow the car were made over the telephone, and that Smith and another person actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>picked up the automobile. He testified that none of the money went to Cady. Carnes, a prison escapee, testified that he only told Cady that he was out on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Two guns were used in the robbery. Small testified that the gun used by Carnes was loaded while his was not, and that as far as he knew, both guns were supplied by Cady. Carnes testified that at least one gun was loaded, but testified that Smith supplied one gun and he the other. Smith testified that he overheard a conversation between Carnes and Cady in which Carnes asked Cady whether he, Cady, had obtained the gun from a museum because, he Carnes, could get no shells for it.</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">Cady did not take the stand. With the conflicting testimony of the participants, the circumstances surrounding the furnishing of the car by Cady take on crucial importance. Gary Steward, a used car salesman for M &amp; W Motors, testified that he first met Cady about May 1, 1972, when Cady visited his lot in search of a car. He came in several more times. On May 15 Steward told Cady about his brother\u2019s Chevelle, which had been placed on the lot for sale, but was on loan on that particular day. Cady told him he would want a car the next day. Steward testified as follows on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">Q Did he [Cady] discuss anything about what the car was going to be used for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">A Well, he didn\u2019t come right straight out and tell me that he was going to rob a bank with the ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">Q What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">A Well, he said something to the effect that he said he knew where there was a fellow that hauled some money back and forth in the trunk of his car to the grocery store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">Q And what did he say about that hauling that money back and forth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">A Well, I was under the impression that he was going\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">MR. LAVORATO: I object to this impression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-14\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-15\">Q What was the specific things that he said other than just hauling the money back and forth to the store ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-16\">A Well, I don\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t come right straight out and tell me that he was going to rob anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-17\">Q Where did he say the bank \u2014 the money, was coming from that was going to go to the store ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-18\">A I believe he said he, the fellow, was picking the money up at a bank and hauling it to a grocery store, to open the business, and he hauled the money in the trunk of his car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-19\">Cady told Steward he wanted the car for a c\u00f3uple of hours and might even buy the car. Steward called Mike Bach, the lendee, to say that a fellow was coming to pick up the car. He then gave Cady the address where the car was located. Mrs. Bach could not identify Cady in the courtroom as the man who picked up the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-20\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b808-21\">On the evidence adduced at the trial the court properly rejected Cady\u2019s motions for a directed verdict. While the evidence was conflicting, there was ample evidence from which, if believed, the jury could find that Cady knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted a bank robbery of a federally insured bank, an offense aggravated by placing in jeopardy the lives of one or more persons by means of two guns, at least one of which was loaded. The weight and credibility of the testimony was for the jury. Appellant concedes that a conviction can rest upon uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice if it is not otherwise incredible or unsubstantial on its face. United States v. Cole, 449 F.2d 194, 197 (8th Cir. 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Woodard v. United States, 405 U.S. 931, 92 S.Ct. 987, 30 L.Ed.2d 806 (1972). The testimony of gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>ernment witnesses was consistent. Prior inconsistent statements were placed before the jury; the jury obviously accorded weight and credibility to their in-trial testimony. In any event, corroboration can be found in the testimony of the car salesman, to whom Cady clearly implied a sinister purpose and disclosed a time requirement consistent with the bank robbery plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">ACCOMPLICE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\"> Appellant contends that it was plain error not to instruct the jury that under the law Smith and Small were accomplices and hence their particular testimony should be received with caution and weighed with great care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instruction No. 9 fully and accurately instructed the jury on the weight to be given to the testimony of an accomplice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant contends, however, that since Instruction No. 12 dealing with the essential elements of the offense named only Small and Carnes, and did not name Smith, it was possible for a jury to conclude that Smith was not an accomplice. This contention is without merit. Small and Carnes were mentioned only in connection with their roles in supplying the necessary elements of the offense of bank robbery; Instruction No. 9 could not mislead the jury, and any fair application of it to the facts in this case would include Smith as an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">PUTTING IN JEOPARDY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Appellant was charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), the aggravated \u201cassault\u201d provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In instructing the jury on the additional elements necessary to constitute the aggravated offense, the court defined \u201cdangerous weapon or device\u201d and to \u201cput in jeopardy the life\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">Instruction No. 16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI-P\">A \u2018dangerous weapon or device\u2019 includes anything capable of being readily operated, manipulated, wielded, or otherwise used by one or more persons to inflict severe bodily harm or injury upon another person. So, an operable firearm, such as a pistol, revolver, or other \u2018gun\u2019, capable of firing a bullet or other \u2018ammunition\u2019, may be found to be a dangerous weapon or device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">To \u2018put in jeopardy the life\u2019 of a person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device means, then, to expose such person to a risk of death, or to the fear of death, by the use of such dangerous weapon or device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Appellant contends that, although not objected to, this instruction constituted \u201cplain error\u201d under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) because it failed to instruct the jury that the robber must have had the <em>objective capability </em>of causing physical harm by the means threatened. The Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Circuit has adopted this construction of subsection (d), holding that unless a finding was required that lives were objectively in danger, as distinguished from mere fear of injury, subsection (d) would have no different meaning from subsection (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which prohibits robbery \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d United States v. Marshall, 427 F.2d 434 (2d Cir. 1970). This court reached a similar conclusion in Bradley v. United States, 447 F.2d 264 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated, 404 U.S. 567, 92 S.Ct. 746, 30 L.Ed.2d 722 (1972), which involved the use of a simulated bomb.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For a contrary result, <em>see </em>United States v. Beasley, 438 F.2d 1279 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 866, 92 S.Ct. 124, 30 L.Ed.2d 110 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>(d) Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The Fifth Circuit has held that in the highly charged atmosphere of a bank robbery by robbers bearing guns, persons present are placed \u201cin jeopardy\u201d as a matter of law. Baker v. United States, 412 F.2d 1069, 1071-72 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1018, 90 S.Ct. 583, 24 L.Ed.2d 509 (1970). It has been held that it is not necessary to show that a weapon is loaded to permit finding that life had been placed in jeopardy, United States v. Shelton, 465 F.2d 361 (4th Cir. 1972); that when a firearm is drawn as though to be used, the test is met, United States v. Marchbanks, 469 F.2d 72 (5th Cir. 1972); and that when a gun is visible and it backs the robber\u2019s demands, the jury may find that the life of the person so accosted is \u201cin jeopardy\u201d, United States v. Roustio, 455 F.2d 366 (7th Cir. 1972). <em>See also </em>United States v. Thomas, 455 F.2d 320 (6th Cir. 1972), where it was held that the government had no burden of showing that the guns so used were operable and loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">While we are free to consider anew the appropriate rule for this circuit,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we need not do so here because the evidence was undisputed that at least one of the guns used in the robbery was loaded. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Marchbanks, <em>supra. </em>Smith testified that he was with Carnes when Carnes acquired shells for the .38 revolver which Carnes later pointed at the bank customer\u2019s head. Small testified that the gun was loaded. Carnes, a defense witness, testified only that the gun used by Small was not loaded. It is reasonable to infer that if Carnes\u2019 gun was not in fact loaded, and hence arguably objectively incapable of causing harm, the defense would have elicited such testimony from its own witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">Direct evidence [that a gun is loaded] is unnecessary. \u2018When * * * a robber displays a gun to back up his demands, he wants the victim to believe that it is loaded, and the fact-finder may fairly infer that it was.\u2019 Wagner v. United States, 264 F.2d 524, 530, n. 8 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 360 U.S. 936, 79 S.Ct. 1459, 3 L.Ed.2d 1548 (1959); Wheeler v. United States, 317 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir. 1963). The defendant introduced no evidence to show that the guns were not loaded and, therefore, the jury could properly infer that they were loaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">Morrow v. United States, 408 F.2d 1390, 1391 (8th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">In <em>Bradley, </em>the instruction was not an issue. There simply was no proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the paper bomb was objectively a dangerous weapon. In United States v. Marshall, <em>supra, </em>in which the court applied the objective test, there was no evidence that the gun was loaded and the defendant had remarked that it was not. The court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s <em>per se </em>test and held that it was a question of fact for the jury; in the absence of proof that the gun was loaded, the court held it was plain error to instruct the jury that a person could be put \u201cin jeopardy\u201d by <em>fear </em>of death or injury rather than the existence of an objective state of danger. In so holding, Judge Lum-bard cautioned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-4\">In light of the permissible inference that we have said may be used to find that the guns used during a robbery are loaded, we would be quick to find harmless error here if we were convinced that the jury would have found that guns were loaded and accordingly, that lives had been \u2018in jeopardy.\u2019 427 F.2d at 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The facts in this case are thus readily distinguishable from <em>Bradley, </em>where the paper bomb was objectively incapable of causing harm, and from <em>Marshall, </em>where there was no proof at all that the gun was loaded. <em>See </em>United States v. Waters, 461 F.2d 248 (10th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Robins v. United States, 409 U.S. 880, 93 S.Ct. 207, 34 L.Ed.2d 134 (1972). We hold that where, as here, there is undisputed evidence that one gun was loaded and the lives of persons were thus by any standard objectively in danger, it was at most harmless error to omit a specific instruction requiring that the jury so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Prior to the charge defense counsel requested the court to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny of a bank, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court declined this request, but did give the lesser included offense of bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since defense counsel did not object to the failure of the court to give the requested instruction, the defect if any is waived unless it may be found to be plain error under Rule 52(b). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">A lesser included offense instruction is mandated when requested, provided the lesser offense is necessarily included in the offense charged. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(c). The lesser included offense must be both <em>lesser </em>and <em>included. </em>These requirements can only be met where the included offense involves fewer of the same constituent elements as the charged greater offense and where the claimed lesser offense has a lighter penalty attached to it than does the charged offense. Thus the claimed included offense must have the same elements as, although fewer of those elements than, the charged greater offense. <em>See </em>Annot., 11 A.L.R.Fed. 173 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Applying these principles, it is clear that both subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 2113 are necessarily included within the offense set forth in subsection (d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The language of subsection (d) confirms it. However, there is a duty on the defendant to come forward with some evidence if he wishes to have the benefit of a lesser included offense instruction; while a judge cannot prevent a jury from rejecting the prosecution\u2019s entire case, he is not obligated to assist a jury in coming to an irrational conclusion of partial acceptance and partial rejection of the prosecution\u2019s case. Driscoll v. United States, 356 F.2d 324, 327 (1st Cir. 1966), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Piccioli v. United States, 390 U.S. 202, 88 S.Ct. 899, 19 L.Ed.2d 1034 <em>(1968); cf. </em>United States v. Comer, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 421 F.2d 1149, 1154 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"> The defense in this case was that appellant, charged as an aider and abetter, did not know the true purpose for which the ear was supplied, that he was not present at the robbery and that he was not part of the crime. That the money was taken from the bank by armed robbers was not disputed. The court properly submitted the lesser offense under \u00a7 2113(a) of robbery (without putting in jeopardy). The difference between the proof of robbery (subsection (a)) and larceny (subsection (b)) is in the taking \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation . . . \u201d required in the case of robbery. That requirement is also present in subsection (d), .but not in (b). Proof of this element was established beyond reasonable doubt. Before a party is entitled to an instruction upon a lesser included offense, \u201c \u2018the proof on the element or elements differentiating the two crimes must be sufficiently in dispute so that the jury may consistently find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Thompson, 490 F.2d 1218, 1221 (8th Cir. 1974). We hold, upon the evidence adduced in this case, that it was not plain error for the court to refuse to give a lesser included offense instruction on the crime of bank larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">ARGUMENT OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Finally, appellant complains that statements by government counsel in his final argument were improper, prejudicial and, while not objected to, constituted plain error. The specific comment complained of was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">No independent evidence?' Let\u2019s take a look at the totally unimpeached witness that the Government put on that stand by the name of Steward, the owner of that used-car lot. Now, let me ask you this right now. Had he been convicted of a felony? No. Did he have any kind of cross-examination that indicated he wasn\u2019t truthful? No. What did he say? Good gravy, what more can you say? \u2018I want a car for two hours,\u2019 the day before. T want a car for two hours.\u2019 \u2018Why do you want it for two hours?\u2019 \u2018Going to rob a bank,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to rob a bank. The messenger is going to deliver some money in the trunk of his car to the grocery store.\u2019 * * * He told Steward what he was going to use that car for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">That the prosecutor took liberties with the exact testimony is beyond question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He did not, however, inject evidence not in the case, nor did he engage in any of the other acts of misconduct which have been held to be reversible error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>his charge to the jury the trial judge cautioned the jury that argument of counsel was not evidence; that the jurors were the sole judges of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses; and that the jury must consider only such matters as are shown by the evidence in open court. Taking the record as a whole, we cannot say that the argument of the prosecutor, balanced by the instructions of the court, affected substantial rights of the appellant. <em>See </em>United States v. Phillips, 482 F.2d 191, 196-97 (8th Cir. 1973); Homan v. United States, 279 F.2d 767, 775-76 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 866, 81 S.Ct. 110, 5 L.Ed.2d 88 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">.
