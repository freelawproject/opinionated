At a residence she was visiting for the first time, Tiffany got drunk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in the company of her girlfriend and four underage boys she had just met. Tiffany became ill and semi-conscious. Some of the guests sexually assaulted Tiffany, then dragged her outside in the freezing rain. In an effort to avoid legal trouble but summon a rescuer, three of them called the Harford County Sheriffs Department. They reported to police communications officer Kim Archer, appellee, that there was a girl who had been \u201cover here drinking\u201d laying in the woods to the rear of \u201c1436\u201d Harford Square, \u201cK Court.\u201d Archer replied that she would \u201csend someone out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Unfortunately, in order to prevent police officers from coming to their residence at 1443 Charleston Drive, K Court, the assailants hastily invented a street number, and insisted on anonymity. Unfortunately, there is no 1436 K Court, because K Court only has odd-numbered addresses. Unfortunately, the dispatcher directed the responding police officers to \u201c1436 <em>----J </em>Court,\u201d an address that does exist. Unfortunately, despite searching behind that address and the entire row of townhomes along J Court, the officers did not find Tiffany, and discontinued their search. Unfortunately, no search was conducted in the woods behind the K Court townhomes, where Tiffany lay until she was found the next day, dead from hypothermia.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In this appeal, we address an issue of first impression in Maryland \u2014 the negligence liability of a police dispatcher. We conclude that the tort duty owed by police dispatchers must be determined by applying the same \u201cspecial duty rule\u201d that governs the tort liability of other public and private defendants. Applying that rule, we hold that Archer did not have a special duty to rescue Tiffany, because Tiffany, who was unconscious, did not specifically rely on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out,\u201d and because the assailants who called on her behalf did not justifiably rely on that promise. Thus, Archer did not have a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Tiffany, or a special duty to aid, protect, or rescue Tiffany. Because appellant cannot establish that Archer had a private duty to Tiffany, the trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s negligence claims against Archer. For substantially similar reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>also affirm the dismissal of appellant\u2019s negligent training claims against James Terrell, appellee, who is chief of Harford County\u2019s Emergency Management and Operations Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We review the allegations in the complaint, and accept them as true for purposes of reviewing this dismissal. <em>See Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 548, 727 A.2d 947 (1999). On November 11, 1995, Tiffany Fouts made plans to spend the night with her school friend, Melanie M. Early in the evening, the two girls went to 1443 Charleston Drive, K Court, located in the Harford Square townhome development in Edgewood. This was the home of Melanie\u2019s acquaintance, Eric F., and his mother, Ms. F. Tiffany, Melanie, and Eric were joined by three of Eric\u2019s friends, Donte, Ricky, and Louis. Tiffany had never met Eric or any of his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The complaint alleges that Ms. F. and Louis supplied alcohol to the minors, who \u201cpartied\u201d in the basement of Ms. F.\u2019s home. Within an hour of her arrival, Tiffany began to vomit and lapsed into semi-consciousness. Some of the guests then assaulted and abused Tiffany. They \u201cengaged in nonconsen-sual sexual acts with [her], heavy objects were dropped upon her head and certain guests urinated upon her as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">To conceal Tiffany\u2019s condition, Eric F. and Ricky dragged her out a back door. They left Tiffany, wearing only a tee shirt, skirt, socks, and shoes, in an area of woods located directly behind the townhome. The weather was cold and rainy, and a snowy winter storm had been forecast.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Melanie and Louis then left the Fox residence. Ricky and Donte were staying the night with Eric. Aware that Tiffany was in danger from exposure, Donte, in the presence of Eric and Ricky, called the Harford County Sheriffs Department (\u201cHCSO\u201d). His report to Kim Archer, the police communications officer who answered the phone, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">HCSO DISPATCHER [ARCHER]: Harford County Sheriffs Office, PCO Archer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">CALLER: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>HCSO DISPATCHER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">CALLER: Um, there\u2019s a girl in the back of the woods like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"al-dedup-0\">HCSO DISPACTHER: Back of what woods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">CALLER: Um, Harford Square.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">HCSO DISPATCHER: Okay.

Thomas as to the proper location of the semiconscious girl.... \u201d The dispatcher directed responding officers to investigate \u201cthe well-being of a number 2 female ... lying to the rear of\u2019 \u201c1436 Harford Square Drive.... J \u2014 John\u2014 Court,\u201d instead of \u201cK Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">These mistakes, appellant asserted, had fatal consequences. \u201cThe area behind J Court is separate and apart from K Court and located in a different section of the Harford Square townhome development.\u201d Appellant alleged that, unlike the area behind K Court, the area behind J Court \u201chad no ... forested area.\u201d Officer Thomas walked the area behind the J Court townhomes, including number 1436, but did not find Tiffany. \u201c[N]o further effort of any nature was made to review or request further information that had been provided to the dispatch office notwithstanding ... the pouring rain and approaching winter storm____\u201d In the early morning hours of November 12, Tiffany Fouts froze to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant filed a wrongful death and survival action against Ms. F., PCO Archer, \u201cunidentified dispatch or emergency service employees of Harford County Emergency Operations Division\u201d (the \u201cDoe defendants\u201d), Officer Thomas, Chief Terrell, the HCSO, and the State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She alleged that \u201cArcher [negligently] breached her duty of care by failing to make basic inquiries of Donte W.\u201d by \u201creporting that Tiffany ... was behind \u2018J\u2019 Court when in fact she was reported to be and was in fact behind \u2018K\u2019 Court,\u201d and by \u201cfailing to report that Tiffany ... was behind townhomes near a forested area, ... [a] crucial piece of initial information [that] would have assisted in the determination that an improper address had been provided by Archer [and prompted] ---- [a] review of the recorded telephone call----\u201d The negligence claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Terrell were based on allegations of improper procedures and training for emergency dispatchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">After appellant voluntarily dismissed Ms. F., all of the governmental defendants moved to dismiss the negligence claims against them. In support, they offered transcripts from the juvenile criminal proceedings against Eric F., which included a transcript of Donte\u2019s call to Archer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Donte testified that he knew Tiffany \u201cwas cold,\u201d and suggested calling the police on her behalf. That suggestion and other suggestions to call for an ambulance and to call 911 were overruled, in favor of calling the HCSO directly. The three looked up HCSO\u2019s number in a local telephone directory, and Donte placed the call. Eric supplied him with the house number \u201c1486.\u201d Donte requested anonymity because he \u201cdidn\u2019t ... want them to come to the house.\u201d After the call, they \u201chit the lights .... [so] they won\u2019t come to the house.\u201d They briefly peeked out the window blinds, looking \u201cfor flashlights,\u201d but then returned to the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Eric testified that he vetoed Donte\u2019s suggestion to call 911, because he \u201cknew it would be a whole bunch of like police cars and stuff, and I didn\u2019t want them coming to the house.\u201d He admitted that for the same reasons, he invented a street address: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give [Donte] the address to this house----so I thought of an address I thought it was close to ... where she was at.\u201d After calling HCSO, Eric went back outside to check on Tiffany only \u201c[o]nce.\u201d Although he and Ricky Washington planned to go outside a second time, and to bring Tiffany \u201cback into the house and let her stay in the basement,\u201d his mother stopped them as they were going out the front door. She told Ricky he could go out if he wished, but he did not. Eric admitted that he never saw the police come.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Deputy Thomas testified that he was familiar with the Harford Square townhomes, from his frequent patrols of that neighborhood. Each of the courts off the main roads are designated by a letter of the alphabet. He explained that there are no even-numbered townhomes located on K Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and no odd-numbered townhomes located on J Court. The courts are located off of main drives known as \u201cHarford Square Drive,\u201d and \u201cCharleston Drive.\u201d At 9:55 p.m. on November 11,1995, he received a call \u201cto go to an address and check the rear of the residence for a female they believed was intoxicated, laying out in the weather.... \u201d The HCSO dispatcher told him to check \u201cto the rear of 1486 Harford Square Drive.... It will be J \u2014 John\u2014Court. Cross-street is Charlestown [sic].\u201d There was no mention of woods in the dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">When Thomas got to 1436 J Court, \u201cit was raining pretty hard\u201d and \u201c[v]ery cold.\u201d Thomas \u201c[w]alked to the rear of the residence,\u201d but \u201c[s]aw nobody.\u201d He \u201c[r]econtacted [the] dispatcher to ask if somebody could come point her out to [him] from the complainant.\u201d When the dispatcher replied that there was no reconnect information, Thomas \u201cwalked that whole line of houses on that side of the court and then back around to the front.\u201d Behind the J Court townhomes, there was a footpath and \u201ca community of trees in between the back of J Court and the back of the other courts ... behind it, along [a] footpath.\u201d Thomas \u201c[s]aw nobody,\u201d only \u201cregular backyard kinds of stuff.\u201d At that point, he encountered a Maryland State trooper who had also responded to the call, but had searched behind J1 Court, another separate court next to J Court. Finding no one, Thomas radioed the dispatcher that the call was an \u201cunfounded complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In response to the motions to dismiss, appellant voluntarily dismissed Officer Thomas. On November 16, 1999, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order dismissing Archer, Terrell, the Doe defendants, and the State. The court concluded that Terrell had public official immunity from negligence claims, but that Archer did not. Nevertheless, the court held that neither Archer nor Terrell could have been negligent \u201cbecause there was no existing duty [to] ... the victim,\u201d who \u201cnever knew of the conversation Ms. Archer had with the anonymous caller,\u201d and therefore, \u201ccould [not] have relied upon Ms. Archer\u2019s protection.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Appellant filed this appeal, challenging only the dismissal of her claims against Archer and Terrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">This suit arising out of Tiffany Fouts\u2019 tragic death presents a question of first impression in Maryland. We must decide whether police dispatchers who receive a call for assistance are presumed, as a matter of law, to have a special duty to aid or rescue a crime victim from the peril in which her assailants placed her. In doing so, we consider standards governing the negligence liability of police dispatchers and other similarly situated emergency dispatchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appel-lees cannot be held liable for negligence because they did not owe a private or \u201cspecial\u201d duty to Tiffany. Citing the unique nature of an emergency services dispatcher\u2019s job, appellant argues that \u201cArcher and Terrell did owe a legal duty of care to [Tiffany] based on the fact that [Tiffany] was an individual and a member of the class of persons who are the subjects of 911 or emergency calls, ... and injury to her from failing to give correct location information was readily foreseeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We do not agree that police dispatchers owe a private duty of care to all persons on whose behalf a request for assistance has been made. Instead, we conclude that the negligence liability of a police dispatcher must be decided on a case-by-case basis, using the \u201cspecial duty rule\u201d to determine whether the dispatcher had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the victim that justifies the imposition of a private duty of care toward that victim. In this case, we conclude that the police dispatcher did not have a special duty to the crime victim on whose behalf a request for emergency services was made, because the victim did not detrimentally rely on the dispatcher\u2019s promise to send a police officer, and because, as a matter of law, any reliance on that promise by the potential rescuers who placed the call was not justified. We shall affirm the dismissal of appellant\u2019s claims against appellees. In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that holding, we will not review the trial court\u2019s holdings regarding appellees\u2019 immunity claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Special Duty To Rescue</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The question of whether a tort duty is owed is a question of law for the court. <em>See Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 716, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997); <em>see also Mullin v. City of South Bend, </em>639 N.E.2d 278, 283 (Ind.1994) (whether a police dispatcher has a special duty to a person in need of emergency services is a question of law for the court). \u201cA tort duty is \u2018an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eisel v. Bd. of Educ. of Montgomery County, </em>324 Md. 376, 385-86, 597 A.2d 447 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">As a general rule, there is no affirmative legal duty to rescue someone in peril.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>a duty to take such action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 242, 492 A.2d 1297 (1985) (quoting <em>Restatement of Torts (Second) </em>\u00a7 314).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cThe main rationale behind the no duty to rescue rule is that the defendant did not engage in any action that gave rise to the plaintiffs harm.\u201d J. Groninger, <em>No Duty to Rescue: Can Americans Really Leave a Victim Lying in the Street? What Is Left of the American Rule, and Will It Survive Unabated?, </em>26 Pepp. L.Rev. 357, 358 (1999). Underlying the rule is a distinction between \u201charmful conduct\u201d and \u201cfailure to confer a benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>L. Murphy, <em>Beneficence, Law, and Liberty: The Case of Required Rescue, </em>89 Geo. L.J. 605, 628 (2001). <em>\u201cA </em>fails to benefit <em>B </em>when <em>A </em>could, but does not, perform an action that would make <em>B </em>better off. On this ordinary understanding, a failure to rescue is a failure to benefit.\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In contrast, \u201cwhen the defendant does bring about the cause or the event which is harming the plaintiff, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>defendant does have a duty to rescue.\u201d <em>Groninger, supra, </em>26 Pepp. L.Rev. at 374 n. 225. Moreover, even \u201c[i]f there is no duty to come to the assistance of a person in difficulty or peril, ... there is at least a duty to avoid affirmative acts making his situation worse.\u201d <em>Furr v. Spring Grove State Hosp., </em>53 Md.App. 474, 487, 454 A.2d 414 (1983). Thus, defendants whose wrongful conduct either creates or increases the victim\u2019s peril do owe a private duty of care to their victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Maryland, like most other jurisdictions, recognizes a common law exception to the \u201cno duty to rescue\u201d rule when there is a special relationship between the potential rescuer and the endangered person. <em>See Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 628, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 314A <em>(\u201cRestatement </em>\u201d). The rationale for the exception is that special duties \u201carise out of special relations between the parties, which create a special responsibility, and take the case out of the general rule.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 314A cmt. b. It is the victim\u2019s justifiable reliance on an expectation of assistance that creates the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the victim and the defendant, and in turn, justifies the imposition of a special duty to aid, protect, or rescue that victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Providing the essential causative link between the \u201cspecial duty\u201d assumed by the municipality and the alleged injury, the \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d requirement goes to the very heart of the special relationship exception, which is predicated in large measure on \u201cthe unfairness that the courts have perceived in precluding recovery when a [defendant\u2019s] voluntary undertaking has lulled the injured party into a false sense of security and has thereby induced [her] either to relax [her] own vigilance or to forego other available avenues of protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em>Grieshaber v. City of Albany, </em>279 A.D.2d 232, 720 N.Y.S.2d 214, 217 (2001) (citations omitted); <em>see also Restatement </em>\u00a7 314A cmt. b (\u201cThe law appears ... to be working slowly toward a recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of dependence or of mutual dependence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Examples of special relationships that, as a matter of law, create a special duty to aid, protect, or rescue include relationships between \u201ccarrier and passenger, innkeeper and guest, invitor and business visitor, school and pupil, employer and employee, [and] landlord and tenant....\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 553, 727 A.2d 947 (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 30, at 356 (5th ed.1984)). The imposition of such a \u201cspecial duty <em>per se </em>\u201d traditionally has been limited to these relationships, with the caveat that \u201cthere may ... be other relations which impose a similar duty.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 314A <em>caveat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In most other cases, whether there is a special relationship creating a private duty in tort is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See id. </em>at cmt. b. The case-by-case approach permits tort recovery in meritorious cases while preserving the general rule that there is no duty to rescue. <em>See City of Rome v. Jordan, </em>263 Ga. 26, 426 S.E.2d 861, 863 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In cases involving tort claims against public servants, there are additional considerations affecting our determination of whether, in addition to the public duty owed to the community at large, a public defendant also owes a private duty to an individual plaintiff. \u201c[A]mong the variables to be considered in determining whether a [private] tort duty should be recognized are ... \u2018the policy of preventing future harm, [and] the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach.... \u2019 \u201d <em>Village of Cross Keys, Inc. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>315 Md. 741, 752, 556 A.2d 1126 (1989) (quoting <em>Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., </em>17 Cal.3d 425, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 342 (1976)). Courts have been reluctant to impose a special duty <em>per se </em>upon an entire class of public employees. In <em>Warren v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>444 A.2d 1 (D.C.1981), the District of Columbia courts explained why imposing a special duty <em>per se </em>is not always necessary to ensure that the employee is held \u201caccountable\u201d for mistakes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>A duty owed to the public ... is no less enforceable because it is owed to \u201ceverybody.\u201d Public officials at all levels remain accountable to the public and the public maintains elaborate mechanisms to enforce its rights \u2014 both formally in the courts and less formally through internal disciplinary proceedings____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">The absence of a duty specifically enforceable by individual members of the community is not peculiar to public police services. Our representative form of government is replete with duties owed to everyone in their capacity as citizens but not enforceable by anyone in his capacity as an individual. Through its representatives, the public creates community service; through its representatives, the public establishes the standards which it demands of its employees in carrying out those services and through its representatives, the public can most effectively enforce adherence to those standards of competence. As members of the general public, individuals forego any direct control over the conduct of public employees in the same manner that such individuals avoid any direct responsibility for compensating public employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 8 (adopting Superior Court\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In addition, the Court in <em>Warren </em>contrasted the modest benefits likely to result from imposing a private tort law duty on public servants with the potentially enormous public costs of doing so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Plaintiffs in this action would have the Court and a jury of twelve ... judg[e] the adequacy of a public employee\u2019s performance in office.

In <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986), the Court of Appeals considered the tort duty of police officers called upon to protect citizens endangered by the criminal conduct of a third party. In that case, a police officer found a drunk man sitting in a truck in a parking lot, and told him not to drive; he did not conduct a field sobriety test or arrest him. As soon as the officer left, the man drove away. Within a short distance, he hit Ashbum, a pedestrian, resulting in the loss of Ashburn\u2019s leg. <em>See id. </em>at 620, 510 A.2d 1078. The trial court dismissed Ashbum\u2019s negligence complaint, on the grounds that (1) the officer had public official immunity from negligence liability, and (2) alternatively, the officer had no special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>duty to protect Ashbum from the consequences of the driver\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After concluding that the officer had qualified public official immunity from liability for non-malicious acts, the Court held that dismissal of the negligence claim against the officer also was appropriate because the officer had no tort duty to Ashburn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Even if we were to assume that [the officer was statutorily required to stop or detain the driver], <em>i.e., </em>that the statute made [the officer\u2019s] actions ministerial, and thus nondiscre-tionary, appellant\u2019s cause would still fail because he did not establish that [the officer] owed him a duty in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 626, 510 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The <em>Ashbum </em>Court concluded that the duty usually owed by a police officer is a duty to the public at large, rather than a private duty to a single individual.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">[W]e recognize the general rule, as do most courts, that absent a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between police and victim, liability for failure to protect an individual citizen against injury caused by another citizen does not lie against police officers. Rather, the \u201cduty\u201d owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is a duty to protect the public, and the breach of that duty is most properly actionable by the public in the form of criminal prosecution or administrative disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 628, 510 A.2d 1078 (citations omitted). It adopted the \u201cspecial duty rule\u201d to define when a particular officer owes a private duty of care to an imperiled person.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\"><em>If [a plaintiff] alleges sufficient facts to show that the defendant policeman created a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with him upon which he relied, he may maintain his action in negligence. </em>This \u201cspecial duty rule,\u201d as it has been termed by the courts, is nothing more than a modified application of the principle that although generally there is no duty in negligence terms to act for the benefit of any particular person, when one does indeed act for the benefit of another, he must act in a reasonable manner. <em>In order </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>for a special relationship between police officer and victim to be found, it must be shown that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 510 A.2d 1078 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Applying this \u201caffirmative act plus specific reliance\u201d test, the Court concluded that Ashbum failed to establish a special relationship, because he \u201calleged no facts which show that [the officer] affirmatively acted specifically for appellant\u2019s benefit or that [the officer\u2019s] actions induced appellant\u2019s reliance upon him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631-32, 510 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 753 A.2d 41 (2000), the Court of Appeals recently reviewed a variety of different \u201cspecial duty tests\u201d used in other jurisdictions. <em>See id. </em>at 146-50, 753 A.2d 41. It explicitly declined to modify the <em>Ashbum </em>test by using the more detailed, multi-part tests adopted in other jurisdictions, holding that \u201cthe intent of the \u2018special relationship\u2019 doctrine is better addressed by our general standard outlined in <em>Ashburn. \u201d Id. </em>at 150, 753 A.2d 41.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Application Of The Special Duty Rule To Police Dispatchers</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Appellant first argues that the trial court erred by applying \u201cno duty to rescue\u201d and \u201cspecial duty\u201d mies to appellees. She contends that the nature of the relationship between a police dispatcher and a person on whose behalf a call for assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>has been made is one of those \u201cspecial relationships\u201d that create, as a matter of law, a special duty to rescue. Her theory is that, by providing police dispatchers such as Archer to answer and relay calls for assistance, the HCSO \u201cassumed\u201d a special duty to aid and rescue Tiffany and all other persons on whose behalf a call for police assistance is made. She asserts that, as a matter of law, Archer had a special relationship with Tiffany, and therefore had a special duty to rescue Tiffany, regardless of whether anyone \u201cspecifically relied\u201d on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In support of her effort to impose a special duty <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>on police and other emergency dispatchers, she offers two policy rationales and two legal arguments. We do not find any of these persuasive. Instead, we conclude that the special duty rule should be applied on a case-by-case basis to determine the negligence liability of a police dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Before addressing appellant\u2019s arguments, however, we think it is helpful to clarify our focus in cases involving a civil duty to rescue. The initial focus in such cases must be on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct warrants the imposition of a private tort duty, rather than on whether the plaintiffs injuries should be compensable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Tort liability should not be imposed unless that imposition can be justified on tort criteria. <em>Even when a defendant\u2019s undoubtedly careless conduct has harmed another, tort law asks whether the defendant owed the plaintiff any duty not to act in that manner. </em>Courts face concerns that included unbounded and disproportionate liability, the impact of judgments on defendants and society, the need to deter dangerous conduct, the administrability of new claims in terms of numbers of suits and the nature of proof, and whether a new damage claim can be effectively con-trolled____As <em>tort law currently operates, courts must initially focus on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct warrants the imposition of liability. Compensation, which focuses on the plaintiff, comes into play only after a court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>concludes the defendant\u2019s conduct warrants the imposition of a duty.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">M. Franklin &amp; M. Ploeger, <em>Symposium: Of Rescue and Report: Should Tort Law Impose A Duty To Help Endangered Persons or Abused Children?, </em>40 Santa Clara L.Rev. 991, 1000 (2000) (emphasis added). Keeping in mind that the threshold question is whether the conduct of police dispatchers warrants imposing a special duty on them as a matter of law, we turn to the important questions raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Policy Reasons For And Against Imposing A Special Duty On Dispatchers</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant\u2019s first policy argument in favor of the blanket imposition of a special duty on dispatchers is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_y\">the legal duty owed by [Archer] to Tiffany .... [was] no different than if a county vehicle operated by an ordinary government employee negligently failed to stop at a traffic signal causing death or injury to another, for which recovery is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">This \u201capples-to-oranges\u201d analogy is inapposite. Negligent police dispatchers are not \u201cjust like\u201d negligent government drivers, because such dispatchers do not create the plaintiffs peril. The government driver who injures a plaintiff through his negligence is liable because he created the peril, not because he failed to rescue the plaintiff from it. We see no relevant similarity between the negligent dispatcher and the negligent driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Appellant\u2019s second reason for imposing a special duty <em>per se </em>on police dispatchers has a broader, and more facially appealing, policy predicate. She argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATgo\">[e]mergency calls for help, either through a 911 system or secondary civilian dispatch operator, have become an integral part of our daily life and society. The State and local governments have assumed the burden and duty to provide aid (emergency and otherwise) to its citizens____ Citizens ... are routinely encouraged to rely upon [this system] and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>use it regularly for their own safety and for the safety of others who are ... unable to make direct contact.... To suggest that it is acceptable for a dispatch operator to inaccurately convey critical information to responding emergency personnel would severely undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the system and in the system\u2019s ultimate ability to ultimately succeed.... Moreover, allowing such mistakes to continue with the inevitable and foreseeable resultant harm \u25a0without accountability is not an acceptable societal standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We are not persuaded, however, that appellant\u2019s legitimate concerns regarding dispatcher standards, accountability, and public reliance justify imposing a private duty of care for each and every call for emergency assistance. We conclude that the presence of a special relationship between a dispatcher and a victim should not be presumed solely on the basis of either a call for assistance or the dispatch of such assistance. We explain, first addressing appellant\u2019s policy concerns, and then our countervailing concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">First, we disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that a special duty should be presumed because harm from a dispatcher\u2019s negligence is highly foreseeable. The <em>Ashburn </em>Court made it clear that foreseeability alone cannot establish a special duty in tort. The Court explicitly rejected the use of a strict \u201cforseeability\u201d test as the touchstone for determining whether a police officer has a duty to aid a crime victim. <em>See Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d 1078. Acknowledging that the \u201cforeseeability factor\u201d is of critical importance in determining whether there is a legal duty, the Court cautioned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted). <em>See also Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 551, 727 A.2d 947 (\u201cnot all foreseeable harm gives rise to a duty; there are other factors to consider such as intervening circumstances or parties\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201cforeseeability\u201d must not be confused with \u201cduty.\u201d <em>The fact that a result may be foreseeable does not itself impose a duty in negligence terms. </em>This principle is apparent in the acceptance by most jurisdictions and by this Court of the general rule that there is no duty to control a third person\u2019s conduct so as to prevent personal harm to another, unless a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists either between the actor and the third person or between the actor and the person injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Similarly, we do not agree that the inherently \u201chigh risk\u201d nature of a dispatcher\u2019s interaction with the public is sufficient reason for imposing a special duty <em>per se. </em>In <em>Valentine, </em>the Court of Appeals rejected an analogous argument in the context of a private defendant. The Court declined to use the special duty rule to expand the tort liability of gun store owners. In doing so, the Court reasoned that a private defendant does not have a private duty of care solely because he is engaged in activity that presents a substantial, but generalized risk of harm. <em>See id. </em>at 551-53, 727 A.2d 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We have followed a similar rationale in limiting the tort liability arising from a government\u2019s provision of public safety services. In <em>Willow Tree Learning Center, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>85 Md.App. 508, 584 A.2d 157 (1991), we held that a child fatally injured on his day care center\u2019s playground equipment did not have a claim against municipal defendants who were responsible for regulating and inspecting that equipment. We explained that a government\u2019s offer of safety-related services does not, in itself, create a special duty of care. \u201cWe do not believe that a special relationship, creating a tortious duty, is created by a governmental decision to legislate safety programs in a particular industry, unless that duty is expressly created by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 584 A.2d 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Nor are we persuaded that appellant\u2019s \u201creliance of the public\u201d rationale merits imposing on dispatchers a special duty as a matter of law. The dispositive answer to this argument is that case-by-case determinations of whether a particular dispatcher owed a special duty to a particular plaintiff fully address any \u201creliance\u201d concerns. Using the <em>Ashburn </em>test, if the plaintiff specifically relied on a dispatcher\u2019s affirmative promise to send assistance, then the dispatcher had a special duty to that plaintiff. Plaintiffs who can show such reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>simply do not need the automatic presumption of special duty that appellant advocates. A case-by-case application of the special duty rule adequately ensures responsibility, by holding negligent dispatchers accountable. <em>See City of Rome v. Jor</em>dan, 263 Ga. 26, 426 S.E.2d 861, 863 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Most importantly, we also reject the corollary to appellant\u2019s reliance argument \u2014 that the nature of the relationship between a dispatcher and a crime victim is sufficiently special to justify imposing a special duty <em>per se. </em>Reliance is critical to establishing a special duty. We recognize that in certain relationships <em>{i.e., </em>common carrier-passenger, innkeeper-guest, landowner-business invitee, school-pupil, employer-employee, and landlord-tenant), detrimental and reasonable reliance is presumed as a matter of law. That presumption, in turn, justifies imposing a special duty without inquiring into the specific contact between the plaintiff and defendant. But we do not view the dispatcher-victim relationship as sufficiently similar to warrant an analogous presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Persons in need of emergency assistance do not have an inherently \u201cdependent\u201d relationship with a dispatcher <em>before </em>they become imperiled. Unlike the common carrier, landlord, innkeeper, employer, and school, the dispatcher has no control over either the victim or the environment in which the victim encounters her peril. Unlike the passenger, tenant, guest, employee, and pupil, the victim cannot reasonably expect an emergency services dispatcher to take steps to protect her from such peril, either by preventing it in the first place or by being in the vicinity to offer aid in the event that she encounters it. Only persons on whom the victim is presumed to rely are charged with a legal duty to either prevent the peril, or to provide a means of escaping it. Indeed, this may reflect that, through their opportunity to exercise control over the victim and her environment, such persons might be said to \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201cincrease\u201d the victim\u2019s peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">There is no analogous opportunity for the dispatcher to prevent or avoid the vast universe of perils facing the public. Therefore, there is no reason to presume as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>that a particular victim has relied on her to do so. Rather, it is only as the result of the specific contact between a particular dispatcher and a particular plaintiff, after the plaintiff has already been placed in peril, that the victim might depend, or \u201cjustifiably rely,\u201d on the dispatcher to aid or rescue her. The special duty test examines whether such reliance occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">It appears that appellant has focused exclusively on the victim\u2019s perspective rather than the dispatcher\u2019s perspective. In doing so, she has brushed aside the dispositive question: whether the conduct of emergency dispatchers warrants the imposition of a special duty as a matter of law. Rephrased in terms of the dispatcher\u2019s conduct, appellant\u2019s argument is that making a dispatcher available to receive requests for assistance warrants the imposition of a private tort duty as a matter of law. We disagree, because making a dispatcher available to receive requests for assistance does not create or increase a victim\u2019s peril, nor does it invariably induce victims or potential rescuers to rely on the dispatcher by foregoing opportunities for aid or rescue. Simply put, the mere receipt of a request for assistance does not cause or contribute to any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the legal duty owed by police dispatchers to the class of persons who are the subject of 911 or emergency calls, by virtue of their position, is a <em>public </em>duty to aid. A police dispatcher\u2019s work is necessarily an integral link in the chain of emergency services ultimately delivered by the responding police officers. Thus, it is appropriate to measure the negligence liability of police dispatchers by the same standard applied to the police officers who respond to their dispatches. Accordingly, we find the <em>Ash-bum </em>Court\u2019s distinction between police officers\u2019 public duties and their private tort duties equally appropriate and applicable to dispatchers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">[T]he \u201cduty\u201d owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is only a duty to protect the public, and the breach of that duty is most properly actionable by the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in the form of criminal prosecution or administrative disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Our holding takes into account the public policy concerns regarding a public entity\u2019s tort liability. Imposing a special duty <em>per se </em>on police dispatchers toward every person on whose behalf a call for assistance is made would have serious consequences. \u201cFor the courts to proclaim a new and general duty of protection in the law of tort, even to those who may be the particular seekers of protection based on specific hazards, could and would inevitably determine how the limited police resources of the community should be allocated and without predictable limits.\u201d <em>Riss v. City of New York, </em>22 N.Y.2d 579, 293 N.Y.S.2d 897, 240 N.E.2d 860, 861 (1968). Ultimately, it may even result in the reduction of public safety services, including emergency response programs and personnel, to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The weight of authority outside this State supports our holding. Our review of cases involving police, \u201c911,\u201d and other emergency services dispatchers indicates that other courts usually treat emergency services dispatchers and responding emergency services personnel alike, and apply the special duty rule to both on a case-by-case basis. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. City of Sacramento, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 1070, 235 Cal.Rptr. 844 (1987) (liability of police operator determined under same special duty rule applied to responding police officer); <em>Noakes v. City of Seattle, </em>77 Wash.App. 694, 895 P.2d 842, <em>rev. denied, </em>127 Wash.2d 1021, 904 P.2d 299 (1995) (same, 911 dispatcher); <em>City of Rome v. Jordan, </em>263 Ga. 26, 426 S.E.2d 861 (1993) (same, police dispatcher); <em>Koher v. Dial, </em>653 N.E.2d 524 (Ind.App.1995) (same, police radio dispatcher); <em>De Long v. County of Erie, </em>60 N.Y.2d 296, 469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d 717 (1983) (same, 911 \u201ccomplaint writer\u201d and police dispatcher).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Moreover, courts that have declined to impose a special duty <em>per se </em>on dispatchers have emphasized that neither the availability of an emergency services dispatcher nor the occurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of dispatcher error necessarily warrants imposing a special duty as a matter of law. In a noted negligent dispatch case, the New York Court of Appeals declined to adopt the broad rule that appellant now advocates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It held that although the public is encouraged to call the police for assistance, and even though that fact may be considered in determining whether a particular dispatcher had a special duty to a particular crime victim, neither the availability of an emergency dispatch system nor the occurrence of dispatcher error justifies the imposition of a special duty for each and every call.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">When an emergency service is involved it must be recognized that the circumstances are often quite demanding and that some mistakes will occur, even when the service is well organized and conscientiously administered. Allowance must be made for this and although any error, however slight, may have dire consequences, it will not always justify an award for damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>De Long, </em>469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We conclude that a case-by-case application of the special duty rule is a more appropriate means of deciding whether a dispatcher\u2019s negligence justifies civil damages. We agree with those courts that have declined to impose a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>duty <em>per se </em>on police and emergency dispatchers. \u201cRather than making sweeping conclusions regarding tort liability based upon the utilization of \u2019911\u2019 or similar emergency call systems, this Court believes that it is preferable to analyze a claim of a special duty by applying the ... [special duty] test....\u201d <em>Wolfe v. City of Wheeling, </em>182 W.Va. 253, 387 S.E.2d 307, 312 (1989). Thus, \u201ca special relationship does not come into being simply because an individual requests assistance from the police.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>468 A.2d 1306, 1313 (D.C.1983) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted). Nor does a dispatcher\u2019s decision to dispatch an officer justify the imposition of a private duty; \u201c[standing alone, a governmental entity\u2019s dispatch of emergency services does not create a private duty.\u201d <em>Koher v. Dial, </em>653 N.E.2d 524, 526 (Ind.App.1995); <em>Morgan, </em>468 A.2d at 1315 (\u201cA special relationship ... does not exist merely because an individual requests, or a police officer promises to provide protection\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For all of these reasons, we hold that neither a dispatcher\u2019s receipt of a call for help nor the dispatch of emergency assistance alone creates a special duty to the person in need of such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The \u201cNo Special Duty\u201d Defense Is Available To Persons Who Are \u201cGovernment Employees\u201d Without Public Official Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Appellant offers two alternative legal arguments challenging the trial court\u2019s application of the special duty rule to her claims. She argues that the trial court erred in permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>appellees to assert a \u201cno special duty\u201d defense, because (1) the \u201cno duty to rescue\u201d rule and the special duty rule were abrogated by the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), by \u201cwaiving immunity for government employees ... whose tor-tious conduct has caused injury\u201d; and (2) the \u201cno special duty defense\u201d is available only to \u201cpublic officials,\u201d and not to \u201cmere government employees,\u201d such as Archer and Terrell. We disagree with both contentions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Before discussing appellant\u2019s contentions, we wish to address preliminarily a fundamental error underlying appellant\u2019s arguments. Appellant has confused the special duty rule with concepts of public official immunity. The \u201cno duty to rescue\u201d and \u201cspecial duty\u201d rules are basic tort law doctrines tied to the first element of negligence \u2014 duty. <em>See Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d 1078 (\u201cnegligence is a breach of a duty owed to one, and absent that duty, there can be no negligence\u201d). The <em>Ashbwm </em>test is the method for determining whether a special duty exists in the particular circumstances of a case involving an alleged failure to protect, aid, or rescue. Thus, the special duty rule is viable regardless of whether the defendant in question is a public official, government employee, or private actor, and regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the defendant in question may have statutory or common law immunity. <em>See, e.g., Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 626, 510 A.2d 1078 (special duty rule provided alternative to public official immunity as grounds for dismissal); <em>Lauer v. City of New York, </em>95 N.Y.2d 95, 711 N.Y.S.2d 112, 733 N.E.2d 184, 187 (2000) (fact that governmental act complained of was ministerial \u201c \u2018merely removes the issue of governmental immunity from a given case,\u2019 \u201d but does not necessarily make the act tortious) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We recognize that negligence cases involving government defendants often involve both \u201cspecial duty rule\u201d and immunity issues. But these two concepts have different origins and require separate analysis. Immunity is premised on the notion that, for policy reasons, certain defendants should be relieved of liability for their negligent acts. In contrast, the special duty rule is premised on the fundamental tort law notion that a defendant cannot be held negligent if she did not have a duty to the plaintiff. The difference between immunity and the special duty rule is that immunity \u201creleases\u201d certain persons from liability for their negligence, while the special duty rule \u201crules out\u201d a finding of negligence altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Thus, \u201c[t]he initial question of duty precedes any discussion of sovereign immunity, which \u2018is a defense rather than an inroad on one of the elements of a tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Rome, </em>426 S.E.2d at 862 n. 1 (citations omitted). If the government defendant did not have a duty to the plaintiff, and thus was not negligent, it is unnecessary to decide whether that defendant also had immunity from negligence. With these theoretical and procedural distinctions in mind, we now turn to appellant\u2019s legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The LGTCA Did Not Abrogate The \u201cNo Special Duty\u201d Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Appellant contends that the LGTCA abrogated the special duty rule, and therefore precluded appellees from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>using a \u201cno special duty\u201d defense. We disagree. Nothing in the LGTCA purports to eliminate a common law defense such as the \u201cno special duty\u201d defense. Rather, the LGTCA merely holds certain local <em>governments </em>financially responsible for negligent acts of their <em>employees. See Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 104, 660 A.2d 447 (1995). It, therefore, does not alter the tort law duties of the individual municipal employees, either by imposing additional legal duties or by \u201cwaiving\u201d common law defenses that the individual employee might have. To the contrary, by providing that the local government \u201cdoes not waive any common law ... defense ... possessed by an employee of a local government,\u201d the Act implicitly confirms that it does not constitute a waiver of an individual employee\u2019s common law defenses. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-303(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Ashburn </em>illustrates that a government defendant has a \u201cno special duty\u201d defense even if that defendant does not have immunity under the LGTCA. The <em>Ashburn </em>Court addressed, separate and apart from the officer\u2019s claim of immunity, the different question raised by the \u201cspecial duty\u201d rule \u2014 whether the defendant owed the plaintiffs \u201ca duty in tort.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 626, 510 A.2d 1078. It held that even if the officer did not have public official immunity for his allegedly negligent acts, the special duty rule provided an independent and alternative basis for dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims against him. <em>See id. </em>at 626, 510 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The \u201cNo Special Duty\u201d Defense Is Available To Government Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Citing <em>Ashburn, </em>appellant argues that \u201c[t]he special relationship doctrine is misapplied to an ordinary government employee,\u201d such that the \u201cno special duty\u201d defense is available \u201conly in the context of a public official, specifically to police officers performing their duty.\u201d Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ash-bum </em>for the proposition that government employees may not assert a \u201cno special duty\u201d defense is misplaced. Although <em>Ashburn </em>involved the alleged negligence of a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>who was a \u201cpublic official,\u201d there is no language in that opinion indicating that the \u201cno special duty\u201d defense is available <em>only </em>to public officials. <em>Ashbum </em>did not consider this question because the case involved a police officer who was a public official, rather than a \u201cmere\u201d government employee. <em>See Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 626, 510 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It is clear that the special duty rule applies outside of the public official and police officer context. Maryland courts have applied the special duty rule in diverse factual settings involving both private and government defendants. <em>See, e.g., Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 166, 359 A.2d 548 (1976) (landlord did not have special duty to protect tenants from criminal acts of third parties); <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. at 249-50, 492 A.2d 1297 (probation officer did not have special duty to control conduct of parolee whose drunken driving caused child\u2019s severe injuries); <em>Southland Corp. v. Griffith, </em>332 Md. 704, 719, 633 A.2d 84 (1993) (shopkeeper has \u201cno special duty\u201d defense against claim of business invitee in certain circumstances); <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 553, 727 A.2d 947 (gun store owner has no special duty to persons shot by gun stolen from his store); <em>Holson v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 411, 414, 637 A.2d 871 (1994) (police officers do not have special duty to transport intoxicated passengers of arrested drivers to their destination); <em>Willow Tree Learning Center, </em>85 Md.App. at 519-20, 584 A.2d 157 (county day care inspector did not have special duty to child fatally injured on day care center\u2019s playground equipment); <em>Furr, </em>53 Md.App. at 488-89, 454 A.2d 414 (state mental hospital and its employees did not have special duty to child murdered by released patient).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In doing so, we have never specifically held that government employees are entitled to assert a \u201cno special duty\u201d defense. We have no trouble, however, concluding that the \u201cno special duty\u201d defense is just as available to government employees as it is to public officials, police officers, and private persons. Appellant offers no policy reason for imposing on an entire class of government employees a tort law duty that is greater than the duty of public officials and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>private persons. We find none. Accordingly, we hold that, regardless of whether appellees were \u201cgovernment employees\u201d or \u201cpublic officials,\u201d the \u201cno special duty\u201d defense was available to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Appellant Failed To Allege The Detrimental And Justifiable Reliance Necessary To Establish A Special Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As alternative grounds for reversal, appellant argues that even if appellees did not have a special duty as a matter of law, the trial court erred in holding that the complaint failed to allege the \u201cspecific reliance\u201d necessary to establish that appellees had a special duty to Tiffany. In doing so, appellant raises another question of first impression in Maryland: whether a potential rescuer\u2019s reliance on the affirmative acts of a police dispatcher can satisfy the \u201cspecific reliance\u201d requirement of the special duty test. We will not decide whether a third party\u2019s reliance on a police dispatcher\u2019s promise to send assistance is sufficient to impose a special duty to rescue on the dispatcher, because we conclude that even if such third party reliance could meet the test, in this case any detrimental reliance by the callers on Archer\u2019s promise to send someone out was not justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Special Reliance Means Detrimental And Justifiable Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The special duty test articulated by the <em>Ashbum </em>Court requires a showing that the affirmative act of the defendant \u201cinduc[ed] <em>the victim\u2019s specif\u00edc reliance </em>upon the [defendant\u2019s] protection.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d 1078 (emphasis added). As we explained above, the purpose of this \u201cspecific reliance\u201d requirement is to establish the essential causative link between the defendant\u2019s actions and the plaintiffs injury. In <em>Cuffy v. City of New York, </em>69 N.Y.2d 255, 513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d 937 (1987), the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Court of Appeals explained why detrimental and justifiable reliance is essential to establishing a special duty to aid or rescue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">[T]he injured party\u2019s reliance is as critical in establishing the existence of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d as is the municipality\u2019s voluntary affirmative undertaking of a duty to act. That element provides the essential causative link between the \u201cspecial duty\u201d assumed by the municipality and the alleged injury. Indeed, at the heart of most of these \u201cspecial duty\u201d cases is the unfairness that the courts have perceived in precluding recovery when a municipality\u2019s voluntary undertaking has lulled the injured party into a false sense of security and has thereby induced him either to relax his own vigilance or to forego other available avenues of protection.... [W]hen the reliance element is either not present at all, or if, present, is not causally related to the ultimate harm, this underlying concern is inapplicable, and the invocation of the \u201cspecial duty\u201d exception is then no longer justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Id. </em>513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d at 940. <em>See also Noakes, </em>895 P.2d at 844 (reliance must have been detrimental and justifiable); <em>City of Rome, </em>426 S.E.2d at 863 (requiring \u201cjustifiable and detrimental reliance by the injured party on the municipality\u2019s affirmative undertaking\u201d); <em>White, </em>552 N.W.2d at 5 (requiring detrimental and justifiable reliance). We agree that proof of such reliance is critical to creating a private tort duty, because detrimental and reasonable reliance on the promise of emergency assistance connects the defendant\u2019s conduct to the plaintiffs injury. <em>See Eisel, </em>324 Md. at 386, 597 A.2d 447. We, therefore, construe the \u201cspecific reliance\u201d requirement under Ashburn\u2019s special duty test to mean reliance that is both detrimental and justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Tiffany Did Not Detrimentally Rely On The Dispatcher\u2019s Promise To Send An Officer</p>\n<p id=\"AhC\">It is undisputed that Tiffany did not detrimentally rely on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out.\u201d Lying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>semiconscious or unconscious outside the residence, Tiffany was not aware that her assailants called the HCSO, much less that Archer promised to send an officer. \u201c[I]t is impossible for a person who has been deprived of any realistic opportunity to choose between alternative \u2018avenues of protection\u2019 to detrimentally rely upon a municipality\u2019s promise of assistance.\u201d <em>Grieshaber v. City of Albany, </em>279 A.D.2d 232, 720 N.Y.S.2d 214, 216 (N.Y.App.Div.2001). Tiffany did not stay outside because she was expecting a police rescue. <em>Compare Noakes v. City of Seattle, </em>77 Wash.App. 694, 895 P.2d 842, 845 (1995) (question of fact presented by evidence that victims may have relied on 911 dispatcher\u2019s promise to send police in deciding to stay inside house as intruder was breaking in); <em>De Long v. County of Erie, </em>60 N.Y.2d 296, 469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d 717, 721 (1983) (same) <em>with Grieshaber, </em>720 N.Y.S.2d at 216 (evidence that victim was already under attack when she reached 911 dispatcher prevented showing of detrimental reliance); <em>White v. Beasley, </em>453 Mich. 308, 552 N.W.2d 1, 20 (1996) (victim who contacted neighbors, but was unaware neighbors then called 911 on her behalf did not detrimentally rely on promise of police protection); <em>R.C. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>759 S.W.2d 617, 621 (Mo.App.1988) (no detrimental reliance by victim who was already under attack when her roommate called for help). Because Tiffany did not call for help, did not know that the callers had done so, did not know that Archer promised to send someone out, and did not \u201cchoose\u201d to stay outside in reliance on that promise, she did not detrimentally rely on a promise of police assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Acknowledging that she cannot establish detrimental reliance by the victim, appellant argues instead that the detrimental reliance of Tiffany\u2019s assailants and would-be rescuers was sufficient to establish a special duty. Appellant asserts that Archer\u2019s promise to the boys who called on Tiffany\u2019s behalf increased Tiffany\u2019s peril because the callers detrimentally relied on it by foregoing opportunities to make an easy rescue. In effect, she seeks to \u201ctransfer\u201d the potential rescuers\u2019 detrimental reliance to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has been called upon to apply the \u201cspecific reliance\u201d requirement in a case where the call for emergency assistance was made by someone other than the person in need of that assistance. Thus, we found no Maryland precedent on this \u201ctransfer of reliance\u201d question. Although the language in the <em>Ashburn </em>test speaks in terms of detrimental reliance by the victim, we do not read <em>Ashburn </em>as providing a definitive answer to this question. That language may reflect only that <em>Ashburn </em>did not involve a third party request for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Several other courts, however, have addressed \u201cthird party caller\u201d cases. Many have held that emergency calls by third parties do not satisfy their state\u2019s special duty test, because the victim must have been aware of the promise to send assistance. <em>See, e.g., Cuffy v., City of New York, </em>69 N.Y.2d 255, 513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d 937, 941 (1987) (no special duty owed when plaintiff did not know about promise of police protection); <em>Mullin v. City of South Bend, </em>639 N.E.2d 278, 285 (Ind.1994) (no special duty when plaintiff was not aware of municipal policy governing dispatch of ambulances); <em>City of Rome v. Jordan, </em>263 Ga. 26, 426 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1993) (no special duty when plaintiff was aware only that police had been called); <em>White v. Beasley, </em>453 Mich. 308, 552 N.W.2d 1, 7 (1996) (no special duty when plaintiff was not aware that neighbors called to report assault).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In <em>Kircher v. City of Jamestown, </em>74 N.Y.2d 251, 544 N.Y.S.2d 995, 543 N.E.2d 443 (1989), the New York Court of Appeals explicitly rejected a \u201ctransferred reliance\u201d argument based on the reliance of third parties on a police promise of assistance in discontinuing rescue efforts. Two \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d bystanders witnessed a midday kidnapping and assault in a parking lot. They pursued the abductor. When they encountered a police officer, they reported the abduction, gave a description of the assailant and victim, and provided the make and license number of the car. The officer told them he would \u201ccall it in.\u201d \u201cBelieving that [their] report ... would suffice,\u201d the would-be rescuers abandoned their pursuit, and made no further effort to summon police. <em>Id. </em>544 N.Y.S.2d 995, 543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>N.E.2d at 444. The officer never reported the abduction. Traveling major highways in the same car, the abductor beat and raped the plaintiff, then left her for dead in the trunk. Twelve hours later a passerby who heard her pleas for help rescued her.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Citing policy reasons, the New York Court of Appeals held that no special duty was owed to the victim-plaintiff because the would-be rescuers\u2019 detrimental reliance on the police officer\u2019s promise</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">cannot \u201cbe transferred to the plaintiffs benefit\u201d [because] ... proof of their reliance does not satisfy the policy concern underlying the reliance requirement \u2014 providing the \u201cessential causative link\u201d between the municipality and the alleged injury.... Requiring that there be such reliance is consistent with the purpose of the special duty rule to place controllable limits on the scope of the municipality\u2019s duty of protection and to prevent the exception from swallowing the general rule---- Absent this requirement, a municipality would be exposed to liability every time one of its citizens was victimized by a crime and the municipality failed to take appropriate action although notified of the incident \u2014 so vast an expansion of the duty of protection should not emanate from the judicial branch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\"><em>Id. </em>544 N.Y.S.2d 995, 543 N.E.2d at 447-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The \u201cvictim reliance\u201d requirement has been criticized as unjustifiably harsh when it precludes recovery on behalf of incapacitated victims, but this criticism generally has not resulted in a significant relaxation of that requirement. For example, in <em>Merced v. City of New York, </em>142 Misc.2d 442, 534 N.Y.S.2d 60, 62 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1987), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>75 N.Y.2d 798, 552 N.Y.S.2d 96, 551 N.E.2d 589 (1990), a New York trial court held that the reliance requirement of New York\u2019s special duty test must be broadened to include callers or complainants who relied on the police officers for assistance____[because] \u2018but for\u2019 this reliance upon the officers the callers ... may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>affirmatively given aid to the decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u201cthe involvement of third parties did not satisfy the[ ] requirements\u201d of direct contact and detrimental reliance by the victim, because \u201cthe municipality\u2019s conduct [did not] deprive[ ] decedent of assistance that reasonably could have been expected from another source.\u201d <em>Merced v. City of New York, </em>75 N.Y.2d 798, 552 N.Y.S.2d 96, 551 N.E.2d 589, 589-90 (N.Y.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We also find an instructive debate on this question in <em>White v. Beasley, </em>453 Mich. 308, 552 N.W.2d 1 (1996), in which neighbors who heard the decedent being attacked called 911 on her behalf.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority held that the decedent did not rely on any affirmative action taken by the police, because she never contacted them and \u201chad no knowledge of a promise [of help] on which she could rely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The dissent argued that a strict application of the victim reliance requirement \u201cto crimes in progress, ... leads to an odd unjust result where the victim least able to help himself, that is, least able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>change the course of his actions, is the one least able to \u2018rely\u2019 on the police officer\u2019s obligation to help him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. The majority rejected the notion that evidence of reliance on a police officer\u2019s generalized \u201cobligation to help\u201d is sufficient to establish a special duty. A claim premised solely on the argument that \u201cit was the officer\u2019s \u2018duty\u2019 to aid victims of crime .... is tantamount to arguing that a tort duty can be established solely on the basis of defendants\u2019 job title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Holding that \u201cthe public duty doctrine ... protects] government employees from liability based solely on their job title,\u201d the Court \u201crefuse[d] to allow the exception to contradict the rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Nevertheless, there appears to be a few circumstances in which courts have eschewed an \u201coverly rigid\u201d application of the requirement of detrimental reliance by the victim. <em>See, e.g., Lauer v. City of New York, </em>95 N.Y.2d 95, 711 N.Y.S.2d 112, 733 N.E.2d 184, 196 (2000) (dissenting opinion) (\u201cWhile direct contact is necessary, this Court has not been overly rigid in its application, taking the particularities of each case into consideration\u201d); <em>Cuffy, </em>513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d at 940 (same). The rationale for permitting a third party\u2019s detrimental reliance to satisfy the special duty test appears to be that the third party caller\u2019s proximity and close relationship with the victim, and the nature of the victim\u2019s peril, afforded the caller a significant opportunity to become a \u201crescuer.\u201d In such cases, by promising assistance, but failing to reasonably provide it, emergency personnel may not merely fail to confer the benefit of their assistance; instead, they also may increase the peril by depriving the victim of assistance that reasonably could have been expected from another source \u2014 the caller and would \u2014 be rescuer. <em>See Merced, </em>552 N.Y.S.2d 96, 551 N.E.2d at 590 (citing <em>Sorichetti v. City of New York, </em>65 N.Y.2d 461, 492 N.Y.S.2d 591, 482 N.E.2d 70, 76 (1985) (special duty arose as result of mother\u2019s reasonable reliance on police who promised help in recovering infant daughter abducted by abusive husband who was subject to protective order)).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">One case in which detrimental reliance by a third party caller presented a jury question is <em>Koher v. Dial, </em>653 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>524 (Ind.App.1995). A police radio dispatcher failed to dispatch an ambulance in response to a wife\u2019s report that her husband was having a heart attack. In reliance on the dispatcher\u2019s promise that an ambulance would be sent immediately, neither the wife nor her neighbors transported the husband to a nearby hospital. Seventeen minutes after her 911 call, the wife called the fire department, which sent an ambulance that arrived one minute later. <em>See id. </em>at 525. The delay in medical treatment allegedly caused permanent heart damage. Plaintiffs later learned that due to the annual sheriffs department picnic, the police dispatcher was an untrained substitute who never dispatched the promised ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The appellate court concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate on the special duty issue, because there was evidence that the wife and neighbors decided not to transport the husband to the hospital or delayed seeking other ambulance services, in reliance on the dispatcher\u2019s promise to send an ambulance immediately. <em>See id. </em>at 527. The <em>Koher </em>Court reasoned that the wife\u2019s reliance on the dispatcher\u2019s promise of such assistance could satisfy the detrimental reliance component of the special duty test because the wife and neighbors remained ready, willing, and able to aid the victim, but delayed their rescue efforts for a brief period in the expectation that an ambulance would be sent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">A number of factors may have been relevant to the <em>Koher </em>court\u2019s decision to permit a special duty claim based on third party reliance, including (1) the close personal relationship of the third party caller to the victim (i.e., wife-husband), (2) the caller\u2019s continuing presence at the scene to render aid to the victim and to ensure that emergency personnel reached the victim, (3) the caller\u2019s reliance on the dispatcher\u2019s promise of help in temporarily ceasing efforts to obtain assistance and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>not attempting an \u201ceasy rescue\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>transporting the victim herself), and (4) the caller\u2019s continuation of those efforts when she realized that the promised assistance had not arrived. Together, these factors indicate that the third party had a continuing willingness and ability to rescue the victim. In these circumstances, a fact finder might conclude that the third party\u2019s reliance on the promise of emergency assistance increased the victim\u2019s peril by depriving the victim of assistance that reasonably could have been expected from that third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">For the reasons set forth below, however, we shall leave the resolution of this \u201ctransferred reliance\u201d question for another day. We conclude that we need not decide whether a third party\u2019s detrimental reliance can create a special duty to rescue, because, even if we assume that it could, the third party reliance in this case did not do so. Accordingly, we shall assume, without deciding, that Tiffany\u2019s assailants did detrimentally rely on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out,\u201d by foregoing their opportunities to rescue Tiffany on the expectation that the police would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Appellant Did Not Establish Specific Reliance Because The Callers Did Not Justifiably Rely On The Dispatcher\u2019s Promise</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Applying the second prong of the reliance test to the uniquely tragic circumstances of this case, we conclude that appellant cannot establish that these third party callers justifiably relied on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out.\u201d An assurance that an officer will be sent out is not necessarily an assurance that the officer can and will remove the victim from her peril. If such an assurance creates an expectation of rescue on the part of the third party who called for assistance, any reliance on that expectation must have been warranted under the circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Mullin, </em>639 N.E.2d at 284 (contact \u201cmust be such that the governmental entity has induced the injured person justifiably to rely on its taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>action for the benefit of that particular person to his detriment\u201d). Here, the pleadings show that any expectation by these assailants that Archer\u2019s promise to send an officer to 1436 K Court would result in a police rescue of their victim was unreasonable and unjustified as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">It is undisputed that these third party callers deliberately reported inaccurate information regarding the location and condition of their victim. They intentionally provided an invented address that did not exist. When Archer asked for an exact street address and mentioned \u201cHarford Square,\u201d they did not tell her the other name for K Court \u2014 \u201cCharleston Drive.\u201d Moreover, they did not tell Archer that Tiffany was unconscious and partially undressed, that they had assaulted her, or that she was in no condition to \u201crescue herself\u2019 by simply coming inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Although they knew or should have known that the police had inaccurate and incomplete information regarding Tiffany\u2019s location and condition, the callers blithely assumed that the police would figure out where she was. When they checked on her \u201conce,\u201d she was still lying there unconscious. Knowing that the police had not found her, and aware of the life threatening weather conditions, they made plans to bring her inside. When Eric\u2019s mother refused to let her son go outside, all three of them abandoned their rescue plans. They made no further effort to find out whether the police had located and rescued Tiffany, to aid or rescue Tiffany, to recontact the HCSO, or to summon another rescuer. Instead, they callously left her outside to die, while they enjoyed shelter just a short distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">This, they were not entitled to do. They had an affirmative, nondelegable duty to rescue the girl they had abused, assaulted, imperiled, and abandoned. <em>See Groninger, supra, </em>26 Pepp. L.Rev. at 374 n. 225. As a matter of law, assailants who request help on behalf of their victim cannot \u201cjustifiably\u201d rely on a generalized promise to send an officer in deciding to leave their victim in the peril that they created. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Their reliance on Archer\u2019s promise to \u201csend someone out\u201d was unquestionably unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We would reach the same result, however, even if these third parties had not been Tiffany\u2019s assailants. First, third parties who intentionally provide inaccurate and incomplete information regarding the person in need of assistance cannot \u201creasonably\u201d rely on their unconfirmed expectation that, despite such information, help will arrive. Second, third parties who request help on behalf of a victim may not \u201creasonably\u201d rely on a promise of assistance when they permanently, rather than temporarily, abandon their rescue efforts. Reliance is not justifiable when the promise of assistance does not prevent the third parties from taking steps to help the victim once they know or should know that the promised assistance was not given. <em>See, e.g., Cuffy, </em>513 N.Y.S.2d 372, 505 N.E.2d at 942 (family did not justifiably rely on police assurances of protection \u201cfirst thing in the morning\u201d where police did not come and family was not attacked until the next evening, because family was not \u201ctrapped and unable to take steps to protect itself when its members knew or should have known that police assistance would not be forthcoming\u201d); <em>Merced, </em>552 N.Y.S.2d 96, 551 N.E.2d at 590 (municipality\u2019s promise to send police officers to investigate did not \u201cdeprive! ] decedent of assistance that reasonably could have been expected from another source,\u201d including neighbors who called to report assault); <em>Huston v. Montgomery County, </em>1995 WL 766308, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19248 (E.D.Pa.1995) (dispatcher\u2019s error in sending ambulance to wrong address did not deprive decedent of assistance from fiancee who called for help, because it did not \u201cactively prevent[ ] ... fiancee from seeking help from other sources\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Here, it is clear that Archer\u2019s promise of assistance did not increase Tiffany\u2019s peril by depriving her of assistance that reasonably could have been expected from these third parties. Archer\u2019s promise to send an officer to the fictitious address they provided did not prevent them from determining whether Tiffany had been rescued, nor did it prevent them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>seeking other assistance, nor did it prevent them from providing assistance themselves. At best, these third parties merely-had a generalized expectation that their call would result in a police rescue. Even assuming that this expectation was justified for a brief period, it did not remain justifiable \u201cforever.\u201d To the extent that Archer\u2019s promise created an expectation of rescue, the continuation of that expectation without any effort to determine whether the rescue occurred was not justified under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Sad and difficult as this case is, we conclude that the criminal and civilly unjustified acts of these third party callers cannot establish the specific reliance necessary to impose a special duty on this police dispatcher. We are in agreement with the recent comments of the New York Court of Appeals that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[wjithout a duty running directly to the injured person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm.... Fixing the orbit of duty may be a difficult task. Despite often sympathetic facts in a particular case ..., courts must be mindful of the prece-dential, and consequential, future effects of their rulings, and \u201climit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree.\u201d Time and again we have required \u201cthat the equation be balanced, that the damaged plaintiff be able to point the finger of responsibility at a defendant owing, not a general duty to society, but a specific duty to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">This is especially so where an individual seeks recovery out of the public purse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\"><em>Lauer, </em>711 N.Y.S.2d 112, 733 N.E.2d at 187-88 (citations omitted).

Although the \u201cno duty to rescue\" rule has been widely discussed and criticized from both a legal and moral perspective, few states have enacted \"duty-to-aid\u201d legislation. <em>See generally </em>L. Murphy, <em>Beneficence, Law, and Liberty: The Case of Required Rescue, </em>89 Geo. L.J. 605, 611 n. 23 (2001) (summarizing state laws imposing a duty to aid crime victims or to report criminal activity). A duty to rescue \"may be established in a number of ways: (1) by statute or rule, (2) by contractual or other private relationship, or <em>(3) </em>indirectly or impliedly by virtue of the relationship between the tortfeasor and a third party[.]\u201d <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 715, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997) (citations omitted). In this case, we are concerned only with the \u201cprivate relationship\u201d grounds for imposing a private duty of care. <em>Compare, e.g., Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 753 A.2d 41 (2000)(considering whether domestic violence protection statute imposed on police officer a special duty to protect domestic violence victims).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">. The rule also embodies the common law distinction between action and inaction. <em>See, e.g., Restatement </em>\u00a7 314 cmt. c (\"The origin of the rule lay in the early common law distinction between action and inaction, or \u2018misfeasance\u2019 and \u2018nonfeasance\u2019 \u201d). We think this distinction has been persuasively criticized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Whatever practical difficulties a court may encounter in distinguishing nonfeasance from misfeasance, once made, the distinction is more than academic. If a court characterizes the defendant's behavior as nonfeasance, ... the defendant ordinarily will owe no duty to the plaintiff; the case may be dismissed. As a result, unreasonable behavior may be immune from liability as long as a defendant can successfully characterize it as nonfeasance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">[T]he distinction between action and inaction is not necessarily the difference between causation and the lack of it....

In that case, decided before New York adopted its widely followed special duty test, the court considered a judgment in favor of the estate of a murder victim. <em>See De Long </em>v. <em>County of Erie, </em>60 N.Y.2d 296, 469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d 717 (1983). The victim, who lived a block and a half from a police station, called 911, asking for the police to \"come right away\u201d to \u201c319 Victoria\u201d because a man was trying to break into her house. A complaint writer for Erie County responded, \u201cOkay, right away.\u201d Unfortunately, he recorded \"219 Victoria,\u201d then assumed that the call originated from Victoria Avenue in Buffalo rather than 319 Victoria Boulevard in Kenmore, a small village adjacent to Buffalo. He relayed the incorrect street address to a police dispatcher, who reported a burglary in progress at the city address. Three minutes later, responding officers reported that there was no such address. Five minutes after the call came in, the police dispatcher \u201ccleared the call,\u201d effectively telling officers to disregard it. Thirteen minutes after she called 911, Mrs. De Long was seen running from her house, naked and bleeding. A neighbor called the local police, who arrived in a minute. Mrs. De Long bled to death from multiple stab wounds. <em>See id. </em>469 N.Y.S.2d 611, 457 N.E.2d at 719.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\">. The Arizona cases cited by appellant for the proposition that \"[s]ome courts have reasonably found that, by providing a 911 service, a municipality assumes a duty of care to those it serves,\u201d are not persuasive because in both, liability was premised on a specific contact between the specific dispatcher and the specific victim. <em>See, e.g., Austin v. City of Scottsdale, </em>140 Ariz. 579, 684 P.2d 151 (1984) (dispatcher owed duty based on anonymous call regarding death threat against specific person at specific address); <em>Hutcherson v.

Although we need not decide whether, as a matter of law, Archer was a government employee, we do note that the record before us does not reveal facts that may be relevant to that decision, including what Archer\u2019s specific duties were, what discretion she had in interpreting information provided by a caller, whether Archer was the dispatcher who spoke with officer Thomas, whether Archer relayed to another dispatcher the correct \"K Court\u201d location \"in the woods,\u201d whether Archer or another dispatcher recognized that the street address provided by the caller did not exist, and whether the dispatch to J Court was a deliberate change in the address provided by the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Moreover, even if we accepted the highly questionable proposition that police dispatchers such as Archer are, as a matter of law, \u201cmere receptionists\u201d who perform only nondiscretionary acts, we would still apply the special duty rule.

In that case, neighbors of the decedent called 911 to report they heard screams and calls for help coming from the apartment of the decedent and her husband, and they saw a man with a gun near the apartment. When police officers arrived, one of the callers \u201cbuzzed them in,\u201d but another tenant who encountered them in the hallway reported that everything was quiet. The officers left without going up to the decedent's seventh floor apartment to check on her welfare. Within a short time, one of the earlier complainants called 911 to say that the police had not yet responded and that emergency assistance was needed. The 911 dispatcher contacted the same officers, who stated that all was well and under control. They did not investigate further. The next morning, the neighbors discovered the body of Ms. Merced, who bled to death from a gunshot wound. <em>See Merced v.
