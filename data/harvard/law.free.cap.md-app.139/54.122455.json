In the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a jury (Hon. S. Michael Pincus, presiding) convicted Kelly Lynn Bradshaw, appellant, of felony murder and related offenses. The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that, on or about September 29, 1998, appellant and one Darryl \u201cSpeedy\u201d Butler (1) conspired to rob Olanipekun \u201cTony\u201d Oyefusi, appellant\u2019s husband, and (2) murdered Mr. Oyefusi during their attempt to commit the robbery. In support of her argument that the interspousal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>immunity defense is applicable, appellant presents two questions on that issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">Whether the trial court erred in refusing to give a requested jury instruction that a wife cannot be convicted of stealing from her husband and, therefore, cannot be guilty of conspiracy to rob or attempted robbery of her husband nor his felony murder based on the felony of attempted robbery?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">and, if the answer to this question is \u201cyes,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of felony murder, conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">For the reasons that follow, we are persuaded that a defendant can be convicted of the <em>robbery </em>or <em>attempted robbery of </em>his or her spouse \u2014 whether either of those offenses is committed by the defendant alone or in concert with one of more accomplices. We shall therefore affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">INTERSPOUSAL IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">According to Professor Hochheimers treatise on Crimes and Criminal Procedure,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">[a] married woman can not incur the guilt of larceny by a taking of her husband\u2019s goods or chattels, [and] ... [t]he husband cannot, at the common law, incur the guilt of larceny by a taking of his wife\u2019s goods or chattels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Lewis Hochheimer, <em>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure, </em>Sec. 368 at pp. 405-406 (2d ed., The Baltimore Book Company, 1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Although the crimes of \u201cgrand larceny\u201d and \u201cpetty larceny\u201d were abolished as of July 1, 1979, the date on which our theft statute took effect, the elements of larceny were retained in the crime of robbery until October 1,2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>When our theft statute was enacted, the General Assembly decided to modify, rather than abolish, the interspousal immunity defense. Md. Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 343(c) &amp; (d)(2001) expressly provides that the following defenses and presumptions are applicable to cases in which a defendant is charged with theft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">(c) Good faith; property of spouse; trade secrets. \u2014 It is a defense to the offense of theft that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">(1) The defendant acted under a good faith claim of right to the property involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">(2) The defendant acted in the honest belief that he had the right to obtain or exert control over the property as he did;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">(3) The property involved was that of the defendant\u2019s spouse, unless the defendant and the defendant\u2019s spouse were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">(4) In cases of theft of a trade secret, that the defendant rightfully knew the trade secret or that it was available to him from a source other than the owner of the trade secret.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">(d) Common law and evidentiary presumptions. \u2014 All common law and evidentiary presumptions applicable on July 1, 1979 to offenses which are consolidated under the provisions of this subheading are also applicable to the offense of theft, unless specifically repealed or modified by the provisions of this subheading, or unless modified by court decisions rendered after July 1, 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charges of felony murder and attempted robbery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>arguing that appellant \u201ccould not, as a matter of law, commit the crime of larceny or attempted larceny against Mr. Oyefusi, her husband, on [the] date [of his death].\u201d According to appellant, because it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that she and the victim were married, and because larceny or attempted larceny is an \u201cessential element of attempted robbery,\u201d the \u201clong standing doctrine of interspousal immunity\u201d recognized in Maryland was applicable to the felony murder and related charges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">The prosecutor argued in response</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">that the public policy that supports this interspousal immunity is limited to theft. It doesn\u2019t extend further up the chain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">There is no immunity for robbery. There is no immunity for felony murder. It is much more limited ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">There is a much greater difference between a theft which has to do with some kind of ownership issues and robbery, which is a crime against person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">After quoting from <em>Parham v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 152, 556 A.2d 280 (1989), in which this Court held \u201cthat the marital relationship does not preclude a conviction for burglary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 161, 556 A.2d 280, the prosecutor added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">[t]here is no immunity for Mr. Butler, and therefore, you know, her liability is bootstrapped to Mr. Butler\u2019s, and she can\u2019t gain protection for what she assisted somebody else in doing, and the conspiratorial liability laws in this state would indicate she is liable for the actions that she aids, abets and acts that she takes in furtherance of the conspiracy that she has joined in here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">After considering the arguments of counsel, Judge Pincus ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">[Under] 343(c)(3) ... it is a defense that the property involved was that of the defendant spouse, unless the parties were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">The evidence with respect to the first prong, whether or not the parties were living together as man and wife, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Court is prepared to find as a matter of law that he had kicked her out, that she was elsewhere for at least eight days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that they had sex on the evening in question, the evidence is clear to the Court that they were not living together as man and wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">The second prong, abodes, I am looking at the dictionary. Webster\u2019s College Dictionary defines abode as a place in which a person resides, a residence, a dwelling, a home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Ms. Bradshaw was residing at various places, but I suppose particularly at the Webbs\u2019 for the longest period of time between the time she was kicked out and the day in question, September 29th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">The plain reading of the statute to the Court and the plain use of the words that the statute uses indicates to the Court that they were not living together as man and wife and they were in fact living in separate abodes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">Further, based on the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute and research, that the statutory intent would restrict\u2014 mandates a restriction of the statutory application of the crime of theft and does not extend to crimes such as count 1, felony murder, based on the robbery felony, and count 2, attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">There is a case in Maryland, <em>Lusby versus Lusby, </em>at 283 Md. [334, 390 A.2d 77 (1978) ] which deals with whether interspousal immunity \u2014 the interspousal immunity doctrine protected a husband from being sued in a tort action by his wife for forcing her vehicle off the road and pointing a high-powered rifle at her, forcing her to enter his vehicle, and during this event he struck her, tore off her clothes and then forcibly and violently raped her against her will and aided two others in raping her as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The court in <em>Lusby </em>stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">\u201cWe can conceive of no sound public policy in the latter half of the 20th Century which would prevent one spouse from recovering from another from the outrageous conduct here alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cThere certainly can be no domestic tranquility to be preserved in the face of allegations such as those we have before us. The court does not and cannot conceive of the statutory intent to extend the interspousal immunity to crimes such as those which are here involved.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 357, 390 A.2d 77].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Now \u2014 and I realize the stacking theory or the foundation upon which robbery would be built. Finally, clearly her liability is connected with that of Mr. Butler, and under those theories, as enunciated by the court, the Court will deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel thereafter noted a timely exception to Judge Pincus\u2019 refusal to give the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATx\">You have heard evidence that Tony Oyefusi and Kelly Bradshaw were legally married. In order to prove that the defendant is guilty of attempted armed robbery and first degree felony murder, one of the elements that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant attempted to commit the crime of theft. It is a defense to the crime of theft and, therefore, to the crimes of attempted armed robbery and first degree felony murder that the property involved was that of the defendant spouse, Mr. Oyefusi, unless the parties were not living together as man and wife or were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged attempted theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">You are required to find that the defendant is not guilty of attempted armed robbery and first degree felony murder of if either of the following factors are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">One, the parties were living together as man and wife, or two, the parties were not living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Living together as man and wife requires that the parties engage in sexual intercourse. An abode is a person\u2019s home, habitation or domicile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">In order to convict the defendant of attempted armed robbery and first degree felony murder, the State must show that the defense of interspousal immunity does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>apply in this case by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that both of the two factors previously stated were absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We agree with Judge Pincus that appellant was not entitled to either a judgment of acquittal or an \u201cinterspousal defense\u201d instruction pursuant to Article 27, Sec. 343(c)(3). Our holding is consistent with <em>Parham, Lusby, </em>and <em>Jupiter v. State, </em>328 Md. 635, 616 A.2d 412 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals rejected the contention that a man who used force to obtain beer from a licensed seller could not be convicted of robbery because he made full payment to the seller when the seller handed over the beer. <em>Id. </em>at 645-646, 616 A.2d 412. Our holding is also consistent with <em>Cates v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 363, 320 A.2d 75 (1974) in which we held that, even though Mr. Cates was entitled by statute to recover his gambling losses, he was guilty of robbery for recovering those losses through \u201cforce of arms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 320 A.2d 75. Whether acting alone or in concert with another person, a spouse who attempts to rob his or her spouse can be convicted of attempted robbery, and \u2014 if the victim-spouse is killed during the attempted robbery \u2014 of felony murder as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">ARGUMENTS FOR REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Appellant argues in the alternative that, even if she was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal, she is entitled to a new trial because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN EXCLUDING THE TESTIMONY OF AN EXPERT WITNESS CONSULTED BY THE DEFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING TESTIMONY RELATING TO A WRITTEN POEM OR RAP SONG WHICH HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY STATE\u2019S WITNESSES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO GIVE A MISSING WITNESS INSTRUCTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">There is no merit in any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Exclusion of Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Appellant\u2019s trial began on October 12, 1999. In a September 24, 1999 letter to the prosecutor, appellant\u2019s trial counsel stated that the defense expected to call Dr. John Davis to testify regarding the effects of \u201calcohol, alcoholism, and the effects of alcohol on our client, based on our client\u2019s history and the amount of alcohol she drank on the day of the alleged crimes.\u201d Dr. Davis interviewed appellant on October 1, 1999. On October 5, 1999, appellant\u2019s trial counsel received a one page report from Dr. Davis and immediately faxed a copy to the prosecutor. The State moved <em>in limine </em>for an order prohibiting Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony, and Judge Pincus granted that motion on the first day of trial, expressly stating that the defense had \u201cthe right to ask me to reconsider [this ruling].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">On October 19, 1999, the sixth day of trial, the State requested that Judge Pincus vacate the order excluding Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony. Judge Pincus declared a recess so that appellant\u2019s trial counsel could attempt to contact Dr. Davis, who had told appellant\u2019s trial counsel that he would be \u201cout of town October 20th and 21st ... testifying in another state.\u201d After the recess, appellant\u2019s trial counsel stated, \u201c[A]t this point, I can\u2019t get him, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">According to appellant, the State\u2019s objections to Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony \u201cresulted from gamesmanship rather than prejudice,\u201d and the State\u2019s decision to withdraw its opposition to that testimony caused \u201ca tremendous disadvantage\u201d to the defense. We disagree. During the <em>in limine </em>hearing, Judge Pincus asked appellant\u2019s trial counsel the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">[H]ow do you respond to the complaint by the State that they have not had a chance to consult with and retain their own expert to rebut [Dr. Davis\u2019] testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>How can they talk to a doctor and say, listen doctor, this is what the defense is going to say? What is your opinion? When they have not even received a report and do not until the 5th of October ..., which is less than a week away from this trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Judge Pincus did not receive a satisfactory answer to either of those questions. He explained to appellant\u2019s trial counsel that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai-dedup-0\">the defense\u2019s decision to sit on their hands, so to speak, at this point, is good enough to convince me to deny [a] motion [to permit Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Even if Dr. Davis had been permitted to testify, he could not have testified to what appellant told him when he interviewed her, because appellant\u2019s hearsay statement is simply not \u201cof a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d Md. Rule 5-703(a); <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 581, 611 A.2d 581 (1992); <em>Waltermeyer v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 69, 80, 480 A.2d 831 (1984). We are persuaded that Judge Pincus neither erred nor abused his discretion in granting the motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Davis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Testimony about a Written Poem or Rap Song</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The State called James Webb to testify that, during the evening of September 29, 1998, he saw appellant and Butler \u201cwriting stuff down\u201d in a notebook that they passed \u201cback and forth to each other.\u201d At one point, Butler entered the Webb residence to use the bathroom. Later, when Mr. Webb entered the bathroom, he saw a sheet of notebook paper containing the words, \u201ccut the motherfucker, something about duct tape and a baseball bat or a bat.\u201d Mr. Webb showed this paper to his wife, who also testified to the contents of the writing, which had disappeared. Mrs. Webb stated \u201cpositively\u201d that appellant\u2019s handwriting was not on this paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Appellant\u2019s' \u201cauthentication\u201d and \u201chearsay\u201d objections to the testimony about this evidence are answered by Md. Rules 5-901(b)(4), 5-1004(a) and (b), and 5-803(a)(5), as well as by <em>Gray v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 699, 456 A.2d 1290 (1983) and <em>Gerald v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 295, 305, 768 A.2d 140 (2001). The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that Mr. Webb observed a document that \u201cwas authored [by appellant\u2019s co-conspirator] ... in furtherance of the exclusive object of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Gray, supra, </em>53 Md.App. at 716, 456 A.2d 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Missing Witness Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Appellant\u2019s question of \u201c[w]hether the trial court erred in refusing to give a missing witness instruction\u201d is answered by <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999), in which the Court of Appeals held that a party entitled to make a \u201cmissing evidence\u201d argument is \u201cnot entitled to such an instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 741 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">.
