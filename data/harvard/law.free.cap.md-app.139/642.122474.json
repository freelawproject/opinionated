EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">After Sears, Roebuck and Co. (\u201cSears\u201d), the appellant, terminated Edward L. Wholey, the appellee, from his position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>as Security Supervisor at the Sears store in Glen Bumie, Maryland, Wholey sued Sears and Paul Eiseman, a Regional Manager of Asset Protection Services for Sears, for wrongful discharge and defamation, among other claims. The case was tried before a jury, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which returned a verdict against Sears on Wholey\u2019s wrongful discharge claim, in favor of Sears on the defamation claim, and in favor of Eiseman on both claims. The jury awarded Wholey $166,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">From a judgment entered on that verdict, Sears appeals, presenting five questions for review. Four of the questions it presents raise a single legal issue: Whether, on the facts most favorable to Wholey, his termination violated a clear mandate of public policy. For the following reasons, we answer that question in the negative, and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Wholey was employed by Sears in its Glen Bumie store for 24 years. He began as a security officer in 1972, and within a year was promoted to Assistant Security Manager. In 1980, Wholey again was promoted, to Security Manager. Finally, in 1994, he became a Security Supervisor. From 1980 until Sears terminated his employment in 1996, Wholey\u2019s work involved investigating employee theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Beginning in 1973, Wholey also worked as a constable for the District Court of Maryland. In 1980, Wholey became a deputy sheriff for the Anne Arundel County Sheriffs Office. He still was working in that position as of the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">In 1994, a new store manager was hired at the Glen Bumie Sears. Around March of 1995, Wholey began to notice that the store manager sometimes would remove items of merchandise from store display areas and put them in his office. As far as Wholey could tell, the items then would \u201cjust disappear.\u201d Wholey did not see the store manager remove any of these items from his office or take any of them from the store without paying for them. Wholey suspected, however, that the store manager was stealing the merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>In November 1995, Wholey noticed that the store manager had two pairs of pants, \u201cone or two\u201d sweaters, and a jacket-all Sears merchandise-in his office. The items all bore store price tags. Wholey checked the store\u2019s cash registers to see if the store manager had purchased any of the items. When he found no receipts reflecting purchases, Wholey suspected that the store manager was going to steal the items by wearing or carrying them out of the store. He contacted Eiseman, who was responsible for security at the Glen Bumie Sears, and told him of his suspicions. Eiseman suggested that Wholey use a van to perform surveillance on the store manager\u2019s office from an outside window. Wholey did so, but the view from the van was so limited that Wholey could not tell from his surveillance whether the store manager was removing, or had removed, any of the items of merchandise from his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Wholey reported to Eiseman that the surveillance from the van was inadequate and asked permission to enter the store manager\u2019s office at night to search it. Eiseman granted permission. On the night of November 29, 1995, Wholey entered and searched the store manager\u2019s office. He also searched a locked drawer in the office, which he opened with his fingernail. Wholey\u2019s search revealed some but not all of the merchandise that he earlier had seen in the office. He did not know what had happened to the missing items of merchandise. He acknowledged at trial that these items could have been returned to the display floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">From November 30, 1995 through December 14,1995, Who-ley continued to observe the store manager\u2019s movements. During that time, he did not see the store manager remove any of the items from his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On December 15, 1995, Wholey learned that the store manager had made an inquiry about what time one of the security guards would be coming on shift. When he learned that, he suspected that the store manager was going to remove the items of merchandise in his office from the store early the next morning and take them without paying for them. Wholey contacted Eiseman, told him of his suspicions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>and requested permission to install cameras in the ceiling of the store manager\u2019s office, to observe the store manager\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Wholey, Eiseman gave him permission to install the cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">During the early morning hours of December 16, 1995, Wholey and Darlene Hill, the Security Manager for the Glen Bumie Sears, installed the cameras. Afterward, Hill went home and Wholey remained at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Later that morning, but before the store manager arrived at work, Wholey called Eiseman and reported that the cameras had been installed. During this conversation, Wholey was watching the store\u2019s security cameras and noticed Sam Alexander, the District Store Manager and Eiseman\u2019s superior, enter the store. Wholey asked Eiseman whether he had told Alexander about the installation of the cameras in the store manager\u2019s office. Eiseman replied that he had not. Eiseman then ended the conversation with Wholey and called Alexander.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Sometime in the next two hours, Eiseman made a return call to Wholey and told him not to use the cameras in the store manager\u2019s office and to disable them. Eiseman explained that he had told Alexander and Thomas Peake, Sears\u2019s Human Resources Manger for the Northeast Region, about the cameras and they had ordered that the cameras not be used, because the store manager \u201cdeserve[d] more respect.\u201d Who-ley complied with Eiseman\u2019s directive and disabled and removed the cameras. He discontinued his investigation of the store manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Throughout the time he was investigating the store manager, Wholey never saw the store manager commit the crime of theft (or any other crime). Also, at no time during the investigation did Wholey act in his capacity as a deputy sheriff for the Anne Arundel County Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">On February 6, 1996, Wholey was terminated from his employment by Sears. Eiseman met with him that day and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>told him that Alexander and Peake had not approved of his handling of the investigation of the store manager (particularly, the installation of cameras in the store manager\u2019s office). When Eiseman asked Wholey to resign, Wholey refused, and then was fired. Seven months later, Wholey brought this suit against Sears and Eiseman, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Sears maintained that it terminated Wholey\u2019s employment because he mishandled security problems that occurred at the Glen Bumie store during a severe blizzard in January 1996. Wholey took the position that that was a pretext, and that the true reason for his firing was in retaliation for his investigating suspected theft by the store manager. In the posture in which this appeal presents itself, we shall assume that Sears discharged Wholey for his handling of the investigation of the store manager, as Wholey contended, and not for any alleged actions or inactions by him during the January 1996 blizzard.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">With respect to the wrongful discharge claim, Sears filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and then a motion for summary judgment, which also was denied. In both motions, it argued that, assuming the facts as alleged and as later testified by Wholey in deposition, Wholey\u2019s termination from employment did not violate a clear mandate of public policy, and thus was not actionable. <em>See Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981) <em>(\u201cAdler </em>/\u201d). Sears advocated that position again during trial, when it moved for judgment at the close of Wholey\u2019s case and again at the close of the entire case. Each time Sears raised this issue, Wholey responded by arguing that the public policy of Maryland favors the investigation and prosecution of crimes and that when Sears terminated him for investigating suspected theft by the store manager, it did so in contravention of that clear mandate of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The trial court agreed with Wholey on the public policy issue. After denying Sears\u2019s motions for judgment, it instructed the jury as follows, over Sears\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">[I]n order to recover for wrongful discharge, [Wholey] must show, one, an at-will employment relationship; two, that he was terminated by the employer and that the discharge was contrary to a clear mandate of public policy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">Now, there is a clear public policy in Maryland favoring the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">If you find that the motivation of [Sears] in firing [Who-ley] was in retaliation to [Wholey\u2019s] investigatory activities, then that motivation would contravene the stated public policy of Maryland. You must also find that [Wholey\u2019s] investigatory activities were lawful and in accordance with the stated procedures set forth by [Sears].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Within ten days after entry of judgment, Sears filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, again asserting that Wholey\u2019s discharge did not violate a clear mandate of public policy. Sears also filed a motion for a new trial, in which it argued that the jury had failed to consider the issue of mitigation of damages. The circuit court denied both motions on July 12,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Sears then noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Sears contends that with respect to Wholey\u2019s wrongful discharge claim, the circuit court erred in denying its motions to dismiss, for summary judgment, for judgment, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and in instructing the jury, because on the version of the facts most favorable to Wholey, his termination from employment did not violate a clear mandate of public policy, as a matter of law. Sears argues that there is no clear mandate of public policy favoring the investigation of suspected criminal activity in Maryland; therefore, Wholey\u2019s claim was without legal foundation. In pressing this argument, Sears relies primarily upon the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Circuit in <em>Adler v. American Standard Corporation, </em>830 F.2d 1303 (4th Cir.1987) <em>(\u2018Adler III\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Wholey counters that the circuit court properly concluded, as a matter of law, that in Maryland there is a clear mandate of public policy in favor of investigating criminal activity. Therefore, its denial of Sears\u2019s motions and its instruction to the jury were not in error. In advancing his argument, Wholey relies primarily upon the Court of Appeals\u2019s favorable reference to <em>Palmateer v. International Harvester, </em>85 Ill.2d 124, 52 Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d 876 (1981), in <em>Adler I, </em>291 Md. at 39, 432 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Wholey was an at-will employee of Sears: He did not have an employment contract and was hired for an indefinite term. <em>See Samuels v. Tschechtelin, </em>135 Md.App. 483, 525, 763 A.2d 209 (2000) (citing <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 790, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992); <em>Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 754, 661 A.2d 202 (1995)). Ordinarily, an at-will employee may be discharged by his employer for any reason or for no reason. <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 494-95, 665 A.2d 297 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The tort of -wrongful discharge is a narrow exception to this well-established principle. The elements of the tort are: \u201c(1) that the employee was discharged; (2) that the dismissal violated some clear mandate of public policy; and (3) that there is a nexus between the defendant and the decision to fire the employee.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>105 Md.App. at 764, 661 A.2d 202 (citing <em>Leese v. Baltimore County, </em>64 Md.App. 442, 468, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>497 A.2d 159 (1985)). A public policy must be clearly mandated to serve as a basis for a wrongful discharge action because that \u201climits judicial forays into the wilderness of discerning \u2018public policy\u2019 without clear direction from a legislature or regulatory source.\u201d <em>Milton v. IIT Research Inst., </em>138 F.3d 519, 523 (4th Cir.1998); <em>see also Gaskins v. Marshall Craft Assocs., </em>110 Md.App. 705, 715, 678 A.2d 615 (1996) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen a plaintiff fails to demonstrate that his or her grievance is anything more than a private dispute regarding the employer\u2019s execution of normal management operating procedures, there is no cause of action for [wrongful] discharge.\u201d <em>Lee v. Denro, </em>91 Md.App. 822, 833, 605 A.2d 1017 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201c \u2018Legislative enactments, prior judicial decisions, [and] administrative regulations\u2019 are \u2018the chief sources of public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bleich v. Florence Crittenton Servs. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>98 Md.App. 123, 134, 632 A.2d 463 (1993) (quoting <em>Lee, </em>91 Md.App. at 830, 605 A.2d 1017 (citation omitted). While it is possible that a clear mandate of public policy may exist in the absence of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory pronouncement, this possibility \u201cshould be accepted as the basis of judicial determination, if at all, only with the upmost circumspection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Townsend v. L.W.M. Mgmt., Inc., </em>64 Md. App. 55, 61-62, 494 A.2d 239 (1985) (quoting <em>Patton v. United States, </em>281 U.S. 276, 306, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930)); <em>see also Bagwell, </em>106 Md.App. at 495-96, 665 A.2d 297 (\u201c[R]ecognition of an otherwise undeclared public policy as a basis for judicial decision involves the application of a very nebulous concept to the facts of the case, a practice which should be employed sparingly, if at all.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Lee, </em>91 Md.App. at 831, 605 A.2d 1017 (noting that, although \u201cMaryland appellate courts have decided several cases involving [wrongful] discharge claims since <em>Adler, </em>they have never found such a claim to be stated absent a discharge which violates a public policy set forth in the constitution, a statute, or the common law\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The Court of Appeals first recognized the tort of wrongful discharge in <em>Adler I, supra, </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464, in which it was responding to two certified questions posed by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The pertinent facts of <em>Adler I </em>are as follows. Three years after Gerald F. Adler was hired by American Standard, he was appointed acting president of one of its subsidiary companies. Adler discovered that the outgoing president of the subsidiary, Bernard Greene, had been using a company account to pay kickbacks to clients and had been altering company records to cover up the scheme. Adler reported this information to two of his superiors and told them that he planned to disclose it to high company officials at an upcoming meeting. The night before the meeting, Adler\u2019s superiors fired him. Soon afterwards, Greene was reappointed president of the subsidiary company.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Adler sued American Standard for wrongful discharge, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been discharged to prevent his disclosure of a number of \u201cimproper and possibly illegal practices,\u201d by Greene and American Standard. (These practices included attempts to treat capital expenditures as expenses; payment of commercial bribes; falsification of corporate sales and income data and alteration of commercial documents to support the falsified information; misuse of corporate funds by officers for their personal benefit; manipulation of work-in-progress inventory information; and alteration of forecasts in connection with intra-corporate financial reporting.) <em>Adler I, </em>291 Md. at 33, 432 A.2d 464. The district court certified two questions to the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">(1) Is a cause of action for \u201c[wrongful] discharge\u201d recognized under the substantive law of the State of Maryland? [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">(2) Do the allegations [by Adler], if taken as true, state a cause of action for \u201c[wrongful] discharge\u201d under the substantive law of the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 32, 432 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">After surveying decisions of courts that had considered the cause of action for wrongful discharge, discussing those deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>sions adopting the tort, and examining the violations of public policy that other courts had ruled sufficient to make the discharge of an at-will employee actionable, the Court of Appeals responded affirmatively to the first question. It answered the second question in the negative, however, saying that Adler\u2019s allegations were not sufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Adler had argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Greene\u2019s conduct violated Md.Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.) art. 27 \u00a7 174, which makes it a crime for officers of a corporation to fraudulently sign or assent to any statement \u201ccontaining untruthful representations of [the corporation's] affairs, assets or liabilities with a view either to enhance or depress the market value of the shares therein, or the value of its corporate obligations, or in any manner to accomplish any fraud thereby____\u201d The Court held that the averments in Adler\u2019s complaint were \u201ctoo general, too conclusory, too vague, and lacking in specifics to mount up to a prima facie showing that the claimed misconduct contravened \u00a7 174 and hence violated the public policy of this State.\u201d <em>Adler I, </em>291 Md. at 44, 432 A.2d 464.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">Adler\u2019s complaint does not assert that the falsification of corporate records was done with an intent to defraud either stockholders or the public at large by enhancing or depressing the market value of [American Standard\u2019s] shares or other obligations. As a result, the allegations of the complaint do not set forth a violation of the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 174. Indeed, during oral argument of the case before us, Adler\u2019s counsel was asked whether his complaint was intended to allege the commission of a crime. In response, he stated that he could not say one way or the other whether the claimed misconduct constituted a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 44, 432 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">After the case was returned to the district court, Adler amended his complaint to allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that other employees of American Standard had violated various federal and state tax laws and that he was terminated from employment so as to conceal these alleged violations. American Standard again moved to dismiss, arguing that the statutes in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>did not establish a clear mandate of public policy that would support a cause of action for wrongful discharge. The court denied the motion, ruling that Adler had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a1b-dedup-0\">alleged, with sufficient particularity, that he threatened the exposure of [American Standard\u2019s] violations of federal tax laws, that he was fired as a result and that the tendency of such firing was to prevent the disclosure of these violations, in contravention of a clear federal public policy, which is incorporated as a public policy by the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIos\"><em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>538 F.Supp. 572, 580 (D.Md.1982) <em>(\u201cAdler II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On the eve of trial, Adler told the court that he intended to prove that American Standard had terminated him to conceal violations of theft and federal mail fraud statutes in addition to the statutes that he had identified in his second amended complaint. At the close of the evidence, the federal district court ruled that Adler had failed to prove that American Standard had violated any of the statutes referenced in his second amended complaint. Nonetheless, it sent the wrongful discharge claim to the jury. It instructed the jury to find for Adler on that claim if it determined that his termination had resulted from his stated intention to disclose the kickbacks and from the ensuing cover-up. The jury found for Adler and awarded $1,232,000 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In <em>Adler III, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that Adler had failed to prove that the decision to terminate his employment had been in violation of a clear mandate of public policy. The Court held that, while the public policy of Maryland clearly proscribes terminating an at-will employee for refusing to engage in illegal activity or for complying with, or stating an intention to fulfill, a statutorily prescribed duty, it did not proscribe terminating such an employee for \u201cwhistle blowing.\u201d The Fourth Circuit made the following pertinent observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-x\"><em>Limitation of the claim for [wrongful] discharge to situar tions involving the actual refusal to engage in illegal activity, or the intention to fulfill a statutorily prescribed duty, ties [wrongful] discharge claims down to a managea</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>ble and clear standard. </em>This analysis is consonant with the stated intention of the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Adler </em>[/] to preserve the rights of the employer to terminate employees at will, subject only to the limited exceptions created by statute and to the relatively limited instances where a clear mandate of public policy has been violated. As a general prudential rule, legislatures have traditionally been reluctant to impose affirmative obligations on citizens to report or prevent crimes because defining what is a crime and to whose knowledge is a very difficult and intrusive inquiry. This reluctance imparts caution to this court.... In the absence of a clear declaration by a legislature or the Maryland Court of Appeals that an action for [wrongful] discharge should be extended to situations where the discharged employee claims to have had the knowledge and the intent to report wrongdoing to a higher corporate official, this court should not create such a ruling. We find that the district court erred in determining that the plaintiff had properly stated and proved a cause of action for [wrongful] discharge under Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">What Adler presented at his trial was little more than the allegations and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, that were presented to the Maryland Court and found insufficient to represent a violation of \u201csome clear mandate of public policy.\u201d His allegations and his evidence reveal nothing more than his discharge resulting from his intention to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on illegal activities condoned by his supervisors ... and their efforts to protect themselves by discharging him. This is not a violation of clearly mandated Maryland public policy and it does not involve an effort by Adler to fulfill a statutorily prescribed duty nor his failure to engage in illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1307 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">As we have said, while Sears relies on <em>Adler III to </em>support its argument on appeal, Wholey urges us to follow the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>Palmateer v. International Harvester, supra, 85 </em>I11.2d 124, 52 Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d 876, a case that was decided two months before <em>Adler I </em>and was cited favorably by the Court of Appeals in <em>Adler I. </em>In <em>Palmateer, </em>an at-will employee of the defendant suspected that a co-employee might be committing theft. He reported his suspicions to local law enforcement officials, and offered to assist them in the investigation and trial of the employee. When his employer learned of this, it fired him. In a 4 to 3 decision, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that terminating an at-will employee for reporting a crime to the authorities is contrary to the \u201cclear public policy favoring investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses,\u201d and therefore gives rise to a cause of action for wrongful discharge. <em>Id. 52 </em>Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d at 880. In <em>Adler I, </em>our Court of Appeals quoted from the majority\u2019s opinion in <em>Palmateer. </em>It also quoted the dissent\u2019s criticism, however: \u201c \u2018Here the public policy supporting the cause of action cannot be found in any expression of the legislature but only in the vague belief that public policy requires that we all become \u201ccitizen crime fighters.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Adler I, </em>291 Md. at 39-40, 432 A.2d 464 (quoting <em>Palmateer, 52 </em>Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d at 881) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In the twenty years since <em>Adler I </em>was decided, the Maryland appellate courts have on a number of occasions considered whether and what public policies exist, and are sufficiently clear, so that, when implicated in the termination of an at-will employee, they will support an exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Recently, the Fourth Circuit observed that the cases in which the Maryland appellate courts have identified a clear mandate of public policy are limited to two circumstances: \u201c(1) Where- an employee has been fired for refusing to violate the law or the legal rights of a third party, ... and (2) Where [an] employee has been terminated for exercising a specific legal right or duty,\u201d <em>Milton, </em>138 F.3d at 522 (quoting <em>Thompson v. Memorial Hosp. at Easton, </em>925 F.Supp. 400, 406 (D.Md.1996)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In <em>Milton, supra, </em>138 F.3d 519, the Fourth Circuit, applying Maryland law, adhered to its holding in <em>Adler III </em>that discharging an at-will employee for \u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d is not a violation of clearly mandated Maryland public policy, unless the employee had a legal duty to report the criminal activity. In that case, the employee became convinced that the employer corporation was engaging in illegal schemes to avoid reporting certain taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service. He reported his concerns to others in the company, and an internal investigation of the matter revealed that at least some of his concerns were justified. When his superiors failed to take action to rectify the problem, the employee reported his concerns to the chairman of the board. His superiors then demoted him; when he complained, he was fired. The Fourth Circuit affirmed a federal district court\u2019s dismissal of the employee\u2019s wrongful discharge claim because he did not (and could not) allege that he was fired for refusing to engage in unlawful activities himself, or that he had a statutory duty to disclose the company\u2019s wrongdoing to its board. <em>See also Thompson, </em>925 F.Supp. at 407-08 (applying Maryland law and holding that an at-will hospital employee did not have a cause of action for wrongful discharge when his employment was terminated for reporting to federal authorities a misadminis-tration of radiation, which was the duty of the hospital alone); <em>Shapiro, </em>105 Md.App. at 768-69, 661 A.2d 202 (refusing to consider a claim of wrongful discharge \u201cabsent some clear <em>mandate </em>\u201d or duty for which the plaintiff himself \u201cactually could be held responsible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">As the divergent opinions in <em>Palmateer </em>and <em>Adler III </em>illustrate, appellate courts in this country are not all of the same view on the question whether an at-will employee who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>was fired for \u201cwhistle blowing\u201d can sue for wrongful discharge when he was not personally obligated to report unlawful conduct but his act of doing so was beneficial to society:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"All\">Appellate courts in some jurisdictions that have allowed a cause of action for retaliatory discharge have refused to extend protection to the whistleblower primarily on the ground that the whistleblower is a volunteer, not relying on a personal legal obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">William J.

Tobias, <em>Litigating Wrongful Discharge Claims </em>\u00a7 5:07, at 24 (2000) (citations omitted). In contrast, other jurisdictions conclude that, when an employee investigates and reports criminal activity,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">the employee seeks to benefit society as a whole, instead of asserting a personal right.... There is no public policy more fundamental than the government\u2019s efforts to protect life and property than enforcement of the laws----Permitting employees to fire whistleblowers undermines public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">1 Tobias, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5:13, at 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">In the case at bar, Wholey, like the plaintiff in <em>Palmateer, </em>points to the general theft statute, at Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), art. 27 \u00a7 342, as the source of the \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d supporting his wrongful discharge action. That statute makes theft a crime, but does not impose on citizens a duty to investigate or report theft. Moreover, investigation of theft against Sears was the essence of Wholey\u2019s job responsibility. In that respect, we find the decision of the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Harris, </em>259 Va. 220, 523 S.E.2d 239 (2000), enlightening.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">In <em>Harris, </em>an officer with the City of Virginia Beach Police Department was investigating a burglary complaint when he became involved in a physical altercation with the sister of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tenant whose apartment had been burglarized. After the situation had calmed down, the officer contacted his supervisor, and told him what had happened. Another officer at the scene told the supervisor that the officer\u2019s actions had caused the incident to escalate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The supervisor decided not to bring charges against the victim\u2019s sister until an investigation of the incident was completed. He instructed the officer who had gotten into the altercation to release the victim\u2019s sister to the custody of the internal affairs division. The officer did so, but also obtained a warrant against the victim\u2019s sister, which he had another officer serve. The officer also obtained a warrant against the victim. When the officer\u2019s supervisor learned about the warrants, he demanded that the officer give him the unserved warrant for the victim. The officer did so and the supervisor placed the warrant in his desk. When the charges against the victim\u2019s sister came to trial, the captain of the City of Virginia Beach Police Department sent a letter to the court requesting that they be <em>nolle prossed </em>because the officer had obtained the warrant without permission. The officer then appeared before a magistrate and obtained warrants against his supervisor for two charges of obstruction of justice and one charge of delay in executing lawful process. At that point, the officer was discharged from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The officer brought a wrongful discharge action against the City of Virginia Beach and several members of the police department. He argued that the criminal statutes prohibiting obstruction of justice and delay in executing legal process established a clear mandate of public policy that the City violated when it discharged him. At the close of the evidence, the trial court held that the officer had been wrongfully discharged because no one, including the officer\u2019s supervisor, had the authority to order a police officer not to arrest a person who had violated the law and, as a matter of law, the City of Virginia Beach was liable. The jury returned a verdict against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The Supreme Court of Virginia reversed. With regard to the liability of the City of Virginia Beach, it observed that, under Virginia law, an at-will employee may recover in a wrongful discharge claim if he can show that his termination was in contravention of a statute \u201cdesigned to protect the \u2018property rights, personal freedoms, health, safety, or welfare of the people in general.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245 (citation omitted). The court held that the officer could not rely on the general obstruction of justice criminal statute as a basis for his wrongful discharge claim, however, because the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">defines the elements of, and sets forth the criminal penalties for, the crime of obstruction of justice, and, accordingly, reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent to prohibit interference with the administration of justice. <em>That section does not explicitly state any public policy, but, like all criminal statutes, it has as an underlying policy the protection of the public\u2019s safety and </em>welfare.... <em>However, [the officer\u2019s] reliance on the statute is not in accord with that policy. Instead, [the officer] is attempting to use [the general obstruction of justice statute] as a shield to protect himself, not the public, from the consequences of his decision to charge [his supervisor] with obstruction of justice despite his supervisor\u2019s order to take no further action in an official capacity with regard to any aspect of the incident involving [the tenant and his sister]. </em>To utilize this criminal statute as [the officer] suggests would allow wrongful discharge lawsuits to be pursued by virtually any police officer who believes that personnel decisions obstructed the officer\u2019s enforcement of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 246 (emphasis added). The court applied the same analysis to the statute prohibiting delay in executing lawful process criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 246 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">From our examination of the Maryland decisional law and other pertinent authorities, such as the opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Harris, </em>we conclude that no clear mandate of public policy was implicated in Sears\u2019s termination of Whole/s employment, as a matter of law. In those Maryland cases recognizing a mandate of public policy well-estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>lished enough to form the predicate for an action for wrongful discharge, there was a preexisting, unambiguous, and particularized pronouncement, by constitution, enactment, or prior judicial decision, directing, prohibiting, or protecting the conduct (or contemplated conduct) in question, so as to make the Maryland public policy on the topic not a matter of judicial conjecture or even interpretation. For example, in <em>Moniodis v. Cook, </em>64 Md.App. 1, 494 A.2d 212, in which we held that the defendant employer was subject to a wrongful discharge action for constructively terminating employees who refused to submit to a lie detector test, it was not necessary for us to speculate, on the vague basis of whether it would be beneficial to society as a whole, about whether the public policy of Maryland disfavored employers subjecting employees to polygraph examinations. The General Assembly had made plain, by enacting a statute prohibiting that very conduct, where the state stands on that issue. <em>See id. </em>at 6-7, 494 A.2d 212 n. 1 (quoting Md.Code (1979) art. 100 \u00a7 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The conduct at issue in this case is one employee\u2019s act of investigating possible theft from his employer by a co-employee. Nothing in Maryland\u2019s general theft statute or any other enactment mandates that a citizen of Maryland who suspects that another person (co-employee or otherwise) may have committed a theft must report, let alone investigate, that suspicion. Indeed, there is no enactment that would require a citizen to report, let alone investigate, an admitted act of theft. To be sure, it might serve the public good for citizens to look into possible criminal acts of others, including co-employees, and report their suspicions to the authorities. We do not subscribe to the view, however, that conduct we might think would promote the good of society as a whole is, because we think so, favored public policy of this State. To find a clear mandate of public policy, we must look to already existing sources of policy expression. In the absence of any legislative or existing judicial pronouncement in this state directing private citizens to investigate possible acts of theft by coworkers or others, we find no origin for the public policy essential to Wholey\u2019s wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>It is worth noting that while Wholey relies on the language of the court in <em>Palmateer v. International Harvester </em>to support his public policy argument, that court did not hold that the public policy of Illinois favored citizens conducting their own investigations of possible criminal conduct of co-workers. The court focused its attention on the employee\u2019s act of reporting his co-employee\u2019s criminal act to the police. In Maryland, we have found a clear mandate of public policy in favor of reporting possible criminal conduct of others to the authorities when, by statute, a person is required to make such a report. <em>See Bleich, </em>98 Md.App. at 135-46, 632 A.2d 463. There was no such statutory directive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Moreover, even if we were to assume, hypothetically, that there is a clear mandate of public policy in Maryland favoring private citizen\u2019s reporting, and even investigating, criminal conduct of co-employees, we still would not find that policy implicated here, for much the same reason that the court in <em>Harris </em>rejected the officer\u2019s claim that he was advancing public policy by pursuing charges against his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">As we have pointed out, it was Wholey\u2019s job to investigate possible theft by Sears employees against Sears. He was hired and paid to serve that function, and to do so at the direction of supervisors who were the ultimate decision-makers about whether, when, how, and to what extent to investigate and pursue employees suspected of having committed theft against the business. Like the officer in <em>Harris, </em>Who-ley\u2019s invocation of public policy would serve not to benefit the public good, but to convert his at-will employment to one in which he no longer would be subject to direction from superiors and instead would have <em>de facto </em>lifetime tenure. So long as Wholey\u2019s job consisted of investigating possible criminal activity by co-employees, he would be immune from being discharged, because terminating his employment necessarily would interfere with the supposed public policy favoring citizen investigation of crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Maryland\u2019s public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine did not limit Sears\u2019s discretion to terminate Wholey\u2019s employment, under the facts most favorable to Who-ley. Because the necessary legal predicate for Wholey\u2019s wrongful discharge claim was absent, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
