This Court\u2019s review should be de novo. <em>(Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Cunningham v Williams, </em>28 AD3d <em>1211; LaForge v Normandin, </em>158 AD2d 990; <em>Schwartz v Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>539 F3d 135.) II. Because of prejudice to plaintiffs resulting from defendants\u2019 delay in raising the issue of the Ontario cap, the lower courts should have applied New York law without even engaging in a choice-of-law analysis\u2014CPLR 4511 (b) does not render meaningless CPLR 3016 (e), despite the holding of the Third Department in <em>Burns v Young </em>(239 AD2d 727 [1997]). <em>(Cole v Mandell Food Stores, </em>93 NY2d 34; <em>People v Lawrence, </em>64 NY2d 200; <em>Shepardson v Town of Schodack, </em>83 NY2d 894; <em>Bryndle v Safety-Kleen Sys., Inc., </em>66 AD3d 1396; <em>McCaskey, Davies &amp; </em>Assoc. v <em>New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

III. <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1995]) is distinguishable\u2014rather than utilizing a <em>Schultz </em>framework with separate defendant-by-defendant analyses under <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121 [1972]), a single, joint <em>Neumeier </em>analysis is appropriate under the facts of this case. <em>(Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Padula v Lilarn Props. Corp., </em>84 NY2d 519; <em>Feldman v Acapulco Princess Hotel, </em>137 Misc 2d 878; <em>King v Car Rentals, Inc., </em>29 AD3d 205; <em>Zatuchny v \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, </em>34 AD3d 398; <em>Cunningham v Williams, </em>28 AD3d 1211.) IV. The exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule is not triggered by virtue of the fact that no party was advocating for the application of Pennsylvania law \u2014 the <em>Schultz </em>Court\u2019s rationale for resorting to the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule is not applicable here \u2014 instead, the Fourth Department\u2019s analyses in <em>Bodea v TransNat Express </em>(286 AD2d 5 [2001]) and <em>Burnett v Columbus McKinnon Corp. </em>(69 AD3d 58 [2009]) in declining to resort to the exception are applicable. <em>(Aviles v Port Auth. of N.Y.&amp; N.J., </em>202 AD2d 45; <em>Hoogenboom v Gilmore, </em>278 AD2d 895; <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121.) V. New York has a significant interest in applying its law to this dispute wherein plaintiffs, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>come to New York as tourists, were severely injured or killed in an accident between two commercial vehicles being operated on New York roadways for profit \u2014 because of New York\u2019s significant interest, the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule is not triggered. <em>(Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121; <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Reale v Herco, Inc., </em>183 AD2d 163; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Hoogenboom v Gilmore, </em>278 AD2d 895.) VI. Allowing the normal, predictable ramifications of joint and several liability to take effect does not create uncertainty such that the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule is triggered, particularly where defendants specifically acknowledged that joint and several liability applied and that each set of defendants was 100% liable to plaintiffs. <em>(Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121; <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189.) VII. New York public policy should be implicated to require the application of New York law where defendants are business entities operating commercial vehicles for profit on New York roadways where plaintiffs were tourists in New York and where, if the foreign case law imposing a cap is applied, innocent bus passenger plaintiffs\u2019 damages will be subject to the cap, while recoveries of other plaintiffs related to the culpable driver of the tractor-trailer will not be similarly limited. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Brink\u2019s Ltd. v South African Airways, </em>93 F3d 1022; <em>Bader by Bader v Purdom, </em>841 F2d 38; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Loucks v Standard Oil Co. of N.Y., </em>224 NY 99; <em>Hamilton v Accu-Tek, </em>47 F Supp 2d 330; <em>Welsbach Elec.

II. The application of Ontario\u2019s loss-allocation rules does not violate New York\u2019s public policy. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Loucks v Standard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Oil Co. of N.Y., </em>224 NY 99; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Mertz v Mertz, </em>271 NY 466; <em>Phelan v Budget Rent A Car Sys., </em>267 AD2d 654.) III. Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions concerning the timing of defendants\u2019 motions are without merit. <em>(Burnett v Columbus McKinnon Corp., </em>69 AD3d 58; <em>King v Car Rentals, Inc., </em>29 AD3d 205; <em>Dorsey v Yantambwe, </em>276 AD2d 108; <em>Florio v Fisher Dev., </em>309 AD2d 694; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Mensah v Moxley, </em>235 AD2d 910; <em>Shepardson v Town of Schodack, </em>83 NY2d 894; <em>Burns v Young, </em>239 AD2d 727; <em>Friedman v Connecticut Gen.

Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate prejudice from defendants\u2019 reliance on Ontario\u2019s loss-allocation law. <em>(Burns v Young, </em>239 AD2d 727.) II. The Appellate Division\u2019s analysis of <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121 [1972]) and <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) was correct. <em>(Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Poplar v Bourjois, Inc., </em>298 NY 62; <em>Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Reach v Pearson, </em>860 F Supp 141; <em>Marillo v Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., </em>32 AD3d 1313; <em>Mensah v Moxley, </em>235 AD2d 910.) III. Applying New York law to the tractor-trailer defendants ignores the 90/10 liability agreement and creates uncertainty. IV. Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden with respect to the New York public policy argument. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Phelan v Budget Rent A Car Sys., </em>267 AD2d 654.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-6\"><em>Clark, Gagliardi &amp; Miller, P.C., </em>White Plains <em>(Lawrence T.

If the conflict of law issues are analyzed separately with respect to the bus and tractor-trailer defendants, New York law applies to the claims against the tractor-trailer defendants. <em>(Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Sullivan v McNicholas Transfer Co., </em>224 AD2d 966; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66.) III. If the claims against all defendants are considered in one conflicts analysis, New York law applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 pain and suffering claims. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>King v Car Rentals, Inc., </em>29 AD3d 205; <em>Gilbert v Seton Hall Univ., </em>332 F3d 105; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Cunningham v Williams, </em>28 AD3d 1211.) IV. New York\u2019s public policy is implicated in these cases. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Loucks v Standard Oil Co. of N.Y., </em>224 NY 99; <em>Kilberg v Northeast Airlines, </em>9 NY2d 34.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Hiscock &amp; Barclay, LLP, </em>Rochester <em>(Anthony J.

III. The bus defendants did not wave their right to rely upon Ontario law. <em>(Bingham v New York City Tr.

There was no need for defendants to affirmatively plead reliance on Ontario\u2019s loss-allocation law. <em>(Burns v Young, </em>239 AD2d 727.) II. A choice-of-law analysis under <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121 [1972]) and <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) correctly results in the application of the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule. <em>(Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473.) III. Ontario, not New York, has the significant interest in applying its own law to the instant case. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>AD2d 5; <em>Neumeier v Kuehner, </em>31 NY2d 121; <em>Dorsey v Yantambwe, </em>276 AD2d 108, 96 NY2d 712; <em>Mensah v Moxley, </em>235 AD2d 910; <em>Marillo v Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., </em>32 AD3d 1313.) IV. Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden with respect to the New York public policy argument. <em>(Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\"><em>Kelly &amp; Leonard, LLP, </em>Ballston Spa <em>(Mitchell A.

This Court should review the decisions of the trial court de novo. <em>(Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Cunningham v Williams, </em>28 AD3d 1211; <em>LaForge v Normandin, </em>158 AD2d 990; <em>Schwartz v Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>539 F3d 135.) II. <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) is distinguishable\u2014rather than utilizing a <em>Schultz </em>framework with separate defendant-by-defendant analyses under <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121 [1972]), a single, joint <em>Neumeier </em>analysis is appropriate under the facts of this case. <em>(Babcock v Jackson, </em>12 NY2d 473; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Padula v Lilarn Props.

The trial court erred in applying the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule because the situs of the accident, New York, was not merely fortuitous in this case, as it was in <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) and, thus, displacing the ordinarily applicable law of the situs would create greater uncertainty here. <em>(Neumeier v Kuehner, 31 </em>NY2d 121; <em>Phelan v Budget Rent A Car Sys., </em>267 AD2d 654; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Aboud v Budget Rent A Car Corp., </em>29 F Supp 2d 178; <em>Reale v Herco, Inc., </em>183 AD2d 163; <em>Huang v Lee, </em>734 F Supp 71; <em>Bodea v TransNat Express, </em>286 AD2d 5; <em>Aviles v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>202 AD2d 45.) IV. The trial court erred in applying the Ontario cap because its application is truly obnoxious to New York public policy under the facts of this case. <em>(Brink\u2019s Ltd. v South African Airways, </em>93 F3d 1022, 519 US 1116; <em>Bader by Bader v Purdom, </em>841 F2d 38; <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am., </em>65 NY2d 189; <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66; <em>Loucks v Standard Oil Co. of N.Y., </em>224 NY 99; <em>Hamilton v Accu-Tek, </em>47 F Supp 2d 330; <em>Ornstein v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate prejudice from defendants\u2019 reliance on Ontario\u2019s loss-allocation law. <em>(Burns v Young, </em>239 AD2d 727.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b390-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Near Geneseo, New York on January 19, 2005 a charter bus carrying members of an Ontario women\u2019s hockey team plowed into the rear end of a tractor-trailer parked on the shoulder of the highway. Three bus passengers and the tractor-trailer\u2019s driver died; several bus passengers were seriously hurt. We are called upon to decide the choice-of-law issue presented by these six lawsuits, which were brought to recover damages for wrongful death and/or personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Nearly a half-century ago, in <em>Babcock v Jackson </em>(12 NY2d 473 [1963]), we abandoned what had long been our choice-of-law rule whereby the law of the place of the tort invariably governed. Because \u201cin nearly all such cases, the conduct causing injury and the injury itself occurred in the same jurisdiction\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 477 n 2), this rule offered \u201cthe advantages of certainty, ease of application and predictability,\u201d but at the expense of \u201cthe interest which [other] jurisdictions . . . [might] have in the resolution of particular issues\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 478; <em>see also Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66, 72 [1993] [place-of-the-tort theory \u201cfailed to accord any significance to the policies underlying the conflicting laws of other jurisdictions\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">To \u201caccomodat[e] the competing interests in tort cases with multi-State contacts,\u201d we adopted the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d or \u201cgrouping of contacts\u201d approach, which gave the \u201ccontrolling effect to the law of the jurisdiction which, because of its relationship or contact with the occurrence or the parties, ha[d] the greatest concern with the specific issue raised in the litigation\u201d (12 NY2d at 481). This new method of analysis, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>limited to competing loss-allocation \u2014 not conduct-regulating\u2014 rules.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Babcock,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201c[w]here the defendant\u2019s exercise of due care in the operation of his automobile is in issue, the jurisdiction in which the allegedly wrongful conduct occurred will usually have a predominant, if not exclusive, concern. In such a case, it is appropriate to look to the law of the place of the tort so as to give effect to that jurisdiction\u2019s interest in regulating conduct within its borders, and it would be almost unthinkable to seek the applicable rule in the law of some other place\u201d (12 NY2d at 483).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The facts of <em>Babcock </em>illustrate how \u201cgrouping of contacts\u201d worked. In that case, a New York passenger in a car operated by a New York driver was injured in an automobile accident that occurred in Ontario during a weekend trip to Canada. We noted that the trip began and was to end in New York, where the car was garaged, licensed and insured, and where the driver-passenger relationship arose <em>(id. </em>at 482-483). The \u201cguest\u201d passenger sued the \u201chost\u201d driver in New York for negligence. At the time, the Ontario guest statute barred the passenger from recovering damages from the driver,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while New York law did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Looking to the \u201cgrouping of contacts,\u201d we decided that New York \u2014 not Ontario, the place of the tort \u2014 possessed \u201cthe dominant contacts and the superior claim for application of its law\u201d as to whether the passenger should \u201crecover[ ] for damages for a wrong concededly committed\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 483). We commented that, in this context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201c[although the rightness or wrongness of [the driver\u2019s] conduct may depend upon the law of the particular jurisdiction through which the automobile passes, the rights and liabilities of the parties which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>stem from their guest-host relationship should remain constant and not vary and shift as the automobile proceeds from place to place. Indeed, such a result . . . accords with the interests of the host in procuring liability insurance adequate under the applicable law, and the interests of his insurer in reasonable calculability of the premium\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 483-484 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Over time, the \u201cgrouping of contacts\u201d approach put into place by <em>Babcock </em>evolved into a more explicit \u201cinterest analysis.\u201d This method of deciding choice-of-law issues \u201creject[ed] a quantitative grouping of contacts\u201d because \u201c[c]ontacts obtain significance only to the extent that they relate to the policies and purposes sought to be vindicated by the conflicting laws\u201d <em>(Miller v Miller, </em>22 NY2d 12, 17 [1968]; <em>see also Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 72 [\u201cOf the various, sometimes competing, schools of thought on choice of law, the one that emerged as most satisfactory was \u2018interest analysis,\u2019 which sought to effect the law of the jurisdiction having the greatest interest in resolving the particular issue\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We refined our \u201cinterest analysis\u201d so as \u201cto assure a greater degree of predictability and uniformity\u201d in <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121, 127 [1972]), a case where a domiciliary of Ontario was killed when the automobile in which he was a passenger collided with a train in Ontario. The vehicle was owned and driven by a resident of New York, who was also killed in the accident. The passenger\u2019s wife and administratrix, a citizen of Canada and a domiciliary of Ontario, brought an action for wrongful death in New York against the driver\u2019s estate and the railway company, both of which interposed affirmative defenses involving the Ontario guest statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The wife, asserting that the Ontario statute was unavailable, moved to dismiss the affirmative defenses, and Supreme Court denied the motion (63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Misc 2d 766 [1970]). The Appellate Division reversed (37 AD2d 70 [1971]), and asked us if its order was properly made. We answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Neumeier </em>set up a three-rule framework for resolving choice of law in conflicts settings involving guest statutes, which by definition allocate losses after the tort occurs rather than regulate primary conduct. Under the first <em>Neumeier </em>rule, when the driver and passenger are domiciled in the same state, and the vehicle is registered there, the law of their shared jurisdiction controls (31 NY2d at 128). The second rule addresses the situation where the driver and the passenger are domiciled in different states, and the law of the place where the accident occurred favors its domiciliary. When the driver\u2019s conduct occurs in the state where he is domiciled, which would not impose liability, that state\u2019s law applies. Conversely, if the law of the place where the accident occurred permits the injured passenger to recover, then the driver, \u201cin the absence of special circumstances,\u201d may not interpose a conflicting law of his state as a defense (id.; <em>see also Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 73 [\u201cIn essence, . . . the second <em>Neumeier </em>rule adopts a \u2018place of injury\u2019 test for true conflict guest statute cases\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u201cIn other situations, when the passenger and the driver are domiciled in different states, the rule is necessarily less categorical\u201d (31 NY2d at 128). Thus, under the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule, the law of the state where the accident occurred governs unless \u201cit can be shown that displacing that normally applicable rule will advance the relevant substantive law purposes without impairing the smooth working of the multi-state system or producing great uncertainty for litigants\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Since the passenger in <em>Neumeier </em>was domiciled in Ontario, where the guest statute did not allow recovery, and the driver in New York, the third rule \u2014 the law of the place of the tort (i.e., Ontario) \u2014 would normally control. We saw no reason to apply the third rule\u2019s proviso since the wife \u201cfailed to show that [New York\u2019s] connection with the controversy was sufficient to justify displacing\u201d lex loci delicti, the law of the place of the wrong <em>(id. </em>at 129). The wife did not show that ignoring Ontario\u2019s guest statute in a case \u201cinvolv[ing] an Ontario-domiciled guest at the expense of a New Yorker . . . further [ed] the substantive law purposes of New York\u201d; and \u201cfailure to apply Ontario\u2019s law would impair . . . the smooth working of the multi-state system [and] produce great uncertainty for litigants by sanctioning forum shopping and thereby allowing a party to select a forum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>[countenancing] a larger recovery than [that party\u2019s] own domicile\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We have routinely applied the <em>Neumeier </em>framework to conflicts in loss-allocation situations not involving guest statutes. For example, the issue in <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) was whether the doctrine of charitable immunity would apply in a lawsuit brought by plaintiffs domiciled in New Jersey. The plaintiffs were the parents of two boys, one of whom committed suicide. They sued the Boy Scouts of America and the Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis, Inc. for negligent hiring and supervision of a sexually abusive brother (also a defendant), who was supplied by the Franciscan Brothers, pursuant to an agreement with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, as a teacher at a school owned and operated by the Archdiocese, and who was a scoutmaster of a Boy Scout troop sponsored by the school and chartered by the Boy Scouts. The plaintiffs\u2019 sons attended the class taught by the brother at the school, and were members of his scout troop.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Acts of sexual abuse were alleged to have taken place mostly during Boy Scout camping outings in New York, but also at the school in New Jersey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Boy Scouts were domiciled in New Jersey; the Franciscan Brothers in Ohio. At the time the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action arose, New Jersey and Ohio both recognized charitable immunity while New York did not. The Ohio rule, however, denied immunity in actions based on negligent hiring and supervision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And the plaintiffs\u2019 claims had already been determined to have been barred by the New Jersey doctrine of charitable immunity in an earlier action brought by the plaintiffs in New Jersey against the Archdiocese. We held that New Jersey law governed, and that the plaintiffs were precluded from relitigating its effect in light of the final determination in their action against the Archdiocese.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Under the first <em>Neumeier </em>rule, New Jersey law clearly controlled the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the Boy Scouts because the plaintiffs and this defendant had \u201cchosen to identify themselves in the most concrete form possible, domicile, with a jurisdiction that [had] weighed the interests of charitable tort-feasors and their victims and decided to retain the defense of charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>immunity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 199-200). But because this was \u201cthe first case for our review [where] New York [was] the forum-locus rather than the parties\u2019 common domicile,\u201d we examined \u201cthe reasons most often advanced for applying the law of the forum-locus and those supporting application of the law of the common domicile\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 200).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We identified those reasons \u201cmost often urged\u201d to favor the forum-locus as \u201c(1) to protect medical creditors who provided services to injured parties in the locus State, (2) to prevent injured tort victims from becoming public wards in the locus State and (3) the deterrent effect application of locus law [would have] on future tort-feasors in the locus State\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 200). We opined that the first two reasons shared \u201ccommon weaknesses,\u201d since neither \u201cnecessarily require[d] application of the locus jurisdiction\u2019s law, but rather invariably mandate[d] application of the law of the jurisdiction that would either allow recovery or allow . . . greater recovery\u201d <em>(id.). </em>As a result, they were \u201csubject to criticism ... as being biased in favor of recovery\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Further, we observed, neither consideration was relevant in <em>Schultz </em>since there was no evidence of unpaid medical creditors or that the plaintiffs were about to become wards of the state. As for the third reason, we acknowledged that although it was \u201cconceivable that application of New York\u2019s law in this case would have some deterrent effect on future tortious conduct\u201d in New York, our \u201cdeterrent interest [was] considerably less because none of the parties [was] a resident and the rule in conflict [was] loss-allocating rather than conduct-regulating\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On the other side of the ledger, we toted up \u201cpersuasive reasons for consistently applying the law of the parties\u2019 common domicile.\u201d These included (1) reduced opportunities for forum shopping; (2) rebuttal of \u201ccharges that the forum-locus is biased in favor of its own laws and in favor of rules permitting recovery\u201d; (3) \u201cthe concepts of mutuality and reciprocity support consistent application of the common-domicile rule\u201d since \u201c[i]n any given case, one person could be either plaintiff or defendant and one State could be either the parties\u2019 common domicile or the locus, and yet the applicable law would not change depending on their status\u201d; and (4) such a rule was \u201ceasy to apply and [brought] a modicum of predictability and certainty to an area of the law needing both\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We then turned our attention to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the Franciscan Brothers. We evaluated choice of law with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>respect to this defendant under the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule \u201cbecause the parties [were] domiciled in different jurisdictions with conflicting loss-distribution rules and the locus of the tort [was] New York, a separate jurisdiction\u201d; and the law of the place of the tort would \u201cnormally apply\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We decided, however, that this situation fit the proviso to the third rule \u201c[f]or the same reasons stated in our analysis of the action against\u201d the Boy Scouts; namely, this result \u201cwould further [New Jersey\u2019s] interest in enforcing the decision of its domiciliaries to accept the burdens as well as the benefits of that State\u2019s loss-distribution tort rules and its interest in promoting the continuation and expansion of [the Franciscan Brothers\u2019] charitable activities in that State\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201calthough application of New Jersey\u2019s law may not affirmatively advance the substantive law purposes of New York, it will not frustrate those interests because New York has no significant interest in applying its own law to this dispute. Finally, application of New Jersey law will enhance the smooth working of the multi-state system by actually reducing the incentive for forum shopping and it will provide certainty for the litigants whose only reasonable expectation surely would have been that the law of the jurisdiction where plaintiffs are domiciled and defendant sends its teachers would apply, not the law of New York where the parties had only isolated and infrequent contacts as a result of [the brother\u2019s] position as Boy Scout leader\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 201-202).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Finally, we rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that New York public policy foreclosed application of the New Jersey charitable immunity statute. We emphasized the difficulty of upsetting the choice of law in a conflicts situation on this basis; specifically, the proponent of a public policy bar would have to \u201cestablish that to enforce the foreign law \u2018would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal\u2019 expressed in them\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 202). Further, \u201cthe proponent must establish that there [were] enough important contacts between the parties, the occurrence and the New York forum to implicate our public policy and thus preclude enforcement of the foreign law\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We concluded that we did not need to decide whether enforcement of New Jersey\u2019s charitable immunity statute offended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>New York public policy \u201cbecause there [were] not sufficient contacts between New York, the parties and the transactions involved to implicate our public policy and call for its enforcement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 203).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The charter bus\u2019s driver (Ryan A. Comfort), his employer (Erie Coach Lines Company), and the company that leased the bus (Trentway-Wagar, Inc.) are Ontario domiciliaries, as are (or were) all the injured and deceased passengers. The tractor-trailer driver (Ernest Zeiset) was a Pennsylvania domiciliary, as are his employer (Joseph French, doing business as J&amp;J Trucking) and the companies that hired the trailer (Verdelli Farms, Inc. and VF. Transportation, Inc.). The injured passengers and the representatives of those who died (collectively, plaintiffs) filed multiple wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits in Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">These split-domicile lawsuits presented an obvious choice-of-law issue because Ontario caps noneconomic damages where negligence causes catastrophic personal injury,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while New York does not cap such damages in a no-fault case involving serious injury. Following extensive discovery, Erie Coach, Trentway<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Comfort (collectively, the bus defendants) and J&amp;J Trucking, the administratrix of Zeiset\u2019s estate, Verdelli Farms and VF. Transportation (collectively, the trailer defendants) moved for orders from Supreme Court determining that, under New York\u2019s choice-of-law principles, Ontario law applied to \u201call loss allocation issues\u201d in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">On March 23, 2009, Supreme Court granted both motions, noting that the Supreme Court of Canada had capped noneconomic damages at CDN $100,000 in 1978 dollars, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>then equivalent to US $310,000. In reaching its decisions, the court concluded that \u201c[p]roper analysis\u201d began with <em>Neumeier. </em>Citing the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule, the judge stated, without elaboration, that \u201c[a]pplying Ontario loss allocation laws [would] not impair the smooth working of the multi-state system, and [would] advance the relevant substantive law purposes of the jurisdiction having the most significant connections to the allocation of loss\u201d; and that Ontario \u201cclearly [had] the predominant interest[ ] in applying its loss allocation laws to its citizens, whereas New York [had] no such interest.\u201d Further, Supreme Court discussed <em>Schultz, </em>which it regarded as analogous; it saw no reason to consider Pennsylvania law since none of the parties requested this.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The trial of these cases was bifurcated, and, during the course of the jury trial on liability, the parties reached a settlement of that issue. In the stipulation of settlement, placed on the record on June 17, 2009, the bus defendants agreed to 90% and the trailer defendants to 10% liability. Meanwhile, plaintiffs had appealed Supreme Court\u2019s orders determining that Ontario law would govern any award of noneconomic damages to be made at a damages trial. The Appellate Division affirmed (72 AD3d 1581, 1586, 1587, 1588, 1589 [4th Dept 2010]; 74 AD3d 1813, 1814 [4th Dept 2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter,\u201d the Appellate Division decided that Supreme Court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion by taking judicial notice of Ontario law . . . despite the failure of defendants to raise [its] applicability ... as an affirmative defense and to provide the substance of the law in their pleadings in accordance with CPLR 3016 (e)\u201d (72 AD3d at 1583). The court subscribed to the Third Department\u2019s view, expressed in <em>Burns v Young </em>(239 AD2d 727, 728 [3d Dept 1997]), that \u201cbecause CPLR 4511 (b) permits . . . judicial notice of the laws of foreign countries that are presented \u2018prior to the presentation of any evidence at the trial,\u2019 \u201d a court has discretion to apply the law of a foreign country notwithstanding \u201ca party\u2019s failure to comply with the requirement in [CPLR] 3016 (e) that the substance of such laws shall be set forth in the pleading\u201d (72 AD3d at 1583). Further, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Ontario cap was procedural rather than substantive, citing <em>Davenport v Webb </em>(11 NY2d 392, 393 [1962]) for the \u201cwell established\u201d proposition that \u201cthe measure of damages is substantive\u201d (72 AD3d at 1583).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Appellate Division agreed with Supreme Court\u2019s bottom-line conclusion that the Ontario cap applied to damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>recovered from the bus and trailer defendants, but conducted separate choice-of-law analyses. With respect to the bus defendants, the court looked to the first <em>Neumeier </em>rule, which directs that the law of the parties\u2019 common domicile \u2014 here, Ontario\u2014 governs. The court observed that applying the law of a shared domicile reduced the risk of forum shopping; rebutted the charge of local bias; and served \u201c \u2018the concepts of mutuality and reciprocity,\u2019 \u201d which are \u201c \u2018supported by the] consistent application of the common-domicile law\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1584, quoting <em>Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As between plaintiffs and the trailer defendants, the Appellate Division applied the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule, which prefers the law of the place of the tort. Invoking the proviso to the third rule, the court decided, however, that Ontario law should govern, reasoning that \u201cwhile applying Ontario law \u2018[might] not affirmatively advance the substantive law purposes of New York, it [would] not frustrate those interests because New York has no significant interest in applying its own law to this dispute\u2019 \u201d (72 AD3d at 1585, quoting <em>Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 201). The court also commented that New York law created great uncertainty for the litigants because the trailer defendants were only 10% liable for the accident pursuant to the parties\u2019 settlement. If the trailer defendants\u2019 exposure to noneconomic damages was unlimited while the bus defendants\u2019 liability for this item of damages was capped, the trailer defendants might end up paying far more than their stipulated share.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Finally, the Appellate Division concluded that plaintiffs failed to meet the \u201c \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of establishing that the application of Ontario law violate[d] the public policy of New York\u201d (72 AD3d at 1585, quoting <em>Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 202). The court pointed out that \u201c \u2018resort to the public policy exception should be reserved for those foreign laws that are truly obnoxious\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 79), which was not the case here. In any event, the Appellate Division decided that the parties\u2019 contacts were too few and limited in scope to implicate New York\u2019s public policy (72 AD3d at 1585, citing <em>Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 201-202).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The Appellate Division granted plaintiffs permission to appeal, and asked us whether its orders were properly made (2010 NY Slip Op 76969[U] [4th Dept 2010]). For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cNo\u201d with respect to the trailer defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On this appeal, plaintiffs again contend that the lower courts were foreclosed from engaging in choice-of-law analysis because defendants did not raise the Ontario cap in their answers. In our view, defendants\u2019 motions were properly entertained. As the Appellate Division mentioned, CPLR 4511 (b) vests Supreme Court with discretion to take judicial notice of foreign law prior to the presentation of evidence at trial. This provision states that the court <em>shall </em>take judicial notice of specified matters (which include the laws of foreign countries or their political subdivisions) if a party so requests; furnishes the court sufficient data to enable it to take judicial notice; and advises adverse parties of its intent to ask the court to take judicial notice. This third requirement \u2014 notice to adverse parties \u2014 must be \u201cgiven in the pleadings <em>or </em>prior to the presentation of any evidence at the trial, but a court may require or permit other notice\u201d (CPLR 4511 [b] [emphasis added]). Defendants complied with these three conditions when they made their pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Plaintiffs rely on CPLR 3016 (e), however, which provides that \u201c[w]here a cause of action or defense is based upon the law of a foreign country or its political subdivision, the substance of the foreign law relied upon <em>shall he </em>stated\u201d (emphasis added). But CPLR 3016 (e) must be read together with CPLR 4511 (b). As a result, while \u201c[o]bedience to [CPLR 3016 (e)\u2019s] pleading requirement . . . would seem ipso facto to satisfy the trio of requirements necessary to <em>compel </em>judicial notice\u201d under CPLR 4511 (b), \u201comission to plead the foreign law . . . need prove no more fatal, or serious, than any other omission under CPLR 3015 or 3016,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that the court can on its own volunteer to give the foreign law judicial notice under CPLR 4511 (b) should further divest CPLR 3016 (e) of any undue rigidity\u201d (see Connors, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C3016:8 [emphasis added]). Further, we do not detect the complained-of unfairness or prejudice. A split-domicile lawsuit, such as this one, always presents a choice-of-law dilemma where loss-allocation rules conflict. This issue may have lain dormant during discovery, but there was no reason for plaintiffs to assume that it had vanished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Next, plaintiffs press for what they call a \u201csingle, joint <em>Neumeier </em>analysis\u201d in cases, such as this one, with multiple tortfeasors. As a result, the Edwards plaintiffs argue, the trial judge \u201cproperly analyzed both sets of Defendants \u2014 those related to the bus and those related to the tractor trailer\u2014 together,\u201d although he reached the wrong conclusion. In our view, however, the correct way to conduct a choice-of-law analysis is to consider each plaintiff vis-a-vis each defendant, which is essentially the approach taken by the Appellate Division. More to the point, this is the path we ourselves have already traveled: in <em>Schultz, </em>the plaintiffs likewise demanded judgment, jointly and severally, against multiple defendants, and we applied the <em>Neumeier </em>rules separately in relation to the New Jersey-domiciled Boy Scouts and the Ohio-domiciled Franciscan Brothers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rules in the <em>Neumeier </em>framework, in fact, by their very nature call for a plaintiff-by-defendant inquiry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Here, the Ontario cap controls any award of noneconomic damages against the bus defendants because they share an Ontario domicile with plaintiffs. We described the relevant choice-of-law principle and its rationale in <em>Cooney:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cUnder the first <em>Neumeier </em>rule, when [the plaintiff and the defendant] share a common domicile, that law should control. Indeed, when both parties are from the same jurisdiction, there is often little reason to apply another jurisdiction\u2019s loss allocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>rules. The domiciliary jurisdiction, which has weighed the competing considerations underlying the loss allocation rule at issue, has the greater \u2018interest in enforcing the decisions of both parties to accept both the benefits and the burdens of identifying with that jurisdiction and to submit themselves to its authority\u2019 . . . Moreover, this rule reduces opportunities for forum shopping because the same law will apply whether the suit is brought in the locus jurisdiction or in the common domicile, the two most likely forums\u201d (81 NY2d at 73, quoting <em>Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 198).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We had earlier made the same point at least as forcefully in <em>Schultz, </em>where we stressed that \u201cthe locus jurisdiction has <em>at best a minimal interest </em>in determining the right of recovery or the extent of the remedy in an action by a foreign domiciliary for injuries resulting from the conduct of a codomiciliary that was tortious under the laws of both jurisdictions\u201d (65 NY2d at 198 [emphasis added]). We cited substantial <em>precedent </em>\u2014 Tooker <em>v Lopez </em>(24 NY2d 569, 576 [1969]), <em>Miller </em>(22 NY2d at 18-19) and <em>Babcock </em>(12 NY2d at 482) \u2014 to support this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In sum, Ontario has weighed the interests of tortfeasors and their victims in cases of catastrophic personal injury, and has elected to safeguard its domiciliaries from large awards for nonpecuniary damages. In lawsuits brought in New York by Ontario-domiciled plaintiffs against Ontario-domiciled defendants, New York courts should respect Ontario\u2019s decision, which differs from but certainly does not offend New York\u2019s public policy <em>(see Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 202 [emphasizing the \u201cheavy burden\u201d borne by a party seeking to show that a foreign law contravenes New York public policy]).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Finally, we look to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule to decide whether the Ontario cap controls with respect to the trailer defendants. Critically, the third rule establishes the place of the tort \u2014 here, New York \u2014 as the \u201cnormally applicable\u201d choice in a conflicts situation such as this one, where the domicile of plaintiffs, the domicile of the trailer defendants and the place of the tort are different. Initially, the fact that the trailer defendants declined to advocate for Pennsylvania law does not permit them to take advantage of the Ontario cap. To rule otherwise would only encourage a kind of forum shopping. Moreover, the stipulation of settlement on liability is not relevant to \u201cinterest analysis,\u201d which seeks to recognize and respect the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>interests of a jurisdiction in the resolution of the particular issue where a conflict of law exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The trailer defendants contend that <em>Schultz </em>controls, meaning that their situation is comparable to that of the Franciscan Brothers, and so the law of New York should not govern, even though the accident occurred there. We do not agree. While New York employs \u201cinterest analysis\u201d rather than \u201cgrouping of contacts,\u201d the number and intensity of contacts is relevant when considering whether to deviate from lex loci delicti under the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule \u2014 i.e., whether even to analyze if displacing this \u201cnormally applicable\u201d choice would \u201cadvance the relevant substantive law purposes without impairing the smooth working of the multi-state system or producing great uncertainty for litigants\u201d (Neumeier, 31 NY2d at 128).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In <em>Schultz, </em>New Jersey was the state where the Franciscan Brothers supplied teachers for a New Jersey school, where some of the acts of sexual abuse allegedly took place, where one of the boys committed suicide, where the two boys allegedly suffered from and were treated for psychological injuries, where the Franciscan Brothers were said to have hired and failed to fire the brother. Under these circumstances, there was every reason to evaluate, under the proviso to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule, whether New Jersey law should displace New York law with respect to the negligent hiring and supervision claim asserted against the Franciscan Brothers in the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. Here, by contrast, there was no cause to contemplate a jurisdiction other than New York, the place where the conduct causing injuries and the injuries themselves occurred. The trailer defendants did not ask Supreme Court to consider the law of their domicile, Pennsylvania, and they had no contacts whatsoever with Ontario other than the happenstance that plaintiffs and the bus defendants were domiciled there.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Accordingly, the orders in these cases should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion and as so modified, affirmed, and the certified questions answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\">.

The dissent seeks to distinguish <em>Schultz </em>from this case on the ground that the torts alleged in the former \u201cwere distinct acts occurring at different times\u201d while here \u201cthe causes of action arise from a single incident\u201d (dissenting op at 333). But regardless of the factual dissimilarities between the two cases, the defendants in <em>Schultz </em>were \u2014 just like defendants in this case\u2014 subject to joint and several liability for their separate allegedly tortious acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. The dissent opines that \u201c[alpplying a single <em>Neumeier </em>analysis to jointly and severally liable defendants and having them subject to the same laws would further the goals of predictability and uniformity\u201d (dissenting op at 333). Making multiple defendants ultimately subject to the same loss-allocation rules might make management of a case simpler for the courts and the parties. A \u201csingle . . . analysis,\u201d however, would not guarantee \u201cpredictability and uniformity.\u201d For one thing, under this approach the choice of law for loss allocation in a multi-state, multi-tortfeasor case would depend on which potential defendants a plaintiff chose to sue. The fact is, when we departed from lex loci delicti in <em>Babcock, </em>we knowingly sacrificed a degree of certainty so as to honor our sister states\u2019 interests in enforcing their own loss-allocation rules with respect to their own domiciliaries <em>(see Babcock, </em>12 NY2d at 478; <em>Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 72).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b403-8\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At4\">(dissenting in part). Because I believe that a single analysis pursuant to <em>Neumeier v Kuehner </em>(31 NY2d 121 [1972]) should be applied where nondomiciliary defendants are jointly and severally liable to nondomiciliary plaintiffs in a tort action arising out of a single incident within the State of New York, and that under such an analysis New York law should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>apply to all defendants for purposes of uniformity and predictability, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Neumeier </em>sets forth a three-rule framework for determining what law should govern when there is a conflict between the laws of the domiciles of the parties or the state in which the tort occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first <em>Neumeier </em>rule provides that when the plaintiff and the defendant are domiciled in the same state, the law of that state shall govern <em>(see </em>31 NY2d at 128).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The second rule \u201caddresses true conflicts, where the parties are domiciled in different States and the local law favors the respective domiciliary\u201d <em>(Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 73 [internal quotation marks omitted]). This rule is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The third rule provides that when plaintiff and defendant are differently domiciled, the law of the location of the tort shall usually apply unless \u201cit can be shown that displacing the normally applicable rule will advance the substantive law purposes without impairing the smooth working of the multistate system or producing great uncertainty for litigants\u201d <em>(Neumeier, </em>31 NY2d at 128).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In this matter, all plaintiffs and the bus defendants are domiciliaries of Ontario whereas the tractor-trailer defendants are domiciled in Pennsylvania. The majority opines that each defendant should be analyzed separately under the <em>Neumeier </em>rules relying on <em>Schultz v Boy Scouts of Am. </em>(65 NY2d 189 [1985]) <em>(see </em>majority op at 329). In applying a separate <em>Neumeier </em>analysis to each defendant, the majority determines that Ontario law should apply to the bus defendants, while New York law should apply to the tractor-trailer defendants. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">While the facts in <em>Schultz </em>lent themselves to a separate analysis for each defendant, the facts in this case do not justify such an analysis. The plaintiffs in <em>Schultz </em>alleged that the two defendants, the Boy Scouts of America and the Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis, had each negligently hired and supervised the same sexually abusive employee. The alleged sexual abuse occurred while the plaintiffs\u2019 sons were at a Boy Scout camp in New York and continued at a school in New Jersey. The tortious activities in <em>Schultz </em>took place over varied periods of time and in different locations. Moreover, there was no relationship between the defendants\u2019 actions other than the fact that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>employed the same alleged bad actor. Because the torts were distinct acts occurring at different times, it was appropriate for us to perform a separate choice-of-law analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In contrast, in the instant case, the causes of action arise from a single incident in New York \u2014 the collision of the bus into the parked tractor-trailer \u2014 and the liability of the defendants is interrelated <em>(see King v Car Rentals, Inc., </em>29 AD3d 205, 213 [2d Dept 2006] [\u201c(b)ecause the liability of all of the defendants here is thus interrelated, the application of the laws of different jurisdictions to the several defendants may lead to unanticipated complications as potentially inconsistent law is applied\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Furthermore, a separate <em>Neumeier </em>analysis for differently domiciled defendants creates additional unpredictability and lack of uniformity in litigation that arises from a single incident. The purpose of the <em>Neumeier </em>rules is to \u201cassure a greater degree of predictability and uniformity, on the basis of our present knowledge and experience\u201d (31 NY2d at 127). Applying a single <em>Neumeier </em>analysis to jointly and severally liable defendants and having them subject to the same laws would further the goals of predictability and uniformity. In fact, this case illustrates the potential for grossly inequitable results when different laws are applied to defendants who are jointly and severally liable. Here, during a jury trial on liability, defendants entered into a stipulation whereby they agreed that they are 100% jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs and further agreed to apportion such liability between themselves at 90% to the bus defendants and the remaining 10% to the tractor-trailer defendants. The majority allows for a situation whereby the tractor-trailer defendants may end up paying more than the bus defendants because of the cap applied on noneconomic tort awards by Ontario \u2014 a patently absurd result. Therefore, to further the goal of predictability and uniformity, this matter should be analyzed under a single <em>Neumeier </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In analyzing this matter under a single <em>Neumeier </em>analysis, it is clear that, because plaintiffs and defendants are differently domiciled, the law of the site of the tort \u2014 here New York\u2014 should apply as set forth in the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule <em>(see </em>31 NY2d at 128).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule does not apply to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Indeed, applying New York law here will not \u201cimpair . . . the smooth working of the multi-state system and produce great uncertainty for litigants by sanctioning forum shopping\u201d (31 NY2d at 129 [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). New York was the site of the accident and the only state in which jurisdiction over all defendants could be acquired. New York is a proper location for this action and there is no indication that the cases were brought here on account of its favorable loss-allocation rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In addition, the exception to the third <em>Neumeier </em>rule should only apply when a state other than the forum-locus state has a \u201cgreate[r] interest in the litigation\u201d <em>(see Schultz, </em>65 NY2d at 197, quoting <em>Miller v Miller, </em>22 NY2d 12, 15 [1968]; <em>see also Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 72). Here, it is uncontroverted that both defendants are commercial enterprises that perform significant business in the State of New York and more significantly are frequent users of New York\u2019s highways in pursuit of their business. New York has a strong interest in the conduct of business enterprises on its highways and in properly compensating the victims of torts, whether New York or foreign domiciliaries, committed by business enterprises on its highways <em>(see Sullivan v McNicholas Transfer Co., </em>224 AD2d 966, 967 [4th Dept 1996] [applying Ohio law to an accident in Ohio because \u201cOhio has a substantial interest in regulating conduct on its highways and in ensuring that those who use its highway(s) will compensate those whom they have injured\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Thus, in determining which forum has the greatest interest in this litigation, it is clear that it is New York. Not only does New York have a strong interest in regulating the conduct of commercial vehicles on its highways, it also has an even stronger interest in having commercial vehicles that use its highways maintain insurance to compensate victims of torts committed by said vehicles. In contrast, Ontario\u2019s primary interest in having its law applied and capping nonpecuniary losses is to keep motor vehicle insurance costs low <em>(see Arnold v Teno, </em>[1978] 2 SCR 287 11 109). That interest, however, need not extend to commercial vehicles operating outside of Ontario and subject to the loss-allocation laws of those states.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Finally, because New York is \u201cthe only State with which [all] parties have purposefully associated themselves\u201d <em>(Cooney, </em>81 NY2d at 74) and availed themselves of New York highways for profit and tourism, applying New York law is entirely appropriate in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Read; Judge Cipabick dissents in part and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In each case: Orders modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\">. While the <em>Neumeier </em>rules specifically referred to guest statutes, the rules have been expanded to cover other loss-allocation conflicts (see <em>Cooney v Osgood Mach., </em>81 NY2d 66, 73 [1993]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. While the enumerated <em>Neumeier </em>rules describe situations with one plaintiff and one defendant, I see no reason why the rule should not be applied to situations, such as here, where there are multiple jointly and severally liable defendants (see Restatement [Second] of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 172).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
