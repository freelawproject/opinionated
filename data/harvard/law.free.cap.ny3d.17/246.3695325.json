We hold in this case that a prisoner who applied before being paroled is not barred from obtaining resentencing after her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Defendant was sentenced to <em>Ak </em>to 9 years in prison for a 2003 drug transaction. On November 25, 2009, she filed an application for resentencing under the 2009 DLRA. On December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>3, 2009, before the application had been ruled on, she was released on parole. Supreme Court later denied her application, and the Appellate Division affirmed, saying that because defendant \u201cis not in custody, she is not presently eligible for resentencing\u201d <em>(People v Santiago, 11 </em>AD3d 407 [1st Dept 2010]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">This case, like <em>Paulin, </em>is controlled by CPL 440.46 (1) (codifying, in part, the 2009 DLRA), which as originally enacted said, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cAny person in the custody of the department of correctional services convicted of a class B felony offense defined in article two hundred twenty of the penal law which was committed prior to January thirteenth, two thousand five, who is serving an indeterminate sentence with a maximum term of more than three years, may . . . apply to be resentenced \"<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">It is undisputed that defendant was entitled to \u201capply\u201d for resentencing when she filed her application, because at that time she was still in custody. The People argue, however, that the statute was not intended to benefit those who have already been released when their applications are decided. The argument is not an unreasonable one. As we point out in <em>Paulin, </em>the apparent reason why the Legislature limited the statute\u2019s benefit to incarcerated offenders is that they suffer the greatest hardship from severe sentences <em>(see 11 </em>NY3d at 244). It is also true, as the People point out, that another avenue of relief is open to parolees. Executive Law \u00a7 259-j authorizes the Division of Parole to grant termination of sentence under certain circumstances; subdivisions (3) and (3-a) of that section specifically permit, and in some cases require, the termination of sentences of paroled felony drug offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">On the other hand, the 2009 DLRA says only that an offender must be in custody when he or she applies for resentencing; it does not require that custody continue until the application is decided. And to read that requirement into the statute would have significant disadvantages: it could produce gamesmanship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and unnecessarily arbitrary results, by leading the parties, and perhaps some judges, to try to accelerate or slow progress toward a decision in the expectation that parole release will cause the application to fail. We conclude that it is best to read the statute as it is written. We hold that it applies to an offender who was in prison at the time she made her application, even though she was paroled before the application was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> Here, as in <em>Paulin, </em>we need not decide whether a 2011 amendment changing \u201cdepartment of correctional services\u201d to \u201cdepartment of corrections and community supervision\u201d altered the scope of the 2009 DLRA <em>(see </em>L 2011, ch 62, part C, subpart B, \u00a7 79).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
