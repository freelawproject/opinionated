The trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an adjournment so that Mr. Corey Becoats could secure the presence of a critical witness violated Mr. Becoats\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial, to present a defense, and to confrontation and constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>(Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270; <em>People v Singleton, </em>41 NY2d 402; <em>People v Spears, </em>64 NY2d 698; <em>People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473; <em>People v Matz, </em>23 NY2d 196; <em>People v Ballott, </em>20 NY2d 600; <em>People v Snyder, </em>297 NY 81; <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284; <em>Singleton v Lefkowitz, </em>583 F2d 618, <em>cert denied sub nom.

The People failed to prove that Mr. Corey Becoats committed the crime of robbery. <em>(People v Williams, </em>84 NY2d 925; <em>People v Hines, </em>97 NY2d 56; <em>People v Lynch, </em>95 NY2d 243; <em>People v Ficarrota, </em>91 NY2d 244; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490; <em>People v Cabey, </em>85 NY2d 417; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103; <em>Van Vechten v American Eagle Fire Ins.

It was reversible error to submit to the jury the robbery count charging Mr. Corey Becoats with robbing a gun and/or sneakers from the victim. <em>(People v Charles, </em>61 NY2d 321; <em>People v Wells, </em>7 NY3d 51; <em>People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410; <em>People v Bauman, </em>12 NY3d 152; <em>People v First Meridian Planning Corp., </em>86 NY2d 608; <em>Hamling v United States, </em>418 US 87; <em>People v Reed, </em>265 AD2d 56; <em>People v Wright, </em>63 AD3d 1700; <em>Griffin v United States, </em>502 US 46; <em>Yates v United States, </em>354 US 298.) IV. The trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings which erroneously permitted improper and prejudicial testimony and impermissibly prohibited the admission of relevant testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>singularly and cumulatively deprived Mr. Corey Becoats of his due process right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the United States and New York Constitutions. <em>(People v Johnson, </em>93 NY2d 254; <em>People v Geraci, </em>85 NY2d 359; <em>People v Rivera, </em>160 AD2d 267; <em>People v Leon, </em>121 AD2d 1; <em>People v Pitts, </em>218 AD2d 715; <em>People v Kornegay, </em>164 AD2d 868; <em>Matter of Holtzman v Hellenbrand, </em>92 AD2d 405; <em>People v Johns, </em>297 AD2d 645; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v James, </em>177 AD2d 595.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b719-5\"><em>Michael C.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for an adjournment to secure the attendance of a witness. <em>(People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473; <em>Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270; <em>People v Singleton, </em>41 NY2d 402; <em>Gilmore v United States, </em>129 F2d 199; <em>Stone v Morris, </em>546 F2d 730.) II. Defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery in the first degree is supported by legally sufficient evidence. <em>(People v Hawkins, </em>11 NY3d 484; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Hines, </em>97 NY2d 56; <em>People v James, </em>75 NY2d 874; <em>People v Cochran, </em>302 AD2d 276; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342; <em>People v Sala, </em>95 NY2d 254; <em>People v Dekle, </em>56 NY2d 835; <em>People v Rooney, </em>57 NY2d 822; <em>People v Charles, </em>61 NY2d 321.) III. The question of whether the charge of robbery in the first degree is duplicitous cannot be reviewed by this Court and is otherwise without merit. <em>(People v Hawkins, </em>11 NY3d 484; <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288; <em>People v Robinson, </em>36 NY2d 224; <em>People v Kelly, </em>5 NY3d 116; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Kadarko, </em>14 NY3d 426; <em>People v O'Rama, </em>78 NY2d 270; <em>People v Kisoon, </em>8 NY3d 129; <em>People v Starling, </em>85 NY2d 509; <em>People v Klipfel, </em>160 NY 371.) IV. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel under both the New York and Federal Constitutions. <em>(People v Schulz, </em>4 NY3d 521; <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; <em>People v Flores, </em>84 NY2d 184; <em>People v Kroemer, </em>204 AD2d 1017; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137; <em>People v Satterfield, </em>66 NY2d 796; <em>Rosario v Ercole, </em>601 F3d 118; <em>People v Turner, </em>5 NY3d 476; <em>People v Rivera, </em>71 NY2d 705; <em>People v Grayson, </em>266 AD2d 740.)

VI. Defendant is not entitled to relief based on his attempt to \u201cjoin\u201d in the claims raised in the brief of co-defendant Jason Wright. <em>(People v Teeter, </em>47 NY2d 1002; <em>People v Ford, </em>66 NY2d 428.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Jonathan I. Edelstein, </em>New York City, for appellant in the second above-entitled action.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKY\">I. The evidence against defendant was insufficient to support his conviction of robbery in the first degree. <em>(People v Schulz, </em>4 NY3d 521; <em>Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Ficarrota, </em>91 NY2d 244; <em>People v Garland, </em>125 AD2d 328; <em>People v Parker, </em>96 AD2d 1063; <em>People v Montgomery, </em>39 AD2d 889; <em>People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103; <em>People v Ford, </em>66 NY2d 428; <em>People v Cleague, </em>22 NY2d 363; <em>People v Moore, </em>291 AD2d 336.) II. The robbery charge was duplicitous. <em>(People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288; <em>People v Van Dyne, </em>12 AD3d 120; <em>People v Ray, </em>71 NY2d 849; <em>People v Agramonte, 87 </em>NY2d 765; <em>People v Brown, 7 </em>NY3d 880; <em>People v Martinez, </em>81 NY2d 810; <em>People v Cruz, </em>96 NY2d 857; <em>People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410; <em>People v Bauman, </em>12 NY3d 152; <em>People v Barnes, </em>64 AD3d 890.) III. A new trial is required because it is impossible to tell whether the robbery conviction was predicated upon a legal or illegal theory. <em>(Yates v United States, </em>354 US 298; <em>United States v Joseph, </em>542 F3d 13; <em>People v Martinez, </em>83 NY2d 26; <em>Griffin v United States, </em>502 US 46.) IV. Defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. <em>(Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137; <em>Kyles v Whitley, </em>514 US 419; <em>People v Lewis, </em>2 NY3d 224; <em>Lockhart v Fretwell, </em>506 US 364; <em>People v Caban, </em>5 NY3d 143; <em>People v Turner, </em>5 NY3d 476; <em>Murray v Carrier, </em>477 US 478; <em>Henry v Poole, </em>409 F3d 48; <em>Rosario v Ercole, </em>601 F3d 118.)

We reject most of their arguments, but conclude that Wright is entitled to a new trial because of an error in excluding evidence he tried to present in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The People sought to prove that defendants, acting with a third man, Sherrod Carter (who had not been apprehended at the time of the trial), beat Hayden Spears to death, and forcibly stole property from him. Two witnesses described an incident in which the three attackers first argued with Spears in the street, and then began to hit him with their fists, a stick or hammer, and a gun that Wright removed from the victim\u2019s pants. Spears fled down the street, bleeding and staggering, but the three caught up with him and resumed the beating, Becoats now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>using a broken bottle. The fracas moved into a nearby field, where the witnesses lost sight of it. Later, the attackers came back out of the field; Wright was carrying a pair of sneakers. Spears was found near death in the field. He died of blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The two witnesses who claimed to have seen the attack were Lorraine Small and Nicholas Carter, Sherrod Carter\u2019s brother. Both had significant criminal records. There was forensic evidence consistent with the witnesses\u2019 accounts of the event, but there was no evidence of the attackers\u2019 identity except the eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A jury convicted both defendants of second degree (depraved indifference) murder and first degree robbery. The Appellate Division modified by reducing the murder convictions to manslaughter in the second degree, and otherwise affirmed <em>(People v Wright, </em>63 AD3d 1700 [4th Dept 2009]; <em>People v Becoats, </em>71 AD3d 1578 [4th Dept 2010]). A Judge of this Court granted defendants leave to appeal (15 NY3d 811 [2010]; 15 NY3d 802 [2010]). We now affirm as to Becoats, but reverse and order a new trial as to Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The indictment included a single count of robbery in the first degree, asserting that defendants \u201cforcibly stole property, to wit, a gun and/or a pair of sneakers from Hayden Spears\u201d and caused serious physical injury to Spears. Becoats and Wright claim that this count was duplicitous \u2014 i.e., that the robbery of the gun and the robbery of the sneakers were separate crimes that should have been charged in separate counts. They did not make this argument in the trial court, however, and we hold that we may not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The general rule, of course, is that this Court does not consider claims of error not preserved by appropriate objection in the court of first instance (CPL 470.05, 470.35; <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 294-295 [1976] [citations omitted]). Defendants seek to bring this case within the narrow exception for so-called \u201cmode of proceedings\u201d errors, but the exception does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">We said in <em>Patterson: </em>\u201cA defendant in a criminal case cannot waive, or even consent to, error that would affect the organization of the court or the mode of proceedings prescribed by law\u201d (39 NY2d at 295). We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cthe purpose of this narrow, historical exception is to ensure that criminal trials are conducted in accordance with the mode of procedure mandated by Constitution and statute. Where the procedure adopted by the court below is at a basic variance with the mandate of law, the entire trial is irreparably tainted\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 295-296).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Not every procedural misstep in a criminal case is a mode of proceedings error. That term is reserved for the most fundamental flaws. Examples are the shifting of the burden of proof from prosecution to defense <em>(id. </em>at 296), and the delegation of the trial judge\u2019s function to his or her law secretary <em>(People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307, 312 [1985]). Mistakenly charging more than one crime in one count of an indictment is not a fundamental error in this sense. A defendant who wants the charges separated must seek that relief at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">To allow an unpreserved claim of duplicitousness to be raised on appeal would open the door to abuse. Defendants accused of multiple offenses may not much care how many counts they face, or may prefer to face one count (and thus one conviction) rather than several. Under the rule defendants here seek, it would be possible for them to make that choice at trial by letting a duplicitous indictment stand without objection, and make the opposite choice on appeal; they might thus obtain a new trial on the basis of an error they consciously decided not to challenge because they thought it insignificant, or welcomed it. To expand the definition of \u201cmode of proceedings\u201d error too freely would create many such anomalous results.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We therefore do not consider defendants\u2019 argument that the indictment here was duplicitous. We express no opinion about the argument\u2019s merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Defendants complain of the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an adjournment, on the eve of trial, to allow the defense to obtain the testimony of a witness in federal custody. We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The trial was scheduled to begin on September 12, 2005. On August 23, 20 days before trial, Becoats\u2019s counsel received a letter from the prosecutor dated August 19. The letter said that the prosecution had recently learned of, and interviewed, a witness named Michael Bishop, a federal prisoner. Bishop, according to the letter, had told prosecutors on August 17 \u201cthat he was present for a portion of the beating of Hayden Spears. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>stated that he observed Sherrod Carter, Nick Carter and Jason Wright take place [sic] in the beating. He also stated that he did not see Corey Becoats when he was present at the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Becoats\u2019s counsel was on trial in another case when the prosecutor\u2019s letter arrived. He responded on August 29 by asking where Bishop was located, and who his lawyer was. The prosecutor replied on August 31, identifying Bishop\u2019s lawyer and the federal prison in Ohio where Bishop was being held.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Becoats\u2019s lawyer, according to his submissions below, \u201cimmediately contacted\u201d Bishop\u2019s lawyer and then \u201cfollowed up\u201d by making contact with the United States Marshal\u2019s office. He was advised, he told the court, \u201cthat no guarantee could be made that the prisoner would be produced- in a state court proceeding\u201d and that in any event \u201cthe U.S. Marshal\u2019s office had to be given at least 30 days notice\u201d if there was to be a \u201cremote possibility\u201d that Bishop would be made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The exact date of the conversation between Becoats\u2019s lawyer and the Marshal\u2019s office is not in the record. The lawyer apparently did nothing as a result of the conversation until September 9 \u2014 the last business day before the trial \u2014 and even then he did not seek an order or begin any other proceeding to obtain Bishop\u2019s testimony, either at trial or by deposition. Instead, he filed papers with the trial court describing the sequence of events, asserting that the prosecution had \u201cdragged its feet in providing the information to the defense,\u201d and asking for \u201can adjournment in the proceeding so that [Bishop] can be secured at trial.\u201d The adjournment was not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the adjournment. It is true that the witness\u2019s testimony, as described by the prosecutor, seemed very significant, and it is also true that the People could have acted more speedily than they did. It is not clear why, having interviewed Bishop on August 17, the People waited two days and then sent a letter to defense counsel by regular mail. If defense counsel had acted with reasonable diligence after receiving that letter, and had nevertheless been unable to obtain Bishop\u2019s testimony in time for trial, it might well have been an abuse of discretion for the court to deny an adjournment <em>(see People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473 [1973]).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The trial court was justified in finding, however, that defense counsel did not act with reasonable diligence. Even assuming that the delay from August 23 to August 29 is excused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>counsel\u2019s involvement in another trial, there were almost two weeks between August 31 (when counsel got a response to his August 29 inquiry) and the trial date in which counsel could have sought, and perhaps obtained, an order requiring Bishop\u2019s testimony. Counsel chose not to do so, but instead to complain about the People\u2019s conduct and ask for an adjournment. It is unclear from the record whether counsel really wanted Bishop\u2019s testimony, or simply wanted delay, or was hoping to create an issue for appeal. It was for the trial court to assess whether, under all the circumstances, an adjournment in the hope of obtaining Bishop\u2019s testimony was justified, and we see no basis in the record to second-guess the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The dissent acknowledges doubt about whether counsel \u201cdid all that he possibly could to obtain Bishop\u2019s appearance\u201d (dissenting op at 658-659). Nevertheless, our dissenting colleagues would order a new trial for Becoats, apparently because the possibility that Becoats was deprived of critical, exculpatory testimony seems unacceptable. But that is no more than a possibility on this record. Bishop\u2019s account of the facts may have turned out to be much less helpful to Becoats than it seems from the prosecutor\u2019s letter; counsel may have had sound strategic reasons for doing no more than he did. On the other hand, if Becoats really has been prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s inaction, our holding today does not prevent him from demonstrating that on a motion brought under CPL article 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As we mentioned above, the indictment charged defendants with forcibly stealing from Spears a gun \u201cand/or\u201d a pair of sneakers. Defendants argue that the evidence is insufficient as to both items to support a conviction for robbery. They also argue that if the evidence was sufficient as to one item but not the other, a new trial is necessary. We reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">As to the gun, the Appellate Division agreed with defendants that the evidence was insufficient. The record shows only that defendants took Spears\u2019s gun to beat him with and then abandoned it at the scene. This, the Appellate Division held, was insufficient to prove that defendants intended permanently to deprive Spears of possession and use of the gun <em>(see People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103, 118-121 [1986]). We assume that this aspect of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The Appellate Division nevertheless affirmed defendants\u2019 robbery convictions, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>support a finding that they forcibly stole the sneakers. Defendants argue otherwise, saying that there is no proof the sneakers were taken from the victim, Spears. Defendants point out that no witness actually saw the sneakers removed from Spears\u2019s feet; the end of the encounter between Spears and his attackers took place in a field out of the witnesses\u2019 sight. No witness mentioned what kind of footwear Spears had on that day, and no one specifically said that he lacked shoes when he was found (though an investigator who observed his body at the hospital said there was <em>\u201ca </em>lot of dirt and sand on his feet\u201d). The sneakers that Wright brought out of the field, defendants say, could have come from anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We think the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict as to the sneakers. When three men beat a fourth man unconscious in a field, and emerge from the field as a group with one of them carrying a pair of sneakers, the inference that the sneakers came from the beating victim is a strong one. It is theoretically possible, of course, that Spears\u2019s attackers chanced upon an abandoned pair of sneakers in the field, but a jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that that is not what happened. Defendants now argue, in the alternative, that the evidence fails to show that they used force \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 taking Spears\u2019s sneakers <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 160.00), but that argument was not made below and is not preserved for our review <em>(see People v Hawkins, </em>11 NY3d 484, 492 [2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We also reject defendants\u2019 argument that a new trial is required because the robbery verdict might have been based on the taking of the gun. As the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Griffin v United States </em>(502 US 46, 56 [1991]), a general verdict need not be set aside merely \u201cbecause one of the possible bases of conviction was . . . unsupported by sufficient evidence.\u201d It is different when a flawed <em>legal </em>theory is given to the jury as an alternative basis for decision; if jurors are given the option of convicting on legally inadequate grounds, \u201cthere is no reason to think that their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that error\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 59). But where jurors are given a choice between a factually supported and factually unsupported theory, it is assumed that they have chosen the one with factual support, \u201csince jurors <em>are </em>well equipped to analyze the evidence\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We made clear in <em>People v Martinez </em>(83 NY2d 26, 36 [1993]) that we accept the distinction between legal and factual inadequacy made in the <em>Griffin </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We come finally to the issue that we conclude requires reversal of Wright\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">As we have mentioned, the only evidence linking defendants to the attack on Spears came from two witnesses who said they saw the attack, Lorraine Small and Nicholas Carter. In a deposition given to police about a week after the event, Small told them that she had overheard a conversation in which an attack on Spears was being planned. According to Small, Nicholas Carter took part in the conversation, and Wright was not present. The jury never learned of this conversation; Wright tried to put it in evidence, but the trial court would not let him do so. In this, we conclude, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">According to Small\u2019s deposition, she was on her front porch on the day before the crime when she heard a group talking in front of a neighboring house. She said that the group included five people, whom she named: Sherrod Carter, Nicholas Carter and Becoats were among them, but Wright was not. They were talking, according to Small, about \u201cwhat to do with\u201d Spears. Some said they should beat him. Sherrod Carter said \u201cno I ain\u2019t gonna beat him, I\u2019m gonna kill him,\u201d adding \u201cI\u2019m gonna murder that motherfucker.\u201d At that point, according to Small, \u201cNick told him to stop talking so loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Wright sought at trial to question Small about this conversation, which was helpful to him in two ways \u2014 showing both his absence from the planning session and the participation in it by one of the People\u2019s key witnesses. The trial court ruled that the statements Small overheard should be excluded on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">This ruling was mistaken. Wright argues, perhaps correctly, that Sherrod Carter\u2019s statement that he was going to kill Spears was within the \u201cstatement of present intention\u201d exception to the hearsay rule <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. v Hillmon, </em>145 US 285, 294-296 [1892]; <em>People v James, </em>93 NY2d 620, 627-636 [1999]). But Wright did not even need to rely on a hearsay exception, because he was not offering Sherrod\u2019s statement, or any other out-of-court declaration, for its truth; Wright had no interest in proving that Sherrod actually intended to kill Spears. Wright wanted only to prove that he was not part of this meeting, and that Nicholas Carter was. His proffer raised no hearsay problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The People do not defend the exclusion of the statement on hearsay grounds, but argue that the trial court had discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>exclude it because its relevance to Wright\u2019s defense was outweighed by its possible prejudice to Becoats. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The evidence could have been very valuable to Wright. In a case wholly dependent on the testimony of two eyewitnesses\u2014 both of whom had criminal records that might have made the jury doubt their word \u2014 proof that one of the two had actually participated in planning the crime might have been decisive. It could have supplied the basis for an argument that Nicholas Carter was one of the criminals, and was falsely accusing Wright to conceal his own involvement. Admittedly, Small\u2019s accusation of Wright would remain \u2014 but the jury might not have convicted Wright on her word alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">As for the prejudice to Becoats, there may have been none. As we have said, the testimony may well have been admissible against Becoats under <em>Hillmon </em>and <em>James. </em>But even if it was not, that does not provide a good enough reason for depriving Becoats\u2019s codefendant of important exculpatory evidence. Other means might have been found \u2014 perhaps by carefully limiting the scope of the questions and answers \u2014 to protect Wright without being unfair to Becoats.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Defendants\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Accordingly, in <em>People v Becoats, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. In <em>People v Wright, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b728-9\">Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"AMW\">(dissenting in <em>Becoats): </em>While I am in agreement with the majority\u2019s resolution of the other issues in the case, I do not agree that the denial of defendant Becoats\u2019 motion for an adjournment was under the circumstances within the permissible range of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Indeed, it appears at the very least highly incongruous to conclude as the majority has, on the one hand, that defendant Wright\u2019s convictions must be reversed upon the ground that erroneously excluded, potentially \u201cdecisive\u201d evidence, showed that one of the two prosecution witnesses, Nicholas Carter, \u201chad actually participated in planning the crime,\u201d (majority op at 656) and, on the other, that the trial court\u2019s decision denying defendant Becoats one adjournment to present a witness who would testify that he had actually seen Nicholas Carter, and not Becoats, take part in the crimes, was not also sufficient cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Both prosecution witnesses had extensive criminal records. Nicholas Carter, in fact, testified in exchange for a veiy generous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>plea offer allowing him to satisfy pending class A-II and B drug felony charges with a probationary sentence. At trial, he recounted that on the evening in question he had been running a bath when his niece informed him that there was a fight going on across the street. He claimed to have watched the fight as it progressed up Joseph Place, and to have seen defendants pull the victim, Spears, into an abutting field, where they were joined by Nicholas Carter\u2019s brother, Sherrod Carter. At this point, Nicholas went inside to take his bath. He testified that, when his bath was over, he observed Sherrod, Becoats and Wright coming out of the field. Wright, he said, was holding a pair of boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On August 23, 2005, 20 days before the trial was scheduled to begin, defendant Becoats\u2019 attorney received a letter from the Monroe County Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case. The Assistant opened his communication by indicating that he was writing, \u201cpursuant to [the prosecutor\u2019s] ongoing Brady obligation.\u201d The letter then advised that the District Attorney\u2019s office had learned on August 15, 2005 that a federal inmate named Michael Bishop had information about the Spears case. An interview had been conducted by .the District Attorney on August 17, 2005 during which Bishop stated that he had been present during part of the Spears beating and that although he observed Sherrod Carter, <em>Nick Carter </em>and Jason Wright beating Spears, he did not see Corey Becoats at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On August 29, 2005, Becoats\u2019 attorney made a letter inquiry of the Assistant District Attorney as to the place of Bishop\u2019s incarceration and the identity of his lawyer. The sought information was provided two days later. After speaking with Bishop\u2019s attorney, Becoats\u2019 counsel asked the United States Marshal\u2019s office about the feasibility of transporting Bishop from the federal correctional facility in Youngstown, Ohio where he was incarcerated to Becoats\u2019 upcoming Monroe County trial. The Marshal\u2019s office was noncommital, indicating that a state court \u201cbody order\u201d would be processed in due course and that minimally 30 days notice was required for production of a federal prisoner at a state proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">On September 9, 2005, Becoats\u2019 attorney requested an adjournment of the trial so that Bishop could be produced to testify. On September 12, 2005, before any ruling upon defendant\u2019s adjournment request had been made, the People disclosed for the first time that they intended to call Nicholas Carter as a witness. Inasmuch, however, as Nicholas Carter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>implicated in the Spears beating by Bishop, and Bishop\u2019s anticipated testimony would not merely be exculpatory as to Be-coats but would demonstrate that one of the two prosecution witnesses had a motive falsely to implicate others, counsel for Becoats, now joined by counsel for Wright, renewed his request for an adjournment to permit Bishop\u2019s production in court. The trial court nonetheless denied the adjournment, because it was of the view that counsel could have sought a judicial subpoena earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Although our inquiry in judging the propriety of the adjournment denial is limited to determining whether the denial constituted an abuse of discretion \u2014 a very tolerant standard that purposefully insulates most judicial decisions respecting the management of a trial from retrospective appellate scrutiny\u2014 the range of permissible judicial discretion is generally understood to contract significantly in situations where the adjournment is necessary to the exercise of a fundamental right <em>(see People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473, 476-477 [1973]; <em>People v Spears, </em>64 NY2d 698, 699-700 [1984]). Fully implicated by defendant Be-coats\u2019 adjournment request was his fundamental right to present witnesses in his defense <em>(see Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 302 [1973]) and his closely allied right to compulsory process to secure the attendance of such witnesses. Also implicated was his right to confront a key witness against him\u2014 Nicholas Carter. I do not believe that, given the basic protections that were at stake, all of which were essential to the fairness and probity of the impending trial, the court, under the circumstances, had discretion to deny Becoats\u2019 adjournment request.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">No one disputes that if Bishop had testified in accordance with the account of the crime he gave the Assistant District Attorney on August 17, 2005 he would have provided evidence to the effect that, although he had been present during part of the victim\u2019s beating he did not see Becoats and, moreover, that one of the two prosecution witnesses to the relevant events was himself a participant in the beating he claimed to have witnessed from afar. The obvious materiality of this evidence to Becoats\u2019 defense is impossible to overstate. Becoats\u2019 counsel did not learn about Bishop\u2019s version of the incident until relatively shortly before trial and did not know that Nicholas Carter would testify for the prosecution until, literally, the day of the trial\u2019s scheduled commencement. It is possible to quibble about whether he did all that he possibly could to obtain Bishop\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>appearance for the scheduled trial, but it is clear that a day here or there would not have made a difference and that an adjournment would, in any event, have been necessary to secure Bishop\u2019s production from the federal facility in Ohio where he was incarcerated. Undoubtedly, rescheduling the trial would have been inconvenient for the court, but it would not have been more than that \u2014 there was no contention a postponement would have precluded the presentation of any testimony or other evidence. Nor was there any reason to suppose that Bishop\u2019s attendance could not have been secured within a reasonable time. He was, after all, an identified witness in a federal prison, and there exist established procedures to obtain the attendance of federally incarcerated witnesses in state court proceedings <em>(see </em>CPL 650.30). While those procedures rely for effect upon the voluntary cooperation of federal authorities, there was no reason to suppose that such cooperation would not have been forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">This was not a situation in which the defendant sought \u201cendlessly [to] pursue an elusive witness\u201d <em>(Foy, </em>32 NY2d at 478), but one in which the defendant requested a single adjournment to secure the attendance at trial of an identified exculpatory witness whose existence and location had been ascertained by the prosecution in the performance of its <em>Brady </em>obligations. \u201c[M]ere inconvenience is not sufficient ground for denying an adjournment when to do so would abridge a basic right\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 477; <em>see also Singleton v Lefkowitz, </em>583 F2d 618, 623 [2d Cir 1978], <em>cert denied sub nom. Abrams v Singleton, </em>440 US 929 [1979]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Inasmuch as there was no more compelling ground identified for the denial at issue and that denial undoubtedly abridged basic rights, leaving substantial doubt as to the reliability of the verdict, defendant Becoats should, like his codefendant, be afforded a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge Smith; Chief Judge Lippman dissents in a separate opinion in which Judge Jones concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In <em>People v </em>Becoats: Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In <em>People v </em>Wright: Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> This was a federal habeas proceeding in which Singleton prevailed upon the claim, previously rejected by this Court <em>(People v Singleton, </em>41 NY2d 402 [1977]), that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying him a continuance to secure the attendance of a material witness in his defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
