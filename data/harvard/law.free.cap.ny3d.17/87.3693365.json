The body of the deceased victim was discovered in the building\u2019s basement, to which he evidently retreated after he was hit. Defendant Dean Pacquette was indicted for second-degree murder (intentional) (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]), second-degree assault (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [2]), and second-degree weapon possession (two counts) (Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 [1] [b]; [3]) in connection with the shooting. He moved to suppress inculpatory statements that he made to the police on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">At the ensuing <em>Huntley </em>hearing, Detective Alan Killigrew testified that he identified defendant as a suspect because of information he received shortly after the shooting from two eyewitnesses. Then on May 17, 2007, he learned that defendant had been arrested for a drug crime in Manhattan. Detective Richard Amato traveled to Manhattan to \u201cpick up\u201d defendant and bring him to the precinct in Brooklyn for a lineup. Amato found defendant in a holding cell in Manhattan, waiting to be arraigned, and arranged through the New York City Police Department for him to be released temporarily into his custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">A few hours after Amato arrived at the precinct in Brooklyn with defendant, the police conducted two separate lineups \u2014 one for each of the two eyewitnesses. Both eyewitnesses identified defendant. Before these lineups, at about 9:00 p.m., <em>Miranda </em>warnings were issued to defendant, who claimed that he knew nothing about the shooting; after the lineups, Killigrew advised defendant that he was \u201ccharged with homicide.\u201d Amato and Detective Erick Parks then escorted defendant back to Manhattan for arraignment for the drug crime. During the ride back, Amato \u201cprobably\u201d let defendant know that he had been identified in both lineups.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Upon arrival in Manhattan, Amato spoke to prosecutors to clear defendant\u2019s release on his own recognizance after arraignment so that he could be taken back to Brooklyn. Meanwhile, Parks accompanied defendant to the courtroom. When Amato later joined them, defendant sat between the two detectives in the front row, waiting for his case to be called. At some point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>before defendant\u2019s arraignment, attorney Daniel Scott was assigned to represent him on the drug charge. While Scott, Amato and Parks agree that they met and spoke in the Manhattan courtroom, their accounts of exactly what was said differ in certain respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">According to Amato, Scott introduced himself as \u201cthe attorney for the arraignment on this case,\u201d meaning \u201c[defendant\u2019s] drug case.\u201d Scott did not indicate that he represented defendant in any other case. Amato \u201ctook [Scott\u2019s] business card,\u201d which is how Amato later recalled Scott\u2019s name. When Scott asked Amato if he could speak to defendant \u201cin private,\u201d Amato moved two rows back and Parks slid down the row and away from defendant so as to accommodate this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">After defendant was arraigned and released on his own recognizance, Amato arrested him \u201cfor the homicide.\u201d The detectives then took defendant back to where he had been sitting in the courtroom because \u201cthe attorney . . . wanted to speak to him.\u201d Amato testified that he overheard Scott tell defendant that he was \u201cnot going across the bridge into Brooklyn to represent him,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201crepresent him in the other case. He represents him in the drug case. He\u2019ll have an attorney for his new case in Brooklyn. He also said, I advise you not to speak to the police because I can\u2019t tell you that you cannot speak to the police but I\u2019m advising you not to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Amato added that Scott did not at any time tell him that he was representing defendant on the homicide charge; Amato gave Scott his business card at Scott\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Parks testified that he, Amato and defendant were sitting in the front row of the courtroom waiting for defendant to be arraigned when someone he assumed to be a Legal Aid attorney (whose name Parks did not recall) \u201capproached\u201d defendant and \u201casked if he could have a moment with\u201d him. He and Amato then \u201cmoved [their] position\u201d so as to allow the attorney to interview defendant while they still kept an eye on him. Parks also testified that at some point after the arraignment Amato had a \u201cbrief\u2019 conversation with the attorney, and that Amato informed him that he had overheard the attorney tell defendant that \u201che represented] him on the Manhattan case,\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t go over the bridge,\u201d and was \u201cnot representing him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Brooklyn, that he\u2019ll represent him in the Manhattan case.\u201d According to Parks, the attorney never told him that defendant was represented by counsel, and never directed him not to question defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Scott testified that when he was assigned to represent defendant in the drug case, he was notified by the clerk of the night court that two Brooklyn detectives had brought defendant to the courtroom. The clerk asked him to expedite the arraignment \u201cbecause the detectives had brought [defendant] in.\u201d The clerk also alerted Scott to the \u201cagreement between the detectives and the district attorney\u2019s office [for defendant to] be released into the detectives\u2019 custody.\u201d Scott introduced himself to defendant, who was sitting between the two detectives, and gave him his business card. He \u201cmay or may not have given\u201d business cards to the detectives, but, in any event, \u201cit was apparent who [he] was and what [he] was doing there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Scott did not interview defendant, because \u201cthere was no privacy whatsoever.\u201d He simply read the felony complaint and asked defendant if he understood what he was being charged with; there was \u201cno reason to discuss . . . bail because his ROR had . . . previously been worked out.\u201d Scott, who was not on the 18-B panel in Kings County, testified that he \u201cclearly\u201d recalled warning the detectives that defendant \u201cwas represented by counsel and that they should not question him.\u201d Similarly, he advised defendant not to \u201cdiscuss any legal matter with [the detectives] whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Scott denied telling defendant or the detectives that he would not cross over the Brooklyn Bridge; he conceded, however, that he never indicated to defendant that he would be or was considering representing him in the homicide case, although he might have commented that he \u201cwould be happy to represent him.\u201d In answers to questions posed by the judge, Scott confirmed that he was not defendant\u2019s attorney for the homicide, and never told the detectives otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201cthe court: I just want to be clear, Mr. Scott, did you tell the detectives from Brooklyn who brought [defendant] over for his arraignment in Manhattan that you were representing [defendant] at any time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Did you tell them that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cthe witness: Yes, I did. Aside from it being\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cthe court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201cthe witness: Yes, I said, he is represented by counsel, do not question him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201cthe court: As far as the drug case or the homicide case or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">\u201cthe witness: I didn\u2019t specify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">\u201cthe court: You didn\u2019t specify. So you had been engaged to represent him as an 18 B for the drug sale case in Manhattan, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\u201cthe witness: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">\u201cthe court: You had not been engaged by anybody to represent him in the homicide case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\u201cthe witness: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">\u201cthe court: And you did not tell the detectives that you were representing him in the homicide case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">\u201cthe witness: Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">On the way back to the precinct in Brooklyn, Amato mentioned to defendant that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-18\">\u201cfound it kind of funny that this guy was telling [him] that he wasn\u2019t coming to Brooklyn to represent him. I didn\u2019t think it was right. I said, you know what? I said, I wouldn\u2019t look out for you like that. I said, you know what? If you tell us what happened, you know, maybe we can help you out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">Amato acknowledged that he was \u201ctry[ing to] get [defendant] to say exactly what happened the day of the homicide.\u201d Defendant was noncommittal, remarking that \u201che would have to think about it.\u201d As Parks put it, defendant \u201chad already been in a lineup so he understood what the purpose of going back to the precinct was. We spoke to him about . . . his attorney, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>attorney doesn\u2019t represent him here in Brooklyn. If he\u2019d like to make a statement to Detective Killigrew, that\u2019s his choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Amato and Parks arrived at the precinct with defendant around 1:30 or 2:00 a.m. on May 18, 2007. At about 2:30 a.m., defendant announced to Amato and Killigrew that he wanted to talk about what happened. Amato contacted the assistant district attorney on duty to \u201cmake sure that [defendant\u2019s] right to counsel didn\u2019t attach because of the [Manhattan drug] case.\u201d The prosecutor advised Amato that he could speak to defendant \u201cbecause he [did not] have counsel attached in this case. He [had] counsel attached in the drug case.\u201d Amato related this advice to Killigrew and, after Killigrew reminded defendant that \u201che was still under the Miranda warnings that we issued earlier,\u201d defendant gave an oral statement, which Killigrew took down.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Defendant admitted to shooting \u2014 first with a shotgun, until it jammed, and then with a handgun, until it, too, became inoperable \u2014 in the direction of the door at the Bainbridge Street building, causing those standing on the front stoop to scatter or run inside. He claimed that he only meant to scare these hangers-on, one of whom he feared on account of a previous run-in, and had been unaware until the following day that anyone had died. Defendant then repeated substantially the same statement on videotape to an assistant district attorney. At the beginning of the videotaped statement, defendant again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights; near the end, he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if he was represented by a lawyer in the homicide case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In a May 30, 2008 decision and order, the judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements. He reasoned that \u201c[a]ssuming arguendo that Scott told the Detectives not to question Defendant,\u201d that instruction was nugatory because even though \u201cDefendant was represented by counsel on the Manhattan narcotics charges, he was not in custody on those charges, having been released on his own recognizance. Scott did not represent Defendant on the homicide charges, nor did he tell the Detectives that he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Defendant was tried by a jury before another judge. The two eyewitnesses testified. Killigrew read his transcription of defendant\u2019s statement, and the jury viewed the videotape. Scott was the only witness called by the defense. He again testified that he instructed the detectives not to question defendant. In the following series of questions and answers on cross-examination, however, he once more conceded that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>represent defendant on the homicide charge at the time defendant gave his statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cQ Did you represent [defendant] on the homicide matter in this county, in Brooklyn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cA I was not assigned to represent him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cQ That is a simple question. You stood there in Manhattan Criminal Court. You had a conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cWhen you did that, did you represent this man on the homicide matter that these detectives had a duty and desire to investigate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201cYes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The jury acquitted defendant of intentional murder (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]) and convicted him of the weapon charge based upon possession of a loaded firearm outside the home or business (Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 [3]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge subsequently sentenced defendant to 15 years of imprisonment followed by five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant appealed. He argued that his indelible right to counsel had attached because Scott let the detectives know that he was represented by counsel and was not to be questioned, and he challenged his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">In a decision and order dated May 18, 2010, the Appellate Division concluded that comments made by the sentencing court \u201cdemonstrated that it improperly considered\u201d the murder count \u201cas a basis for sentencing\u201d (73 AD3d 1088 [2d Dept 2010]), and so vacated the sentence and remitted the matter to Supreme Court for resentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Division otherwise affirmed, deciding that any error in not suppressing defendant\u2019s statements was harmless because \u201cthe evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt . . . was overwhelming, and there [was] no reasonable possibility that the alleged error might have contributed to [his] conviction\u201d <em>(id.). </em>A Judge of this Court granted defendant permission to appeal (15 NY3d 808 [2010]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">Defendant urges us to send this case back to the hearing court for the judge to decide whether Scott, in fact, told the detectives that defendant \u201cwas represented by counsel and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>should not question him.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, if Scott made this assertion and gave this direction, the right to counsel indelibly attached, and the statements subsequently given by defendant in the absence of counsel must be suppressed even though Scott did not, in fact, represent defendant in the murder case at the time (or ever, for that matter); or, put slightly differently, defendant contends that Scott\u2019s neglect to \u201cspecify\u201d to the detectives whether he represented defendant in \u201cthe drug case or the homicide case or both\u201d created an ambiguity causing the indelible right to counsel to attach. We have never held that an attorney may unilaterally create an attorney-client relationship in a criminal proceeding in this fashion, and decline to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>People v Ramos </em>(40 NY2d 610 [1976]), for example, is not \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the situation here, as defendant contends. Ramos, who was wanted by the police in relation to a shooting in Manhattan, was subsequently arrested in the Bronx on a narcotics charge. At the arraignment in the Bronx on the drug matter, Ramos\u2019s attorney proclaimed in open court, in the presence of a detective from Manhattan who was waiting to take the defendant into custody, that \u201c[flor the record, [he had] advised [Ramos] not to make any statements to these police officers who are taking him into custody\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 612). Ramos was then escorted to Manhattan, where he made an incriminating statement to an assistant district attorney. At the outset of this interrogation, he was equivocal about whether he wanted a lawyer \u2014 stating, for example, \u201cWhat I can tell about this here I can tell you myself just like it happened. It can go against me, I would like a lawyer. I can tell you that myself, I hope it don\u2019t go against me, I am trying to get out of this jam\u201d \u2014 before finally saying to the assistant district attorney \u201cGo ahead, ask me some questions\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 613).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We held that the statement taken by the assistant district attorney should be suppressed because \u201cthe defendant was represented by counsel at the time of his interrogation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 618) by virtue of \u201cthe attorney\u2019s affirmative and direct action\u201d \u2014 i.e.,</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>his statements on the defendant\u2019s behalf in front of the judge in open court \u2014 \u201crelative to the interrogation which was about to be commenced in connection with\u201d the shooting <em>(id. </em>at 617). Further, we noted that Ramos\u2019s \u201cspecific although perhaps confused request: Tt can go against me, I would like a lawyer\u2019, [gave] testimony to his need <em>and desire </em>for legal advice from a lawyer representing his interests\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 618 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Here, by contrast, Scott made no statements during the arraignment on the drug crime even arguably related to the homicide. If he had said in open court that defendant \u201cwas represented by counsel and that [the police] should not question him,\u201d the prosecutor (or the judge) would have had the occasion and the opportunity to ask him flat out whether he was defendant\u2019s lawyer in the murder case, as the judge and the prosecutor later did at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing and the trial, respectively. Moreover, there is no ambiguity here, as there was in <em>Ramos, </em>about whether defendant may have intended to invoke his right to counsel before making the inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Indeed, in <em>People v Marrero </em>(51 NY2d 56, 59 [1980]), the other case principally relied upon by defendant, we equated the defendant\u2019s conduct to \u201ca verbal request for counsel.\u201d Marrero, believing that he was being sought in a homicide investigation, asked a lawyer to contact the police and arrange for his surrender. As a result, the police took Marrero into custody in the attorney\u2019s office with the lawyer present. There was no doubt that the lawyer represented the defendant at that juncture of the homicide investigation. Later at the police station, Marrero made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We held that the statements should be suppressed, observing that \u201c[b]y consulting a lawyer to contact the police, and then surrendering in the attorney\u2019s office with counsel present, the defendant had manifested his own view that he [was] not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 59 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Further, we observed that the police did not know about the limited nature of the attorney\u2019s representation. Rather, \u201c[a]ll they knew was that the defendant had sought the assistance of counsel <em>in connection with the charge they were </em>investigating\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]; <em>see also People v West, </em>81 NY2d 370, 380 [1993] [citing <em>Marrero </em>for the proposition that \u201c(a)bsent some indication that the representation had ceased, the police could not question defendant concerning <em>the very matter as to which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>they knew he had a lawyer\u201d </em>(emphasis added)]). Here, however, nothing about defendant\u2019s conduct suggests that he meant to invoke his right to counsel before he made the statements, and, also unlike the situation in <em>Marrero, </em>Scott had not already conspicuously represented defendant in an aspect of the homicide matter, causing the indelible right to attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. Although defendant insists that Scott made these remarks <em>post-</em>arraignment, his hearing testimony is, at best, ambiguous on the matter of timing. As relevant to this point, Scott testified that all his conversation with defendant took place within earshot of the two detectives, and lasted from 5 to 10 minutes \u201c[t]otal,\u201d since \u201c[i]t was just a question of informing [defendant] of the charges, never mind the bail, and <em>advising him not to speak\u201d </em>(emphasis added). He also testified that \u201cin the past\u201d in similar situations he had \u201casked the judge while we were all in the well of the courtroom\u201d \u2014 i.e., during arraignment \u2014 \u201cto advise or reinforce the warning or advisement not to question [his] client.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-14\">. The judge did not submit the assault and other weapon possession count to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-15\">. On July 21, 2010, Supreme Court resentenced defendant to the same sentence originally imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. When Ramos agreed to talk to the assistant district attorney, he was well aware that he had earlier made incriminating statements to three Bronx police officers who questioned him about the shooting while he was awaiting arraignment on the drug charge: he told the assistant district attorney \u201cI already talked to detectives, if they got that record already it don\u2019t make no difference\u201d whether he again implicated himself in the shooting (40 NY2d at 613). The admissibility of these statements was not raised on the appeal <em>(id. </em>at 612 n 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b169-5\">Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">(dissenting). In the decision and order we now review the Appellate Division affirmed portions of a Kings County Supreme Court judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. It did so over defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction had been obtained based on an inculpatory statement that should have been suppressed since it was given by him to Brooklyn police detectives in pursuance of an invalid waiver of his right to counsel. Although that claim was fully litigated at a pretrial <em>Huntley </em>hearing, the Appellate Division did not address its merits. It held instead that if it had been error to deny suppression of defendant\u2019s statements, the error was harmless in light of what it viewed as the overwhelming properly received evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt (73 AD3d 1088 [2010]). This Court has now evidently concluded that the evidence was not so overwhelming as the Appellate Division thought and, accordingly, that the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver and ensuing confession should have been determined as a necessary antecedent to affirming the judgment convicting him. Having so concluded, the Court apparently undertakes to do what the Appellate Division did not upon a hearing record which, although well developed, raises certain factual issues not yet resolved by a court with jurisdiction to do so. The testimony from which those issues arise may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Daniel Scott, the attorney assigned to represent defendant at his Manhattan arraignment on narcotics charges, testified that, in the presence of the Brooklyn detectives who had escorted defendant to the arraignment, and not privately, he \u201ctold [defendant] not to discuss any legal matter with them [the Brooklyn detectives] whatsoever.\u201d He also testified that he separately \u201cadvised [the detectives] that Mr. Pacquette was represented by counsel and that they should not question him.\u201d He stated as well that he never told Mr. Pacquette that he would not represent him on the Brooklyn homicide with which he was about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>be charged. The Brooklyn detectives, on the other hand, testified that defendant and Scott conferred privately but that portions of the attorney-client exchange were nonetheless overheard by Detective Amato. Amato reported that he heard Scott tell defendant that he would not represent him in his new case in Brooklyn. Amato and his partner Detective Parks both stated that Scott never advised them that defendant was represented by counsel and that they should not question him.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The hearing court did not decide whether Scott did in fact tell defendant in front of the detectives that he was not to speak with them about any legal matters or whether he told the detectives that they should not question his client. Nor did the hearing court decide whether Scott told defendant that he would not represent him in the Brooklyn homicide matter. This was because the court found dispositive Scott\u2019s acknowledgments that he was not ultimately engaged to represent defendant in the homicide and that he did not, in so many words, tell the Brooklyn detectives that he represented defendant in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The majority, although declaring that Scott could not have unilaterally created an attorney-client relationship with defendant respecting the Brooklyn matter, does not go so far as to say that Scott in the course of representing defendant at his Manhattan arraignment could not have effectively signaled his entry into that matter, thus triggering, with respect to the homicide investigation, his client\u2019s indelible right to counsel. That, of course, would not be consistent with our decision in <em>People v Ramos </em>(40 NY2d 610 [1976]), which, on facts remarkably like those at bar, clearly recognizes that a defendant\u2019s attorney is, through \u201caffirmative and direct action relative to [an] interrogation . . . about to be commenced\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 617), capable of precluding an uncounseled waiver of the right to counsel in an unrelated matter, even one in which the attorney does not ultimately represent the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, it appears to be the majority\u2019s position that what Scott said was not adequate to communicate to the detectives his entry into the Brooklyn matter. In taking this position, it must be supposed that the majority assumes for the purposes of its argument that Scott did in fact tell defendant in the detectives\u2019 immediate presence that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was \u201cnot to discuss any legal matter with them whatsoever\u201d and that he did not tell defendant that he would not represent him in Brooklyn. It must also be supposed that the majority is assuming, also for the sake of argument, that Scott did instruct the detectives \u201cthat Mr. Pacquette was represented by counsel and that they should not question him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Having made these assumptions in defendant\u2019s favor in lieu of sending the matter back for factual findings that this Court may not make, the majority then says that \u201cScott made no statements during the arraignment on the drug crime even arguably related to the homicide\u201d (majority op at 96). Even viewed in isolation, simply for their semantic content, Scott\u2019s directives unambiguously communicated to the detectives that his client was not to discuss with them <em>\u201cany </em>legal matter . . . whatsoever\u201d (emphasis supplied) and, accordingly, that \u201cthey should not question [defendant]\u201d about any legal matter whatsoever. A homicide is a legal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Even if there were some doubt as to what Scott\u2019s words themselves meant, and really there should be none, the context in which they were spoken could have left absolutely no doubt that Scott was directing the Brooklyn homicide detectives quite specifically not to question defendant about the Brooklyn homicide they were investigating. At the time, all concerned knew that defendant was a suspect in a Brooklyn homicide, and, indeed, Scott was well aware that his client was, by prearrangement, to be immediately returned to the custody of the Brooklyn detectives at the conclusion of his expedited arraignment so that he could be timely arraigned on homicide charges in Brooklyn. Given this scenario, Scott\u2019s concern could not have been principally that defendant would be questioned in his absence about matters pertinent to the New York County drug case, something which his entry as counsel at defendant\u2019s Manhattan arraignment itself precluded, but that he would during the interval before his arraignment on the Brooklyn homicide charges be interrogated and make imprudent admissions with respect to that homicide. Certainly the Brooklyn homicide detectives, who had no interest in defendant\u2019s New York County drug case, would have understood that Scott\u2019s directives to them concerned the case that they were investigating and in which Scott\u2019s client would, in the coming hours, be a natural candidate for custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Although the majority characterizes Scott\u2019s intercession as an attempt unilaterally to create an attorney-client relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>defendant was already represented by Scott and no competent defense attorney would simply abandon a client about to be interrogated as a suspect in a homicide. That Scott should have sought to enter the homicide case, if only temporarily to interpose himself between his client and the Brooklyn homicide detectives until formal appointment of counsel at the impending homicide arraignment in Brooklyn, was entirely appropriate. Whether Scott could have effectively accomplished that purpose by admonishing defendant and the Brooklyn detectives as he testified he did, is an inquiry that would seem to be controlled by <em>Ramos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In <em>Ramos, </em>we held that the statement by the lawyer appearing on Ramos\u2019s behalf at his Bronx arraignment on charges of drug possession \u2014 that he had \u201cadvised Mr. Santiago [Ramos] not to make any statements to these police officers who are taking him into custody\u201d (40 NY2d at 616) \u2014 sufficed to signal to the officers the lawyer\u2019s entry into Ramos\u2019s unrelated Manhattan homicide case, and thereby triggered Ramos\u2019s indelible right to counsel in that case. The admonitions of attorney Scott in this case, both literally and contextually virtually identical to those of Ramos\u2019s attorney, are, if precedent is a constraint upon what we do, entitled to be accorded the same legal effect. Although the majority finds it important that in <em>Ramos </em>the attorney placed his directive on the record, there appears no reason why Scott\u2019s admonitions should be deemed less effective than those of Ramos\u2019s lawyer simply because they were not placed on the record. As we noted in <em>Ramos, </em>the critical inquiry is whether \u201can attorney has communicated with the police for the purpose of representing the defendant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 615, quoting <em>People v Arthur, </em>22 NY2d 325, 329 [1968] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, what was crucial in <em>Ramos </em>and what should be here as well is the circumstance, necessarily assumed in appellant\u2019s favor at this juncture, that the defendant\u2019s attorney took \u201caffirmative and direct action relative to [an] interrogation . . . about to be commenced\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 617) \u201cin the presence of the police officer[s] taking [his client] into custody\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 616).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Even if there were some residual ambiguity as to whether Scott in his admonitory statements referred to the Brooklyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>homicide, that ambiguity would not redound to the prosecution\u2019s benefit. We were very clear about this in <em>Ramos </em>where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u201cIf, in fact, the prosecution was in doubt as to whether an attorney had entered the proceeding, the burden should rest squarely on it to insure that the defendant\u2019s right to be represented by counsel be protected. The ambiguity of the lawyer\u2019s statement or the manner in which the defendant\u2019s attorney went about representing his client cannot be seized by the prosecution as a license to play fast and loose with this precious right. A defendant\u2019s right to counsel cannot be made to depend on whether in the sole judgment of the prosecution there has been sufficient activity and conduct of a proper character so as to compel a conclusion that the lawyer has entered the proceedings. Nor can we agree with the prosecutor that the defendant has an affirmative burden to point out to the prosecution that an attorney has entered the proceedings on his behalf. To hold otherwise would violate our prior holdings and seriously undermine this constitutionally guaranteed right\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 617-618).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">And, in the more recent case of <em>People v Marrero </em>(51 NY2d 56 [1980]), citing <em>Ramos </em>we again emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201c[o]nce an attorney has appeared on the defendant\u2019s behalf we have refused to allow the police to rely on arguable ambiguities in the attorney-client relationship in order to justify police questioning of the defendant without the attorney being present (see, e.g., <em>People v Ramos, </em>40 NY2d 610). We have indicated that if the police are uncertain as to the scope of the attorney\u2019s representation, the defendant should not be questioned <em>(People v Coleman, </em>42 NY2d 500, 507)\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 59).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">While the majority understands these principles to apply only where the police do not know about the \u201climited nature of the attorney\u2019s representation\u201d (majority op at 96), it is difficult to understand how that posited condition lends support to its position in this case, since, even if it were true that limited representation could not trigger representational rights, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>manifestly it is not, there is no permissible basis for a supposition that the Brooklyn detectives knew, at the time they obtained defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel, about the \u201climited nature\u201d of attorney Scott\u2019s representation of defendant. Only by making credibility findings on the disputed issues of what was said by Scott to defendant and what Amato overheard, would it be possible to conclude that the Brooklyn detectives had some reliable basis for believing that Scott would not represent defendant in the Brooklyn case. If such a finding is to be made and relied upon in disposing of defendant\u2019s motion, the case should be remitted for that purpose; the finding may not be made in the first instance by this Court and, obviously, what the detectives knew is not appropriately assumed adversely to appellant as a basis for our denial of his appeal and our accompanying statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It is also suggested that <em>Ramos </em>and <em>Marrero </em>should not control here because in those cases the defendants manifested a need for legal assistance in the matters being investigated while defendant did not. It is, however, a basic and long-standing principle of our right-to-counsel jurisprudence that, if an attorney has entered a matter, the right to counsel indelibly attaches rendering it irrelevant, in the event of a subsequent uncounseled custodial waiver of the right, whether the defendant was, in interacting with his or her interrogators, not evidently averse to speaking or whether there was some manifestation by the defendant of a need for a lawyer. As we reiterated in <em>People v Hobson </em>(39 NY2d 479, 481 [1976]) and has since been the governing rule of law, \u201c[o]nce a lawyer has entered a criminal proceeding representing a defendant in connection with criminal charges under investigation, the defendant in custody may not waive his right to counsel in the absence of the lawyer.\u201d If Scott entered his client\u2019s homicide case, the uncounseled waiver subsequently obtained from his client in that case was invalid and the confession consequently elicited must be suppressed. Because it is not possible to say on any properly assumed set of facts considered in light of <em>Ramos </em>that Scott did not effectively enter the proceeding, the matter should be remitted so that the factual findings necessary to a proper determination of defendant\u2019s suppression motion can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Defendant would undoubtedly have been protected from making an uncounseled waiver of his right to counsel if he had not by careful prearrangement been \u201creleased\u201d from custody on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>represented New York County matter to the Brooklyn detectives (who promptly rearrested him). It is questionable whether this artifice should be deemed effective to avoid attachment of the indelible right under <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167 [1979]) where, as here, the detectives were obviously aware of the extant representational relationship, having been present at its inception, and fully intended in the hours after defendant\u2019s \u201crelease\u201d to subject him to custodial questioning. But accepting that the \u201crelease\u201d of defendant was not a contrivance simply to avoid the triggering of a representational right, it is clear that the situation was one involving great peril to defendant\u2019s legal interests and, accordingly, one which defendant\u2019s lawyer could not treat with indifference as it unfolded before him. Although there may not have been an automatic entitlement to counsel in the homicide case by reason of the unrelated representation in the designedly noncustodial New York County matter, there was, as we have recognized in <em>Ramos, </em>certainly in this situation a need and a corresponding prerogative on the part of the lawyer affirmatively to act to protect his client\u2019s interests. On this record, I do not think it possible for this Court to conclude that he did not do so, indeed, if it were necessary, that he did not do so \u2018 \u2018conspicuously. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith and Pigott concur with Judge Read; Chief Judge Lippman dissents in a separate opinion in which Judge Jones concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. We specifically rejected in <em>Ramos </em>the People\u2019s contention that Ramos\u2019s counsel could not have acted to prevent his prearraignment interrogation in an unrelated murder prosecution because he \u201cnever appeared at the defendant\u2019s murder arraignment or any other proceeding in connection with [that] case\u201d (40 NY2d at 617).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. While the majority urges that if Scott had placed his admonitions on the record the prosecutor or judge might have clarified the extent of his representation of defendant, there was obviously nothing to prevent the detectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>from pursuing the matter with Scott directly either at the arraignment or subsequently. As the majority recounts, \u201cAmato \u2018took [Scott\u2019s] business card\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 90).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
