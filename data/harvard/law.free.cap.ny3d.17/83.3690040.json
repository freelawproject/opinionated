The Appellate Division\u2019s decision and order had no effect on the legal status of assumed names. It simply followed the well-settled law that home improvement jobs must be done in the name on the contractor\u2019s license or he forfeits his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>recover. <em>(J.G.

He designated his ownership as \u201cIndividual,\u201d but wrote \u201cCoastal Construction Development\u201d after \u201cName of Company,\u201d and did not fill in the blank for a \u201cD/B/A\u201d name. After \u201cName of Applicant (President or Owner)\u201d he wrote \u201cAnthony Marraccini.\u201d The license was issued to Coastal Construction Development. Marraccini\u2019s own name does not appear on the license, but it is undisputed that Marraccini and Coastal are not separate legal entities. Thus Marraccini was personally licensed to do a home improvement business, though under a name other than his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Eleven years later, in 2004, Marraccini did construction, rehabilitation and maintenance work for defendants, John and Pam Ryan. In dealing with the Ryans, Marraccini used his own name, not Coastal Construction Development. The record does not show why he did not use the company name, but there is no indication that he was trying to or did deceive the Ryans. It is undisputed that, if the Ryans had gone to the Department of Consumer Protection Web site and searched for \u201cAnthony Marraccini,\u201d they would have found his license, which was indexed under both names.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">After the work was done, a dispute arose between Marraccini and the Ryans over whether he had been fully paid, and Marraccini brought this lawsuit against them. The Ryans moved for summary judgment on the ground, among others, that Marraccini was not licensed to do home improvement business in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>individual name. Supreme Court denied the motion, but the Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the complaint (71 AD3d 1100 [2010]), observing that, by doing business in his own name and not the name on his license, Marraccini violated Westchester County Administrative Code \u00a7 863.319 (1) (b). We granted leave to appeal (15 NY3d 799 [2010]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Marraccini may indeed have violated section 863.319 (1) (b) of the County Code, which says in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be a violation to . . . [c]onduct a home improvement business in any name other than the one in which the person is licensed.\u201d The County Code provides civil and criminal penalties, not to exceed $1,000, for such a violation (Westchester County Code \u00a7 277.171 [1]; \u00a7 277.181). Repeat violators may incur larger fines, and imprisonment for up to 15 days <em>(id,.). </em>The County Code does not, however, say that a violator is barred from bringing suit under a contract entered into under the wrong name. The question here is whether New York common law imposes such a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We conclude that it does not. The forfeiture of the right to be paid for work done is an excessive penalty for what seems to have been an inadvertent and harmless violation of the County Code. The case would be different if Marraccini had no license at all. <em>B &amp; F Bldg. Corp. v Liebig </em>(76 NY2d 689, 693 [1990]) holds that a contractor who was unlicensed at the time a contract was executed or work performed may not maintain a cause of action. We see no reason, however, to extend the strict rule of <em>B &amp; F Bldg. Corp. </em>to the much less serious violation at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, and defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
