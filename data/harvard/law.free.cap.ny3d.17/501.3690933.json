The Appellate Division properly held that the trial court had erred in admitting testimony as \u201cprompt outcry\u201d when the statement was not made at the first suitable opportunity and there was no reasonable explanation for the months-long delay. <em>(People v Van Ness, </em>43 AD3d 553; <em>People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d 426; <em>People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v Rice, </em>75 NY2d 929; <em>People v O\u2019Sullivan, </em>104 NY 481; <em>People v Banks, </em>27 AD3d 953; <em>People v Allen, </em>13 AD3d 892; <em>Matter of Gregory AA., </em>20 AD3d 726; <em>People v Vanterpool, </em>214 AD2d 429.) II. The Appellate Division properly held that the trial court erred in admitting testimony under the \u201crecent fabrication\u201d exception to the hearsay rule when the prior statements did not predate the declarant\u2019s motive to lie and defense counsel did not open the door to their admission. <em>(People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d 426; <em>People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269; <em>People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v Seit, </em>86 NY2d 92; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v Rojas, </em>97 NY2d 32; <em>People v Massie, </em>2 NY3d 179; <em>People v Mann, </em>31 NY2d 253; <em>People v Lago, </em>60 AD3d 784; <em>People v Jones, </em>258 AD2d 383.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\"><em>Glenn A.

Garber </em>and <em>Angharad Vaughan </em>of counsel), for appellant in the second above-entitled action.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYf\">I. The complainant\u2019s statements at the child advocacy center detailing the alleged sexual abuse, during an exam conducted at the behest of law enforcement the day before the complainant and the examining nurse testified before the grand jury, more than two years after the alleged abuse, were not sufficiently related to medical diagnosis and treatment to be admissible hearsay, and should have been excluded. <em>(People v Rogers, </em>8 AD3d 888; <em>People v Bailey, </em>252 AD2d 815; <em>People v Ballerstein, 52 </em>AD3d 1192; <em>Williams v Alexander, </em>309 NY 283; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>68 NY2d 569; <em>People v Cratsley, </em>86 NY2d 81; <em>Johnson v Lutz, </em>253 NY 124; <em>Matter of Leon RR, </em>48 NY2d 117; <em>People v Bradley, </em>15 AD3d 840; <em>People v Jackson, </em>124 AD2d 975.) II. It was harmful error for the state\u2019s expert to testify that behaviors including tantrums and rebelliousness are indicative of child sexual abuse, and for the prosecutor to argue that the complainant\u2019s manifestation of these behaviors proved that the allegations of abuse were true. <em>(People v Shay, 210 </em>AD2d 735; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>Dougherty v Milliken, </em>163 NY 527; <em>People v Carroll, </em>95 NY2d 375; <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284; <em>People v Hudy, </em>73 NY2d 40; <em>People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d 277; <em>People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410; <em>People v Banks, </em>75 NY2d 277; <em>People v Stuckey, </em>50 AD3d 447.) III. The complainant\u2019s statements to her aunt detailing the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>abuse, two years after the period of alleged abuse ended, were not admissible as \u201cprompt outcry,\u201d and it was harmful error to permit the complainant and the aunt to improperly bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility with testimony about these prior statements. <em>(Crawford v Nilan, </em>289 NY 444; <em>People v Seit, </em>86 NY2d 92; <em>People v </em>McClean, 69 NY2d 426; <em>People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v Rice, </em>75 NY2d 929; <em>People v Deitsch, </em>237 NY 300; <em>People v O\u2019Sullivan, </em>104 NY 481; <em>People v Leon, </em>209 AD2d 342; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Baker, </em>23 NY2d 307.) IV. The trial court erred by permitting the complainant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that she reported the alleged abuse to her eight-year-old cousin who promised to keep it a secret, as such report was not a \u201cprompt outcry,\u201d and constituted improper bolstering of the complainant\u2019s credibility. <em>(People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v O\u2019Sullivan, </em>104 NY 481.) V. It was an abuse of discretion and harmful error to permit a detective on redirect to relate the entire statement by the complainant graphically describing the alleged sexual abuse, in response to defense counsel\u2019s impeachment on a specific, narrow point in the complainant\u2019s statement to police, where no limiting instruction was given and the prosecutor utilized this testimony as substantive evidence. <em>(People v Massie, </em>2 NY3d 179.) VI. The cumulative impact of numerous evidentiary errors and improper argument by the prosecutor rendered the trial fundamentally unfair and deprived defendant-appellant of a fair trial and due process of law, where the only evidence of guilt was the uncorroborated testimony of the 11-year-old complainant and all of the errors had the direct effect of bolstering the complainant\u2019s credibility. <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Calabria, </em>94 NY2d 519; <em>People v Dowdell, </em>88 AD2d 239; <em>People v Ortiz, </em>116 AD2d 531; <em>People v Nevedo, </em>202 AD2d 183; <em>People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d 426; <em>People v Allweiss, </em>48 NY2d 40; <em>People v Rice, </em>75 NY2d 929.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>Cyrus R.

Defendant\u2019s challenges to the admission of the complainant\u2019s prior statements are partially waived and partially unpreserved; in any event, those statements were properly admitted. <em>(People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10; <em>People v Williams, </em>75 NY2d 858; <em>People v Stuckey, </em>50 AD3d 447; <em>People v Aguirre, </em>262 AD2d 175; <em>People v Vasquez, </em>221 AD2d 575; <em>People v Vanterpool, </em>214 AD2d 429; <em>People v Clarke, </em>81 NY2d 777; <em>People v Kelly, </em>5 NY3d 116; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v Rojas, </em>97 NY2d 32.) II. Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims, Dr. Treacy\u2019s expert testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s summation remarks concerning that testimony were entirely appropriate. Moreover, even if the People\u2019s use of that testimony was improper in any respect, the error was harmless. <em>(People v </em>Clarke, 81 NY2d 777; <em>People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d 277; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>People v Abney, </em>13 NY3d 251; <em>People v Lee, </em>96 NY2d 157; <em>People v Carroll, </em>95 NY2d 375; <em>People v Cintron, </em>75 NY2d 249; <em>People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410; <em>People v Gregory, </em>78 AD3d 1246; <em>People v Torres, </em>78 AD3d 866.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b578-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The issue for us to decide in these two cases is whether prior consistent statements alleging sexual abuse were properly admitted under the prompt outcry rule or, alternatively in the <em>Rosario </em>case, to rebut a claim of recent fabrication. In both appeals, we affirm the Appellate Division, which concluded that the prior consistent statement was inadmissible in <em>Rosario, </em>and admissible in <em>Parada.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">\n<em>Rosario</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Complainant, who was 16 at the time of trial, testified that her father, defendant Angel Rosario, began to abuse her sexually when she was about nine years old. Over the next four or five years, he would frequently rub his body against hers when he encountered her alone in the family\u2019s apartment, pressing his penis against her. He would make complainant perform oral sex on him, and once put his mouth on her vagina when she was in her bedroom, watching the Disney Channel on television. When complainant was 13 years old, defendant penetrated her vagina with his penis. Then in early 2004, when complainant was 14 years old and in ninth grade, she struggled with and resisted defendant when he forced sexual intercourse on her. Complainant says that she told defendant \u201cThis is never going to happen again,\u201d and that he did not touch her sexually after this encounter. At no time did defendant ejaculate, and, in every instance, the penetration was slight. Complainant did not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>anyone in her extended family<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> about defendant\u2019s sexual advances because she was scared that she would not be believed and would get into trouble, and she was fearful about how her mother would react.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">By January 2004, about the time the abuse stopped, complainant had started dating. In May 2004, her boyfriend noticed that she was upset and asked her what was wrong. They were in the school courtyard at the time. Because she \u201chad difficulty saying\u201d what was bothering her, complainant\u2019s boyfriend suggested that she write it down. Complainant then took a piece of paper from her book bag and wrote the following note, which she handed to her boyfriend for him to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201cWell, um I kind of get sexually harassed by my Dad since I was I think 10. And im not very proud of it + I havent told nebody cause he\u2019s my dad n i didn\u2019t want him 2 go away + pwease don\u2019t tell nel [and] lately ive bin pushing him off n stuff so like yeah, please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">When complainant\u2019s boyfriend responded by \u201clook[ing] at [her] like, are you serious? Can this really happen and why didn\u2019t you tell anybody\u201d she felt \u201cembarrassed and ashamed.\u201d Complainant\u2019s boyfriend testified that he slipped the note into his pocket, unbeknownst to complainant; she testified that he crumpled up the note and threw it away as they left the courtyard. Complainant was not sure when she wrote the note, but thought it \u201cmust have been May\u201d or perhaps \u201cearlier\u201d; her boyfriend asserted that this episode took place in May 2004. He located the thought-to-be-lost note (which was admitted into evidence) in February 2006, and produced it for the District Attorney two days before he testified on June 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On June 24, 2005, about a year after she wrote the note, complainant argued with defendant when he refused to let her go to the movies with her boyfriend. Having gotten friendly with Police Officers Anthony Flores and Slade Bradley, who ran the Explorers Program sponsored by the New York Police Department,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> complainant stopped by the stationhouse to talk to Officer Flores. When he was not there, she went to the movies with her boyfriend, in defiance of defendant. But once at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>movies, she got nervous about getting into \u201csevere trouble\u201d and being \u201chit\u201d by defendant, a stern disciplinarian who inflicted corporal punishment when displeased with her behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Before returning home, complainant called Officer Flores (whom defendant had also contacted, fearing that his daughter had run away from home after their argument). Officer Flores picked complainant up at the movies and returned with her to the stationhouse. Once there, complainant spoke with both Officers Flores and Bradley (a woman), telling them that defendant had sexually abused her. According to complainant, she decided to report \u201cwhat was going on\u201d at that point in time because she was tired of \u201call of the stuff that went on in [her] house\u201d and did not want to be molested anymore. The officers took complainant to meet with a detective in the Manhattan Special Victims Squad, to whom she repeated her claim of sexual abuse. Defendant was arrested and subsequently indicted for first-degree course of sexual conduct against a child (Penal Law \u00a7 130.75 [1] [b] [being at least 18 years old and engaging in two or more acts of sexual conduct over a period of time not less than three months in duration with a child less than 13 years old]), first-degree rape (Penal Law \u00a7 130.35 [1] [engaging in sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion]) and other lesser charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">At trial, defendant denied his daughter\u2019s accusations; his wife testified that she had never noticed any change in her daughter\u2019s personality or behavior toward defendant. In summation, the defense argued that complainant \u2014 portrayed as a willful only child, angry at defendant for restricting her freedom and anxious about the punishment he would mete out for her disobedience on June 24, 2005 \u2014 embroidered a tale of mistreatment by her father with a claim of sexual abuse (perhaps in response to a suggestive question posed by Officer Bradley) and then found herself \u201cbacked into a corner.\u201d The jury convicted defendant of all the charges submitted to it, including first-degree course of sexual conduct against a child, and first- and second-degree rape. The trial judge sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of 15 years in prison, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The Appellate Division reversed the judgment, holding that the note did not qualify as a prompt outcry \u201cin view of the months-long delay between the charged conduct and the writing of the note, especially in the absence of a sufficient explanation for the complainant\u2019s not confiding in someone else earlier\u201d (68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>AD3d 600, 601 [1st Dept 2009]). The court further concluded that the note was not admissible as a proper rehabilitative response to a defense claim of recent fabrication for two reasons: \u201cIt was offered on the People\u2019s direct case ... in the course of the complainant\u2019s direct testimony, <em>in anticipation of </em>a defense of recent fabrication\u201d; and at the time</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cthe note was admitted into evidence, the defense had done nothing to specify to the jury . . . when and how the complainant had decided to make a false accusation against defendant [and] could as easily have claimed that the complainant\u2019s motivation . . . arose years earlier, in response to defendant\u2019s controlling and overbearing conduct over the years, rather than on June 24, 2005\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 602 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">A Judge of this Court granted the People permission to appeal (15 NY3d 809 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\n<em>Parada</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Complainant testified that defendant Luis Parada sexually abused her when he babysat her after school and during school breaks from mid-2002 until early 2004 at the apartment where she resided with her mother and four brothers and the man with whom her mother then had a relationship, a childhood friend of defendant. Specifically, complainant, who was six or seven when the alleged abuse took place and 11 at the time of trial, testified that defendant twice anally sodomized her, causing rectal bleeding that she once reported to her mother (although not its cause), and also touched and penetrated her vagina with his finger, forced her to touch his penis and would lie on top of her on occasions when he was alone with her, or only her infant brother was also present in the apartment. According to complainant, defendant would tell her not to tell anyone because it was their \u201csecret\u201d or \u201csomething bad w[ould] happen.\u201d While defendant was still babysitting her, though, complainant disclosed to a female cousin, who was one year older, that defendant had \u201cput his front private part in[to her butt].\u201d Complainant made her cousin \u201cpinky promise\u201d not to tell anyone because she \u201cthought they wouldn\u2019t believe [her].\u201d Defendant\u2019s babysitting duties ended sometime after complainant\u2019s mother and his friend broke up in early 2004, and complainant\u2019s mother moved in with her brother and sister-in-law, whose children included the cousin in whom complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>had earlier confided. According to complainant\u2019s mother, in early 2005, defendant telephoned her, saying that \u201che wanted to know how the kids were doing and ... to come over and see [them].\u201d She invited defendant to her brother\u2019s apartment, and he offered to take complainant and her younger brother to the Museum of Natural History. Complainant, described by her mother as \u201cmore stunned than happy\u201d to see defendant, asked her cousin to go along on this trip because she \u201cdid not want to go alone with [defendant].\u201d After the museum visit, complainant let her mother know that she did not want to see defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In mid-May 2006, complainant revealed to her paternal aunt that defendant had \u201ctouched her\u201d when he babysat her. At complainant\u2019s insistence, her aunt agreed to keep this a secret. On another occasion, complainant again talked to her aunt about \u201cwhat [had] happened to her.\u201d Then in late June 2006, while mother and daughter were in the kitchen washing and drying the dishes after dinner, complainant\u2019s mother initiated a conversation with her about boys, telling complainant \u201cnot [to] let[ ] anyone touch her\u201d or \u201cput their hands on [her] body.\u201d She assured complainant that \u201cif anyone ever[ ] put[ ] their hands on\u201d her, she should tell her mother, who would protect her. At that point, complainant blurted out that \u201csomeone\u201d had already touched her. After her mother mentioned the names of two adult males, complainant \u201cbroke down and started crying\u201d and \u201csaid it was [defendant].\u201d Complainant\u2019s mother contacted the police the next day, and defendant was arrested and eventually indicted for first-degree course of sexual conduct against a child (Penal Law \u00a7 130.75 [1] [a] [engaging in two or more acts of sexual conduct over a period of time not less than three months in duration with a child less than 11 years old]).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Prior to defendant\u2019s jury trial, the People moved to introduce into evidence complainant\u2019s statements to her cousin and aunt about defendant\u2019s sexual abuse. Defendant objected that these disclosures did not constitute prompt outcry. The trial judge decided that the testimony could come in, however, and complainant and her aunt testified as described. Defendant took the stand and professed innocence. His expert, a psychiatrist with experience in evaluating child victims of sexual abuse, testified that children may allege molestation to get even with someone in their environment, and sometimes \u201cconfabulate\u201d or \u201cintroduce fantasy\u201d into their statements. The jury convicted defendant of the charged offense, and Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>subsequently sentenced him to 20 years in prison followed by five years of postrelease supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, affirmed the judgment, ruling that the trial judge properly admitted complainant\u2019s revelation to her cousin as a prompt outcry because \u201cit was made during the period wherein [complainant] was being sexually abused\u201d (67 AD3d 581, 582 [1st Dept 2009]). The court further concluded that while Supreme Court erroneously admitted complainant\u2019s disclosures to her aunt, the error was harmless. Finally, the court declined to reach, in the interest of justice, defendant\u2019s unpreserved challenges to the admission of certain prior consistent statements that complainant made to a pediatric nurse who examined her and a detective who interviewed her, and portions of the People\u2019s summation and, alternatively, rejected these challenges on the merits or considered any error to be harmless. Further, \u201c[t]o the extent the existing record permit [ted],\u201d the court concluded that defendant received effective assistance of counsel <em>(id. </em>at 583).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The dissenting Justices would have exercised discretion in the interest of justice to decide defendant\u2019s unpreserved arguments, which they considered meritorious. In their view, the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the various unpreserved and preserved \u201cevidentiary errors on a conviction that rest[ed] essentially on the credibility of an 11-year-old child\u201d was not harmless <em>(id. </em>at 586). A dissenting Justice granted defendant permission to appeal to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">As a general rule, \u201cevidence that a victim of sexual assault promptly complained about the incident is admissible to corroborate the allegation that an assault took place\u201d <em>(People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10, 16 [1993]). The prompt outcry rule \u2014 an exception to the inadmissibility of the prior consistent statements of an unimpeached witness \u2014 \u201cpermits evidence that a timely complaint was made,\u201d but does not allow further testimony as to the \u201cdetails of the incident\u201d <em>(People v Rice, </em>75 NY2d 929, 932 [1990]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a classic exposition of the original reasoning underlying the prompt outcry rule, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201c[i]t is a general rule that the evidence of a witness can never be corroborated or confirmed by proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that the witness stated the same facts testified to in court on some occasion when not under oath. Such statements, like all hearsay evidence, are excluded as unsatisfactory and incompetent. But there is an exception to the rule in the case of rape. The outrage in such a case upon a virtuous female is so great that there is a natural presumption that at the first suitable opportunity she would make disclosure of it; and she would be so far discredited if she did not make disclosure, for the purpose of confirming her evidence where she is a witness, such disclosure may be received. But where the disclosure is not recent, as soon as suitable opportunity is furnished, the reason for receiving the evidence does not exist, and the principle justifying its reception does not apply\u201d <em>(People v O\u2019Sullivan, </em>104 NY 481, 486 [1887] [disclosure made 11 months after the commission of the alleged rape was too remote to qualify as a prompt outcry]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">As we recognized in <em>McDaniel, </em>though, \u201c[t]he contemporary rationale for permitting prompt outcry evidence is that some jurors would inevitably doubt the veracity of a victim who failed to promptly complain of a sexual assault\u201d <em>(McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d at 16).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, we have made clear that \u201cpromptness is a relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>concept dependent on the facts \u2014 what might qualify as prompt in one case might not in another\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Rosario</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Applying these principles to the facts in <em>Rosario, </em>too much time (perhaps as long as five months) elapsed between the last instance of alleged sexual abuse and the note for this evidence to qualify as a prompt outcry. Although there is no hard-and-fast rule as to the timeliness of a prompt outcry, the concept of promptness necessarily suggests an immediacy not ordinarily present when months go by, especially when the complainant is a teenager, not a child <em>(see e.g. id. </em>at 14 [daughter told her mother about a nighttime sexual assault the following morning]; <em>Rice, </em>75 NY2d at 931 [victim reported her rape to the police after her assailant fled]; <em>People v Stearns, </em>72 AD3d 1214 [3d Dept 2010] [victim told her former boyfriend of rape the following morning]; <em>People v Aller, </em>33 AD3d 621 [2d Dept 2006], <em>lv denied </em>8 NY3d 918 [2007] [victim told her mother of the sexual assault within 12 hours of the attack]).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The People also argue in <em>Rosario </em>that, even if not a prompt outcry, the note and the testimony about it were admissible to rebut a claim of recent fabrication. Generally, a witness\u2019s trial testimony may not be bolstered with prior consistent statements (Mc<em>Daniel, </em>81 NY2d at 16) because \u201can untrustworthy statement is not made more trustworthy by repetition\u201d <em>(People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d 426, 428 [1987]; <em>see also </em>DuBois, A <em>Matter of Time: Evidence of a Victim\u2019s Prompt Complaint in New York, </em>53 Brook L Rev 1087, 1092-1093 [1988] [explaining that the inadmissibility of an unimpeached witness\u2019s prior consistent statements is \u201cbased on the theory that simple \u2018repetition does not imply veracity\u2019 \u201d; that such statements are \u201cpresumed to lack probative value\u201d; that \u201ctheir introduction hinders trial efficiency\u201d; and that their use in a criminal case \u201cmay prejudice the defendant by unduly bolstering the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witness\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)]). Nevertheless, \u201cotherwise inadmissible evidence may become admissible where the adverse party has \u2018opened the door\u2019 to it by offering evidence, or making an argument based on the evidence, which might otherwise mislead the factfinder\u201d <em>(People v Massie, </em>2 NY3d 179, 180 [2004]). When a \u201cwitnesses] testimony is assailed \u2014 either directly or inferentially \u2014 as a recent fabrication, the witness may be rehabilitated\u201d with a prior consistent statement made at a time predating the motive to fabricate <em>(McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d at 18; <em>see also People v Seit, </em>86 NY2d 92, 96 [1995]; <em>McClean, </em>69 NY2d at 428).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>According to the People, defense counsel in her opening statement implicitly accused complainant of lying, thus opening the door to admission of evidence about the note in their direct case. Defense counsel in her opening statement first described defendant as a strict father, plagued by health problems, with high academic expectations of his daughter; she acknowledged that defendant smoked marijuana. She gave a factual account of the events of June 24, 2005, which were not in dispute, and complainant\u2019s parents\u2019 frantic efforts to locate her, commenting that \u201c[e]ventually they [complainant\u2019s parents] find her. She had gone to the movies with her boyfriend and saw <em>Batman </em>that day. It\u2019s now late in the evening. So the story begins.\u201d Finally, defense counsel asked the jurors to keep an open mind; reminded them that the allegations were serious; and described defendant as a dedicated and loving family man \u201cdevastated by this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The People single out defense counsel\u2019s use of the word \u201cstory,\u201d claiming that she suggested a recent fabrication by \u201cdiscuss [ing] in detail the events of [June 24, 2005] and . . . telling the jury that the \u2018story\u2019 began after the police found [complainant] that day.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fabrication may have been an obvious (indeed, the only) defense here, as is often the case where a claim of sexual abuse is contested. But we cannot say that any remarks made by defense counsel in her opening statement created a misleading impression that opened the door for the People to elicit evidence of the note in their direct case <em>(see Massie, </em>2 NY3d at 184 [\u201c(A) trial court should decide \u2018door-opening\u2019 issues in its discretion, by considering whether, and to what extent, the evidence or argument said to open the door is incomplete and misleading, and what if any otherwise inadmissible evidence is reasonably necessary to correct the misleading impression\u201d]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-1\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\n<em>Parada</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">To the extent that defendant now asserts that disclosure to a child can never constitute a prompt outcry, he did not raise such a claim at trial; he argued only that complainant\u2019s statement to her cousin was not sufficiently prompt. In any event, we see no reason to disallow prompt outcry testimony where a child victim discloses sexual abuse to a peer <em>(see People v Aguirre, </em>262 AD2d 175 [1st Dept 1999] [child disclosed to her best friend]). And complainant told her cousin of the abuse a few weeks after defendant anally sodomized her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Importantly, as the Appellate Division noted, complainant made this disclosure before the sexual abuse ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Finally, the admission of complainant\u2019s disclosures to her aunt was harmless error. True, this case rested on the testimony of an 11-year-old witness who was recounting events that had occurred several years in the past. But complainant described the events in age-appropriate terms and provided details that she could not have gleaned from watching television or movies, as defense counsel suggested. She had no motive to implicate defendant. And while he repeatedly describes complainant\u2019s testimony as \u201cvague and inconsistent,\u201d defendant never points out any specific inconsistencies. His vagueness claims boil down to complainant\u2019s uncertainty about the dates when these acts occurred \u2014 hardly surprising given that the abuse occurred over the course of two years and involved a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, to the extent preserved, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Accordingly, the orders of the Appellate Division in <em>People v Parada </em>and <em>People v Rosario </em>should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b587-9\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACDc\">(dissenting in <em>People v Rosario </em>and concurring in <em>People v Parada). </em>In each of these cases, defendant was convicted of sexually abusing a young girl. In each case, a long time passed before the abuse was reported to the authorities. Evidence was admitted in each case showing that, during that time, the victim confided the secret to someone: the victim in <em>Rosario </em>told her boyfriend, and the victim in <em>Parada </em>told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>aunt. The majority holds that it was error to admit the evidence of these disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">I disagree. I admit that neither disclosure qualifies as a \u201cprompt outcry,\u201d according to the nineteenth century rule that our cases have followed to date. But I believe that the limits of that rule have become obsolete. The critical question in these cases is whether the victims were telling the truth or lying\u2014 and it is simply unfair, to the People and to the victims, to conceal from the jury powerful evidence that shows they were telling the truth. I would therefore adopt a broader version of the prompt outcry rule, permitting the jury to know of any disclosure made by the victim about the crime before the crime was reported to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Applying that rule, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division in <em>People v Rosario </em>and reinstate the conviction; in <em>People v Parada, </em>I would hold that there was no error in admitting the evidence, thus making it unnecessary to reach the question of harmless error. In <em>Rosario, </em>I also vote to reverse for another reason: I believe the evidence was properly admitted under the recent fabrication exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The People, as well as those accused of crimes, are entitled to a fair trial. I think it important to understand just how unfair the trials in these two cases would have been without the evidence that the majority holds should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">In <em>Rosario, </em>the unfairness is particularly stark. Without the evidence that is in dispute, the jury would have known only that the victim reported her father\u2019s abuse to the police on the same day that she had a fight with him because he forbade her to go to the movies with her boyfriend. Any fairminded juror considering these facts would have to recognize the possibility that the accusation was invented in anger \u2014 and thus might well have a reasonable doubt that the accusation was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">But a juror who voted to acquit for that reason would have been grossly misled. The victim made the same accusation, reluctantly and in confidence, in a note to her boyfriend, a year earlier, at a time when she was actually trying to protect her father \u201ccause he\u2019s my dad n i didn\u2019t want him 2 go away.\u201d I find the note very convincing evidence that the victim was telling the truth \u2014 and conclusive evidence that she did not invent the abuse after an argument with her father a year later. There is no common sense reason for keeping this evidence from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The injustice in <em>Parada </em>is less extreme because \u2014 as the majority\u2019s harmless error finding reflects \u2014 the case against Parada was strong even without the disputed evidence. But I do not find it as hard as the majority does to imagine an acquittal if the evidence had been kept out. If that had happened, no witness except the victim\u2019s mother would have testified to having heard the victim disclose the abuse before the authorities were involved. The victim testified to the \u201cpinky promise\u201d disclosure to her cousin, but the cousin was not called as a witness. There was no forensic evidence of abuse. Defendant testified, in what seems from the transcript a straightforward and convincing way, that he had never done and never would do any of the things the victim accused him of. It seems possible to me that a juror could have thought his denial raised a reasonable doubt; that the victim and her mother might for some reason (perhaps to protect the true abuser) have concocted a false story.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">But a juror who heard the testimony of the victim\u2019s aunt would have been much less likely to harbor such a doubt. The aunt \u2014 a woman in her early 20s, with whom the victim had lived off and on \u2014 testified that she frequently observed the victim crying for no apparent reason. When the victim was 11, a month before any report to the authorities, this led to the following conversation, as the aunt recounted it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cI took [the victim] in to the living room with me, I sat down with her and I asked her what was going on, why was she crying like that, she should have no reason to be crying so much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cAt that point she told me that she had said to me before remember I had something to tell you and I didn\u2019t say anything to you. I told her yes I do remember, and she told me that the problem was that Buddy was touching me ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201cQ. When she told you that Buddy had touched her when she lived at the apartment, describe her demeanor when she told you that, her tone of voice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">\u201cA. She said it low, at the same time she was trying to still catch her breath from crying and she was just crying and she was with her head down like she wanted to took a look at me and tell me to my face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">\u201cQ. Was she still hugging you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">\u201cA. Yes, she was still hugging me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">\u201cQ. Were you hugging her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cQ. Had you ever seen her like this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cA. No, not like that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cQ. Did she ask you to keep this a secret?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Short of imagining a conspiracy of which the aunt was a member, it is hard for me to see how a jury that heard that testimony would think the victim a liar. And again, there is no common sense reason why the jury should not have heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">In general, the hearsay rule prohibits the admission into evidence of out-of-court statements to prove the truth of the matter stated. This rule applies even to prior statements of a testifying witness that are consistent with the witness\u2019s testimony. As the majority explains (majority op at 513), the reason generally given for the exclusion of prior consistent statements is that \u201can untrustworthy statement is not made more trustworthy by repetition\u201d <em>(People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d 426, 428 [1987]). While this is undoubtedly true, it is also true that jurors are smart enough to know it, and thus in most cases so-called \u201cbolstering\u201d testimony does little harm. Indeed, the most cogent objection to it seems to be that it is generally a waste of time \u2014 that it \u201chinders trial efficiency,\u201d as a law review article quoted by the majority suggests (majority op at 513).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Since the admission of prior consistent statements is rarely prejudicial, courts should be, and often are, willing to relax the rule excluding such statements when their admission will advance the efforts of a factfinder to learn the truth. The prompt outcry rule unquestionably advances those efforts. It was originally justified by the realization that jurors were likely to be suspicious of a rape victim who did not make outcry promptly. The majority quotes (majority op at 512) our explanation for the rule a century and a quarter ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">\u201cThe outrage in such a case upon a virtuous female is so great that there is a natural presumption that at the first suitable opportunity she would make disclosure of it; and she would be so far discredited if she did not make the disclosure, for the purpose of confirming her evidence where she is a witness, such disclosure may be received\u201d <em>(People v O\u2019Sullivan, </em>104 NY 481, 486 [1887]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Obviously, our understanding of the \u201cnatural\u201d reaction of a rape victim has changed since 1887. It is now well-known that, in many cases, it is difficult for the victim to report the crime or to accuse her attacker. And delayed reporting, often understandable in the case of adult victims, is even more so in the case of children abused by adults. No one, surely, would endorse today our statement in <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>that \u201c[a] disclosure in a case of rape has no legal value whatever unless it is the natural result of the horror and sense of wrong which would prompt every virtuous female to make outcry at the first suitable opportunity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 490). This change in our understanding, however, is not a reason to abandon the prompt outcry exception to the hearsay rule <em>(see People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10, 16-17 [1993]). It is a reason to expand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Remote as we are from nineteenth century visions of the natural reaction of an \u201coutraged female,\u201d the question \u201cwhy didn\u2019t she complain sooner?\u201d is still asked, and will and should continue to be asked, in trials for rape and other forms of sexual abuse. The question is asked not because there can be no good answer to it, but because anyone interested in the truth will want to know what the answer is. When part of the answer is that the victim <em>did </em>complain sooner, to a friend or relative in confidence, the jury should know it. To avoid discussion of the question \u2014 to pretend that a delay in reporting sexual abuse is totally irrelevant \u2014 would be both unfair and self-defeating, because the question will be in jurors\u2019 minds even if lawyers and witnesses do not talk about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Recognizing the importance of disclosure evidence in sexual abuse cases, a number of state courts have expanded the traditional prompt outcry rule. Massachusetts has discarded the \u201crequirement of \u2018promptness\u2019 or \u2018freshness,\u2019 \u201d finding that it \u201cno longer withstands scrutiny as a cure to the problem of juror stereotyping in cases of sexual assault\u201d <em>(Commonwealth v King, </em>445 Mass 217, 242, 834 NE2d 1175, 1197 [2005]). California has revised its law to hold that proof of an extrajudicial complaint may be admissible \u201cwhether it was made promptly after the incident or . . . at a later date\u201d <em>(People v Brown, </em>8 Cal 4th 746, 750, 883 P2d 949, 951 [1994]). And Connecticut, discarding dictum in an earlier case, has rejected the rule that a complaint must have \u201cbeen made at a \u2018natural\u2019 time\u201d <em>(State v Parris, </em>219 Conn 283, 284, 292, 592 A2d 943, 944, 948 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">I propose that we join those states in recognizing that contemporary understanding of the complexities of reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sex crimes calls for a broader exception to the hearsay rule. The rule I would adopt is a simple one: When a victim testifies to an act of rape or sexual abuse, every disclosure of the alleged crime by the victim before it was reported to the authorities should be admissible, subject of course to a trial court\u2019s normal power to exclude evidence that is repetitive, unnecessarily inflammatory or otherwise prejudicial. To me, the good that such a rule can do is obvious, and I do not see how it can do any harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\u00a1II</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Even if our prompt outcry rule is not broadened, I would reinstate Rosario\u2019s conviction, because I believe the victim\u2019s note to her boyfriend was properly admitted under the recent fabrication exception to the hearsay rule. Under that exception, when a witness\u2019s statement is attacked, directly or by inference, as a recent fabrication, a prior consistent statement made before the alleged motive to fabricate arose is admissible to rebut the attack <em>(People v McClean, </em>69 NY2d at 428).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Rosario\u2019s argument here, which the majority accepts, is essentially that the People had to wait for him to make the recent fabrication argument before they rebutted it. As a general rule, of course, the People cannot offer hearsay \u201cin anticipation of\u2019 a defense of recent fabrication, to use Supreme Court\u2019s unfortunate description of its own ruling in this case. But here, there was more than just \u201canticipation\u201d \u2014 there was certainty. As the majority seems to acknowledge (majority op at 514), a recent fabrication defense was Rosario\u2019s only real alternative to a guilty plea. The victim testified that Rosario abused her. If she was not lying, how could there be any reasonable doubt of his guilt?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Before the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting the victim\u2019s prior consistent statement, Rosario\u2019s counsel had made clear enough, though only by implication, that she would pursue the obvious and only line of defense. During voir dire, counsel suggested to prospective jurors \u201cthat sometimes a minor . . . might be motivated to make something up if she backs herself in a compromising position\u201d; and \u201cthat . . . there are issues between parents and children to the extent that a child might act out and make a false report of something.\u201d During her opening statement, defense counsel narrated in meticulous detail the events of the day the victim first complained to the police. Counsel told the jury that the victim wanted to go to the movies with her boyfriend; that her father didn\u2019t approve of her going out with a boy; that she was \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cwhining about it\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that she then left the house and did not come back; and that she was not found until late in the evening. \u201cSo the story begins,\u201d defense counsel said. She did not tell the rest of the story \u2014 she did not explicitly link the father-daughter argument to the accusation to the police that was made the same day\u2014 but she did not need to. Could there be a juror so dull-witted as to miss the point?</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Now that Rosario\u2019s conviction has been reversed, there must be a new trial. One of two things, it seems to me, must happen. Perhaps Rosario\u2019s defense counsel will argue recent fabrication plainly enough to open the door to the prior consistent statement; in that event, the second trial will in substance be a duplicate of the first, with a different jury considering the same issue on the same evidence. Or perhaps defense counsel will tiptoe through the whole second trial as successfully as she did through her opening statement at the first trial, never quite saying \u201cthe victim made all this up because she was mad at her father,\u201d but leaving the jury to draw the inference. If that is the case, the jury may acquit Rosario because it believes the victim fabricated her story in anger \u2014 though the simple, incontrovertible fact is that she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">No good purpose is served by reversing Rosario\u2019s conviction. It should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Read; Judge Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">In <em>People v </em>Rosario: Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Read; Judge Smith concurs in result in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">In <em>People v Parada: </em>Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">.

When the note was admitted into evidence in <em>Rosario, </em>defense counsel did not object that its contents were inadmissible. In any event, the note contained few details, and no descriptions of any specific alleged act of \u201csexual harrass[ment].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. In some instances, the People may seek to counter any potential juror misconception in this regard by calling an expert to explain why a victim of sexual abuse might not promptly report the crime (see <em>People v Spicola, </em>16 NY3d 441, 460-463 [2011] [expert testified about a range of behaviors observed in cases of validated child sexual abuse, some of which may seem counterintuitive to a lay person, including delayed reporting of abuse]). Judge Smith suggests that we should also expand our traditional prompt outcry rule, as several other states have done, in an effort to help the jury decide whether an alleged victim is telling the truth or lying, and would decide these cases by applying his new rule <em>(see </em>concurring/dissenting op at 516, 519). But defendants and the People disputed only whether the outcry was, in fact, sufficiently prompt under New York law; the People did not ask the trial court to broaden the rule. In a related vein, we note that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts resolved <em>Commonwealth v King </em>(445 Mass 217, 834 NE2d 1175 [2005]) on the basis of its traditional fresh complaint doctrine, which was similar, but not identical, to our prompt outcry rule. The Court sua sponte, in the exercise of its power to regulate evidentiary presentations not implicating constitutional rules, reexamined and prospectively revised its traditional fresh complaint doctrine only after soliciting and receiving numerous amicus briefs discussing whether modification or elimination was in order (445 Mass at 237 n 16, 248, 248 n 29, 834 NE2d at 1194 n 16, 1201, 1201 n 29).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">. As a matter of fact, defense counsel did not mention the police in her opening statement at all. The closest she came was mentioning that the Rosarios called \u201cthe Explorer\u2019s Program\u201d (after calling complainant\u2019s grandmother and friends and \u201cfriends involved in the afterschool program\u201d) when trying to locate their daughter on June 24, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. Judge Smith suggests that the jurors could not have been \u201cso dull-witted\u201d as to \u201cmiss the point\u201d that defense counsel was trying to make a connection between the father-daughter argument on June 24, 2005 and complainant\u2019s accusation (concurring/dissenting op at 521). But defense counsel did not relate complainant\u2019s accusation to this particular father-daughter dispute as opposed to defendant\u2019s strictness and demands of complainant in general (or, for that matter, his use of corporal punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>when she did not meet his expectations). In short, it was not obvious from defense counsel\u2019s opening statement that the note predated complainant\u2019s alleged motive to lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\">. When the prosecutor asked complainant at trial when she made the disclosure to her cousin, she answered \u201cThat was like a few weeks ago when he did this to me,\u201d apparently meaning that defendant had anally sodomized her a few weeks before the disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
