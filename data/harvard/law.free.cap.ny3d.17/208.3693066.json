We hold that the Superintendent\u2019s approval of such restructuring pursuant to his authority under the Insurance Law does not bar the policyholders from bringing these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">This appeal has its origins in the unraveling of the world\u2019s financial markets that began in 2007. As described in the complaint, plaintiffs are a group of unrelated banking and financial services institutions that hold financial guarantee insurance policies issued by defendant MBIA Insurance on their structured-finance products. In May 2009, they commenced this action against defendants MBIA Insurance, MBIA Inc., and MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois (MBIA Illinois) following the Superintendent\u2019s February 2009 approval of their application for restructuring. Plaintiffs contend that the restructuring constituted a fraudulent conveyance, which left MBIA Insurance undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Prior to the restructuring, MBIA Inc., a publicly-traded Connecticut-based corporation, provided financial guarantee insurance and other forms of credit protection to its customers worldwide. It conducted this business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA Insurance, a New York-based corporation. MBIA Illinois, an essentially-dormant, Illinois-domiciled corporation, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBIA Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">As a monoline insurer, MBIA Insurance \u201cexclusively wrote financial guarantee insurance policies and did not offer property, casualty, life, disability or other forms of insurance.\u201d Under the terms of its policies, MBIA Insurance promised to pay its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>policyholders if an obligor on a covered instrument defaulted. Historically, MBIA Insurance had underwritten policies that covered municipal bonds and other types of securities issued by governmental entities. However, in response to market trends, MBIA started offering guarantee insurance related to structured-finance products. Structured-finance products, which include mortgage-backed securities, are \u201cobligations payable from or tied to the performance of pools of assets.\u201d Notably, by the end of 2008, MBIA Insurance had a portfolio of policies with a face amount of $786.7 billion. Approximately one third of MBIA Insurance\u2019s portfolio consisted of structured-finance policies ($233 billion in face amount); the remaining two thirds consisted of municipal bond policies ($553.7 billion in face amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Beginning in 2007 and continuing through 2008, the health of the real estate market deteriorated. In turn, the risks associated with certain financial products tied to real estate, such as structured-finance products, increased concomitantly. Not surprisingly, MBIA Insurance\u2019s exposure to liability with respect to its structured-finance policy portfolio grew exponentially as the real estate market crumbled during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In 2008, MBIA Inc. responded to this crisis in a number of ways. On February 25, 2008, it publicly \u201cannounced] that it would establish \u2018separate legal operating entities for MBIA\u2019s public, structured, and asset management businesses\u2019 within five years.\u201d At the same time, MBIA Inc. suspended the issuance of new structured-finance guarantee policies. In May 2008, MBIA Inc. also considered infusing $900 million of its own cash into its subsidiaries \u201cin order to \u2018support MBIA Insurance[\u2019s] triple-A ratings and existing and future policyholders.\u2019 \u201d Despite these efforts to curb the negative effects of the downturn in the real estate market, in early June 2008, both Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody\u2019s) and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Rating Services downgraded MBIA Insurance\u2019s creditworthiness. MBIA Inc., as a result, opted not to invest its own cash into its subsidiaries, but instead decided to pursue its plan to segregate its municipal bond portfolio from its structured-finance portfolio, which it feared was turning toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Under the Insurance Law, many aspects of this plan required approval or nondisapproval by the Superintendent. To that end, on December 5, 2008, MBIA Insurance, on behalf of itself and the other defendants, submitted an ex parte application to the Superintendent, detailing a series of proposed transactions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>would effectuate their desired goals. MBIA Insurance supplemented and amended its application several times in the ensuing two months. Defendants requested approval of the following transactions in order to separate their two sets of portfolios. First, MBIA Insurance would declare and distribute a $1,147 billion dividend to MBIA Inc. Second, MBIA Insurance would redeem and retire roughly one third of its capital stock from MBIA Inc. and in exchange would give MBIA Inc. approximately $938 million more in cash and securities, as well as all of the issued and outstanding stock of MBIA Illinois. Third, MBIA Inc. would transfer the cash it received from the dividend distribution and the cash, securities and MBIA Illinois stock it received in connection with the stock redemption to MuniCo Holdings Inc. (MuniCo), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBIA Inc. Fourth, MuniCo would capitalize MBIA Illinois, no longer a subsidiary of MBIA Insurance, by contributing $2,085 billion it received in these asset transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Finally, following the capitalization of MBIA Illinois, MBIA Insurance further proposed that it and MBIA Illinois would enter into a series of transactions pursuant to which MBIA Illinois would \u201creinsure, on a cut-through basis, those financial guaranty insurance policies sold or reinsured by MBIA [Insurance].\u201d Such an arrangement would allow the municipal bond policyholders to submit claims directly to MBIA Illinois as well as MBIA Insurance. In exchange, MBIA Insurance would remit about $3.66 billion to MBIA Illinois, most of which represented \u201cthe net unearned premium reserve . . . associated with\u201d the municipal bond policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">By letter dated February 17, 2009, the Superintendent granted each of the approvals requested by MBIA Insurance (the Transformation). The approval letter stated that the Transformation was fair to structured-finance policyholders, noting that MBIA Insurance would \u201ccontinue to pay all valid claims in a timely fashion.\u201d No notice or opportunity to be heard was given to the policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Specifically, the Superintendent approved the proposed dividend payment made by MBIA Insurance to MBIA Inc. under Insurance Law \u00a7 4105 (a), which requires a determination that MBIA Insurance would \u201cretain sufficient surplus to support its obligations and writings.\u201d Next, the Superintendent approved the proposed stock redemption, concluding under Insurance Law \u00a7 1411 (d) that it was \u201creasonable and equitable.\u201d Finally, with respect to the proposed reinsurance transaction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Superintendent did not disapprove, concluding that it comported with statutory factors enunciated in Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 1308, 1505 and 6906. In his letter, the Superintendent stressed a number of times that his approvals and nondisapprovals were based on \u201cthe representations contained in the [application [by MBIA Insurance] and its supporting submissions, and in reliance on the truth of those representations and submissions.\u201d Following the Superintendent\u2019s issuance of its approval/ nondisapproval letter, defendants consummated the Transformation, which was given retroactive effect to January 1, 2009. The very next day, MBIA Inc. publicly announced that it had succeeded in segregating its municipal bond policy portfolio from its structured-finance policy portfolio by restructuring its principal insurance subsidiary, MBIA Insurance. MBIA Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer emphasized in a letter to shareholders that the Transformation provided the holding company \u201cwith much needed clean capacity for new municipal bond business.\u201d On February 18, 2009, the Superintendent issued his own public statement, announcing that he had overseen \u201ca transformation of [MBIA Insurance] that effectively splits that company in two, dividing its assets and liabilities between two highly capitalized insurance companies.\u201d Despite the Superintendent\u2019s public endorsement of the restructuring, Moody\u2019s further downgraded MBIA Insurance\u2019s credit rating to B3, six steps below investment grade and three steps above \u201cjunk.\u201d One of the primary reasons Moody\u2019s cited for its downgrade of MBIA Insurance was the \u201csubstantial reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In May 2009, plaintiffs commenced this action in Supreme Court alleging fraudulent conveyances under New York\u2019s Debtor and Creditor Law, breach of contract, abuse of the corporate form, and unjust enrichment. \u201c[A]midst an ongoing financial crisis,\u201d plaintiffs allege that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201c[i]n an unlawful attempt to escape MBIA Insurance\u2019s coverage obligations to [p]laintiffs and other policyholders, [defendants executed a series of fraudulent conveyances, in breach of MBIA Insurance\u2019s contracts, to transfer MBIA Insurance assets into MBIA Illinois \u2014 an entity that [defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>structured to be free from liabilities or other obligations to [p]laintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Plaintiffs specifically allege that \u201c [defendants [fraudulently] stripped approximately $5 billion in cash and securities out of MBIA Insurance\u201d and that MBIA Insurance received no consideration for the assets it transferred. They further allege that the fraudulent conveyances have exposed them to potentially billions of dollars in losses since MBIA Insurance is now woefully undercapitalized and insolvent. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that MBIA Inc. abused the corporate form by causing MBIA Insurance to engage in these unfair transactions in order to shield assets away from plaintiffs. Plaintiffs seek to set aside the allegedly fraudulent transfer or, in the alternative, a declaration that defendants shall be jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs under plaintiffs\u2019 insurance policies, or an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on June 9, 2009. Their principal basis for dismissal is that plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this plenary proceeding are impermissible \u201ccollateral attacks\u201d on the Superintendent\u2019s approval of the Transformation, which can only be challenged in a CPLR article 78 proceeding. Defendants also contend that the complaint fails to state cognizable causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On June 15, 2009 \u2014 six days after defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and within the four-month statute of limitations period \u2014 plaintiffs separately filed an article 78 proceeding in Supreme Court, assigned to the same Justice handling the plenary action, challenging the Superintendent\u2019s 2009 approval/ nondisapproval of the Transformation. Plaintiffs assert in that proceeding that the Superintendent acted arbitrarily and capriciously and abused his discretion. For relief, plaintiffs seek an annulment of the Superintendent\u2019s determination and a declaration that the transactions approved by the Superintendent in connection with the Transformation are null and void. The article 78 proceeding remains pending while the parties conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">In a written decision, Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion seeking dismissal of the complaint <em>(ABN Amro Bank N.V. v MBIA Inc., </em>26 Misc 3d 1223[A], 2010 NY Slip Op 50238[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2010]). The court rejected defendants\u2019 \u201ccollateral attack\u201d argument, noting that plaintiffs were not seeking a determination from the court that the Superintendent incorrectly applied New York\u2019s Insurance Law (2010 NY Slip Op <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>50238[U] at *16). Rather, Supreme Court held, the \u201cmere fact that there was earlier approval of the . . . restructuring by the Insurance Department does not immunize defendants from subsequent statutory and common law claims\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *13). In so holding, the court observed that \u201c[t]he Superintendent was not called upon to examine whether defendants intended to defraud policyholders\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *15). Supreme Court then evaluated the legal sufficiency of the complaint and found that plaintiffs adequately pleaded causes of action under the Debtor and Creditor Law <em>(see id. </em>at *18). It also concluded that plaintiffs adequately stated claims for breach of contract premised on a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, abuse of the corporate form allowing for a declaratory judgment piercing the corporate veil of MBIA Insurance, and unjust enrichment <em>(see id. </em>at *18-19).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting in part, reversed and granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint <em>(ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. v MBIA Inc., </em>81 AD3d 237, 248 [1st Dept 2011]). The majority construed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as a \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on the Superintendent\u2019s authorization of the Transformation. Citing its decision in <em>Fiala v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(6 AD3d 320 [1st Dept 2004]), the majority held that \u201c[a] plenary action that seeks the overturn of the Superintendent\u2019s determination, or challenges matters that the determination necessarily encompasses, constitutes an impermissible indirect challenge to that determination\u201d (81 AD3d at 246 [internal quotation marks omitted]). As a result, the majority opined that an article 78 proceeding challenging the Superintendent\u2019s determination is the only remedy available to the plaintiffs <em>(see id. </em>at 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The majority also held that, in any event, plaintiffs\u2019 three common-law claims failed to state causes of action. Specifically, the majority noted that plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and piercing of the corporate veil claims should have been dismissed on the ground that plaintiffs fail to allege a default on payments owed to them under their policies <em>(see id. </em>at 244-245). The majority found that \u201c[pjlaintiffs also fail to allege particularized statements detailing fraud or other corporate misconduct that would warrant piercing the corporate veil\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 245). Finally, the majority concluded that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for unjust enrichment because they did not allege that \u201cMBIA Insurance has conferred some benefit upon MBIA Inc. and MBIA Illinois at plaintiffs\u2019 expense\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The two dissenting Justices agreed with the majority that plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment cause of action should have been dismissed, but would have otherwise affirmed the order of Supreme Court <em>(see id. </em>at 253 [Abdus-Salaam, J., dissenting in part]). The dissent rejected the notion that an article 78 proceeding is the sole remedy available to plaintiffs here <em>(see id. </em>at 252-253). The dissenting Justices reasoned that the Superintendent\u2019s decision did not have a preclusive effect on plaintiffs\u2019 right to assert claims against defendants because, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Fiala </em>and the other cases cited by the majority, plaintiffs here had no \u201copportunity to be heard or otherwise provide input regarding the determination\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 253).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Furthermore, the dissent concluded that plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for breach of contract, under a theory that defendants breached an implied covenant of good faith, where they allege that defendants \u201csubstantially reducfed] the likelihood that MBIA Insurance [would] be able to pay its policyholders,\u201d thereby \u201cinjuring the right of plaintiffs to receive the fruits of the contract\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 254 [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). Finally, the dissent concluded that plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded their claim for a declaratory judgment and piercing of the corporate veil, observing that plaintiffs allege that MBIA Inc. abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form by causing MBIA Insurance to make fraudulent conveyances for no value <em>(see id. </em>at 254-255).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Plaintiffs appeal as of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a) and we now modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Defendants have consistently maintained that plaintiffs\u2019 plenary claims under the Debtor and Creditor Law and the common law constitute an \u201cimpermissible collateral attack\u201d on the Superintendent\u2019s approval of the Transformation. To support their position, defendants do not argue that plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from commencing a proceeding in Supreme Court following the Superintendent\u2019s determination. Rather, defendants contend on this appeal that the Insurance Law vests the Superintendent with \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 claims that may only be challenged through an. article 78 proceeding. For the reasons that follow, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">It is fundamental that \u201cArticle VI, \u00a7 7 of the NY Constitution establishes the Supreme Court as a court of \u2018general original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>jurisdiction in law and equity\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sohn v Calderon, </em>78 NY2d 755, 766 [1991], quoting NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 7 [a]). \u201cUnder this grant of authority, the Supreme Court \u2018is competent to entertain all causes of action unless its jurisdiction has been specifically proscribed\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Thrasher v United States Liab. Ins. Co., </em>19 NY2d 159, 166 [1967]). Indeed, \u201cit has never been suggested that every claim or dispute arising under a legislatively created scheme may be brought to the Supreme Court for original adjudication\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Thus, \u201cthe constitutionally protected jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not prohibit the Legislature from conferring exclusive original jurisdiction upon an agency in connection with the administration of a statutory regulatory program\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We applied these principles in <em>Sohn </em>and held the agency in question there, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), had exclusive original jurisdiction to resolve a dispute concerning a landlord\u2019s entitlement to demolish a rent-regulated building <em>(see id. </em>at 767-768). In analyzing the statute governing DHCR\u2019s authority, Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 26-408, we observed that it was \u201cbeyond question that the Legislature intended\u201d such disputes \u201cto be adjudicated by the DHCR\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 765-766). Thus, we concluded that the statutory scheme proscribed the landlord in that case from circumventing DHCR\u2019s authority and commencing an action in Supreme Court seeking a declaration that was within DHCR\u2019s exclusive purview <em>(see id. </em>at 767-768). We noted that the landlord, of course, could later challenge a determination made by DHCR by way of an article 78 proceeding <em>(see id. </em>at 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Richards v Kaskel </em>(32 NY2d 524 [1973]), we held that section 352-e of the General Business Law, which vests the Attorney General with exclusive jurisdiction to approve a cooperative building conversion plan, did not preclude the plaintiffs, tenants of a rent-stabilized apartment complex, from commencing a private lawsuit alleging that their landlord engaged in fraudulent misconduct in connection with such a plan <em>(see id. </em>at 535). There, we observed that section 352-e authorized the Attorney General \u201cto consider the sufficiency of the language and content of the [cooperative conversion] plan [and to determine] that the plan . . . complied with the disclosure requirements of the statute\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 535 n 5). Given the limited scope of the Attorney General\u2019s adjudicatory authority under this section of the General Business Law, we concluded that the Legislature did not \u201cintend[ ] to deprive the court of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>traditional equitable jurisdiction to consider claims of illegality on the part of the sponsor apart from noncompliance with that provision\u201d <em>(id.; see also McGee v Lepow, </em>82 AD2d 746, 747 [1st Dept 1981], <em>appeal dismissed </em>54 NY2d 1027 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In this case, defendants essentially ask us to construe the Superintendent\u2019s exclusive original jurisdiction to approve the Transformation under the relevant provisions of the Insurance Law to mean that he is also the exclusive arbiter of all private claims that may arise in connection with the Transformation\u2014 including claims that the restructuring rendered MBIA Insurance insolvent and was unfair to its policyholders. Defendants\u2019 contention, taken to its logical conclusion, would preempt plaintiffs\u2019 Debtor and Creditor Law and common-law claims. We reject this argument and conclude that there is no indication from the statutory language and structure of the Insurance Law or its legislative history that the Legislature intended to give the Superintendent such broad preemptive power <em>(see Matter of Zuckerman v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>44 NY2d 336, 342-343 [1978] [\u201cAlthough (the Public Employment Relations Board [PERB]) has exclusive jurisdiction of labor disputes between public employers and public employees involving the right to organize and the right to negotiate in good faith, this jurisdiction does not mean that any and all disputes between such parties fall exclusively to PERB. PERB\u2019s jurisdiction encompasses only those matters specifically covered by the Taylor Law\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">If the Legislature actually intended the Superintendent to extinguish the historic rights of policyholders to attack fraudulent transactions under the Debtor and Creditor Law or the common law, we would expect to see evidence of such intent within the statute. Moreover, we would expect that, in such a situation, affected policyholders, such as plaintiffs, would have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Superintendent made his determinations. Here, we find no such intent in the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor do we see a provision that required the Superintendent to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard to plaintiffs before he approved the Transformation <em>(cf. Shah v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>2003 NY Slip Op 50591[U], *26 [Sup Ct, NY County 2003] <em>[affd in part by Fiala, </em>6 AD3d at 321-322] [in the context of an Insurance Law article 73 demutualization, following the required statutory notice and an opportunity to be heard by the policyholders, \u201c(t)he (L)egislature expressly placed the determination as to whether a plan of reorganization complied with the statute and was fair and equitable to policyholders in the (exclusive jurisdiction) of the Superintendent\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Defendants nonetheless look to Insurance Law \u00a7 326 (a) as a provision conferring exclusive authority on the Superintendent to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 private claims. Defendants\u2019 reliance on such provision, however, is entirely misplaced. That statute, as pertinent here states that \u201cany order, regulation or decision of the [Superintendent is declared to be subject to judicial review in a proceeding under article [78] of the civil practice law and rules.\u201d A cursory reading of the plain language reveals that it does not vest the Superintendent with the power to consider causes of action such as plaintiffs\u2019. Rather, the statute merely provides that the Superintendent\u2019s decisions \u2014 which derive from legislatively designated authority under the Insurance Law \u2014 are subject to review in an article 78 proceeding (see <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v State of New York, </em>33 AD2d 127, 128 [3d Dept 1969], <em>affd </em>28 NY2d 561 [1971] [\u201cit is clear from the legislative history that (Insurance Law \u00a7 326) was written in its present form to insure that all and not just some of the determinations made by the (Superintendent) were reviewable by an article 78 proceeding\u201d]). The Superintendent\u2019s determinations, however, have never included the adjudication of claims like those plaintiffs have put forward in this action. Nor can these claims be properly raised and adjudicated in an article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Because we perceive no basis to conclude that the Legislature divested Supreme Court of its general jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 Debtor and Creditor Law and common-law claims, explicitly through the Insurance Law or otherwise, we next turn to the preclusive effect, if any, of the Superintendent\u2019s approval of the Transformation on this plenary action. Such an inquiry requires an analysis of administrative collateral estoppel principles. At the outset, however, we observe that defendants correctly concede that collateral estoppel does not apply here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>While our inquiry would normally end with such a concession, a discussion is necessary here as the so-called \u201ccollateral attack doctrine\u201d does not exist apart from the doctrines of exclusive original jurisdiction and administrative collateral estoppel principles. And there is good reason for this. The recognized doctrines, as they exist in New York, build in protections of notice and opportunity to be heard for affected constituencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel (or issue preclusion) is rooted in principles of fairness. It is well settled that the doctrine \u201cmay be invoked in a subsequent action or proceeding to prevent a party from relitigating an [identical] issue decided against that party in a prior adjudication\u201d <em>(Staatsburg Water Co. v Staatsburg Fire Dist., </em>72 NY2d 147, 152 [1988]). In <em>Capital Tel. Co. v Pattersonville Tel. Co. </em>(56 NY2d 11 [1982]), we reaffirmed the principle that collateral estoppel applies to an administrative proceeding <em>(id. </em>at 17). In the context of administrative agency determinations, we have recognized that the doctrine of collateral estoppel \u201cis applied more flexibly, and additional factors must be considered by the court\u201d <em>(Allied Chem. v Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>72 NY2d 271, 276 [1988]). \u201cThese additional requirements are often summed up in the beguilingly simple prerequisite that the administrative decision be \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 in character\u201d <em>(id., citing Ryan v New York Tel. Co., </em>62 NY2d 494, 500 [1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">An administrative decision is quasi-judicial in character when it is \u201c \u2018 \u201crendered pursuant to the adjudicatory authority of an agency to decide cases brought before its tribunals employing procedures substantially similar to those used in a court of law\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Jason B. v Novello, </em>12 NY3d 107, 113 [2009], quoting <em>Ryan, </em>62 NY2d at 499). Thus, for collateral estoppel to be triggered, not only must the identity of the issue decided in the prior action or proceeding have been the same, but also \u201cthere must have been a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling\u201d <em>(Gilberg v Barbieri, </em>53 NY2d 285, 291 [1981], quoting <em>Schwartz v Public Adm\u2019r of County of Bronx, </em>24 NY2d 65, 71 [1969]; <em>see also Capital Tel. Co., </em>56 NY2d at 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Here, even assuming the issues considered by the Superintendent in approving the Transformation are identical to the issues raised by plaintiffs in their plenary action (which they are not), plaintiffs had no opportunity to contest the Superintendent\u2019s determination or, more importantly, challenge the validity of the financial information provided to him by defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>which formed the basis of the Superintendent\u2019s approval. The record is indisputable on this point. MBIA Insurance submitted a private application to the Superintendent. The Superintendent did not conduct public hearings or provide public notice before rendering his determination. Crucially, the Superintendent accepted the truth of defendants\u2019 submissions <em>(cf. Shah, </em>2003 NY Slip Op 50591[U] at *12-13, <em>affd in part by Fiala, </em>6 AD3d at 321 [plenary lawsuit dismissed as a collateral attack on the Superintendent\u2019s decision to approve a demutualization of an insurance company where public hearings were held and plaintiff had notice and opportunity to be heard]). Simply put, there was nothing \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d about the Superintendent\u2019s approval process that ought to be binding on plaintiffs in this case <em>(see Staatsburg Water Co., </em>72 NY2d at 154 [even where party had an opportunity to participate in a prior proceeding, such proceeding is not quasi-judicial, and therefore not binding, where party\u2019s participation \u201cdid not necessarily amount to a full and fair opportunity to contest the determination\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">That the Superintendent complied with lawful administrative procedure, in that the Insurance Law did not impose a requirement that he provide plaintiffs notice before issuing his determination, does not alter our analysis. To hold otherwise would infringe upon plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to due process. Indeed, as we stated in <em>Gilberg, </em>\u201c[d]ue process, of course, would not permit a litigant to be bound by an adverse determination made in a prior proceeding to which he was not a party or in privity with a party\u201d (53 NY2d at 291; <em>see also Phillips Petroleum Co. v Shutts, </em>472 US 797, 811-812 [1985] [a party cannot be bound by a prior proceeding without \u201cminimum procedural due process protection,\u201d including \u201cnotice plus an opportunity to be heard and participate in the litigation\u201d]). Clearly plaintiffs here were not in privity with the Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Satisfied that the Superintendent\u2019s approval of the Transformation does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 independent plenary action, we address the sufficiency of the pleadings. Our standard of review is well familiar: \u201cOn a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211, the pleading is to be afforded a liberal construction\u201d <em>(Leon v Martinez, </em>84 NY2d 83, 87 [1994]; <em>see </em>CPLR 3026). Courts must \u201caccept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\u201d <em>(Leon, </em>84 NY2d at 87-88).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We conclude that plaintiffs adequately pleaded causes of action under the Debtor and Creditor Law. Plaintiffs premise their first claim on Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 273, which requires them to allege that MBIA Insurance fraudulently made \u201cconveyance^]\u201d that rendered it \u201cinsolvent\u201d because it did not receive \u201cfair consideration\u201d for such conveyances. They base their second claim on Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 274, which similarly requires plaintiffs to allege that MBIA Insurance fraudulently made \u201cconveyance[s] . . . without fair consideration,\u201d which left it with \u201cunreasonably small capital.\u201d Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 276 forms the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action. That statute requires plaintiffs to allege that defendants made conveyances and incurred obligations with the intent \u201cto hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Plaintiffs, who are undoubtedly creditors of MBIA Insurance, support all of these claims by describing a series of allegedly fraudulent transactions made in bad faith by defendants after the Superintendent\u2019s approval of the Transformation, in which they ultimately assert defendants \u201cstripped approximately $5 billion in cash and securities out of MBIA Insurance.\u201d Further, plaintiffs allege that MBIA Insurance received no consideration for the assets it transferred to MBIA Inc. As a result, plaintiffs allege that MBIA Insurance is insolvent and unable to meet its obligations under the terms of their policies. These allegations clearly support causes of action under sections 273 and 274 of the Debtor and Creditor Law. Moreover, these allegations, taken together and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs, as we must at this stage of the litigation, sufficiently allege an intent on the part of defendants to defraud plaintiffs under section 276 <em>(see Dempster v Overview Equities, </em>4 AD3d 495, 498 [2d Dept 2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Turning to plaintiffs\u2019 common-law claims, we likewise conclude that plaintiffs pleaded a viable cause of action for breach of contract based upon a breach of the implied covenant of good faith. Of course, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u201cembraces a pledge that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract\u201d <em>(Dalton v Educational Testing Serv., </em>87 NY2d 384, 389 [1995] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Here, plaintiffs sufficiently allege that MBIA Insurance, by fraudulently transferring billions of dollars of its assets to MBIA Inc. for no consideration, \u201cviolated the covenant by substantially reducing the likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that [it] will be able\u201d to meet its obligations under the terms of the insurance policies <em>(ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., </em>81 AD3d at 254 [Abdus-Salaam, J., dissenting in part]; <em>see also MBIA Ins.

As the Appellate Division dissent appropriately observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c \u2018[t]he party seeking to pierce the corporate veil must establish that the owners, through their domination, abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against that party such that a court in equity will intervene\u2019 <em>(Matter of Morris v New York State Dept. of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>82 NY2d 135, 142 [1993])\u201d (81 AD3d at 255).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In that regard, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that MBIA Inc. abused its control of its wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA Insurance, by causing it to engage in harmful transactions that now shield billions of dollars in assets from plaintiffs and expose them to significant liability meet this test <em>(cf. East Hampton Union Free School Dist. v Sandpebble Bldrs., Inc., </em>16 NY3d 775, 776 [2011] [piercing the corporate veil claim properly dismissed where plaintiff failed to allege any harm purportedly resulting from an abuse or perversion of the corporate form]).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Finally, we agree with the Appellate Division that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for unjust enrichment should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion, and as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">.

Contrary to the dissent, plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that the allegedly fraudulent transactions rendered MBIA Insurance insolvent and unable to meet payments under the terms of the policies, as pleaded in their complaint, can very well be considered \u201cobjectively measurable deviations from specific contract provisions\u201d (dissenting op at 235).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b301-10\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A40\">(dissenting). Plaintiffs seek relief in this plenary action brought pursuant to the Debtor and Creditor Law and common law that, if granted, would annul the decision made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the Superintendent of Insurance on February 17, 2009 to approve the restructuring of MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA Insurance) and related subsidiaries and affiliates by unwinding the underlying transactions. Whether or not this lawsuit is called, in the coinage of the First Department, a \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on the Superintendent\u2019s approval (81 AD3d 237, 240 [2011]), the fact remains that the Legislature has confined any challenge to the propriety of the restructuring to a CPLR article 78 proceeding. This is so because the Insurance Law has preempted plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and common-law causes of action, which are all grounded in the notion that the restructuring sanctioned by the Superintendent caused MBIA Insurance to be insufficiently capitalized to the detriment of its structured-finance policyholders. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">New York law has historically vested the Superintendent with broad authority to regulate the insurance industry <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 201 [\u201cThe superintendent shall possess the rights, powers, and duties, in connection with the business of insurance in this state, expressed or reasonably implied by this chapter or any other applicable law of this state\u201d]). As particularly relevant to this lawsuit, he is responsible for making sure that insurance companies possess sufficient reserves to pay all their claims <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1303), even in the face of \u201cexcessive losses occurring during adverse economic cycles\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 6903 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The regulatory regime in the Insurance Law embraces both advance approval of certain transactions that may affect an insurer\u2019s viability, and post-transaction supervision of the insurer\u2019s financial condition. Further, most significant transactions between insurers in a holding company system (as happened with the restructuring) require the Superintendent\u2019s prior approval that the terms of the transaction are \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d and his consideration of whether the transaction may \u201cadversely affect the interests of policyholders\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 1505 [a] [1]; [e]). Thus, the Superintendent reviews any proposed dividend distribution exceeding certain thresholds to make certain that paying it will leave the insurer with sufficient assets to satisfy all outstanding claims <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 4105 [a]). Similarly, he reviews proposed stock redemption plans in advance to ensure that they are \u201creasonable and equitable\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 1411 [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In addition to his prior approval of insurance transactions, the Superintendent also continually monitors domestic insurers\u2019 financial health through periodic examinations <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 309-310) and reviews of insurers\u2019 annually filed financial statements and reports <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 307). If as part of his review the Superintendent determines that an insurer lacks sufficient reserves \u2014 i.e., if it \u201cis unable to pay its outstanding lawful obligations as they mature in the regular course of business\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 1309 [a]) \u2014 the Superintendent has the exclusive authority to place the insurer into specialized liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings under article 74 of the Insurance Law <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 7402 [a], [e]). Article 74 authorizes him to avoid \u201c[a]ny transfer of . . . the property of an insurer . . . with the intent of giving to any creditor or enabling him to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other creditor of the same class\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 7425 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Superintendent acted to carry out his responsibilities under the Insurance Law\u2019s comprehensive regulatory regime when he approved the dividend payment and stock redemption, and did not disapprove the reinsurance transaction, the individual components of the restructuring proposed by MBIA Insurance. Although the majority notes that the Superintendent \u201cstressed a number of times that his approvals and non-disapproval[ ] were based on \u2018the representations made in the [application [by MBIA Insurance] and its supporting submissions, and in reliance on the truth of those representations and submissions\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 219), he equally emphasized that his decisionmaking was informed by \u201cthe Department\u2019s examination of the MBIA Entities\u2019 financial condition prior to\u201d the restructuring, and \u201cthe Department\u2019s analysis of the MBIA Entities\u2019 financial condition after the effectuation of\u201d the restructuring. The approval, a complex 10-page document, also imposed various conditions on MBIA Insurance and/or its related affiliates and subsidiaries. In short, the Superintendent issued the approval only after a multimonth investigation of MBIA Insurance\u2019s finances, which encompassed the review of voluminous raw financial data and the running of \u201csuper-stressed or break-the-bank\u201d tests by experts within the Department. He was not simply a passive recipient of information from MBIA Insurance, power<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>less to verify that company\u2019s representations and dependent on its good graces, as the majority implies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\u201cThe Legislature may expressly state its intent to preempt, <em>or that intent may be implied from the nature of the subject matter being regulated as well as the scope and purpose of the state legislative scheme ... A comprehensive and detailed statutory scheme </em>may be evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to preempt\u201d <em>(Matter of Cohen v Board of Appeals of Vil. of Saddle Rock, </em>100 NY2d 395, 400 [2003] [emphases added] [state law governing review of area variances preempted contrary local law]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As already noted, the Insurance Law vests broad powers in the Superintendent to regulate New York\u2019s insurance industry. More to the point, he is directed to ensure that precisely the kinds of transactions at issue in this case are carried out fairly and equitably, and leave the affected insurers with sufficient assets to satisfy their obligations to policyholders. The particular provisions of the \u201clegislative scheme\u201d relevant here, briefly described earlier, could hardly be more \u201ccomprehensive and detailed.\u201d Concomitantly, the Superintendent considered the precise issues disputed by plaintiffs in this lawsuit when he approved the restructuring. In other words, plaintiffs\u2019 plenary action not only expressly seeks to undo the restructuring, but does so by contesting the findings underpinning the Superintendent\u2019s approval. There is essentially no daylight between the causes of action asserted by plaintiffs and the substance of the Superintendent\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">For example, just as Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 274\u2019s prohibition on transfers that leave companies with \u201cunreasonably small capital\u201d is intended to keep companies sufficiently capitalized to \u201csustain operations\u201d <em>(Moody v Security Pac. Bus. Credit, Inc., </em>971 F2d 1056, 1069, 1070 [3d Cir 1992]), so the Superintendent\u2019s supervision of reserves is intended to ensure that insurance companies can continue to operate by maintaining their ability to pay claims <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1309 [a]). Similarly, Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 276\u2019s prohibition on transfers that may \u201chinder [or] delay . . . either present or future\u201d policyholders is essentially equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the requirement that the Superintendent must determine that a transaction is \u201creasonable and equitable\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 1411 [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">And in any event, the critical question is whether <em>\u201cthe thrust </em>of [plaintiffs\u2019] complaint\u201d goes to matters already determined by an expert agency that has been delegated the primary authority to resolve such issues <em>(Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., </em>379 US 411, 417 [1965] [emphasis added]). There need not be exact correspondence. And here, \u201cthe thrust\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the restructuring caused MBIA Insurance to be insufficiently capitalized to the detriment of its structured-finance policyholders. The Superintendent\u2019s approval of the restructuring was premised on his determination that this was not the case. Put another way, plaintiffs assert that the restructuring stripped MBIA Insurance of needed reserves whereas the Superintendent concluded that the restructuring left the insurer in sound financial condition, a prerequisite to his approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The majority seems to suggest that if the Legislature \u201cactually intended the Superintendent to extinguish the historic rights of policyholders to attack fraudulent transactions under the Debtor and Creditor Law or the common law, we would expect to see evidence of such intent within the statute\u201d; and \u201cwe would expect that . . . affected policyholders . . . would have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Superintendent made his determinations\u201d (majority op at 224). As for the first proposition, we have, as already discussed, long held that preemption need not be express where the legislative regime is comprehensive and detailed. Most recently, for example, we held in <em>People v Grasso </em>(11 NY3d 64 [2008]) that the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law preempted certain common-law claims pressed by the Attorney General. There was no express language in the statute to this effect. And I am not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>aware that we have ever considered the scope of an agency\u2019s notice and hearing provisions to be relevant to preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In my view, plaintiffs\u2019 common-law causes of action are also preempted because they are simply artfully repackaged versions of the Debtor and Creditor Law claims. In any event, these causes of action are deficient on the merits, as the Appellate Division majority correctly concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The majority reinstates plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim, locating the breach within the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because \u201cplaintiffs sufficiently allege that MBIA Insurance, by fraudulently transferring billions of dollars in assets to MBIA Inc. for no consideration, violated the covenant by substantially reducing the likelihood that [it] will be able to meet its obligations under the terms of the insurance policies\u201d (majority op at 228-229 [internal quotation marks omitted]). For support, the majority cites <em>MBIA Ins. Corp. v Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. </em>(2009 NY Slip Op 31527[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Countrywide underwrote and sold residential mortgage-backed securities and obtained financial guarantee insurance on those securities from MBIA Insurance. To get MBIA Insurance to sign on, Countrywide represented that if there was \u201ca breach of any representation or warranty related to a mortgage loan (a \u2018Defective Loan\u2019), it would either cure the breach or repurchase or substitute eligible mortgage loans for the Defective Loan\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *5). The ultimate insurance between Countrywide and MBIA Insurance, in contrast to this case, \u201cincorporated the representations and warranties . . . and gave MBIA [Insurance] the right to rely on these representations and warranties, to enforce their terms, and to exercise remedies for any breach\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *6).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Supreme Court rejected MBIA Insurance\u2019s generalized claims that the parties\u2019 insurance agreement included an implied promise that Countrywide would tell MBIA Insurance all about different special kinds of risk and use underwriting standards of a certain quality. But the court upheld one narrow aspect of MBIA Insurance\u2019s breach of contract claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cthe claim survives to the limited extent that it asserts that corrective action \u2014 such as investigating loans which became over 30-days delinquent \u2014 would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>have preserved MBIA[ Insurance]\u2019s benefits under the bargain, but that Countrywide Home deliberately refused to take such action in order to collect more late payment fees and service charges\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *19).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In other words, Countrywide allegedly frustrated <em>specific objectives in the parties\u2019 contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Here, by contrast, plaintiffs have not alleged any objectively measurable deviations from specific contract provisions. And it is undisputed that, as part of the restructuring, MBIA Illinois agreed to reinsure the $554 billion in outstanding municipal bonds issued by MBIA Insurance. As plaintiffs themselves explain, the \u201creinsurance gives policyholders direct claims against both the original insurer (MBIA Insurance) and the reinsurer (MBIA Illinois).\u201d One can hardly say that MBIA Insurance derives no benefit whatsoever from the fact that one of its sister companies is now jointly liable for its entire municipal bond portfolio.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Plaintiffs also allege that the parent company abused MBIA Insurance\u2019s corporate form by shifting assets to cause insolvency and lack of present ability to meet its obligations to policyholders (although the company has, in fact, paid all claims that have become due since the restructuring). To pierce the corporate veil, plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) the owners exercised complete domination of the corporation in respect to the transaction attacked; and (2) . . . such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff which resulted in plaintiffs injury\u201d <em>(Matter of Morris v New York State Dept. of Taxation &amp; Fin., </em>82 NY2d 135, 141 [1993]). We have held that \u201c[t]hose seeking to pierce a corporate veil . . . bear a heavy burden\u201d <em>(TNS Holdings v MKI Sec. Corp., </em>92 NY2d 335, 339 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In the majority\u2019s view, plaintiffs can apparently show domination of MBIA Insurance by virtue of its status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBIA Inc. (majority op at 229); however, \u201c[i]t is a general principle of corporate law deeply ingrained in our economic and legal systems that a parent corporation ... is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries\u201d <em>(United States v Bestfoods, </em>524 US 51, 61 [1998]). Further, the majority grounds the requisite abuse of the corporate form on the allegation that MBIA Inc. \u201ccaus[ed]\u201d MBIA Insurance to undertake \u201ctransactions that now shield\u201d assets from plaintiffs \u2014 in other words MBIA Inc. purportedly drained capital from its subsidiary (majority op at 229). As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has pointed out, though, \u201cno New York authority . . . disregards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>corporate form solely because of inadequate capitalization\u201d <em>(Gartner v Snyder, </em>607 F2d 582, 588 [2d Cir 1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Superintendent approved MBIA Insurance\u2019s restructuring after finding that it was fair and equitable and would leave the affected insurers with sufficient assets to satisfy their obligations to policyholders, including, of course, these plaintiffs, who have persuaded the majority that the courts may nonetheless review the restructuring de novo. Having recently merged the Departments of Insurance and Banking to create a new Department of Financial Services to provide the \u201cresponsive, effective, innovative[ ] state banking and insurance regulation . . . necessary to operate in a global, evolving and competitive market place\u201d (L 2011, ch 62, \u00a7 1, enacting Financial Services Law \u00a7 101-a), the Legislature may wish to consider if, as a result of today\u2019s decision, further legislation is now necessary to address the new Department\u2019s envisioned role as the arbiter of major financial transactions in these industries. Critically, it does not enhance New York\u2019s reputation as a major financial center for insurers to be put in a position where they survive our State\u2019s daunting regulatory gauntlet and gain approval for a financial transaction under the Insurance Law, yet remain vulnerable to multiple lawsuits brought in state and federal court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by disaffected policyholders who claim that the same transaction is fraudulent under other state statutes and common law. The regulatory agency would not be a party in these lawsuits and, after today\u2019s decision, there is no reason for such plaintiffs to bring a CPLR article 78 proceeding in addition to their plenary actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It surely behooves the Legislature to make clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>for which the majority discerns inadequate support in current law: the State\u2019s comprehensive financial regulatory regime preempts lawsuits under the Debtor and Creditor Law and common law seeking to upset transactions approved or directed by the Superintendent (now, the Superintendent of Financial Services), which may only be challenged in a CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Smith, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Ciparick; Judge Read dissents in a separate opinion in which Judge Graffeo concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. Of course, if plaintiffs believe that the Superintendent relied on inaccurate or unreliable data, they may pursue this tack in their CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. The majority compares this case to <em>Richards v Kaskel </em>(32 NY2d 524, 535 n 5 [1973]); however, in <em>Richards, </em>the administrative action \u2014 the Attorney General\u2019s acceptance of a sponsor\u2019s cooperative offering plan \u2014 \u201c[did] not constitute approval\u201d of the plan by him <em>(see </em>General Business Law \u00a7 352-e [4]; <em>Matter of Charles H. Greenthal &amp; Co. v Lefkowitz, </em>32 NY2d 457, 462 [1973] [noting that an offering plan is \u201cfiled simply for informational purposes\u201d to enable prospective buyers to decide whether to purchase an interest]). Moreover, the plaintiffs in <em>Richards </em>alleged specific oral misrepresentations to tenants apart from the offering plan <em>(see Richards v Kaskel, </em>69 Misc 2d 435, 443 [Sup Ct, NY County 1972]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">. MBIA Insurance has also been sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and in the Delaware Court of Chancery (see <em>Aurelius Capital Master, Inc. v MBIA Ins. Corp., </em>695 F Supp 2d 68 [SD NY 2010] [suit by a putative class of structured-finance policyholders]; <em>Third Ave. Trust v MBIA Ins. Corp., </em>2009 WL 3465985, 2009 Del Ch LEXIS 186 [2009] [suit by noteholders]). The plaintiffs in these two cases press the same state statutory and common-law claims advanced by plaintiffs in this lawsuit. Multiple lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions present the obvious risk of conflicting or at least inconsistent outcomes for different policyholders of the same insurer, further undermining the certainty and stability of the Superintendent\u2019s approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">. Plaintiffs here did not commence their CPLR article 78 proceeding until shortly after MBIA Insurance filed its motion to dismiss. In the motion, MBIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Insurance argued that plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred as a collateral attack on the Superintendent\u2019s approval, which apparently alerted plaintiffs to the advisability of initiating a CPLR article 78 proceeding before the four-month statute of limitations expired. Other policyholders who have sued MBIA Insurance <em>(see </em>n 3 at 236) did not commence CPLR article 78 proceedings against the Superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
