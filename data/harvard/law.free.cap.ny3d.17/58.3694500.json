We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"AuX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>On the afternoon of November 28, 2006, two uniformed officers were patrolling a residential area of Flushing, Queens County. One of the officers observed defendant Robert Franov exit the driver\u2019s side door of a Lincoln Town Car, holding a small black box. Defendant began walking in the direction of the officers but, upon seeing them, dropped the box to the ground and continued to walk. The officers stopped defendant and recovered the discarded item, which turned out to be a computerized automobile light control module. Upon examination of the automobile, they noticed that the driver\u2019s side door lock was broken and the dashboard had been ripped apart, exposing the internal wiring. The officers arrested defendant and recovered a screwdriver, rachet and four sockets from his pants pocket. Defendant neither owned nor had permission or authority to use the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Following his arrest, defendant was indicted for unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 165.06), criminal mischief in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 145.05 [2]), criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 165.40) and possession of burglar\u2019s tools (Penal Law \u00a7 140.35). A jury convicted him of all four counts. Defendant appealed, arguing, as relevant here, that the proof was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Appellate Division modified the judgment by vacating the conviction of unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree and the sentence imposed thereon, and otherwise affirmed (71 AD3d 914 [2d Dept 2010]). The court held that the trial evidence as to that count was legally insufficient, reasoning that \u201cdefendant\u2019s momentary presence in or about a vandalized automobile cannot, without more, provide the basis for finding that he exercised dominion and control over the vehicle as required to support a conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 915).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">A Judge of this Court granted the People leave to appeal (15 NY3d 804 [2010]), and we now reverse and reinstate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">A person is guilty of third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle \u2014 a class A misdemeanor \u2014 when, \u201c[k] no wing that he does not have the consent of the owner, he takes, operates, exercises control over, rides in or otherwise uses a vehicle\u201d (Penal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u00a7 165.05 [1]). Under Penal Law \u00a7 165.06, a person is guilty of second-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle, a class E felony, when he or she commits the crime of third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle as defined in Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 (1) and has been previously convicted of that crime within the preceding 10 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue here is whether defendant\u2019s conduct fell within the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The People claim that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that defendant committed second-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle because a rational jury could have found that defendant exercised control over or otherwise used the Town Car by breaking into it, damaging the interior and taking an automotive part. Defendant, and our dissenting colleagues, argue otherwise, contending that the Appellate Division properly vacated the unauthorized use conviction on legal sufficiency grounds as the crime should be limited to instances in which the person charged had the means and intent to operate the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Our analysis begins with former Penal Law \u00a7 1293-a, the predecessor to Penal Law \u00a7 165.05. Section 1293-a made it a felony for a person, without the consent of the owner, to \u201ctake, use or operate ... an automobile.\u201d We narrowly construed this provision in <em>Matter of Diane S. </em>(18 NY2d 973 [1966]), determining that the statute was inapplicable to a defendant who was a passenger in a vehicle because, even though she knew the vehicle had been taken without the owner\u2019s permission, she had not been involved in the asportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In 1965, the Legislature decided to broaden the reach of the unauthorized use statute by enacting Penal Law \u00a7 165.05, which replaced section 1293-a. Two phrases were added by section 165.05 (1) \u2014 \u201cexercises control over\u201d and \u201crides in\u201d \u2014 and the clause \u201cor otherwise uses\u201d was placed at the end of the specifications of enlarged prohibitions (L 1965, ch 1030).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The new statutory construction clearly indicated that the Legislature sought to address more than \u201cjoyriding\u201d or there would not have been a need to insert the amended language. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the Legislature reduced the classification of the offense from a felony to a class A misdemeanor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We first had occasion to address the expanded language of Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 in <em>People v McCaleb </em>(25 NY2d 394 [1969]). In <em>McCaleb, </em>and its companion case <em>People v Gibbs, </em>the defendants were each found in different parked automobiles that had been taken and moved without the permission of their owners. McCaleb was apprehended while sitting in the vehicle\u2019s rear seat with the engine turned off and a key in the ignition. Gibbs was sleeping in the front passenger seat of a car with the engine running. Both automobiles had been reported as stolen. McCaleb and Gibbs asserted that they could not be convicted of unauthorized use of a vehicle under Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 because the statute was intended to punish only joyriding, as was its precursor, former section 1293-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On appeal in <em>McCaleb, </em>we rejected these arguments. We contrasted the statute\u2019s new language with former section 1293-a, observing that the inclusion of additional proscriptions \u201cindicates that a broader range of conduct was being prohibited\u201d (25 NY2d at 399). Turning first to the term \u201cuses\u201d in Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 (1), we determined that \u201c[i]ts independent meaning is underscored by its inclusion in the extended phrase \u2018or otherwise uses,\u2019 \u201d and that the modifier \u201cotherwise\u201d serves the purpose of \u201cbroadening\u201d the meaning of the term <em>(id.). </em>We then focused on the scope of the phrase \u201cexercises control over,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201cThe exercise of control is not limited to a moving vehicle, for otherwise it would be largely synonymous with \u2018operates,\u2019 or covered by \u2018riding\u2019. Thus barring the owner or others from entry into the car might constitute such control, as might the temporary use of the vehicle, or its motor, for a purpose accomplished while the vehicle remains or has become stationary. Moreover, by lowering the grade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of crime from felony ... to misdemeanor, the Legislature, understandably, included conduct less serious than that covered by the old statute and there treated as larceny\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Based on the more expansive language incorporated into Penal Law \u00a7 165.05, we concluded that the conduct of McCaleb and Gibbs fell within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We revisited Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 in <em>People v Roby </em>(39 NY2d 69 [1976]), a case where the defendant was seated in the passenger seat of a stolen vehicle and his companion was in the driver\u2019s seat trying to put a key in the ignition when the arresting officer approached. There, the defendant attempted to distinguish <em>McCaleb </em>on three grounds, claiming that he was in the car for only a short time; the motor was not running nor was the key in the ignition; and the car was not recently stolen so as to give rise to the inference that he was involved in the theft. We found these distinctions unpersuasive and affirmed the conviction. First, we stated that \u201c[t]here is no minimum time limit for unauthorized occupation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 71). Second, we viewed the evidence of the codefendant\u2019s attempt to use the key as parallel to the conduct in <em>McCaleb. </em>Finally, we held that the statute does not require any evidence of theft, and such \u201cfact is absolutely immaterial to the quantum of proof necessary to establish commission of the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Reading <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby </em>together, it is evident that, unlike the narrower provision from which it was derived, Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 is not limited to joyriding or situations in which the vehicle is actually driven. Moreover, although the defendants in <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby </em>each had the ability to operate the automobiles in question, thus evincing control, we did not hold \u2014 as the dissent now would \u2014 that operability was a sine qua non of the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle. Indeed, in <em>McCaleb </em>we recognized that a person may exercise control over a vehicle by \u201cbarring the owner or others from entry into the car\u201d or temporarily using it \u201cfor a purpose accomplished while the vehicle remains . . . stationary\u201d (25 NY2d at 399). Notably, Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 itself contains no operability or movement prerequisite. We therefore cannot agree with defendant\u2019s contention, accepted by the dissent, that a person may not be convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>unauthorized use of a vehicle unless the accused had the ability and intent to operate it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On the other hand, entry alone is not enough under the statute, which expressly requires some degree of control or use. The inadvertent entry into a vehicle mistaken for one\u2019s own would not constitute this crime \u2014 something more is needed since the statute contains a knowledge component.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether denominated as exercising control over or otherwise using a vehicle, we conclude that a violation of the statute occurs when a person enters an automobile without permission and takes actions that interfere with or are detrimental to the owner\u2019s possession or use of the vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Measured against this standard, the evidence adduced at trial was legally sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction of unauthorized use of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Here, contrary to the Appellate Division\u2019s characterization, this case involves much more than defendant\u2019s brief presence in an automobile. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, a rational jury could have found that defendant broke into the Town Car by \u201cpopping\u201d out the driver\u2019s side door lock; entered the car without consent; unscrewed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ripped apart the driver\u2019s side dashboard; and stole the vehicle\u2019s light control module. Defendant\u2019s unauthorized entry coupled with multiple acts of vandalism and the theft of a part unquestionably interfered with the owner\u2019s possession and use of the vehicle. Put differently, defendant\u2019s actions constituted a temporary use of the car \u201cfor a purpose accomplished while the vehicle remain[ed] . . . stationary\u201d (McCaleb, 25 NY2d at 399). As a result, \u201cthere is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, defendant\u2019s conviction of unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree reinstated, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of the facts <em>(see </em>CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. Defendant was previously convicted of third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle within the 10-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">. The operative language in chapter 1030 of the Laws of 1965 is identical to the current statutory text in Penal Law \u00a7 165.05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. As originally enacted, the Legislature created only one unauthorized use of a vehicle offense, codified at Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 (L 1965, ch 1030). The Legislature subsequently created unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 165.06) and unauthorized use of a vehicle in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 165.08), redesignating the crime contained in Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 as unauthorized use of a vehicle in the third degree <em>(see </em>L 1982, ch 413).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. The dissent posits that, under <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby, </em>an unauthorized use conviction \u201cmay only be sustained where the defendant\u2019s presence in a stationary vehicle is <em>coupled with </em>other evidence demonstrating the ability to operate the vehicle or the means to do so\u201d (dissenting op at 68). In effect, the dissent would restrict the scope of this crime to joyriding and attempted joyriding. But the dissent\u2019s narrow interpretation disregards the Legislature\u2019s intent to expand the types of conduct proscribed by Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 and would read the clause \u201cor otherwise uses\u201d out of the statute. The dissent also ignores our prior construction of that very phrase, in which we emphasized that it has an \u201cindependent meaning\u201d and \u201cadded importance,\u201d and was intended to \u201cbroaden! ]\u201d the provision <em>(McCaleb, </em>25 NY2d at 399). Further, the dissent\u2019s position leads to incongruous results, under which a person sitting in the back seat with a key may be prosecuted under the statute but a person who enters a car and inflicts considerable damage \u2014 precluding the owner from operating the car without first undertaking significant repairs \u2014 cannot be charged under the provision. Surely the owner of the vehicle in this case would be justified in viewing the damage caused by defendant as substantially affecting the operability of the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">. The concurrence views <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby </em>as holding that the unauthorized entry into a vehicle, without more, is sufficient under the statute. But this would transform the unauthorized use statute into a trespass provision akin to Penal Law \u00a7 140.05, which makes it a violation to \u201cknowingly enter! ]\u201d a premises without consent. Penal Law \u00a7 165.05, however, does not employ the word \u201center.\u201d Rather, it specifically requires \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. This appeal provides us no occasion to address the circumstances, if any, under which a person could exercise control over or otherwise use a vehicle without entering it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">. We also reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that he should not be prosecuted for second-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle because his actions are also punishable under other provisions, such as third-degree auto stripping (Penal Law \u00a7 165.09). Absent a contrary legislative intention, \u201coverlapping in criminal statutes, and the opportunity for prosecutorial choice they represent, is no bar to prosecution\u201d <em>(People v Robinson, </em>95 NY2d 179, 184 [2000] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; <em>see also People v Mattocks, </em>12 NY3d 326, 333-334 [2009]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJi\">(concurring). I agree with the result the majority reaches, but do not join its opinion, because the rule it states seems to me less clear than it should be. I would simply reaffirm what we said in <em>People v Roby </em>(39 NY2d 69, 70-71 [1976]), summarizing our holding in <em>People v McCaleb </em>(25 NY2d 394 [1969]): \u201cthe statute proscribing unauthorized use of a vehicle (Penal Law, \u00a7 165.05, subd 1) makes criminal the unauthorized occupation of another person\u2019s vehicle, without his consent, irrespective of whether or not the vehicle is in motion\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Under <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby, </em>someone who enters and occupies someone else\u2019s vehicle \u201cuses\u201d that vehicle within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 (1), and if he does so \u201c[k]nowing that he does not have the consent of the owner\u201d he violates the statute. This is not the only possible interpretation of the word \u201cuses\u201d \u2014 it could, as the dissent argues, be read to require the \u201cability\u201d or \u201cmeans\u201d to operate the vehicle (dissenting op at 66) \u2014 but it is the interpretation we chose several decades ago, and I see no reason to change our mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The majority seeks a middle ground, saying that \u201cthe ability and intent to operate\u201d the vehicle is not required but that \u201centry alone is not enough\u201d (majority op at 64). The majority would insist on \u201csome degree of control or use,\u201d which it defines as \u201cactions that interfere with or are detrimental to the owner\u2019s possession or use of the vehicle\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 64). But what unauthorized occupancy of a car does not so \u201cinterfere\u201d? Does an intruder manifest \u201ccontrol or use\u201d if he talks to a friend while sitting in the car? Smokes a cigarette? Looks out the window for the time it would take to smoke a cigarette? The only example the majority gives of something that would <em>not </em>be prohibited is \u201cinadvertent entry into a vehicle mistaken for one\u2019s own\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 64), but an entry without mens rea is excluded on the face of the statute, which applies only to someone who acts \u201c[k]nowing that he does not have the consent of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Perhaps the majority\u2019s \u201ccontrol or use\u201d test is no different in substance from the simple \u201cunauthorized occupation . . . without . . . consent\u201d test of <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby. </em>But if that is what we mean, I think we should say so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b138-6\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5X\">(dissenting). At issue is whether defendant\u2019s conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 165.06, 165.05 [1]) was supported by legally sufficient evidence, where defendant did not demonstrate the ability to operate the vehicle or the means to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stated differently, the question is whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to establish that defendant \u201cexercised control over\u201d or \u201cotherwise used\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of the unauthorized use of a vehicle in the second degree statute. Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>primarily on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>People v McCaleb </em>(25 NY2d 394 [1969]) and <em>People v Roby </em>(39 NY2d 69 [1976]), the majority stated, \u201c[w]hether denominated as exercising control over or otherwise using a vehicle, a violation of the statute occurs when a person enters an automobile without permission and takes actions that interfere with or are detrimental to the owner\u2019s possession or use of the vehicle\u201d (majority op at 64). Applying this standard, the majority held that \u201cthe evidence adduced at trial was legally sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction of unauthorized use of a vehicle\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Because I believe the majority reads the unauthorized use of a vehicle statute too broadly, and because I believe the statute in question is meant to prohibit a defendant\u2019s unauthorized \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle <em>as a vehicle, </em>I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that there was legally sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle. Accordingly, I dissent and would affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\"><em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby </em>are not in conflict with my position. They support it. In <em>McCaleb, </em>and its companion case <em>People v Gibbs, </em>defendant McCaleb was found sitting in the back seat of a stolen car; although the car\u2019s engine was turned off, there was a working key in the ignition <em>(see McCaleb, 25 </em>NY2d at 397). The second defendant, Gibbs, was discovered sleeping in the front passenger seat of a stolen car with the engine running <em>(id.). </em>In remanding both appeals for a new trial, the Court held that the rebuttable presumption contained in Penal Law \u00a7 165.05 (1)\u2014 that a defendant in a stolen automobile had knowledge that he did not have the vehicle owner\u2019s consent \u2014 satisfies due process <em>(id. </em>at 400-401).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, the Court held that the unauthorized occupation of another\u2019s motor vehicle, without any movement of said vehicle, falls within the ambit of the unauthorized use of a vehicle statute <em>(id. </em>at 399). In reaching this holding, the <em>McCaleb </em>Court logically concluded that the statute\u2019s terms \u201cexercises control over,\u201d \u201crides in,\u201d and \u201cotherwise uses\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>should be interpreted broadly to the extent of including passengers to negate any requirement that the statute covers only those involved in the actual taking of the vehicle, or only applies to situations where the vehicle is moving <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Here, the majority points to the <em>McCaleb </em>Court\u2019s recognition that \u201ca person may exercise control over a vehicle by \u2018barring the owner or others from entry into the car\u2019 or temporarily using it \u2018for a purpose accomplished while the vehicle remains . . . stationary\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 63, quoting 25 NY2d at 399). In my view, the majority\u2019s reliance on such language is misplaced because the language bears no relation to what happened in <em>McCaleb, Roby </em>(39 NY2d at 71 [defendant was in the front passenger seat of a parked stolen car, while his codefendant was in the driver\u2019s seat attempting to insert a key into the ignition]) or the case at bar. This language supports the <em>McCaleb </em>Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he [statute\u2019s] exercise of control [term] is not limited to a <em>moving </em>vehicle\u201d (25 NY2d at 399 [emphasis added]), a point I do not dispute. In addition, applying the \u201cfor a purpose accomplished while the vehicle remains . . . stationary\u201d language leads to an overly broad and vague construction of the statute because the list of potential \u201cpurposes\u201d would be virtually limitless. Such a construction would necessarily lead to incongruous results.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In conclusion, pursuant to <em>McCaleb </em>and <em>Roby, </em>\u201cunauthorized use\u201d convictions may only be sustained where the defendant\u2019s presence in a stationary vehicle <em>is coupled with </em>other evidence demonstrating the ability to operate the vehicle or the means to do so. Based on the foregoing, I would hold that for the purpose of legal sufficiency, in order for a lone defendant to come within the unauthorized use of a vehicle statute, evidence must be adduced at trial that he or she, without the authorization of the vehicle owner (and with an intent to operate the vehicle), obtained the means to set the vehicle\u2019s mechanism in operation or possessed tools designed to bypass the vehicle\u2019s ignition system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without evidence of defendant\u2019s intent and ability to operate the vehicle, the requirements for \u201cunauthorized use\u201d cannot be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick and Read concur with Judge Graffeo; Judge Smith concurs in result in a separate concurring opinion; Judge Jones dissents and votes to affirm in another opinion in which Judge Pigott concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">.
