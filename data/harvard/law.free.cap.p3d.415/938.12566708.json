After entering a no-contest plea, Hopu was convicted of Burglary in the Second Degree (Burglary Two) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 708-811 (2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hopu was sentenced to a five-year term of imprisonment including a mandatory minimum term of two years to be served concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Hopu claims the Circuit Court erred by denying his Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence because his sentence violated his right to due process where the charging document did not state that he would be subject to enhanced sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Hopu's point on appeal as follows and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hopu claims the Circuit Court erred by denying his Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence because the Felony Information with which he was charged, in violation of Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai'i Constitution, failed to plead that he would be subject to enhanced sentencing. Hopu appears to argue that due process required that the charging document expressly state he would be subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, the statutory basis for the minimum term, what the minimum sentence would be, and the reasons-including prior convictions-for the enhanced punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The bulk of Hopu's argument relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Auld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/#p245\">\n    136 Hawai'i 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/#p245\">\n    361 P.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (2015). However, recognizing that new rules of law were being announced in that case, the\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   court gave those rules \"purely prospective effect, which means that the rule is applied neither to the parties in the law-making decision nor to those others against or by whom it might be applied to\n   <em>\n    conduct or events occurring before that decision\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/#p245\">\n    136 Hawai'i at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/#p245\">\n    361 P.3d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Hopu's Felony Information was filed on February 4, 2014, and the\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   decision was filed on November 24, 2015. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   does not apply to Hopu's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hopu also argues that Hawai'i case law prior to\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   supports his argument that he was \"entitled to have the mandatory minimum enhancement allegations pled in the charging instrument in this matter[,]\" in particular,\n   <em>\n    Jess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261563\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/117/381/#p401\">\n    117 Hawai'i at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261563\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/117/381/#p401\">\n    184 P.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, prior to\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   , this requirement had never been applied to allegations of prior convictions for the purpose of imposing a mandatory minimum as a repeat offender and the\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   court's recognition that it was pronouncing a new rule of law belies this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hopu also appears to argue that the Felony Information was deficient for failing to specify that HRS \u00a7 706-606.5 (Supp. 2017) is the section under which Hopu would sentenced as a repeat offender. Again, published case law prior to\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   did not make this a requirement. In any event, this court has rejected this claim in the past.\n   <em>\n    State v.
