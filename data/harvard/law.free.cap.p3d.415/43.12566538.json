Cimarex argued that as the operator of the well, it was Mr. Benedetti's principal employer and was statutorily immune from civil liability. Mr. Benedetti responded to Cimarex's motion to dismiss, arguing that \u00a7 302(H) was an unconstitutional special law under Art. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 59 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On March 25, 2016, the district court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After argument from the parties, the court asked for supplemental briefing on the issue of whether \u00a7 302(H) was a special law.
