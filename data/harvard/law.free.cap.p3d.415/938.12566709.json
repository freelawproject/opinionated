After a trial by jury, Ponce was found guilty and sentenced to five (5) years imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of one year, eight months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Ponce contends that (1) The circuit court improperly admitted State's Exhibits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   5 and 8 into evidence under the business record exception to hearsay, (2) there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction, (3) the circuit court erred by denying Ponce's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal because the State failed to prove the element of \"deception\", and (4) the circuit court erred when it denied Ponce's Motion for New Trial upon the late discovery of Ponce's inability to read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Ponce's points of errors as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. State's Exhibits 5 and 8 Were Properly Admitted Pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ponce contends that the circuit court erred in admitting State's Exhibits 5 and 8 under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) because the exhibits were prepared in anticipation of litigation and were testimonial, making them subject to sixth amendment confrontation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ponce argues that the circuit court improperly admitted State's Exhibits 5 and 8 under HRE Rule 803(b)(6). State's Exhibits 5 and 8 are Eligibility Review (ER) forms filled out and submitted to DHS by Ponce, dated January 16, 2013 and January 24, 2014, respectively. In order to continue receiving food stamp benefits, later referred to as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ER forms are automatically mailed to welfare benefit recipients a year after an initial Application for Financial and SNAP Assistance is processed. ER forms are blank pre-printed forms in which the applicant responds to questions with respect to any changes which may have transpired in the preceding year affecting eligibility. Applicants must complete the ER form by reviewing their eligibility information contained in the form and by listing, among other things, any changes to the applicant's household composition, income, and assets. If changes occur, DHS makes adjustments to the applicants eligible benefits. After the applicant completes the ER form, it can be mailed, faxed, or brought directly to DHS's processing center where a DHS clerk registers the ER form and assigns an eligibility worker to schedule an in-person or over-the-phone interview for the purpose of reviewing the submitted form with the applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The initial eligibility worker assigned to Ponce's case to review her 2013 and 2014 ER forms was Edison Espiritu (Espiritu), who was, at the time of trial, on vacation and unable to testify. At trial, David Kihara (Kihara), a DHS eligibility worker, testified as the custodian of records for DHS. Kihara had been employed by DHS as an eligibility worker for thirty-five years, in which the past ten years his responsibilities included, reviewing DHS cases to determine eligibility factors, ensuring the accuracy of eligibility benefits, and computing corrected amounts if an overpayment was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kihara testified that case files for all welfare benefit recipients are kept and maintained by DHS. Records that are kept in the case file include, all applications, reporting systems, changes reported, and any supporting documentation submitted by the recipient, which include the annual ER forms. The ER forms are used by DHS to determine household composition and the income of applicants to allow for proper assessment of the amount a recipient is entitled to receive in benefits. As to State's Exhibit 5 and 8, Kihara testified that both forms were filled out and signed by Ponce and were prepared in the course of DHS's regularly conducted activity as an annual assessment and determination of SNAP eligibility benefits. He stated that State's Exhibits 5 and 8 were the types of forms that would be kept in the case file for all welfare recipients and the types of records that are regularly maintained and updated. Kihara further testified that the ER forms are the types of records that are entered into a recipients case file at the time that they are received or made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ponce contends that State's Exhibit 5 and 8 should not have been admitted under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) because they were not records made in the regular course of business and rather were prepared primarily in anticipation of litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

The supreme court held that although there was an understanding that the results of a speed check would likely be used in the prosecution of speeding cases, the card could still qualify as a business record under HRE Rule 803(b)(5).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313496\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313496\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/354/\">\n    at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313496\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/354/\">\n    227 P.3d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ER form's primary function is to determine and/or confirm the recipient's household composition and income to assess the amount of benefits the applicant is entitled to receive for the upcoming year. Further, Kihara's testimony established the foundation necessary for the admissibility of the ER Forms as business records. Accordingly, the circuit court properly admitted State's Exhibit 5 and 8 as business records pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Business records are not testimonial.\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Ponce acknowledged that she was previously married in 1983 and at that time, she had informed DHS of her marriage and identified her husband as a household member in her welfare case. In regards to the State's Exhibits that were entered into evidence at trial, Ponce testified that she was the one who filled out all the applications for welfare benefits, the signatures on the exhibits were hers, the letters and other documents submitted to DHS were hers, she had received the EBT card from DHS, and she received the benefits as shown on the EBT printout. Ponce testified that she was aware that she was required to report her marriage with Smith and acknowledged that instead she had listed Smith as either her friend, caregiver, roommate and/or indicated that her marital status was single in the DHS applications and ER Forms submitted by her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the foregoing, considering the evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Ponce deceived DHS by failing to report her marriage to Smith, thereby obtaining SNAP benefits in excess of $300 to which she was not entitled, as a result of that deception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Circuit Court Properly Denied Ponce's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on our holding that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to sustain Ponce's conviction, we conclude that the circuit court did not err when it denied Ponce's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Circuit Court Properly Denied Ponce's Motion for New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ponce contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying her motion for new trial, based on \"newly discovered evidence,\" specifically, the discovery of Ponce's inability to read after trial at the hearing on her Motion for New Trial on December 29, 2016. Ponce argues that had the evidence of her inability to read been available at trial, it would have been further investigated to determine whether it affected her filling out and signing of documents and used to prove that she did not have the requisite state of mind for the charge of theft.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence will only be granted if (1) the evidence has been discovered after trial; (2) such evidence could not have been discovered before or at trial through the exercise of due diligence; (3) the evidence is material to the issues and not cumulative or offered solely for purposes of impeachment; and (4) the evidence is of such a nature as would probably change the result of a later trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Mabuti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1956050\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/72/106/#p113\">\n    72 Haw, 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201264\">\n    807 P.2d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Ponce's post-trial admission of her inability to read does not constitute newly discovered evidence in the context of a motion for a new trial because Ponce was aware of her inability to read at all times before trial, at trial, and after trial. Additionally, the evidence is not material to the issues nor would it have changed the result of a later trial. Upon DHS receiving Ponce's Applications and ER Forms for welfare benefits, the Eligibility Worker assigned to her case would review Ponce's submission with her to verify her responses during which time Ponce always confirmed that Smith was nothing more than a non-related co-habitant rather than her husband. During these in-person or telephone interviews, Ponce was orally instructed of her rights and responsibilities, the requirement to report any changes in household or income, and requirement to report truthfully. Further, prior to Ponce's initial interview in 2010, Ponce was required to watch an instructional video on the welfare system. All evidence indicating that the ability to read was not necessary to establish the requisite intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Motion for New Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered on January 10, 2017, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Honorable Shirley Kawamura presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    After 2010, the Food Stamps Program became known as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
