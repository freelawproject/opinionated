Ms. Dresp was Mr. Richmond's estranged girlfriend. Ms. Dresp had asked Mr. Higginbotham and Ms. Zackuse to accompany her to Mr. Richmond's property so that she could remove some of her belongings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 When the trio arrived at Mr. Richmond's home, Ms. Dresp knocked on the door. Although there was no answer, Ms. Dresp could see Mr. Richmond inside. Ms. Dresp felt angry. She wanted to retrieve her belongings. Ms. Dresp advised Mr. Richmond that if he did not open the door, she would kick it down. She also told him she would break into the shed. To that end, she retrieved a crow bar from Mr. Higginbotham's van.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Ms. Dresp followed through on her promise to break into the shed, a police officer arrived at the scene in response to a call from Mr. Richmond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The officer talked to Ms. Dresp and Mr. Richmond. It appears this helped mitigate the situation. With the officer's input, it was agreed Ms. Dresp would return the following day to retrieve her belongings from inside the residence. It was also agreed Ms. Dresp could immediately remove some belongings from a car parked on the property. With a plan for the removal of Ms. Dresp's property in place, the officer left, believing she had resolved the situation to the best of her ability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Ms. Dresp had lived at the property with Mr. Richmond as an authorized tenant. The parties dispute whether Ms. Dresp shared Mr. Richmond's authority over the premises on the date of the offense conduct. We need not resolve this issue for purposes of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Ms. Dresp testified that she was using Mr. Higginbotham's van because it was the only available vehicle and it could also fit her belongings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    There was some dispute in the testimony as to when it was agreed that Ms. Dresp could remove items from the car. Ms. Dresp and Mr. Richmond recalled the agreement occurred after the officer left. The officer testified the agreement took place in her presence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    \u00b6 5 Once the officer was gone, Ms. Dresp began removing items from the car with the help of Mr. Higginbotham and Ms. Zuckuse. Mr. Higginbotham's presence appeared to upset Mr. Richmond. Mr. Richmond began yelling and an oral argument ensued between the two men. Although he was much smaller than Mr. Richmond, Mr. Higginbotham stated he was not afraid of Mr. Richmond. He said he was at the property only to help Ms. Dresp retrieve her belongings. Mr. Higginbotham was carrying a flashlight in his hand at this point in time. According to Ms. Dresp and Ms. Zackuse, Mr. Higginbotham appeared more frustrated than angry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    \u00b6 6 Mr. Higginbotham started walking toward Mr. Richmond as the two men argued. However, Ms. Dresp urged Mr. Higginbotham away. Mr. Higginbotham and Mr. Richmond exchanged additional words and then Mr. Richmond went inside his house.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    \u00b6 7 Mr. Richmond's return to the house was a relief. It appeared the hostility had come to an end. Unfortunately, this turned out not to be true. Instead, Mr. Richmond ran out of his house, armed with a two-by-four piece of lumber that was nearly four feet in length. Mr. Richmond and Mr. Higginbotham then started exchanging more words. Mr. Richmond warned Mr. Higginbotham not to come any closer to him. When Mr. Higginbotham took a step forward, Mr. Richmond struck Mr. Higginbotham with the two-by-four. According to Ms. Dresp and Ms. Zackuse, Mr. Richmond held the two-by-four like a baseball bat and swung it at Mr. Higginbotham's head. After he was hit, Mr. Higginbotham spun around and fell face first on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b6 8 Ms. Dresp went to Mr. Higginbotham's aide and Ms. Zackuse called 911. Meanwhile, Mr. Richmond ran out of the back of his house and drove away in a truck. As he left, Mr. Richmond threatened to shoot everyone if they did not leave the property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 9 When emergency personnel arrived at the scene, it was determined Mr. Higginbotham had suffered \"severe head trauma.\" 3 Report of Proceedings (RP) (Feb. 4, 2016) at 513. Mr. Higginbotham was unconscious and eventually transported to Harborview\n    Medical Center in Seattle. He died shortly thereafter. Examiners found no evidence of any weapons on Mr. Higginbotham's body or in his clothing. An autopsy concluded Mr. Higginbotham's death was caused by a blunt force injury to his head.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     Legal proceedings\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 10 Mr. Richmond lodged a self-defense theory against the State's murder charges. In support of this theory, Mr. Richmond sought to introduce testimony from several experts. One of the experts was David Predmore. Mr. Predmore was proffered to testify about the general effects of methamphetamine consumption on human behavior. According to the defense, this testimony was relevant because high levels of methamphetamine had been found in Mr. Higginbotham's system at the time of his death. Although Mr. Richmond had not been aware of Mr. Higginbotham's methamphetamine consumption at the time of the assault, the defense theorized that Mr. Predmore's testimony was relevant to corroborate Mr. Richmond's claim that Mr. Higginbotham was behaving aggressively the night of the attack. The trial court excluded Mr. Predmore's testimony as speculative and irrelevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b6 11 Another proposed defense expert was Dr. Robert Stanulis. Defense counsel advised that Dr. Stanulis would testify to the \"flight or fight\" response as it pertained to Mr. Richmond's behavior the night of the attack. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 168. Although defense counsel furnished a curriculum vitae for Dr. Stanulis, no expert report or summary of opinion was ever produced. None exists in the record on appeal. The trial court excluded Dr. Stanulis's testimony on the basis of an inadequate discovery disclosure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b6 12 At trial, Mr. Richmond took the stand and testified in his defense. Mr. Richmond told the jury he was in fear for his life on the night of the attack. He felt ganged up on by Ms. Dresp and her companions. He repeatedly told the trio they needed to leave. Mr. Richmond said that while he was trying to get Ms. Dresp and her companions to leave, Mr. Higginbotham approached him in a \"fast manner,\" armed with a flashlight.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    5 RP (Feb. 9, 2016) at 993. Mr. Richmond then saw his dog try to sneak outside the door of his home. Mr. Richmond moved to shut the door and then returned to his position in front of Mr. Higginbotham. Another argument ensued. During this argument, Mr. Richmond claimed Mr. Higginbotham approached him with what appeared to be a knife. Mr. Richmond felt scared. He picked up a two-by-four and used it to strike down Mr. Higginbotham. After Mr. Higginbotham fell, Mr. Richmond stated he panicked. He ran inside his house, grabbed his dog, and left the property in a truck.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 13 Based on the testimony, the trial court provided the jury a full panoply of self-defense pattern instructions. Not only did the court provide WPIC 16.02, 16.07, and 16.08 (regarding justifiable homicide and no duty to retreat) as requested by Mr. Richmond, it also provided WPIC 16.04, as requested by the State, which explains the restrictions on lawful use of self-defense by an initial aggressor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b6 14 During summation, the prosecutor argued the initial aggressor instruction. The prosecutor asked the jury to focus on what happened when Mr. Richmond returned from his house after the initial verbal confrontation with Mr. Higginbotham. The prosecutor described Mr. Richmond's retreat inside the house as \"a moment of peace.\" 6 RP (Feb. 9, 2016) at 1125. The prosecutor asked the jury to focus on this moment and consider whether Mr. Richmond's subsequent actions were reasonable. The prosecutor argued it was not reasonable for Mr. Richmond to come out of his house with the two-by-four given that the situation appeared to have calmed down. \"Who's the aggressor?\" the prosecutor asked.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1126. \"The defendant is the aggressor. He doesn't get-You don't even\n    get to the question of self-defense.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . In her final statements to the jury, the prosecutor argued Mr. Richmond stirred the \"whole thing up\" and took \"it to a next level by coming out of his house, armed with a board, screaming at them. He doesn't get to claim self-defense.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1165.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 15 A jury convicted Mr. Richmond of second degree murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 16 At sentencing, the State introduced a proposed judgment and sentence that contemplated an offender score of five based, in part, on a 2004 Idaho conviction. The court engaged counsel in a brief colloquy regarding the nature of the Idaho conviction. The discussion focused on whether the conviction qualified as a violent offense. Defense counsel said the offense was a nonviolent felony and likely would not even qualify as a crime in Washington. The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed the Idaho offense should be included in Mr. Richmond's offender score as a nonviolent offense. Mr. Richmond concurred with this assessment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 17 At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the court imposed a standard range sentence. Mr. Richmond appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     Constitutional right to present a defense-exclusion of expert testimony\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 18 Mr. Richmond argues the trial court violated his constitutional right to present a defense by excluding expert testimony. We disagree. The trial court never prevented Mr. Richmond from testifying or proffering a self-defense case to the jury. Instead, the court excluded expert testimony proffered by Mr. Richmond because it failed to meet the criteria for admissibility under the rules of evidence. This determination was well within the trial court's discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Mr. Predmore had never met or examined Mr. Higginbotham. He had no basis to assess how Mr. Higginbotham's body may have processed methamphetamine. According to Mr. Predmore's proposed testimony, methamphetamine can have a wide range of effects. Increased aggression is only one possibility. It is therefore nothing but speculation to connect Mr. Higginbotham's methamphetamine use with Mr. Richmond's claim of victim aggression. The evidence was properly excluded, consistent with long-standing case law.\n    <em>\n     Lewis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855922\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/141/367/#p388\">\n     141 Wash.

The defense failed to proffer the substance of Dr. Stanulis's testimony to opposing counsel and the court in a timely manner, despite numerous continuances. Although some sort of proffer was eventually made to the trial court on the morning of jury selection, the substance of this proffer is not in the appellate record. Without the ability to review the substance of the proffer and how it might have related to Mr. Richmond's conduct the night of the attack, we are in no position to analyze whether Dr. Stanulis's testimony was admissible or whether Mr. Richmond was prejudiced\n    by the trial court's decision to exclude the testimony as a discovery violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     First aggressor jury instruction\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 22 Mr. Richmond argues the trial court improperly issued a first aggressor instruction, thereby vitiating his ability to argue self-defense. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b6 23 A first aggressor instruction may be issued in circumstances where \"(1) the jury can reasonably determine from the evidence that the defendant provoked the fight, (2) the evidence conflicts as to whether the defendant's conduct provoked the fight, or (3) the evidence shows that the defendant made the first move by drawing a weapon.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

The State is invariably the party to propose a first aggressor instruction. As such, the State has the burden of establishing the instruction's applicability. To meet this obligation, the State must point to some evidence, beyond the defendant's mere words, indicating the defendant intentionally provoked the confrontation between himself and the victim.\n    <em>\n     State v.

There is a conflict in the parties' proffered evidence as to what happened at this point. According to the State's witnesses, Mr. Richmond armed himself with a two-by-four and ran outside his home. But according to Mr. Richmond, he merely stood on his porch and reached for the two-by-four after Mr. Higginbotham came at him with what appeared to be a knife.

This claim is unsupported by the record. The trial court stated it had \"no problem\" with the defense asking witnesses about their methamphetamine use on the day of the offense. 1 RP (Jan. 27, 2016) at 174. Such questioning was relevant to the witnesses' credibility. The lack of questions regarding drug use was the result of defense counsel's choice not to engage in this line of inquiry, not any ruling by the trial court.

According to Mr. Richmond, this evidence was relevant to show the witnesses' relationship to Mr. Higginbotham and their bias toward him. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling. Evidence of Mr. Higginbotham's methamphetamine use had the potential of being improperly analyzed as bad character evidence. This potential for prejudice was not offset by any significant probative value. The jury knew Ms. Dresp and Ms. Zackuse were close friends with Mr. Higginbotham.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Evidence of the trio's shared drug use would not have appreciably enhanced the jury's ability to assess potential bias.

Although defense counsel recognized Mr. Richmond had an Idaho felony conviction and ultimately accepted the State's offender score calculation, neither defense counsel nor Mr. Richmond ever affirmatively acknowledged that the Idaho conviction was legally comparable to a Washington offense. To the contrary, defense counsel specifically disputed the legal comparability of the Idaho conviction. It is unclear why, given defense counsel's position, the defense ultimately concurred with the State's offender score calculation. But we need not resolve this conundrum. A defendant's mere agreement with the State's offender score calculation and admission of the existence of an out-of-state conviction is insufficient to constitute an affirmative acknowledgment that an out-of-state conviction meets the terms of the comparability analysis.\n    <em>\n     State v.

None of the testimony states that Richmond ran toward Higginbotham in a threatening manner. If one reads the entirety of Dresp's trial testimony, one questions whether Richmond ran at all. The testimony suggests he walked out of the house. Dresp spoke figuratively when using the word \"running\" and then the State's attorney later employed the same verb when questioning. Dresp also testified that Richmond \"came out and-stepped off the porch,\" language that does not connote \"running.\" RP at 381. Dresp states Richmond and Higginbotham later stepped toward one another, testimony that confirms that at least Richmond did not run at Higginbotham. Even if we assume that Richmond ran out of the house, which we should do based on principles of review, the trial still lacked testimony that Richmond ran toward Higginbotham in a threatening manner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    \u00b6 48 We should consider additional evidence. Although Joseph Richmond owned the residence, I assume that Veronica Dresp held the right to enter the premises to retrieve her personal belongings. Still, Dresp used a crowbar to break and enter Richmond's shed. A police officer calmed the situation, but Richmond thereafter exchanged taunts with Dennis Higginbotham, who assisted Dresp in retrieving belongings from a vehicle. Richmond did not desire Higginbotham on his property. Higginbotham walked toward Richmond and the two volleyed further affronts. Richmond entered his house and returned with the two-by-four.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    \u00b6 49 Richmond stepped from the back steps and then walked toward Higginbotham. The two exchanged more verbal assaults and Richmond told Higginbotham not to step further. The trial lacked evidence that Richmond raised the board in a threatening manner before Richmond stepped toward Higginbotham and slammed him with the board. According to Veronica Dresp, Richmond held the board behind his person until he attacked Higginbotham.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \u00b6 50 Assuming we believe Joseph Richmond's story he never threatened Dennis Higginbotham before Higginbotham approached him with a knife. Under this version of the facts, Richmond did not engage in provocation before he acted in self-defense. Assuming we believe the State's facts, Joseph\n    Richmond attacked Higginbotham without any advance provocation, other than words and by walking toward Higginbotham before Higginbotham walked toward Richmond. The duo exchanged hostile words, but did not fight. Richmond committed a unilateral assault.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \u00b6 51 The majority emphasizes that Joseph Richmond carried a board in his hand. Nevertheless, under the State's evidence, Dennis Higginbotham did not move to strike Richmond because of the board. The parties faced each other and stood still while Richmond held the board. Walking with a two-by-four in one's hand does not reasonably provoke a fight, when one stops short of the victim and warns the victim not to step forward. Higginbotham stood on Richmond's property and Richmond held the right to stand his ground and order Higginbotham to leave. The majority's holding conflicts with the right to stand one's ground as instructed by the trial court in jury instruction 19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    \u00b6 52 Assuming the majority considers the two-by-four to constitute a weapon, Richmond possessed the right to hold the board to defend himself in the event Higginbotham attacked him first. Even if Richmond bore a gun, the constitution would protect his conduct. U.S. CONST. amend. II ; WASH. CONST. art. 1, \u00a7 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    \u00b6 53 Because we determine the inferences we can draw from the evidence on a case-by-case basis and because of the esoteric nature of determining the sufficiency of the evidence, reviewing the facts of reported decisions assists in the resolution of this appeal.

Wasson and his cousin Billy Bartlett quarreled in an alley outside Bartlett's apartment. Wasson entered his car and repeatedly revved the engine of the vehicle. Bartlett broke the driver's side window of the car. Wasson exited his car with a gun in hand, but Wasson did not assault Bartlett. The commotion attracted neighbor Thomas Reed, who exited the apartment complex and told the other two men to quiet. Reed and Bartlett exchanged blows, and one blow from Reed knocked Bartlett to the ground. Reed then walked toward Wasson. According to Wasson, he concluded Reed had stabbed Bartlett. Also, Reed approached him and informed him that Reed would attack him next. Wasson told Reed to stop and fired after Reed continued to approach him.

The instruction indicated that the State must prove that the defendant performed an unlawful act that created the necessity for self-defense, and this court held\n    such an instruction void for vagueness.

Arthur abruptly pulled his automobile from the parking spot at high speed, hit a car in an adjoining space, and his car ended in a ditch. Waterhouse ambled to Arthur's vehicle to prevent Arthur from leaving the scene of an accident. When Waterhouse reached into Arthur's car, Arthur stabbed him. Arthur testified that he acted in self-defense because he feared Waterhouse would attack him. This reviewing court noted that the only possible provoking act committed by Arthur was the collision with the other vehicle, but that Arthur had withdrawn from the parking lot.

Frederick Martin occupied Hoyt's residence when Brower arrived. Martin grew agitated with Brower. When Brower left the apartment and walked down stairs, Martin trailed Brower. Brower turned and stuck his revolver in Martin's stomach and told him to return to the apartment. This court reversed the conviction because of the lack of evidence to support the giving of a first aggressor instruction. Assuming Brower to be the first aggressor, the first aggression occurred when Brower assaulted Martin. Although Brower armed himself before traveling to Hoyt's apartment, Brower possessed the right to carry the firearm. A broad reading of\n    <em>\n     Brower\n    </em>\n    champions the proposition that arming oneself does not constitute an act that reasonably provokes a belligerent response.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    \u00b6 61 I would remand for a new trial because of the rendering of the first aggressor jury instruction.
