ORS 813.010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal. Specifically, defendant argues that, based on the evidence presented at trial, no factfinder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) was .08 percent or higher when he was riding or \"driving\" his motorcycle. On appeal, we conclude that, even though the fact that alcohol in the blood dissipates over time is common knowledge, that knowledge combined with the minimal evidence presented at trial in this case is not sufficient for a reasonable factfinder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's BAC was above .08 percent at the time he was driving. Accordingly, we reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts are few and undisputed. Oregon State Police Trooper Dunlap stopped defendant for riding his motorcycle without a helmet. Following that stop, Dunlap took defendant into custody for DUII and brought defendant to the North Bend Police Department for a blood alcohol test using an Intoxilyzer. That test began approximately one hour and 45 minutes after defendant was initially stopped. The test indicated that defendant's BAC was .09 percent. Between the time that defendant was stopped and the time that his BAC was tested, Dunlap did not observe defendant consume any alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was charged by information with DUII. A short bench trial was held in which the state relied solely on a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   theory of intoxication-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that defendant was legally intoxicated under the relevant statute because he\n   had a .08 percent or higher BAC when he was riding his motorcycle. ORS 813.010(1)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In defendant's closing argument, he argued that the trial court could not convict him because the state's evidence was legally insufficient to prove that he was intoxicated in violation of ORS 813.010(1)(a) at the time that he was riding. Specifically, defendant noted that the only proof offered by the state was that defendant's BAC was .09 percent when measured one hour and 45 minutes after he had been driving and that defendant had not consumed any alcohol during that time. Defendant argued that there was no basis for a factfinder to determine, without further evidence, whether defendant had a .08 percent or higher BAC at the time that he was driving. The trial court, acting as a factfinder, rejected defendant's argument and convicted defendant, noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Well, in this case, I will find [defendant] guilty because the only evidence before me is what he blew, and I don't have evidence at all that suggests one way or the other what you do with *** that to equate it with time of driving. But that's the evidence I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"So, I'll find him guilty of that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted, on appeal defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because no factfinder could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had a BAC of .08 percent or higher when he was riding his motorcycle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, defendant contends\n   that it is speculative to find that his BAC was above the legal limit at the time he was driving based on the results of a blood alcohol test that he took one hour and 45 minutes later. In response, the state contends that, under prior case law, the trial court was entitled to infer based on the record before it that defendant's BAC when he was riding was at least as high as the BAC measured by defendant's later blood alcohol test. We agree with defendant and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, there is circumstantial evidence bearing on the movement of alcohol through defendant's system. Although there is no direct evidence in the record of how much alcohol defendant consumed or precisely when he consumed it, there is circumstantial evidence that he consumed some quantity of alcohol such that the later-administered breath test revealed a .09 percent BAC. That later-administered breath test tells us that, at some point, his BAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   violated the legal limit and further that his BAC exceeded the legal limit for some amount of time. The evidence does not tell us how long he was at or above the .08 percent BAC threshold or when he crossed that threshold, but the evidence is conclusive that he crossed the threshold. Further, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the alcohol he did consume would, at some point, leave or dissipate from defendant's system. Again, we do not know the precise rate of dissipation given the minimal evidence in the record, but not knowing the rate of dissipation is substantively different from the majority opinion's conclusion that this case \"does not include\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence bearing on the movement of alcohol.\" 290 Or. App. at 406, 415 P.3d at 1084 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the majority opinion requires \"additional evidence guiding the trier of fact on rates of accumulation and dissipation,\" 290 Or. App. at 406, 415 P.3d at 1084, two hypotheticals show why additional evidence is not necessary. First, if a breath or blood test administered a mere nine minutes after a person drove-instead of one hour and 45 minutes later, which is presented in this case-revealed a .09 percent BAC, it would be reasonable to infer that the driver was over the legal limit at the time of driving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, if a breath test established a .09 percent BAC nine hours after the person drove-and like this case, there was no evidence that the driver consumed any alcohol after the stop-it would be similarly reasonable to infer that the driver was over the legal limit at the time of driving given common knowledge that alcohol dissipates over time. In both hypotheticals, the\n   later-administered breath test revealing a .09 percent BAC logically can lead to a conclusion that the driver was over the legal limit at the time of driving without the need for additional evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Why then does the majority opinion conclude that a breath test after an hour and 45 minutes after driving becomes too speculative for a reasonable factfinder to\n   conclude that defendant was over the legal limit when he drove such that additional evidence is necessary to withstand a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   One possible explanation is because the majority opinion looks for the conclusion to \"follow solely as a matter of probability and logic\" and that the conclusion \"necessarily\" would have had to occur. 290 Or. App. at 406, 415 P.3d at 1084. But those requirements run contrary to\n   <em>\n    Bivins\n   </em>\n   , which explains that \"the requirement that the [factfinder] be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that a particular inference must\n   <em>\n    inevitably\n   </em>\n   follow from the established facts.

Under that scenario, because whatever alcohol he consumed was still being absorbed, it is possible that his BAC was not .08 percent or higher when he was driving and that alcohol continued to enter his blood after he was stopped such that an hour and 45 minutes later he had a .09 percent BAC (either because his BAC peaked at some higher level and was on the way down or because it took that long to absorb sufficient alcohol to reach a .09). Although a plausible scenario-and\n   possibly even a reasonable inference-given the state of the record in which there is neither evidence to establish how alcohol is absorbed and eliminated generally in the body, nor evidence specific to defendant, or someone similarly situated, on absorption and dissipation of alcohol, the majority opinion's reliance on the possibility of a rising BAC does not align with our standard of review. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine the evidence \"in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact, accepting reasonable inferences * * *\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   found the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In all cases, a certain amount of time will have passed after the stop and before the arrest, while a police officer investigates the crime. In addition, to test the driver, the police officer must use a specific machine, the Intoxilyzer 5000 or the Intoxilyzer 8000, which are the only breath test machines approved by the Oregon State Police for use in performing a chemical analysis of a person's breath, *** and which typically are located at the police station.
