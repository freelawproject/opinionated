Aloha B&amp;B provides lodging to transient guests, averaging between one hundred and two hundred customers per year. Plaintiffs-Appellees Diane Cervelli (Cervelli) and Taeko Bufford (Bufford) (collectively, Plaintiffs), lesbian women in a committed relationship, planned a trip to Hawai'i and sought lodging with Aloha B&amp;B. Aloha B&amp;B and Young refused to accommodate Plaintiffs' request for lodging based solely on their sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Aloha B&amp;B, alleging discriminatory denial of public accommodations in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 489.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hawai'i Civil Rights Commission (HCRC) intervened in the case as a plaintiff, after it had determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discriminatory practices had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs and the HCRC filed a partial motion for summary judgment on the issues of liability and injunctive relief, and Aloha B&amp;B filed a competing cross-motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted Plaintiffs and the HCRC's motion and denied Aloha B&amp;B's motion. The Circuit Court ruled that Aloha B&amp;B violated HRS \u00a7 489-3 by discriminating against the Plaintiffs on the basis of their sexual orientation. The Circuit Court also enjoined Aloha B&amp;B from \"engaging in any practices that operate to discriminate against same-sex couples as customers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Aloha B&amp;B argues that the Circuit Court erred in ruling that it is liable for discriminatory practices under HRS Chapter 489. Aloha B&amp;B maintains that because Aloha B&amp;B operates its business out of Young's residence, the Circuit Court should have applied an exemption from prohibited discriminatory practices in real property transactions set forth in HRS Chapter 515 for the rental of rooms by a resident. Alternatively, Aloha B&amp;B argues that the application of HRS Chapter 489 to prohibit discriminatory practices under the circumstances of this case would violate Young's constitutional rights. Based on these arguments, Aloha B&amp;B contends that the Circuit Court erred in granting Plaintiffs and the HCRC's motion for partial summary judgment and in denying Aloha B&amp;B's motion for summary judgment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Aloha B&amp;B operates out of a four bedroom home in the Mariner's Ridge section of Hawai'i Kai, where Young and her husband reside. Young operates Aloha B&amp;B as a sole proprietorship and offers three rooms in her residence to guests for overnight lodging. Rooms at Aloha B&amp;B are offered at a nightly rate of $80 to $100, and there is a three-night minimum booking requirement. In addition to the nightly rate, Aloha B&amp;B charges and collects general excise taxes from its customers as well as transient accommodation taxes, which only providers of transient accommodations are required to pay. Aloha B&amp;B remits these taxes to the State of Hawai'i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Aloha B&amp;B does not offer rooms to customers for use as a permanent residence, and Young never describes herself as a landlord to her guests. Aloha B&amp;B averages one hundred to two hundred customers per year. The median length of stay for Aloha B&amp;B customers is four to five days. The majority of customers stay for less than a week, about 95 percent or more stay for less than two weeks, and more than 99 percent stay for less than a month. In addition to overnight lodging, customers at Aloha B&amp;B are provided breakfast, pool access, wireless internet access, and other amenities. Almost all of\n   Aloha B&amp;B customers, an estimated 99 percent, are travelers who do not live in Hawai'i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Aloha B&amp;B advertises its services to the general public through its own website as well as through multiple third-party websites. Aloha B&amp;B's website, freely accessible through the internet, provides a phone number and email address for potential customers to contact Aloha B&amp;B, and it contains graphics stating \"Best Choice Hawaii Hotel\" and \"Best Choice Oahu Hotels.\" Aloha B&amp;B also advertises through various bed-and-breakfast-related websites to generate more business for itself, including paying an annual fee of between $400 to $500 to BedandBreakfast.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs Cervelli and Bufford, two lesbian women in a committed relationship, began planning a trip to Hawai'i to visit a friend. Plaintiffs, who resided in California, wanted to stay near their friend, who lived in Hawai'i Kai. Cervelli emailed Aloha B&amp;B to inquire if a room was available for their planned trip. Young responded by email the same day, stating that a room was available for six days and providing instructions on how to complete the reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Two weeks later, Cervelli called Aloha B&amp;B to book the reservation and spoke with Young, who indicated that the room was still available. While Young was writing up the reservation, Cervelli mentioned that she would be accompanied by another woman named \"Taeko.\" Young stopped and asked whether Cervelli and her companion were lesbians. When Cervelli said \"yes,\" Young responded, \"[W]e're strong Christians. I'm very uncomfortable in accepting the reservation from you.\" Young refused to accept the reservation from Cervelli and terminated the phone call by hanging up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Cervelli called Bufford in tears and explained what had happened. Bufford then called Young and attempted to reserve a room, but Young again refused to accept the reservation. Bufford 'asked Young if her refusal was because Bufford and Cervelli were lesbians, to which Young responded \"yes.\" Bufford had two phone conversations with Young that day. Young referred to her religious beliefs in discussing her refusal to provide a room to Plaintiffs. Apart from Plaintiffs' sexual orientation, there was no other reason for Young's refusal to accept Plaintiffs' request for a room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cervelli and Bufford each filed a complaint against Aloha B&amp;B with the HCRC alleging discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation. Young was interviewed during the HCRC's investigation and was asked to describe the religious beliefs that she claimed precluded her from accepting Cervelli and Bufford's reservation. Young stated that she is Catholic; that she believes that homosexuality is wrong; that she believes that sexual relations between same-sex couples (regardless of whether they are legally married) are immoral; and that she therefore refused to provide Cervelli and Bufford with a room. The HCRC found that there was reasonable cause to believe that Aloha B&amp;B had committed an unlawful discriminatory practice against Cervelli and Bufford in violation of HRS \u00a7 489-3. The HCRC subsequently closed its cases based on Cervelli's and Bufford's election to pursue a court action, and it issued \"right to sue\" notices to Cervelli and Bufford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs subsequently filed in the Circuit Court a Complaint for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and damages against Aloha B&amp;B, alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of HRS Chapter 489. The HCRC filed a motion to intervene in the case as a plaintiff because it found the case was one of \"general importance\" given the HCRC's mission to eliminate discrimination. The Circuit Court granted the HCRC's motion to intervene as a plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs and the HCRC filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to liability and injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aloha B&amp;B filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Circuit Court held a hearing on the parties' competing motions for summary judgment. At the hearing, counsel for Aloha B&amp;B acknowledged that \"discrimination is a horrible evil\" and that \"in places of public accommodation discrimination is a horrible evil.\" Aloha B&amp;B's counsel also acknowledged that Aloha B&amp;B admits that it \"does provide lodging to transient guests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Aloha B&amp;B's counsel argued that the law prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, HRS Chapter 489, does not apply to Aloha B&amp;B because it uses Young's residence to provide lodging to transient guests. Aloha B&amp;B's counsel argued that Aloha B&amp;B's use of a residence means that it is not a \"place of public accommodation\" subject to the requirements of Chapter 489, but instead is governed by HRS Chapter 515.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Circuit Court granted Plaintiffs and the HCRC's motion for partial summary judgment with respect to liability and declaratory and injunctive relief, and it denied Aloha B&amp;B's cross-motion for summary judgment as moot. In its Summary Judgment Order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Circuit Court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Aloha B&amp;B] is governed by Chapter 489, HRS, not Chapter 515, HRS, and [Aloha B&amp;B] constitutes a place of public accommodation under HRS \u00a7 489-2, because its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the general public as customers, clients, or visitors. [Aloha B&amp;B] also constitutes \"[a]n inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment that provides lodging to transient guests\" and \"[a] facility providing services relating to travel or transportation.\" HRS \u00a7 489-2. [Aloha B&amp;B] violated HRS \u00a7 489-3 by discriminating against Plaintiffs Diane Cervelli and Taeko Bufford on the basis of their sexual orientation as lesbians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Certain brackets in original.) The Circuit Court enjoined and prohibited \"Defendant Aloha Bed &amp; Breakfast, a Hawai'i sole proprietorship of Phyllis Young,\" and its officers, agents, and employees \"from engaging in any practices that operate to discriminate against same-sex couples as customers of Aloha Bed &amp; Breakfast[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Circuit Court entered its Summary Judgment Order on April 15, 2013. The parties subsequently submitted a stipulated application to file an interlocutory appeal from the Summary Judgment Order, which the Circuit Court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Aloha B&amp;B argues that the Circuit Court erred in ruling that it is liable for discriminatory practices under HRS Chapter 489. Aloha B&amp;B argues that it is not subject to HRS Chapter 489, but that its activities are governed by HRS Chapter 515. In particular, Aloha B&amp;B asserts that an exemption from prohibited discriminatory practices in real property transactions set forth in HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) protects it from liability in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs and the HCRC, on the other hand, argue that Aloha B&amp;B is clearly a place of public accommodation that is subject to HRS Chapter 489. Plaintiffs and the HCRC argue that Aloha B&amp;B cannot \"borrow\" an exemption applicable to a different law (HRS Chapter 515) to avoid liability for violating the public accommodations law (HRS Chapter 489) on which Plaintiffs seek relief. They also argue that the HRS Chapter 515 exemption relied upon by Aloha B&amp;B only applies to long-term living arrangements in which tenants are seeking permanent housing, and not to the short-term transient lodging provided by Aloha B&amp;B to its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As explained below, we conclude that the Circuit Court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and the HCRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The statutory provisions relevant to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint against Aloha B&amp;B alleged discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations, in violation of HRS Chapter 489.

We conclude that the Circuit Court properly ruled that there are no material facts in dispute and that Aloha B&amp;B violated HRS \u00a7 489-3 by discriminating against Plaintiffs on the basis of their sexual orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   HRS \u00a7 489-3 prohibits \"[u]nfair discriminatory practices that deny, or attempt to deny, a person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation on the basis of ... sexual orientation ....\" Aloha B&amp;B admitted that the sole reason it refused to provide lodging to Plaintiffs was because of their sexual orientation. Young testified in her deposition that there was no other reason for Aloha B&amp;B's refusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is also clear based on the plain statutory language that Aloha B&amp;B is a \"place of public accommodation.\" That term is defined by HRS \u00a7 489-2 to mean \"a business, accommodation, ... recreation, or transportation facility of any kind whose goods, services, facilities, ... or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the general public as customers, clients, or visitors.\" Aloha B&amp;B admitted in its responsive pretrial statement that \"it offers bed and breakfast services to the general public.\" The evidence presented by Plaintiffs and the HCRC supports this admission. The evidence showed that Aloha B&amp;B advertises and offers its services to the general public through its own website as well as through multiple third-party websites that are freely accessible over the internet; it makes its services available to a large number of customers, an average of between one hundred and two hundred per year; and aside from same-sex couples and smokers, it generally accepts anyone as a customer as long as the person is willing to pay and a room is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   More importantly, the statutory definition of \"place of public accommodation\" specifically includes, \"[b]y way of example, but not of limitation,\" \"[a]n inn, hotel, motel, or\n   <em>\n    other establishment that provides lodging to transient guests\n   </em>\n   [.]\" HRS \u00a7 489-2 (emphasis added). Aloha B&amp;B admitted that it \"does provide lodging to transient guests.\" The undisputed evidence showed that Aloha B&amp;B customers only stay for short periods of time - - the majority for less than a week and about 95 percent for less than two weeks. Aloha B&amp;B does not offer rooms to customers for permanent housing or for use as a residence, and Young does not view herself as the landlord of the guests. In addition, Aloha B&amp;B collects from its customers, and pays to the State, a transient accommodation tax, which only providers of transient accommodations are required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on Aloha B&amp;B's own admissions as well as the undisputed evidence, we conclude that Aloha B&amp;B falls squarely within the statutory definition of \"place of public accommodation\" as an \"establishment that provides lodging to transient guests[.]\" Our conclusion is bolstered by the stated purpose of HRS Chapter 489 and the Legislature's directive on how it should be construed. HRS \u00a7 489-1(a) (2006) states that the purpose of HRS Chapter 489 \"is to protect the interests, rights, and privileges of all persons within the State with regard to access and use of public accommodations by prohibiting unfair discrimination.\" HRS \u00a7 489-1(b) (2006) then directs that HRS Chapter 489 \"shall be liberally construed to further\" these purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   When the plain language of the statutory definition of \"place of public accommodation\" is liberally construed to further the anti-discrimination purposes of HRS Chapter 489, it reinforces our firm conclusion that Aloha B&amp;B is a place of public accommodation. We conclude that the Circuit Court correctly ruled that Aloha B&amp;B constitutes a place of public accommodation that is subject to HRS Chapter 489. It is undisputed that Aloha B&amp;B refused to provide Plaintiffs with lodging on the basis of their sexual orientation. Therefore, we affirm the Circuit Court's determination that Aloha B&amp;B violated HRS \u00a7 489-3 by discriminating against Plaintiffs on the basis of their sexual orientation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In arguing that its actions were not prohibited by HRS 489-3, Aloha B&amp;B relies on an exemption applicable to a different law, HRS Chapter 515, a law which generally prohibits discrimination in real property transactions. In particular, Aloha B&amp;B relies on the exemption set forth in HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2), a so-called \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) provides that the prohibitions in HRS \u00a7 515-3 against discrimination in real estate transactions do not apply \"[t]o the rental of ... up to four rooms in a housing accommodation by an owner or lessor if the owner or lessor resides in the housing accommodation.\" Aloha B&amp;B argues that the HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) exemption supersedes the prohibition against discrimination set forth in HRS \u00a7 489-3 and therefore authorized its discriminatory conduct in this case. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In analyzing Aloha B&amp;B's argument, we begin by focusing on our \"foremost obligation ... to ascertain and give effect\" to the Legislature's intent in enacting the statutory provisions. As noted, through HRS \u00a7 489-1, the Legislature mandated that HRS Chapter 489 shall be liberally construed to further its purposes of protecting people's rights to access and to use public accommodations by prohibiting unfair discrimination. HRS Chapter 515 is also directed at prohibiting discrimination and \"shall be construed according to the fair import of its terms and shall be liberally construed.\" HRS \u00a7 515-1 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   By providing remedies for discrimination and the injuries caused by discrimination, HRS Chapter 489 and HRS Chapter 515 are remedial statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Remedial statutes are liberally construed to suppress the perceived evil and advance the enacted remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores v.

Accordingly, we liberally construe the scope of the protection against discrimination provided by HRS Chapter 489, and we narrowly or strictly construe the scope of the exemption from prohibited discrimination provided by HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Hawai'i Legislature's actions in omitting a \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption when it enacted HRS Chapter 489 indicates its intent that no such exemption would apply to discrimination in public accommodations and the type of conduct engaged in by Aloha B&amp;B in this case. The \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in HRS Chapter 515 was enacted in 1967.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1967 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 193, \u00a7 4 at 196. Almost twenty years later, the Hawai'i Legislature enacted HRS Chapter 489, which was patterned after the public accommodation provisions of the federal 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hoshijo ex rel. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260722\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/307/#p317\">\n    102 Hawai'i 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260722\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/307/#p317\">\n    76 P.3d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 (2003). The federal public accommodation provisions contain the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in the provision defining a \"place of public accommodation\" to include an \"establishment which provides lodging to transient guests[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a(b)(1). Although the corresponding Hawai'i provision adopts portions of the federal provision word for word, the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption is conspicuously omitted from the Hawaii provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A side by side comparison of the two provisions is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-85\">Hawai`i Public Accommodations Federal Public Accommodation Law Law HRS \u00a7 489-2 defines a \"place 42 U.S.C \u00a7 2000a(b)(1) defines of public accommodation\" to a \"place of public include: accommodation\" to include: \"An inn, hotel, motel, or \"[A]ny inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment that other establishment which provides lodging to transient provides lodging to transient guests[.]\" guests, <em>other than an</em> <em>establishment located within a</em> <em>building which contains not</em> <em>more than five rooms for rent</em> <em>or hire and which is actually</em> <em>occupied by the proprietor of</em> <em>such establishment as his</em> <em>residence</em>[.]\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We conclude that the Hawaii Legislature's omission of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in enacting HRS Chapter 489 provides persuasive evidence that it did not intend such an exemption to apply to establishments, like Aloha B&amp;B, that provide lodging to transient guests. We also conclude that Congress' inclusion of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption is instructive, for it demonstrates that Congress believed that a person's residence may\n   constitute a \"place of public accommodation\" as an \"establishment which provides lodging to transient guests.\" If a person's residence could not constitute a place of public accommodation, then the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption would not be necessary in the federal public accommodation provision. Congress' inclusion of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in the federal public accommodation law supports our conclusion that a place of public accommodation includes a bed and breakfast business, like Aloha B&amp;B, that uses the proprietor's residence to provide lodging to transient guests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Contrary to Aloha B&amp;B, we do not view HRS Chapter 489 and HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) to be in irreconcilable conflict. In this regard, we note that the term \"rental\" as used in HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) is not specifically defined. Also, because HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) is an exception to a remedial statute, we construe it narrowly. We conclude that it is possible to reconcile HRS Chapter 489 and HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) by construing the phrase \"rental of a room\" for purposes of HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) to exclude short-term lodging provided to transient guests covered by HRS Chapter 489 and as applying only to longer-term living arrangements where more permanent housing is sought. Such a construction would be consistent with the manner in which the Legislature has characterized the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption set forth in HRS \u00a7 515-4 (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In enacting the HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) exemption in 1967, the Legislature referred to it as the \"tight living\" exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 874, in 1967 House Journal, at 819. Furthermore, in amending HRS Chapter 515 in 2005 to add sexual orientation to the types of discrimination precluded by HRS \u00a7 515-3, the Legislature described the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption set forth in HRS 515-4(a)(2) as follows: \"\n   <em>\n    Housing laws\n   </em>\n   presently permit\n   <em>\n    landlords\n   </em>\n   to follow their individual value systems in selecting\n   <em>\n    tenants\n   </em>\n   to live in the landlords' own homes[.]\" 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 214, \u00a7 1 at 688 (emphasis added). This characterization of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption indicates that the Legislature understood the exemption to apply to longer-term living or housing arrangements - - where a landlord-tenant relationship would be established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259646\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/97/259/#p266\">\n    97 Hawai'i 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259646\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/97/259/#p266\">\n    36 P.3d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (2001) (\" '[S]ubsequent legislative history or amendments' may be examined in order to confirm our interpretation of statutory provisions.\" (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, Aloha B&amp;B admitted that it provides lodging to transient guests and that no landlord-tenant relationship is established during the guests' short-term stays. Construing the phrase \"rental of a room\" for purposes of HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2) to exclude short-term lodging provided to transient guests and as applying only to longer-term living arrangements would serve the Legislature's purposes for enacting both HRS Chapter 489 and HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2). It would advance the Legislature's goal of prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, while permitting landlords \"to follow their individual value systems\" in selecting a tenant who will reside with them on a longer-term basis in their own homes. This construction would also avoid any irreconcilable conflict between HRS Chapter 489 and HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This language perfectly describes Aloha B&amp;B.

HRS \u00a7 515-4(a)(2), on the other hand, applies more generally to the \"rental of rooms,\" without specifying the time period involved or whether the provision of lodging to transient guests is covered.

The trait that unifies the items in the list is set forth in the statutory definition itself - - establishments \"that provide[ ] lodging to transient guest.\" It is undisputed that Aloha B&amp;B possesses this unifying trait.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    While Young stated that she will not accept reservations from smokers, same-sex couples, unmarried couples, and disabled people who cannot climb the stairs, Young stated that the standard questions she asks people in processing a reservation consists of the dates they want, whether they are smokers, what room they are asking about, requesting their names, addresses, and contact information, asking if they have any dietary needs, and asking about the deposit.
