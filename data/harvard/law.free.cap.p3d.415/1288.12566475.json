Appellants filed these appeals to challenge the district court's July 7, 2017, \"Order Terminating Parental Rights of Niki Colleen Watts and Ronald Alan Watts.\" In that order, the district court concluded there was clear and convincing evidence to support two statutory grounds for termination of Appellants' parental rights: (1) the children have been neglected by Appellants, reasonable efforts were unsuccessful in rehabilitating the family, and the children's health and safety would be seriously jeopardized if returned to Appellants; and (2) the children were in foster care for 15 of 22 months and Appellants are unfit parents.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-2-309\">\n    Wyo.

California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). This Court notes that, in\n   <em>\n    NRL v. State (In re NRL)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/344/759/\">\n    2015 WY 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886718\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/344/759/\">\n    344 P.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2015), this Court ruled it would permit\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   -type briefs in appeals challenging termination of parental rights. After the motions were filed, this Court entered, in each docket, an \"Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time to File\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Brief.\" This Court ordered that, on or before December 27, 2017, Appellants \"may file with this Court a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues [she/he] would like this Court to consider in this appeal.\" On December 27, 2017, Appellants filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings, both of which are three pages in length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] On January 9, 2018, this Court denied the attorneys' motions to withdraw, because the attorneys did not discuss whether the district court complied with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-3-431\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-3-431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p). The district court subsequently corrected the record to state that it considered that statute and granted a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] Next, Appellants' court-appointed attorneys filed the withdrawal motions noted in the first paragraph of this order. Now, following review of the record, the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs submitted by appellate counsel, and the supplemental\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs, and the parties'\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings, this Court finds the appellate attorneys' latest motions to withdraw should be granted and the district court's \"Order Terminating Parental Rights of Niki Colleen Watts and Ronald Alan Watts\" should be affirmed. This Court finds nothing in the record or any of the pleadings to convince this Court that Appellants have any meritorious issues. It is, therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65]\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the captioned appeals are hereby consolidated; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b66]\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Rebecca S.
