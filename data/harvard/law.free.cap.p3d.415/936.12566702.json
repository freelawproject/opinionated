BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The factual background, according to the District Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Verdict Convicting Defendant of Inattention Offenses, entered on February 2, 2017, is as follows in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. On Wednesday, August 12, 2015, around 10:39 a.m., [Caleb Jimenez], who was part of a street construction crew, working on Hardy Street, a public road, in front of Wilcox Elementary School, ... observed [Bukoski] driving a ... truck exceeding the 15 mph speed limit, during school hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Jimenez saw [Bukoski] driving with his head down through the vehicle's windows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. Jimenez witnessed [Bukoski] striking traffic barricades, victim Lawrence Asai (hereinafter \"Asai\"), and some construction equipment before coming to a stop. On cross-examination, Jimenez testified that the all [sic] of these collisions took place within a few seconds. Jimenez testified that there was a flagman before the construction zone manned by Artworks Construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4. Jimenez testified that he received traffic safety training every Monday via weekly meetings, and that he was trained to make eye-contact with vehicles that passed through construction zones.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5. Jimenez saw Asai on the ground before medical personnel arrived and took Asai away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. Jimenez testified that, immediately to the side of the road where the accident occurred, there was a 1 to 2 foot deep trench containing rebar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Jimenez testified that he and [Bukoski] grew up together and that they were like \"family.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   8. At the close of Jimenez's testimony, the State rested and [Bukoski] moved for a Judgment of Acquittal, which was denied by this Court, for reasons listed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   9. Lieutenant Tanaka testified that he only brought a copy of General Order 2001-03, Motor Vehicle Traffic Investigation Procedures, which was later given to the State and Defense on November 3, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   10. As a witness called by [Bukoski], Officer Hanson Hsu testified that he did not observe signs of impairment or intoxication in [Bukoski] at the scene. Officer Hsu further testified that, on his Motor Vehicle Accident Report for the incident, he did not mark the human factors of inattention, distraction, aggressive, reckless driving, excessive speed, driving too fast for conditions, or exceeding the speed limit as causes of or factors contributing to the accident, but he did mark \"other improper action.\" During his investigation, he did not inspect the car for mechanical failure because he is not trained in mechanics. On cross, Hsu said that [Bukoski] told Hsu that [Bukoski] was the driver. [Bukoski] also told Hsu that he had a health problem and took medication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   11. As a witness for [Bukoski], Chelsea Carineo, who works near the collision scene and arrived on the scene approximately thirty minutes after it happened, testified that the traffic barriers were not weighed down, that [Bukoski's] vehicle had tinted windows, and that there were no flagmen posted earlier that day when she drove to work, although there were flagmen present at the site the following day. She also testified that the road was approximately 5-6 feet wide on the day of the accident and that there was a 1-2 foot deep trench immediately to the right of the road containing rebar. On cross, Carineo confirmed that the speed limit was 15 [ ] mph and that school was in session during the time of the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.

Jimenez also testified that he saw Bukoski's vehicle collide with two barriers and some equipment, then drive partially onto a sidewalk and hit a fence.
