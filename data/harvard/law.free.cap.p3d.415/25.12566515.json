Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Michelle Leavitt, Judge, Morales argues that the district court erred in concluding that his petition was procedurally barred. We disagree and affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Morales filed the underlying petition on April 26, 2017, six years after issuance of the remittitur on his direct appeal on August 10, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Morales v. State,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54180 (Order of Affirmance, July 15, 2010). Thus, his petition was untimely filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 34.726(1). Moreover, his petition was successive because he had previously filed a postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he asserted the same grounds for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 34.810(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Morales v. State,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 66432 (Order of Affirmance, December 11, 2014). Morales's petition was procedurally barred absent a demonstration of good cause and actual prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 34.726(1) ; NRS 34.810(1)(b), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Morales argues that the United States Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , 577 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S. Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), and\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States,\n   </em>\n   578 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    136 S. Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), provided good cause to excuse the procedural bars to his claim regarding his first-degree-murder jury instructions. This argument fails. Although Morales relies on\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   in arguing that\n   <em>\n    Byford v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    116 Nev. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), should be given retroactive effect,\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   was decided before Morales's 2009 trial and thus was timely available to support any relevant claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hathaway v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951000\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/119/248/\">\n    119 Nev. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951000\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/119/248/\">\n    71 P.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Moreover, Morales was not actually prejudiced by being procedurally barred from challenging the\n   <em>\n    Kazalyn\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   jury instruction, where the record shows that the district court gave\n   <em>\n    Byford's\n   </em>\n   curative instruction that remedied the\n   <em>\n    Kazalyn\n   </em>\n   instruction's deficiencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    116 Nev. at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d at 714-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, as\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   preceded and was effectively applied during his trial, Morales's bare claim that failure to excuse the procedural bar would cause a miscarriage of justice fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pellegrini v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275279\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/860/#p887\">\n    117 Nev. 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275279\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/860/#p887\">\n    34 P.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (2001) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nika v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937610\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/124/1272/\">\n    124 Nev. 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 n.84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937610\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/124/1272/\">\n    198 P.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 n.84 (2008). Morales has thus failed to demonstrate good cause and actual prejudice to overcome the procedural bar. Noting further that Morales was not entitled to appointed counsel, that he demonstrated his comprehension of the proceedings, and that the proceedings did not present any difficult issues, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the petition as procedurally barred without appointing counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 34.750(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Brown v. McDaniel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Nev.%20565\">\n    130 Nev. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20P.3d%20867\">\n    331 P.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871-72 (2014).
