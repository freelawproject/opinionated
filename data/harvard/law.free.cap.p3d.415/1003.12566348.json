Eighth Judicial District Court, Family Court Division, Clark County; Charles J. Hoskin, Judge.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Our review of the documents submitted to this court pursuant to NRAP 3(g) reveals a jurisdictional defect. Specifically, the notice of appeal appears to be untimely filed under NRAP 4(a) because it appears that it was filed more than 30 days after service of written notice of entry of the orders appealed from.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRAP 4(a)(1) ; NRAP 26(c). Written notice of entry of the custody order was filed and served by mail on December 11, 2017, and written notice of entry of the order denying NRCP 60(b) relief was filed and served by mail on January 11, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's notice of appeal from the custody order was due no later than January 16, 2018, and from the order denying NRCP 60(b) relief no later than February 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holiday Inn v.
