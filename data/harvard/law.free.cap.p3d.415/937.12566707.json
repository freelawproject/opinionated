The HLRB granted the MSJ in part, and denied it in part, in Order No. 3199: Order Denying Hawaii Health Systems Corporation's Motion to Dismiss; and Granting, in Part, and Denying, in Part, United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO's Motion for Summary Judgment (\n   <strong>\n    Order No. 3199\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 28, 2016, HHSC appealed to the Circuit Court. On December 2, 2016, HHSC moved for partial stay of Order No. 3199, pending the outcome of the appeal. On February 7, 2017, the Circuit Court issued its Order Granting Partial Stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 16, 2017, UPW commenced this secondary appeal, challenging the Order Granting Partial Stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Circuit Court later vacated the Order Granting Partial Stay, on August 4, 2017. This appeal, however, remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   UPW raises four points of error, contending that the Circuit Court erred when it: (1) determined that Hawaii Revised Statutes (\n   <strong>\n    HRS\n   </strong>\n   ) chapter 380 did not apply because the issue was not a \"labor dispute\" but rather a statutory dispute; (2) granted the partial stay without complying with the requirements of HRS chapter 380; (3) determined that HHSC was likely to prevail on the merits despite the presumptive validity of Order No. 3199; and (4) determined that HHSC was likely to prevail on the merits despite conflicting authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve UPW's points of error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) We first address HHSC's argument that this court does not have appellate jurisdiction because this appeal is interlocutory and was not made in compliance with Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (\n   <strong>\n    HRCP\n   </strong>\n   ) Rule 54(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and HRS \u00a7 641-1(b) (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   UPW argues that this appeal lies as of right, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 380-10 (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   HRS \u00a7 380-10 states that \"[w]henever any court of the State issues or denies any temporary injunction in a case\n   <em>\n    involving or growing out of a labor dispute\n   </em>\n   , an appeal shall lie as of right[.]\" (Emphasis added). Accordingly, we consider (1) whether the \"involves or grows out of\" requirement is met, and (2) whether the \"labor dispute\" requirement is met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 380-10. If this case involves or grows out of a labor dispute, then UPW's appeal lies \"as of right,\" and this court has appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A case \"involves or grows out of\" a labor dispute when \"the case involves persons ... who are members of ... an affiliated organization of employers or employees; whether the dispute is (A) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees[.]\" HRS \u00a7 380-13(1) (2015). Here, the UPW is an affiliated organization of employees, and the dispute is between the employer, HHSC, and the association of employees, UPW. Therefore, the requirement that the case \"involves or grows out of\" a labor dispute has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We note that the Circuit Court determined that the situation did not involve a labor dispute, stating that \"it does not appear to the court that this is a controversy arising out of a labor dispute such as there's picketing, or there's an ongoing labor dispute.\" Nevertheless, the term \"labor dispute\" includes \"any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment [.]\" HRS \u00a7 380-13(3). Therefore, we analyze (a) whether what occurred constituted \"any controversy,\" and (b) whether smoking is a condition of employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although few cases explicitly address the \"any controversy\" requirement by itself, it appears that the requirement is satisfied in a broad range of labor disputes, not only where there is picketing or a strike. In\n   <em>\n    AT&amp;T Broadband, LLC v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers\n   </em>\n   , the United States Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit held that a failure to negotiate in good faith constituted a labor dispute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341253\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/758/#p759\">\n    317 F.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759-61 (7th Cir. 2003). Other courts using similar statutes have held that labor disputes existed although no strike activity occurred, where a disagreement led to litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Milwaukee Bd. of Sch.

In\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Hawai'i Prof'l Assembly v. Tomasu\n   </em>\n   , the Hawai'i Supreme Court reviewed a dispute in which the parties disagreed over whether the implementation of a statutory requirement was a subject of mandatory bargaining.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259241\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/79/154/#p156\">\n    79 Hawai'i 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259241\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/79/154/#p156\">\n    900 P.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (1995).

Put another way, the suit must remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the moment of final appellate disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the adversary system, once set in operation, remains properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal-adverse interest and effective remedy-have been compromised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Hamilton ex rel.

First, the issue potentially affects a \"significant number\" of people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260760\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/323/#p327\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260760\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/323/#p327\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    119 Hawai'i at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    193 P.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, whenever the Hawai'i Legislature passes a law that affects unionized employees, and if one or more public employers move for temporary injunctive relief related to the legislation, the issue of whether HRS chapter 380 applies could affect a large number of public employees, as well as members of the public that are served by the public employees. As to the second and third factors, it would be desirable to obtain guidance for public officers because it is likely that the Legislature will pass another law affecting State employees, and a similar dispute is likely to arise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lethem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    119 Hawai'i at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    193 P.3d at 844-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). For these reasons, UPW's first and second points of error fall within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   UPW's third and fourth points of error allege that the Circuit Court erred in determining that HHSC was likely to prevail on the merits, in conjunction with its ruling on the partial stay. The question of which party will prevail on the merits will be resolved in due course, with the disposition of the merits of this case. These questions would be more appropriately considered in conjunction with an appeal from a final order or judgment, if any, and it is not desirable to review them prior to the final disposition by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For these reasons, UPW's first and second points of error are justiciable, but the third and fourth points are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) In its first point of error, UPW contends that the Circuit Court erred in determining that the appeal did not involve a \"labor dispute\" pursuant to HRS chapter 380.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   HHSC argues in response that the dispute at hand is a statutory dispute, rather than a labor dispute, which it argues would involve a strike or similar activity. As discussed above, we conclude that the instant appeal involves a labor dispute, and therefore, HRS chapter 380 applies. For this reason, we are \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\" and we hold that the Circuit Court erred when it determined that the case did not involve a labor dispute.\n   <em>\n    Chun v.

HRS \u00a7 377-9(h) states that the \"reviewing court may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper.\" HRS \u00a7 380-1 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   No court of the State shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in strict conformity with this chapter ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, when HRS chapter 380 was enacted, both the Senate and the House stated in their Standing Committee Reports: \"It should be pointed out that this bill [if] enacted will not be in conflict with [HRS chapter 377].\" S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 709, in 1963 Senate Journal, at 909-10; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 989, in 1963 House Journal, at 857. Therefore, it was not the intention of the Senate or the House that HRS chapter 380 override the court's jurisdiction to issue a stay of an HLRB order pursuant to HRS \u00a7 377-9(h). We conclude that it is possible to give effect to both statutes because a circuit court would have jurisdiction to grant a stay under HRS \u00a7 377-9(h), so long as it complied with the requirements of HRS chapter 380, and therefore no conflict exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
