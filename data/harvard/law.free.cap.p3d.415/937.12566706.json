On May 24, 2016, Botelho did not appear for sentencing and the Circuit Court ordered the forfeiture of the bail bond and issued a bench warrant for Botelho's arrest setting new bail in the amount of $75,000.00. A Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond was entered on May 31, 2016. A notice of the bail bond forfeiture was mailed to AABB on May 31, 2016 and, on June 3, 2016, Arthur Lee appears to have signed the certified mail return receipt for the Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond. Therefore, the search period, under HRS \u00a7 804-51, was from June 3, 2016 to July 3, 2016. On Tuesday, July 5, 2016, AABB filed a Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture Vacate Judgment and Discharge Bond (hereafter \"First Motion.\") On July 15, 2016, the Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree entered an order denying the First Motion. AABB did not appeal from this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 16, 2017, Botelho was located, arrested on the outstanding bench warrant, and surrendered. On May 16, 2017, AABB filed its Second Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture Reinstate Bond, then Discharge Bond (hereafter \"Second Motion\"). The Circuit Court denied the Second Motion on June 22, 2017 for lack of jurisdiction due to untimely filing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the governing statute, HRS \u00a7 804-51 does not permit a second motion to set aside a bail forfeiture, the Circuit was correct in denying AABB's Second Motion.\n   <em>\n    Ranger Ins.
