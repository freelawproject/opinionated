Montierth filed suit in district court, seeking to quiet title to property he purchased at a tax sale. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank), the mortgagee on the property and a defendant in the quiet title suit, filed counterclaims alleging that Mr. Montierth's tax deed was void. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Deutsche Bank, concluding that the statutorily-required notice regarding redemption provided by Mr. Montierth to the property owner and to Deutsche Bank was deficient and that the tax deed was void.

In June 2005, Kevin Alvesteffer borrowed $168,000 from Ameriquest Mortgage Company (Ameriquest) to purchase property in Green River, Wyoming. Ameriquest recorded a mortgage on the property and, in 2009, assigned the mortgage to Deutsche Bank. Property taxes on the property were not paid, which resulted in a tax delinquency and tax sale. John R. Montierth purchased the property at the tax sale for $977.83 in August 2007. On January 17, 2013, Mr. Montierth mailed the notice required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-108\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Montierth never personally served Mr. Alvesteffer with the statutory notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The January 17 notice letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Take notice that on May 2, 2013, per the Wyoming Statute, John R. Montierth will make application for a tax deed with respect to the following property in Sweetwater County, Wyoming:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   EDGEWATER ADDN BLK 6 LOT 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 2, 2007, John R. Montierth purchased said real property for 2006 delinquent taxes. The street address is 1625 Colorado Cir., Green River, WY 82935. The property was taxed in the name of ALVESTEFFER, KEVIN J.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The time for redemption of said property expired August 2, 2011\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Neither Mr. Alvesteffer nor Deutsche Bank responded to the notice or redeemed the property. On May 9, 2013, Sweetwater County issued a tax deed conveying the property to Mr. Montierth. The deed was recorded on May 14, 2013. After receiving the tax deed, Mr. Montierth invested a significant amount of money in the property to make it livable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Mr. Montierth filed this lawsuit against Mr. Alvesteffer and Deutsche Bank, seeking to quiet title to the property and void Deutsche Bank's mortgage lien. Mr. Alvesteffer failed to answer and the district court entered default judgment against him. Deutsche Bank asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaimed for declaratory relief, alleging that the tax deed was void because Mr. Montierth's notice was defective since it contained the wrong redemption date and was not properly served upon Mr. Alvesteffer. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment; the district court granted Deutsche Bank's motion for summary judgment and denied Mr. Montierth's motion. Mr. Montierth timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 6] We review the district court's entry of summary judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment can be sustained only when no genuine issues of material fact are present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Second and third, the controversy is one upon which the judgment of the court can effectively operate, and the determination of the controversy will have the force and effect of a final judgment on the parties. A declaration that the tax deed is void, the relief sought by Deutsche Bank, would extinguish Mr. Montierth's tax deed and would also result in the survival of Deutsche Bank's mortgage interest. Finally, these proceedings are genuinely adversary in character and not a mere disputation.

Mr. Montierth argues that both conclusions were erroneous and that he is entitled to summary judgment on his action to quiet title. We first address Mr. Montierth's argument that the district court erroneously concluded that the notice provided to Deutsche Bank was insufficient, and that as a result, the tax deed is void. Because we conclude that the decision was correct, we do not reach the question of whether the district court erred in concluding that lack of service to Mr. Alvesteffer rendered the tax deed void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Mr. Montierth purchased the property at the tax sale on August 2, 2007, and on January 17, 2013, he provided notice to Mr. Alvesteffer and Deutsche Bank regarding redemption of the property. That notice stated that the \"time for redemption of said property expired August 2, 2011.\" The district court concluded that the notice was deficient because the date for redemption should have been no earlier than May 2, 2013, the date upon which Mr. Montierth stated he would apply for the tax deed. Mr. Montierth claims that \"it is not clear that [he] misstated the redemption deadline\"; he argues that even if the statement was erroneous, it should not have misled Deutsche Bank, and, thus, substantial compliance with the statute should suffice. He urges us to overrule caselaw holding that when the improper redemption period is provided in the notice, tax deeds are void.

The treasurer stated that the county \"has consistently asserted that the right of redemption expires after four years, even though in practice we will allow redemption of property until issuance of a tax deed.\" After a careful review of the applicable statutes, we conclude that the \"practice\" of the county-to allow redemption until the issuance of the tax deed-reflects the correct interpretation of the statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 16]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-109\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Montierth stated that he intended to apply for a tax deed on May 2, 2013.
