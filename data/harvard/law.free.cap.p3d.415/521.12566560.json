On May 5, 2017, Reynolds petitioned this Court for reinstatement. As required by Rule 11.3 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, 5 O.S.2011, ch. 1, app. 1-A, a Professional Responsibility Tribunal held a hearing on Reynolds's application. The Oklahoma Bar Association supported Reynold's application for reinstatement, and the panel subsequently recommended that Reynolds be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Upon de novo review of the record, we find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   1. Reynolds has complied with the procedural requirements necessary for reinstatement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   2. Reynolds has established by clear and convincing evidence that she has not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in Oklahoma during her suspension;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   3. Reynolds has established by clear and convincing evidence that she possesses the good moral character and fitness necessary for reinstatement to the Oklahoma Bar Association; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   4. Reynolds has established by clear and convincing evidence that she possesses the competency and learning in the law required for reinstatement without re-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petition of Jonna Lynn Reynolds for reinstatement to the Oklahoma Bar Association is therefore GRANTED, and her membership shall be reinstated upon her payment of the costs associated with these proceedings in the amount of $172.78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DONE BY ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT IN CONFERENCE THIS 12TH DAY OF MARCH, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gurich, V.C.J., and Kauger, Winchester, Edmondson, Colbert, Reif, and Wyrick, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Combs, C.J., dissents.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
