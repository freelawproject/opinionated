Sullivan argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict because the trial court failed, sua sponte, to instruct the jury that all deliberations must always involve all jurors. We affirm Sullivan's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We remand, however, for the trial court to correct two scrivener's errors in Sullivan's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The State charged Sullivan with one count of burglary in the second degree. The State alleged that on October 23, 2016, Sullivan and codefendant Aaron Fox unlawfully entered an unoccupied home in Renton with intent to commit a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 A trial was held on January 4 through 10, 2017. The State proposed a set of the standard jury instructions, including Washington Pattern Jury Instruction (WPIC) 1.04\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   As jurors, you have a duty to discuss the case with one another and to deliberate in an effort to reach a unanimous verdict. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but only after you consider the evidence impartially with your fellow jurors. During your deliberations, you should not hesitate to reexamine your own views and to change your opinion based upon further review of the evidence and these instructions. You should not, however, surrender your honest belief about the value or significance of evidence solely because of the opinions of your fellow jurors. Nor should you change your mind just for the purpose of reaching a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 1.04 (4th ed. 2016) (WPIC).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Instruction 14 further informed the jury how to initiate and carry out the deliberative process, and explained that each juror has the right to be heard.

On the second day of deliberations, however, a juror fell ill and the trial court substituted an alternate juror.
