Thusly, Chee and TCW notified Yamamoto of what they wanted to arbitrate. As there were no counterclaims or other claims for relief against Yamamoto, no other notice of relief or remedy needed to be stated.

We reject Yamamoto's contention that\n   <em>\n    Ueoka\n   </em>\n   mandates the denial of a motion to compel where notice is given, but given after the filing of the motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Ueoka\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable because, in\n   <em>\n    Ueoka\n   </em>\n   , \"[d]espite the circuit court's stated willingness to reconsider the stay issue if a demand for arbitration was filed,\n   <em>\n    neither Szymanski nor Hartley ever made a demand for arbitration\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ueoka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261967\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/386/#p395\">\n    107 Hawai'i at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261967\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/107/386/#p395\">\n    114 P.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

[W]e emphasize the importance of utilizing alternative methods of dispute resolution in an effort to reduce the growing number of cases that crowd our courts each year. Allowing a party to compel arbitration after filing a lawsuit (without filing a notice initiating arbitration) does nothing to avoid litigation or reduce the number of cases crowding our courts.

We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the Circuit Court did not err in considering Chee and TCW's January 12, 2015 letter to satisfy the HRS \u00a7 658A-9 requirements to initiate arbitration and that this conclusion is not inconsistent with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ueoka\n   </em>\n   . Rather, it appears that requiring a motion to compel arbitration to be denied, a new demand to be made, and then a new motion to compel to be filed, would be inconsistent with the policy considerations stated by the supreme court and the statutory requirements to initiate arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 9, 2016 Order Compelling Arbitration is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Honorable Edwin C.
