On appeal, Boisselle contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress and by refusing to instruct the jury concerning justifiable homicide in resistance of a felony. Boisselle also contends that the prosecutor committed flagrant misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, thus depriving him of a fair trial. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In July 2014, Michael Boisselle encountered Brandon Zomalt, an old acquaintance. Zomalt told Boisselle that he was homeless, had nowhere to sleep, and that he needed assistance obtaining a food handler's permit in order to secure a job. Boisselle offered to let Zomalt stay with him in his duplex unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 With Boisselle's assistance, Zomalt received his food handler's permit and began working at a nearby restaurant. However, Zomalt was fired after one week for fighting at work. Zomalt was addicted to alcohol and methamphetamine. He also had a history of violence. Several people, including Zomalt's mother and two of his former girlfriends, had been granted protection orders against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After losing his job, Zomalt drank throughout the day. Boisselle did not feel safe around Zomalt and avoided him when possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Boisselle asked Zomalt to move out in the beginning of August. Zomalt apologized for his behavior and asked for another chance. Boisselle agreed to let Zomalt stay, but Zomalt's behavior thereafter worsened. Boisselle believed that Zomalt was following him when he left the duplex. One night, Boisselle woke up to discover Zomalt beside the bed, staring at him. When Boisselle asked Zomalt what he was doing, Zomalt stated that he wanted to ask Boisselle something but changed his mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 One morning, after Boisselle and Zomalt began to argue, Boisselle left the duplex to go to a nearby store. Zomalt followed Boisselle to the store, yelling at him the entire way. Boisselle tried to avoid Zomalt when he returned home. Boisselle went to his bedroom on the second floor of the duplex while Zomalt sat on the couch downstairs, consuming alcohol. Later that night, still in his bedroom, Boisselle told Zomalt that he could not stay at the duplex any longer. Zomalt refused to leave. Boisselle threatened to call the police. Zomalt again refused to leave, prompting Boisselle to grab his jacket and walk downstairs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before he could leave, Zomalt pulled out a gun and pointed it at Boisselle. Boisselle went back upstairs to his bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Boisselle could look over the living room from the upstairs railing. Later, from that vantage point, he saw Zomalt sitting on the couch with the gun placed on the arm of the couch. Boisselle went downstairs and into the kitchen, where he pretended to get something to drink. Upon leaving the kitchen, Boisselle grabbed the gun from the arm of the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 At trial, Boisselle testified about what happened next:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q After you grabbed the gun, what did [Zomalt] do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A He stood up, turned and started coming in my direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q And what did you think he was going to do at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A I thought he was going to come and grab that gun from me. I grabbed the gun, he reacted, turned, and he was coming so ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q What did you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A I turned and I fired a few times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q Now, how far away were you when you were firing these shots?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A From the love seat to the stairs. I don't know exactly that distance, but I know that it's not a very far distance at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q And at that time he was coming at you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 8 On September 1, 2014, South Sound 911 dispatch received an anonymous telephone call from an individual who reported that \"somebody by the name of Mike\" stated that he shot someone at 13008 Military Road East, No. B (the duplex). Shortly thereafter, the Puyallup Police Department anonymous tip line received a telephone call from an individual who reported that \"Mike\" had \"shot someone\" and \"possibly killed him, and it was in self-defense.\" Deputies Ryan Olivarez and Fredrick Wiggins were dispatched to the scene, arriving at 6:50 p.m. Sergeant Christopher Adamson arrived shortly thereafter, at approximately 7:13 p.m. Sergeant Erik Clarkson arrived at the scene at 7:17 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 9 Olivarez and Wiggins knocked on the door of the duplex but received no response. There was, however, a dog inside that was barking aggressively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deputies walked around the outside of the duplex and attempted to look inside, but all of the windows were closed and covered with blinds. There was a light on in the upstairs western bedroom. The deputies smelled a foul odor coming from the house and the garage. Olivarez\n   thought that \"something about it just seemed off\" and was concerned with \"trying to figure out if someone need[ed] help.\" Olivarez and Wiggins then contacted the neighbors in order to gather more information. Two neighbors informed the deputies that they had not seen anyone coming or going from the duplex for about \"four or five days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 10 Adamson listened to the anonymous telephone call made to the Puyallup tip line. Because the anonymous caller provided few details, Adamson was worried \"about whether someone was dead or dying in the house.\" When he arrived, Adamson searched for evidence to substantiate the anonymous telephone calls. Adamson smelled a faint odor coming from the garage that he believed was decaying flesh. Adamson spoke with a neighbor, who told him that a sex offender named Boisselle lived in the duplex. Adamson confirmed that information through the sex offender registry. However, several entries in the computer aided dispatch log indicated that Boisselle did not live at the duplex anymore and that his current location was unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 11 Adamson directed Olivarez to identify and contact the owner of the duplex. Olivarez contacted the owner and learned that he had rented the duplex to a woman who had stopped paying rent. The owner believed that there was a man named Michael living in the duplex who may be the son of the woman, but the owner had been unable to get Michael to pay rent. As a result, the owner was forced to file for bankruptcy and no longer owned the house. Based on the owner's statements, Adamson did not believe that the owner could give valid consent for the police to enter the duplex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 12 Wiggins checked the license plates of the two vehicles parked in the driveway of the duplex through the Department of Licensing and learned that Lola Patterson was the registered owner of both vehicles. Wiggins drove to Patterson's last known address and spoke with her personally. Wiggins learned that Patterson was Michael's\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   mother and that Patterson had not seen or heard from Michael in about three days. Adamson believed that this information \"just adds to the concern that we have somebody that is potentially down in the apartment or the duplex\" because he could not \"account for Mike, or whoever the victim is.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13 Upon arriving at the duplex, Clarkson also noticed a \"really bad odor\" that \"might be rotting garbage, or something like that\" coming from the garage. Clarkson walked around the duplex and attempted to look inside, but the windows were covered. The dog inside the duplex followed Clarkson around, barking and growling. When Clarkson reached the sliding door at the back of the duplex, the dog aggressively charged at the sliding door and pushed the blinds out of the way. Clarkson looked through the sliding door and could see overturned furniture, which he interpreted as \"signs of [a] struggle\" and an indication that \"something bad could have happened in there.\" Clarkson and Adamson agreed to contact animal control in case entry into the duplex was necessary. Adamson believed that he had an obligation to force entry into the duplex to determine whether someone was dead or dying and for the abandoned dog's safety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14 Clarkson noticed a man standing across the street who seemed interested in the activities of the police. Clarkson went to talk to the man, who identified himself as Christopher Williamson. Williamson stated that he was a friend of Zomalt and that Zomalt had been staying in the duplex with Michael. Williamson had not seen or heard from Zomalt for several weeks. Clarkson ended his conversation with Williamson at around 7:50 p.m., roughly one hour after the first deputy arrived at the duplex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15 Following his conversation with Williamson, Clarkson received a call from Auburn Police Detective Faini. Faini told Clarkson that Auburn police were investigating a possible missing person and homicide case and that it may be related to Clarkson's welfare check. Faini told Clarkson that the Auburn investigation concerned a roadside carpet burning incident and that he would be interested to know if there was any torn up carpet in the duplex. Faini told Clarkson that the possible victim's name was Zomalt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 Clarkson then contacted Adamson. Clarkson told Adamson that Zomalt was associated by DNA evidence with a roadside burning incident in Auburn. Adamson told Clarkson that he was able to look through the sliding door and see that carpet had been ripped up from the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 Adamson and Clarkson did not believe that they had enough time or information to get a search warrant. Clarkson testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A I don't even know how you would write that, two anonymous tips come in, and torn up carpet. I have no idea what crime, or if any crime we are dealing with, it just doesn't look good....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q What is it in your mind that you thought you were dealing with at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A Dealing with a suspicious welfare check and possibly someone that's down inside, has been hurt or dead, we don't know. So at that point I'm thinking the bottom line is you can't walk away from this. You have got a duty to do something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 18 With no person apparently able to consent to a police entry of the unit and believing that they did not have a sufficient basis to obtain a search warrant, Adamson and Clarkson made a joint decision to force entry into the duplex. Clarkson broke through the front door. An animal control officer secured the dog. The officers then performed a security sweep of the duplex, looking for anyone who was hurt. Adamson and Clarkson searched the second floor of the duplex while Wiggins and Olivarez searched the first floor. The officers checked all of the rooms, looking in closets and other large spaces for a person or a body but ignoring drawers and other areas where a person could not fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 19 Sergeant Clarkson believed that the smell was coming from inside of the garage and was consistent with a dead body. Once all of the rooms inside the duplex had been checked, deputies Wiggins and Olivarez forced entry into the garage from inside of the duplex. Once inside the garage, all four officers could see a large, rolled up carpet with a shoe sticking out and maggots pouring out of the bottom. Sergeant Clarkson opened the garage door using the automatic door opener and all four officers went around to the outside of the garage for a clear view of the carpet. From outside of the house, the officers saw an arm hanging out of the front end of the carpet. Clarkson told the other officers that \"this is a crime scene now,\" and that \"it's time we have to seal this off.\" None of the officers collected evidence or touched the carpet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 20 Boisselle contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search of the duplex. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 21 The United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. CONST. amend.

The trial court found that Wiggins \"thought there 'potentially' was a body inside the duplex.\" The trial court found that neighbors told Olivarez that \"nobody had been seen at the home in 'about a week,' and the dog had not been outside during that time.\" The trial court found that Clarkson \"believed from the information provided by the anonymous caller that someone inside the duplex was 'possibly shot or dead.' \" The trial court found that \"[n]one of the information the deputies gathered prior to their entry confirmed the defendant or Mr. Zomalt was alive or safe. The information heightened the\n   deputies' concern over the welfare of those two men.\" The trial court found that all four of the officers \"believed, both subjectively and collectively, that it was their duty to public safety and welfare, and part of their community caretaking function, to enter the duplex without a warrant.\" These findings, which are verities on appeal, support the conclusion that the officers subjectively and reasonably believed that assistance may have been immediately required to protect one or more individuals inside the duplex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 32 Several of the trial court's findings also support the conclusion that the officers were not primarily motivated by an intent to search for or seize evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that the Auburn police put out a bulletin looking for Zomalt. \"That bulletin was provided only to fellow law enforcement agencies, captioned 'Suspicious Circumstances-attempt to locate.' \" However, the trial court also noted that there was no evidence that the deputies had seen the bulletin.

This is so, he asserts, because the officers did not know what they had\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because they waited an inordinate amount of time between arriving at the duplex and entering to check on the health and safety of the occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 34 We are unpersuaded by Boisselle's contention that the officers did not act quickly enough to justify the intrusion under the community caretaking function exception. What constitutes an \"emergency\" and what steps are necessary to render immediate assistance is highly dependent on the circumstances. Indeed, an officer may reasonably believe that assistance is necessary even though the officer cannot see or hear an individual in need of help. We have previously held that an officer who could not ascertain the health or safety of an individual and suspected that the individual might be dead was nevertheless properly acting pursuant to his community caretaking function by entering the individual's residence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Boisselle cites to no authority that places a time clock on an officer's decision concerning whether to render assistance pursuant to the community caretaking function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 35 In any event, the record establishes that the officers acted promptly given the circumstances. From the moment they arrived at the duplex, until entry, the officers individually and collectively began to ascertain the situation at hand. This included checking doors and windows to determine whether anyone was inside the duplex, contacting both the owner of the duplex and the individual listed on the lease in attempts to obtain consent to enter, questioning neighbors, and contacting animal control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the officers reached a point where two things were clear: (1) obtaining consent to enter was not possible as no person entitled to consent could be identified, and (2) there was nothing further the officers could do to discern the welfare of any person inside the unit absent entry.

The trial court did not require the defense to file a complete set of proposed jury instructions, but did order the defense to propose any instructions that it was seeking that were different from the State's proposed instructions. The State filed its proposed instructions on April 28, 2016. Boisselle filed his proposed instructions on May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 49 Boisselle's proposed instructions included two Washington pattern jury instructions, 11 Washington Practice: Washington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal 16.02 and 16.03 (3rd ed. 2008) (WPIC), addressing justifiable homicide. The first concerned justifiable homicide in defense of self and read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Homicide is justifiable when committed in the lawful defense of a defendant when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   1) a defendant reasonably believed that the person slain intended to commit a felony or to inflict death or great personal injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   2) a defendant reasonably believed that there was imminent danger of such harm being accomplished; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   3) a defendant employed such force and means as a reasonably prudent person would use under the same or similar conditions as they reasonably appeared to the defendant, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances as they appeared to him, at the time of and prior to the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The second concerned justifiable homicide in resistance to a felony. That instruction read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Homicide is justifiable when committed in the actual resistance of an attempt to commit a felony upon a defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A defendant may employ such force and means as a reasonably prudent person would use under the same or similar conditions as they reasonably appeared to the defendant, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances as they appeared to him at the time and prior to the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Boisselle did not propose any instructions defining any felony offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 50 On May 18, 2016, after both parties rested their cases, the trial court excused the jury with orders to return the following day for closing arguments. As the court recessed, defense counsel stated that he had additional instructions that he would be proposing. Defense counsel provided those instructions to the State and to the court via e-mail at 4:19 p.m. that evening. The e-mail listed 18 additional instructions by WPIC number only. The following morning, at the hearing to discuss the instructions, defense counsel brought a packet of proposed instructions that included definitions of the felony offenses of burglary, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and felony harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 51 The trial court refused to instruct the jury on Boisselle's theory of justified homicide in resistance to a felony. The trial court issued an order in which it made detailed findings concerning the proposed instruction. The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [E]verything put forward by the defense suggested to the State that the defense in this case was based on the theory of self-defense involving defense of the person, or defending a physical attack on the defendant. That information included the general language in the omnibus order, the initial packet of instructions proposed by the defense, opening statement given by defense counsel, cross-examination of the State's witnesses, and the direct of the defendant. All of that evidence suggested the defendant was personally fending off a physical attack at the time of this shooting. During his entire direct examination, the defendant never suggested that he shot the victim for any reason other than to prevent a direct personal attack on the\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   defendant's person. The State's cross-examination of the defendant was clearly focused on the issue of the defendant's use of force to defend his person from an attack by the victim. In point of fact, the first time the Court realized the defense was putting forth a different theory was when the court looked at the subject matter of the WPICs listed in defense counsel's e-mail after the close of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 52 The trial court further found that the evidence presented at trial did not properly put at issue Boisselle's alternative theory. The trial court found that \"[t]here was no evidence presented by the defense that suggest the defendant's act of shooting the victim was,\n   <em>\n    at the time of the shooting,\n   </em>\n   done in resistance to the commission of a felony.\" The trial court found that the State \"only had notice of the theory of self-defense that is defense of the person, and the evidence actually presented by the defense establish only that theory and no other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 53 Finally, the trial court found that Boisselle would not be prejudiced by the court's refusal to give the proposed instruction. The trial court noted that \"[d]efense of self and defense in resistance to a felony are closely related, as every person who defends being attacked is resisting the commission of a felony assault.\" Accordingly, the trial court found that Boisselle would \"still be allowed to argue his theory of the case, which is the theory supported by the actual evidence presented at trial, which is the defendant was defending himself against a personal attack by the victim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 54 The trial court found that there was no evidence adduced at trial to support the defense of justifiable homicide in resistance of a felony. Rather, all of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Boisselle, indicated that Boisselle was defending himself against death or great personal injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court refused to give the proposed instruction. This was not an abuse of the court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 55 Moreover, although he asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to issue his proposed instruction, Boisselle does not attempt to analyze whether a justifiable homicide defense applies in the context of the felonies that he suggests that he was defending against. We have previously held that such a defense \"applies only if the felony which was sought to be prevented threatens life or great bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For its part, the State presented expert testimony that Zomalt was shot three times in the head and that each shot was a contact wound caused by a gun touching his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 60 During closing argument, Boisselle's attorney argued that Boisselle shot Zomalt in defense of his own life, after Zomalt stood up from the couch and began to chase after Boisselle.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   [Boisselle] went, he grabbed the gun off of the arm of the love seat. He ran, trying to get away, he was going to go up the stairs. At that moment when he takes the gun, Mr. Zomalt gets up out of that couch .... So he gets up off this love seat, starts coming after Mr. Boisselle. Mr. Boisselle turns and fires the gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   So he picks up the gun, turns and just fires, and his intent at that moment is fear induced, because Mr. Zomalt is chasing\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   after him in his own house.... Mr. Zomalt got up out of that chair, started coming after him, and as I said, Mr. Zomalt put the fear of God in Mr. Boisselle and-in a split second, ladies and gentlemen, you can see the distance that we are talking about-in a split second he had to react, and what he did was he started firing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 61 In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor addressed the defense theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The law does allow you to defend yourself against an attack with reasonable force. If you are about to get beat down with fists, you can respond with fists. If you are about to get shot with a gun, you can shoot a gun. There is a big difference between defending yourself with reasonable force\n   and defending yourself with deadly force. This defendant went to the end first. His reaction to what he says was a threat was to fire multiple gunshots, including three to the head. Keep in mind, it's only possible if you reject Dr. Lacy's testimony that these are contact wounds....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   So now let's talk about the actual law of self-defense. Instruction No. 26 says, necessary means under the circumstances as they reasonably appear to the actor, no reasonably effective alternative appeared to exist and the amount of force used was reasonable to effect the purpose. You can respond in kind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Mr. Boisselle said I was going to get beat up. So he can beat him back up or fight back. And you know what? If a fistfight ensues and Mr. Zomalt is winning and inflicting a severe beating or death on Michael Boisselle, then he can fire shots.\n   <em>\n    There's no preemptive strike in self-defense.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Boisselle then interposed an objection on the basis that the prosecutor had misstated the law. The objection was overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 62 The prosecutor continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   There is no preemptive strike. And when you read your instructions and it talks about standing your ground in your own home, no duty to retreat, all that stuff is true, right, but it's\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   all filtered through reasonably necessary. It doesn't matter if Mr. Zomalt was told to leave and didn't, you can't shoot him down. It doesn't matter if Mr. Boisselle hours earlier put a gun in your face, you can't take the gun and shoot him down. There has to be a threat of great personal injury, severe pain and injury or death before you can use deadly force, which is what this defendant did. He used deadly force. And he told you from the witness stand, I pointed at him and I fired and fired and fired and fired and fired until he dropped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 63 The prosecutor then addressed the justifiable homicide jury instruction\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Instruction No. 22 that sets out self-defense uses the word \"reasonably\" four separate times. Four. And that's because the law of self-defense is based on necessity. You can respond in kind. And if you don't respond in kind, you are going to be held accountable. Are you allowed to make a mistake? Sure. Actual danger isn't necessary, as long as you reasonably perceived the danger. And see, here's how the law of self-defense works: There is a subjective standard. There is an objective standard. The subjective standard is this: Did Michael Boisselle, himself, believe that he had to defend himself against Brandon Zomalt with deadly force? Did he believe it? That's the first question for you folks to ask. Did Michael Boisselle believe in it? Not just did he believe it. Did he reasonably believe it, based on everything he knew? ... Defendant said he had to do it, but was that conclusion by him reasonable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   The second one is an objective standard and the difference between the two is this .... You 12 will determine objectively whether or not what he said was reasonable. Would a reasonable person do what Michael Boisselle did if that reasonable person knew everything Michael Boisselle knew? ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   A couple of final things. Even if all of that is true, the response, the deadly force that's used, is no more than necessary to accomplish the act. And so if Brandon Zomalt is a threat of great personal injury, and charged Michael Boisselle and all that is true, and the defendant's fear is reasonable he can shoot him twice, and then he stops, because then he stopped the threat.\n   <em>\n    He doesn't get to fire five. He doesn't get to fire three in his head. And when you over self-defend, you assault.\n   </em>\n   And when you assault and cause death, you commit Felony Murder Two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   If everything he says is true, then he's a murderer, because he can't use the amount-the nature of the force, deadly, and the amount of the force, five gunshots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   (Emphasis added.) At this point, Boisselle interposed an objection, again arguing that the prosecutor was misstating the law. The objection was overruled. The prosecutor continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    You can't over defend.\n   </em>\n   You don't get to put three in the brain because you're angry that the guy came at you. You can't. And even if the defendant can put three shots in Brandon, one in the back of his head from a distance of five to six feet, he doesn't get to finish him off. That's an assault. That's felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 64 On appeal, Boisselle contends that the prosecutor's \"preemptive strike\" and \"over defend\" arguments were misstatements of the law. Boisselle asserts that, to establish a claim of self-defense, he \"need only show reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm and imminent danger to himself or to another,\" and that he \"need not show actual danger.\" Br. of Appellant at 74. Boisselle also asserts that the prosecutor's argument likely caused the jurors to discredit his claim of self-defense based solely on the number of shots fired. Br. of Appellant at 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 65 The prosecutor's statements, considered in light of the entire argument, were not misstatements of the law. Boisselle argued to the jury that the amount of force that he used was reasonably necessary to protect himself under the circumstances as he understood them. Responding to that argument, the prosecutor argued to the jury that the amount of force that Boisselle used was\n   <em>\n    more than that which was reasonably necessary\n   </em>\n   under the circumstances. Rather than shooting Zomalt to protect himself from imminent danger of great bodily harm or death, the prosecutor argued, Boisselle either preemptively killed Zomalt by inflicting three contact wounds to his head or incapacitated Zomalt and continued to shoot him until he died.

There was nothing they saw or heard that allowed them to determine a person was alive inside the duplex in need of immediate help.

As the majority appears to see it, the lead opinion and the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   articulated different three part tests to determine whether the community caretaking exception applies. Justice Chambers' test differs primarily in that the first factor did not require a need for immediate action and the third factor did not require an emergency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the apparent belief that the two tests are mutually exclusive, the majority attempts to accommodate both to the facts of this case, and in so doing, stretches the meaning of \"immediate\" and \"emergency\" beyond recognition. The effort is unnecessary and unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 70 The better approach is to recognize that the lead opinion in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   does exactly what it says it is doing: establishes a test that specifically applies to \"the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, also known as the 'save life' exception, a subset of the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , at 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=303%20P.3d%201047\">\n    303 P.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.
