FISCHER, PRESIDING JUDGE:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 1 Geron Taylor appeals the district court's judgment in favor of the City of Bixby in this civil rights action. The appeal has been assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36(b), 12 O.S. Supp. 2013, ch. 15, app. 1, and the matter stands submitted without appellate briefing. The City is entitled to judgment with respect to Taylor's tort claims and his State and federal constitutional claims except in one respect. It cannot be determined from the summary judgment record whether Taylor has a claim based on the ten days he served in the City's jail after his arrest for speeding and driving without a license. In all other respects, the district court's judgment is affirmed. This case is remanded for a determination of whether Taylor has a claim based on his ten-day incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 On September 8, 2011, Taylor was stopped by a Bixby police officer for driving 49 miles per hour in a 40-mile per hour speed zone. During the interrogation that followed, Taylor failed to produce a driver's license, admitted that he did not have a driver's license and admitted that he had never possessed a valid driver's license. Taylor was arrested and charged with speeding and driving without a license. It was subsequently determined that Taylor had been convicted of driving without a valid driver's license on nine previous occasions. On October 4, 2011, Taylor appeared in the Bixby Municipal Court pro se and entered a plea of guilty to both the speeding and driver's license charges. He was fined $703 and sentenced to ten days in the City jail. Taylor served the jail time but did not pay the fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Represented by counsel, Taylor filed this case on January 20, 2012, after his release from jail, asserting violations of his Oklahoma and federal constitutional rights as well as Oklahoma tort law claims. In support of these claims, Taylor alleged facts concerning his arrest, conviction and the conditions of his confinement and treatment while incarcerated. The City was named as the only defendant and removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The City filed a motion for summary judgment to which Taylor responded. By order dated December 12, 2012, the federal court granted the City's motion, in part, denied it in part, and remanded the\n   case to the state district court for further proceedings. With respect to some of the issues, the federal court determined that Taylor had failed to exhaust available state remedies. The following day, Taylor filed a pro se application for post-conviction relief in Bixby Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In his post-conviction application, Taylor argued that prior to pleading guilty, he was not advised of his right to counsel, right to a jury trial, right to appeal, right to bond pending appeal and that he was fined in excess of the maximum permitted by law. On May 3, 2013, the Bixby Municipal Court allowed Taylor to withdraw his original guilty plea, vacated the October 4, 2011 judgment and granted Taylor a new trial. The court's order states Taylor \"was not advised of his right to appeal the decision of the Court or the right to withdraw his plea ....\" The City appointed counsel to represent Taylor and his case was tried to a jury on August 1, 2013. The jury found Taylor guilty of driving without a valid driver's license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Judgment and Sentence was entered on February 6, 2014. This time Taylor was fined $300, the maximum fine allowed for driving without a license, and ordered to pay court costs in the amount of $51, both of which he paid. The Judgment and Sentence does not impose or refer to any jail time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The City then filed a motion for summary judgment in this case and Taylor filed a response. Taylor appeals the district court's January 8, 2016 Final Order and Journal Entry of Judgment granting the City's motion for summary judgment, and finding that Taylor had not and would not be able to state a claim for relief based on the circumstances of his arrest, conviction and incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Title 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2056 governs the procedure for summary judgment in this case.

First, we review Taylor's petition and the federal court's judgment to determine what claims survived the federal court proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I. Taylor's State Constitutional Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In his summary judgment briefing, Taylor cites seven Oklahoma constitutional rights he claims were violated by the City. In addition to the Oklahoma constitutional provisions cited in the previous paragraph, Taylor relies on Article 2 \u00a7 2 guaranteeing the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and Article 2 \u00a7 6 guaranteeing a speedy and certain remedy for every wrong in the courts of this State. Taylor claims he has a private right of action to pursue violations of each of these constitutional rights, citing\n   <em>\n    Bosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    2013 OK 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    305 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 In\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   , a pretrial detainee alleged that he was subjected to excessive force by law enforcement officials during the booking process at a county detention facility. The Court held that Bosh had a private right of action to enforce a claim of excessive force pursuant to Article 2 \u00a7 30 of the Oklahoma Constitution even though the county was exempt from tort liability pursuant to the Governmental Tort Claims Act, 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 172.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Whether the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   establishes a private right of action pursuant to other provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution has not been entirely settled. \"There has been disagreement among Oklahoma's lower federal and state courts regarding the scope of\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   's holding.\"\n   <em>\n    Daffern v.

Certainly,\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   establishes a private right of action available to pretrial detainees subjected to excessive and unreasonable force, in certain circumstances, after an arrest. It would \"defy reason\" to refuse to extend the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   to pretrial detainees who claim they were unlawfully arrested merely because of their race.\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    2013 OK 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    305 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

City of Norman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6893912\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/341/689/\">\n    2014 OK 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6893912\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/341/689/\">\n    341 P.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We need not address that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The City's motion for summary judgment asserts as undisputed material facts that Taylor was stopped for speeding, during the stop Taylor admitted that he did not have a valid driver's license and he had never possessed a valid driver's license, and Taylor was arrested for driving without a license. Taylor's response to the City's motion admits each of these facts. Consequently, Taylor admits, for summary judgment purposes, that he was not arrested because he was black and that there was probable cause for his arrest. The district court's judgment in favor of the City with respect to Taylor's Article 2 \u00a7 30 claim based on the circumstances of his arrest is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 But Taylor's summary judgment briefing also argues that he has an Article 2 \u00a7 30 claim that applies to the conditions of his ten-day incarceration after the Bixby Municipal Court vacated his October 4, 2011 conviction. According to Taylor's theory, his Article 2 \u00a7 30 claim based on his treatment during incarceration in October 2011 did not arise until May 3, 2013, after his original conviction was vacated and he was released from jail. Taylor's theory of recovery is novel, and unsupported by any authority. At the time the treatment occurred about which Taylor complains, he had been convicted. And, he was subsequently convicted again after his original conviction was vacated. To follow Taylor's theory to its logical conclusion, his Article 2 \u00a7 30 claim arose on May 3, 2013, when his original conviction was vacated. Therefore, the claim would have been\n   extinguished on August 1, 2013, when he was convicted a second time for the same offense. We find instructive the United States Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

Article 2 \u00a7 9\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Because his conviction was not vacated until after his incarceration, an Article 2 \u00a7 30 claim is not available to Taylor with respect to his complaints regarding the conditions of his confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryson v.

However, because Taylor was incarcerated as a result of his conviction, his claim arising from the conditions of his confinement is based on Article 2 \u00a7 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Article 2 \u00a7 7, Due Process of Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The basis of Taylor's due process claim is not clear but seems to concern the fact that he entered a guilty plea without being advised of his right to counsel and a jury trial.

No Oklahoma case has addressed whether a private right of action exists pursuant to Article 2 \u00a7 19 or \u00a7 20 to a person denied the right to counsel or a jury trial in an Oklahoma criminal proceeding. For the following reasons, we hold that there is no private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 The federal district court dismissed Taylor's Sixth Amendment claim without\n   prejudice, finding that he had yet to pursue available State post-conviction relief so it could not be determined whether Taylor had a cause of action for violation of his right to counsel.

But that remedy is limited to violations of federal constitutional rights and Taylor did not refile his Sixth Amendment claim after it was dismissed without prejudice by the federal court. In contrast to section 1983, no Oklahoma statute provides a civil remedy in damages for a violation of Article 2 \u00a7 20. The statute permitting those wrongfully convicted to recover damages, 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 154, is unavailable to Taylor. He was not convicted of a felony, he pled guilty, and he has not been pardoned or judicially absolved of guilt after a finding of innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 154(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just the opposite, Taylor was convicted after his second trial and did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 For the same reasons, we find that Taylor does not have a civil remedy in damages for a violation of Article 2 \u00a7 19, noting that he was provided a jury trial prior to his second conviction. The district court correctly granted the City's motion for summary judgment regarding these alleged constitutional violations and that aspect of the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   E. Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Article 2 \u00a7 2 provides: \"All persons have the inherent right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry.\" Section 6 provides: \"The courts of justice of the State shall be open to every person, and speedy and certain remedy afforded for every wrong and for every injury to person, property, or reputation; and right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, delay, or prejudice.\" Other than to claim that the City violated Article 2 \u00a7 2 on October 4, 2011, when he \"appeared in court,\" Taylor does not support these alleged constitutional violations with any specific factual contentions. We are unable to find anything more than a generalized relationship between those provisions and the harm Taylor claims in this case. For example, the courts of justice were open when Taylor obtained his post-conviction relief and they were open when Taylor filed this suit. The district court determined that Taylor had \"not sufficiently stated claims for violation of his constitutional rights.\" With respect to Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6, we agree. That aspect of the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II. The Surviving Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 Consequently, we hold that Taylor has potentially stated a claim for violation of two provisions of Article 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution: section 9 concerning cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines, and section 7 concerning due process. Taylor has also stated State tort law claims for assault and battery and the tort of outrage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Article 2 \u00a7 9, Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Taylor's petition alleges that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment while he was incarcerated because he\n   was denied toilet paper, an adequate shower, a warm blanket, adequate food and water and subjected to excessive force and racial slurs. He claims this was a violation of his rights protected by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 2 \u00a7 9 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 In its analysis of this claim, the federal district court applied the two-step analysis established in\n   <em>\n    Farmer v.

First, the court determined that the conditions about which Taylor complained were not \"sufficiently serious\" to constitute a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 834,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court found that Taylor had failed to show \"deliberate indifference\" by jail officials to a substantial risk of serious harm posed by the conditions about which Taylor complained.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The federal court granted the City judgment as to Taylor's Eighth Amendment claim based on the conditions of his confinement. Taylor did not appeal and that judgment is now final. As the City correctly argues, that judgment precludes Taylor from relitigating the same issue in State court. Once a court has decided an issue necessary to its judgment, the same parties may not relitigate that issue.\n   <em>\n    Okla. Dep't of Pub. Safety v.

City of Joliet\n   </em>\n   , 580 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Stein v.

Therefore, it cannot be determined from the summary judgment record whether this resulted from a clerical omission, a finding that no additional jail time beyond the time served was warranted or a finding that the crime did not warrant the imposition of jail time. Further, because Taylor's original sentence was vacated after the federal court's judgment, any potential claim he has is not precluded by that ruling.\n   <em>\n    Nealis v. Baird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451132\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/996/438/\">\n    1999 OK 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451132\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/996/438/\">\n    996 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the City has failed to show that all facts material to its motion are supported by acceptable evidentiary material in this regard.\n   <em>\n    Spirgis v.
