Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Ronald J. Israel, Judge.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Our review of the documents submitted to this court pursuant to NRAP 3(g) reveals a jurisdictional defect. Specifically, the notice of appeal appears to be untimely filed under NRAP 4(a) because it appears that it was filed before the entry of a final written judgment, and is therefore of no effect.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     NRAP 4(a)(1) ;\n     <em>\n      Rust v. Clark Cty. School District\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8559079\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/103/686/\">\n      103 Nev. 686\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8559079\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/103/686/\">\n      747 P.2d 1380\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1987). A premature notice of appeal filed before entry of a final, written judgment is of no effect, and a district court's oral pronouncement from the bench, a minute order, and even an unfiled written order are ineffective for any purpose. Accordingly, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction, and we\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     ORDER this appeal DISMISSED.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
