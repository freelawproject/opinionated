A premature notice of appeal filed before entry of a final, written judgment is of no effect, and a district court's oral pronouncement from the bench, a minute order, and even an unfiled written order are ineffective for any purpose. Accordingly, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction, and we</p><p id=\"p-10\">ORDER this appeal DISMISSED.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
