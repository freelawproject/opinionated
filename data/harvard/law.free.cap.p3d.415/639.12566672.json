The superior court suppressed this evidence, ruling that the search exceeded the warrant's scope, and we granted discretionary review. The State argues that under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the superior court erred when it concluded that the locked gun safe's contents were outside the warrant's scope. We agree with the State because the warrant authorized a search for firearms and because firearms were likely to be found in the locked gun safe. We also decline the Respondents' request to affirm on the alternative basis that the Washington\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Constitution's greater privacy protections under article I, section 7 include that a premises search warrant must expressly authorize the search of locked containers likely to hold the search's object. Accordingly, we reverse the superior court's ruling suppressing the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. SEARCH WARRANT AND ADDENDUM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 On October 27, 2015, Deputy Martin Zurfluh obtained a search warrant to search the Respondents' property, including their residence, for evidence of possession of stolen property and utility theft. The search warrant was limited to a stolen power meter and its accessories. An arrest warrant for Witkowski was also issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 29, officers executed the search and arrest warrants. After this search, Deputy Zurfluh requested an addendum to the search warrant. In his affidavit, Deputy Zurfluh explained that after entering the Respondents' residence, police found drug paraphernalia, ammunition, one locked gun safe, one unlocked gun safe, a rifle case, and surveillance cameras. Deputy Zurfluh knew that the Respondents were felons and were prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The search warrant addendum authorized police to search at the Respondents' street address for evidence of unlawful possession of a firearm, identity theft, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia. The warrant addendum defined the area to be searched for this evidence as the main residence, a shed, and any vehicles and outbuildings at the street address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 The addendum authorized the seizure of evidence including,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. [f]irearms, firearms parts, and accessories, including but not limited to rifles, shotguns, handguns, ammunition, scopes, cases, cleaning kits, and holsters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Surveillance Systems used or intended to be used in the furtherance of any of the above listed crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    6. Any item used as a container for item 4.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 68 (emphasis added). Notably, the addendum did not identify either of the gun safes as items to be seized, although Deputy Zurfluh stated in his affidavit as part of his description of the initial search that officers had found two gun safes in the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 When executing the warrant addendum, officers opened the locked gun safe. They found firearms inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7 Following the second search, the State charged Respondents with numerous counts including first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. Witkowski was additionally charged with seven counts of possession of a stolen firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. SUPPRESSION MOTIONS AND HEARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Respondents moved to suppress all evidence found as a result of the search. At the suppression hearing, Deputy Zurfluh testified that the locked gun safe was located in the kitchen and that it was about the size of a refrigerator. Deputy Zurfluh suspected that there were firearms in the safe because he had found ammunition in the home. In Deputy Zurfluh's experience, tall, upright safes were typically gun safes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 Deputy Zurfluh further testified that when officers opened the locked gun safe, they found 11 loaded rifles and shotguns with their serial numbers filed off, a handgun, a police scanner, a large quantity of cash, ammunition, and cameras. The unlocked gun safe was empty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 10 The superior court suppressed the \"evidence found inside the gun safes\" under the Fourth Amendment. CP at 100. The superior court ruled that the addendum to the warrant \"did not include the gun[ ] safes or containers for firearms\" and that gun safes are not \"personal effects,\" so that \"[t]he search of the safe[s] did not fall within the scope of the search warrant.\" CP at 99-100. The superior court later denied the State's motions for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State filed motions for discretionary review in both Respondents' cases. We granted the State's motions for discretionary review and consolidated the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.

THE FOURTH AMENDMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State argues that the superior court erred under the Fourth Amendment when it suppressed evidence found inside the locked safe based on its determination that the search of the safe fell outside the warrant addendum's scope. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. PRINCIPLES OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Fourth Amendment provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   U.S. CONST. amend.

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE WARRANT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 15 The State argues that the locked gun safe was within the warrant's scope because under the Fourth Amendment, when the warrant authorized the search of the premises for evidence of firearms, it authorized the search of the locked gun safe. The Respondents argue that the search exceeded the warrant's scope because the warrant excluded the locked gun safe by negative implication and because Deputy Zurfluh was aware of the locked gun safe but did not include it in the search warrant. We agree with the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   1.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   a. THE WARRANT ADDENDUM AUTHORIZED THE SEARCH OF LOCKED CONTAINERS IN WHICH THE OBJECT OF THE SEARCH WAS LIKELY TO BE FOUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 17 Here, the warrant addendum listed the objects of the search as including firearms and firearm accessories. And Deputy Zurfluh testified that he suspected the close-to-refrigerator-sized, locked safe contained firearms because he had found ammunition in the home. Deputy Zurfluh also testified that in his experience, a tall, upright safe would be used to store guns. Under the rule expressed in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , because one object of the search was \"[f]irearms,\" CP at 68, the premises search warrant addendum authorized the search of the locked gun safe as an area in which the object of the search was likely to be found.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191830\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/798/#p820\">\n    456 U.S at 820-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191830\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/798/#p820\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Respondents assert that the rule from\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   is dicta. We nevertheless apply the rule in light of the substantial federal authority on this point. Numerous federal circuit courts have applied the rule from\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   to authorize the search of locked items under a premises warrant that could contain the object of the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

GUN SAFE NOT EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF AFFIDAVIT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 28\n   <em>\n    Llamas-Villa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   support the Respondents' legal argument that a warrant could exclude by negative implication items known to the officer requesting the warrant and listed in a warrant affidavit but intentionally omitted from the warrant itself. However, we disagree that exclusion by negative implication applies to the search warrant addendum at issue here because the affidavit and addendum were identical in their lists of places to be searched and items to be seized. Thus, there is no inference that the locked safe was intentionally excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 29 Here, the affidavit in support of the warrant addendum listed the following places to be searched:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 [Street address of the residence.] A brown manufactured home that has two windows with white trim facing south and a fully covered front porch attached to the west side of the residence[ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 A brown, elevated shed located northeast of the main residence\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 Any and all vehicles and outbuildings located on the property\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   CP at 66 (bold omitted). It also included an extensive list of items to be seized, including, as relevant here,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   1. [f]irearms, firearms parts, and accessories, including but not limited to rifles, shotguns, handguns, ammunition, scopes, cases, cleaning kits, and holsters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   4. Surveillance Systems used or intended to be used in the furtherance of any of the above listed crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   6. Any item used as a container for item 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   CP at 61. Notably, the warrant addendum's list of places that could be searched and things that could be seized was identical to the lists in Deputy Zurfluh's affidavit in support of the warrant addendum. Where the affidavit and addendum contained identical lists of places to be searched and items to be seized, there is no inference that the locked safe was intentionally excluded, and we hold that exclusion by negative implication does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 30 And although the warrant addendum affidavit disclosed the presence of the locked gun safe within the residence, it did so in passing, as part of a description of the events that occurred after police executed the original warrant. As part of a lengthy description of the residence's interior, Deputy Zurfluh stated, \"In the dining room area there was a large gun safe. There was a spare bedroom to the right, on the east side of the house.\" CP at 65. It is only this brief reference to the locked gun safe that the Respondents argue gives rise to an inference that the locked gun safe was intentionally omitted from the warrant addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 31 We hold that the warrant addendum affidavit's brief reference to the existence of a locked gun safe as part of a description of the initial search does not give rise to an inference that the locked gun safe was intentionally omitted from the warrant addendum. To the contrary, because the warrant addendum affidavit's lists did not include a locked gun safe and because the superior court authorized identical lists in the addendum, there is no inference that the addendum intentionally omitted a locked gun safe. Because such an inference is not sensible under\n   the circumstances, exclusion by negative implication does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254435\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/73/#p81\">\n    536 U.S. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254435\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/73/#p81\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, although\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Llamas-Villa\n   </em>\n   support that exclusion by negative implication could apply to search warrants, it does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   iii. \" CONTAINERS FOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS \" DID NOT EXCLUDE \" CONTAINERS FOR GUNS \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 32 As for the Respondents' argument that by listing \"containers for surveillance equipment,\" the search warrant addendum necessarily excluded \"containers for guns,\" we disagree for three reasons. Br. of Resp't Witkowski at 7. First, the Respondents provide no case law holding that the inclusion of containers for one item necessarily excludes containers for another item.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a rule improperly ascribes a hypertechnical meaning to a search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perrone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370266\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/538/#p549\">\n    119 Wash.2d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%20611\">\n    834 P.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 33 Second, the Respondents' rule is counter to the established rule from\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   : that by authorizing a search for \"firearms,\" the warrant also authorized a search within containers likely to hold firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 34 Third, the Respondents' argument conflates the items to be seized with the places to be searched: even if the inclusion of surveillance containers in the list of\n   <em>\n    items to be seized\n   </em>\n   necessarily excluded other types of containers, this would not affect the list of\n   <em>\n    places that could be searched\n   </em>\n   . Here, the locked safe was a place searched and not an item seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 35 In conclusion, we hold that the warrant authorized a search for firearms, and thus, the warrant addendum also authorized a search of the locked gun safe as within the scope of the addendum and under settled Fourth Amendment law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   III. ARTICLE I, SECTION 7\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 36 Next, we address Berven's article I, section 7 argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Respondents argue that we may affirm the superior court on the basis that the Washington Constitution's greater privacy protections under article I, section 7 include that a premises search warrant must expressly authorize the search of locked containers. In response, the State argues that under article I, section 7, a premises search warrant authorizes a search of locked containers therein, even if the search warrant does not explicitly list the containers. As discussed, we hold that the search was proper under the Fourth Amendment. The Respondents' arguments for a different outcome under article I, section 7 fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A. NECESSITY OF A\n   <em>\n    GUNWALL\n   </em>\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 37 At the outset, the Respondents and the State agree that a\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   analysis is unnecessary because it is well settled that article I, section 7 is interpreted independently of the Fourth Amendment.
