Because the judgment in this case was entered before the January 1, 2018, effective date of SB 896, its provisions do not apply. Or. Laws 2017, ch. 529, \u00a7 28 (providing that SB 896 applies \"on appeal from a judgment or order entered by the trial court on or after the effective date of this 2017 Act\").\n      </p>\n     </footnote>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for two counts of second-degree rape, ORS 163.365 (Counts 1 and 2), two counts of second-degree sodomy, ORS 163.395 (Counts 3 and 4), two counts of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.408 (Counts 5 and 6), two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427 (Counts 7 and 8), one count of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine to a minor, ORS 475.890(3) (Count 10), and four counts of compelling prostitution, ORS 167.017 (Counts 13, 16-18). Defendant assigns error to the trial court's imposition of three $50,000 compensatory fines on Counts 16 through 18. Defendant also advances as unpreserved contention that the court erred by imposing $9,290 in court-appointed attorney fees. We conclude that the trial court erred by imposing both the compensatory fines and the attorney fees, and we reverse those portions of the judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      In the fall of 2012, defendant met S, a 13-year-old girl who had recently run away from home, outside of his Beaverton apartment. He allowed her to live with him for several weeks. During that time, defendant provided S with drugs, raped and sexually abused her, and induced her to engage in prostitution.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      In July of the following year, the Department of Human Services (DHS), S's legal guardian at the time, sent S to Mingus Mountain, a facility in Arizona for girls who are at risk behaviorally and emotionally and for whom other treatment had not been effective. She stayed there for nearly a year. During a counseling session a few months\n     after she arrived there, S first alerted authorities to defendant's crimes.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Defendant was eventually charged with and convicted of the crimes described above. During trial, S's former DHS caseworker testified that S's treatment at Mingus Mountain had been covered by her Oregon Health Plan (OHP) insurance, which all juveniles automatically receive while they are in the temporary custody of DHS.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      At sentencing, in addition to imposing a term of 370 months' imprisonment, the trial court also expressed interest in imposing compensatory fines under ORS 137.101. In\n     accordance with that statute, the court indicated that the state must prove economic damages to the victim before the court could impose a compensatory fine. The state presented a letter to the court from a DHS worker that stated that the Mingus Mountain treatment had cost roughly $168,000. In the state's view, the letter provided the court with evidence that was sufficient to prove economic damages for a compensatory fine. Defendant objected to the compensatory fine, arguing, in part, that S did not suffer any economic damages.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      The court imposed a punitive fine of $200 on each of Counts 1 through 10, 13, and 16 through 18. It also imposed three $50,000 compensatory fines, one for each of three convictions for compelling prostitution, Counts 16 through 18, which required defendant to \"Pay a compensatory fine to victim: [S's name], c/o DHS.\" Additionally, the trial court stated that defendant may be able to pay the compensatory fines imposed because defendant was \"about 28 years old now, I think. And I'm going to find that he appears to be healthy. Able to maintain some type of employment[.]\" The court then immediately turned to a discussion about court-appointed attorney fees. Without stating that it was relying on the same facts to determine that defendant could pay the attorney fees, or making any findings explicitly for the purpose of imposing the fees, the trial court imposed $9,290 in court-appointed attorney fees on defendant. Defendant did not object. During the trial, defendant had testified that he had had little income even though he worked sporadically doing construction work, sold food at a farmer's market, and provided maintenance work at his apartment complex in exchange for a discount on rent.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      On appeal, defendant assigns error to the court's imposition of the three compensatory fines, arguing that the court erred for three reasons. First, defendant argues that the prerequisites for imposing a compensatory fine were not met, specifically that S was not a victim who has suffered economic damages, and, thus, a compensatory fine payable to her cannot be imposed.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      Second, defendant argues that\n     he does not have the ability to pay a $150,000 compensatory fine. Third, defendant argues that the court's order to pay three $50,000 compensatory fines was plainly erroneous because the court had already imposed separate $200 punitive fines on each of those same counts. Additionally, defendant assigns error to the trial court's imposition of $9,290 in court-appointed attorney fees.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      In deciding whether the trial court erred when it imposed the three compensatory fines, we find defendant's third argument dispositive. In sum, we agree with defendant that the trial court plainly erred by ordering defendant to pay three $50,000 compensatory fines, and we exercise our discretion to correct the error. In addition, because the record is clear that the trial court could not impose any compensatory fine payable to S, we reverse as to those parts of the judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      As we explained in\n      <em>\n       State v.

Those facts-that defendant appeared healthy at the time of sentencing and had worked in the past-do not allow a nonspeculative, objective assessment of defendant's present or future capacity to pay fees. The record shows that defendant had a history of odd jobs that relied on defendant's physical labor and for which he made little income. There is no evidence in the record that defendant would have employment waiting for him after his release or that he had an education or employment history that would in any plausible way help him gain employment at age 60 after having spent over 30 years in prison. Moreover, the fact that defendant appeared to be healthy at the time he was sentenced to over 30 years of imprisonment is not evidence of any plausible prospect of employment far in defendant's future.
