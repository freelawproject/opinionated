The Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) described the events. According to Mr. Davis, he had consumed Yukon Jack and \"eight or nine beers\" with a friend when he met up with Robert Cotton at approximately 4:00 p.m. on September 5, 1982. They stopped at a liquor store, where they purchased a six-pack of beer and a bottle of MD 20-20. Mr. Davis drank \"two or three beers and some of the MD 20-20\" (a high alcohol content wine). He and Mr. Cotton then picked up a hitchhiker between Gillette and Buffalo, intending to rob him. Mr. Davis explained, \"We couldn't think of how to go about this, so I told him not to worry about it, I'll think of something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b64] Mr. Cotton stopped the car, pretending he had to urinate. Mr. Davis and Mr. Cotton exited the vehicle to discuss how they were going to get the victim out of the car. Mr. Cotton \"pulled him out of the car\" and \"threw him down on the ground,\" and said, \"If you try to fight, I will break your neck.\" Mr. Cotton ordered Mr. Davis to retrieve a set of handcuffs from the vehicle and asked Mr. Davis for his knife, which Davis gave to him. Mr. Davis got the cuffs, and Mr. Cotton handed him his knife and handcuffed the victim. Mr. Davis stated that he was going to put the knife away then, but \"didn't for some reason.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b65] Mr. Cotton went through the victim's pockets, retrieving \"a bunch of things,\" including money and a lighter. They decided to uncuff the victim and send him down the road on foot. However, as Mr. Cotton went to uncuff him, he had one hand behind the victim's head, pulling his hair, while Mr. Davis held the knife \"over his neck.\" The victim \"raised up and the knife stuck in his throat.\" Mr. Davis explained that \"the guy was screaming and bleeding pretty good. Mr. Cotton suggested, 'Finish him off because he is going to die anyway. Just put him out of his misery.' \" Mr. Davis then \"knelt down, pushed the knife in as far as [he] could and slit his throat ... in only one motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Davis got into the car, and Mr. Cotton followed a little later, with \"blood all over his arms and hands.\" Mr. Davis stated that \"[i]f I hadn't been drinking, it never would have happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    The Original Sentencing and the Presentence Investigation Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. Davis was originally sentenced on February 22, 1983. The court did not receive testimony before sentencing Mr. Davis, but the PSI was filed in the court on the day he was sentenced. The PSI provided some history of Mr. Davis' life before prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b67] Mr. Davis' father drowned at the age of nineteen, when Mr. Davis was an infant. When he was two, his mother married Richard Johnson, his primary father figure. Mr. Davis' mother and his stepfather had two additional sons, one born when he was four years old and the other when he was nine. Mr. Johnson was an alcoholic. Mr. Davis' mother and Mr. Johnson divorced in 1978, but reunited shortly thereafter and maintained a relationship characterized as \"unstable, primarily due to Mr. Johnson's past alcohol abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b68] Mr. Davis had a juvenile record that consisted of several non-violent charges, including burglary/petty theft in 1980, shortly after his family relocated from Michigan to Arizona, possession of a stolen vehicle when he was fourteen, and resisting arrest in 1981. In 1980, after the burglary/petty theft, he was placed at the Adobe Mountain School and underwent psychological and educational evaluation. He participated in a treatment program designed \"to meet his needs for individual and group therapy.\" There he had \"trouble relating effectively with both peers and staff and it was felt this stemmed from an extremely poor self concept.\" He attempted suicide several times. By the summer and fall of 1980, \"his behavior and attitudes showed improvement\" and he was released to the custody of his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b69] Approximately three months later, Mr. Johnson reported to correctional authorities that Mr. Davis had been suspended from school for fighting and that he was in possession of marijuana. Mr. Davis was apprehended, charged with resisting arrest, and sent to the Catalina Mountain School. He remained there for four months until he was \"given a full discharge.\" While he was incarcerated, his family returned to Michigan; and upon his discharge Mr. Davis joined them. The family moved to Gillette, Wyoming in 1982 for a brief period, and then returned to Michigan. Mr. Davis joined them in Michigan for a short time before returning to Gillette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b610] Prior to the events that resulted in the charges in this case, Mr. Davis had several psychological examinations: one in 1975 conducted by the Diagnostic Center, one in 1979, one conducted in Michigan in 1980, and one conducted at the Adobe Mountain School in 1980. None of the reports from these examinations are contained in the record, but the PSI quotes from them. The 1975 Diagnostic Center report \"noted that '[Mr. Davis] sometimes would fly into a rage and do destructive things without any apparent trigger, and that he frequently left home for several hours at a time, always returning at night.' \" The 1979 examination, which was referred to in the 1980 Michigan report, found Mr. Davis \"to be a 'very angry boy who is attempting to get even with his parents.' \" The 1980 Michigan report referred to the 1975 Diagnostic Center report and described Mr. Davis as \"a disturbing element in the classroom from the first grade through the fifth grade.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b611] The 1980 Adobe Mountain School evaluation \"depicted [Mr. Davis] as seeing himself as 'a total failure in life and that he was such a miserable person, that he and everyone else in the world necessarily should dump on him because of his badness.' \" The Adobe Mountain School evaluator felt that \"some of [Mr. Davis'] behavioral and academic problems might be neurological in nature\" and that \"additional sources of stress appear to include 'his highly ambivalent\n   home situation.' \" That evaluator also indicated that Mr. Davis was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   highly emotionally constricted and confused in terms of how to work his way out of his current problems. The belief of [Mr. Davis] that he is a bad person and must act out that way, or if he wishes to follow what appears to be at least some well-defined positive instincts and engage in desirable behavior, creates a great deal of tension in [him]. Thus, he is very easily triggered-off to engage in very impulsive acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b612] The PSI summarized Mr. Davis' educational background: he completed eleventh grade, and attended public schools where he had \"most of his difficulties\" and consequently spent \"considerable time in special educational classes.\" His public school teachers observed problems such as truancy, acting out, moodiness, and a lack of motivation. However, Mr. Davis \"seemed to function better and maintain a more positive attitude toward his education while receiving institutional care in Arizona.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Davis' employment history included five food service jobs which he had off and on between December of 1980 and August of 1982. None of those jobs lasted more than three months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b614] Without hearing testimony or referring to the PSI, the court sentenced Mr. Davis to life plus twenty to fifty years, consecutively, in accordance with plea negotiations that had taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Resentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b615] On June 25, 2013, after decisions by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

He requested that the court vacate his original sentence and conduct a new sentencing hearing consistent with the mandate of\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   . By operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

He sought vacation of his sentence and a new sentencing hearing consistent with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912726\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/132/\">\n    2014 WY 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912726\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/132/\">\n    334 P.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141-42 (Wyo. 2014) (\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud III\n   </em>\n   ). The State agreed that Mr. Davis was entitled to an individualized sentencing hearing. The district court held a sentencing hearing in July of 2016 and imposed the original sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b617] Mr. Davis' mother testified at the hearing. She stated that as a child Mr. Davis was \"easy going, fun loving, caring\" until he began to use drugs and alcohol as a teen. She also explained that he always had a \"good relationship\" with her and that his relationship was \"good\" with her husband when her husband wasn't drinking. She described her current relationship with Mr. Davis as \"great\" and described him as \"back to the little boy I once knew. He's caring. He's outgoing. And I don't see anger anymore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b618] Mr. Davis testified on his own behalf. He testified regarding his behavior as a child. He explained that he was angry because of the way his stepfather treated him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [A] lot of times he told me I was worthless and would never amount to anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   That started when I was probably 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   And I become, to start to believe it. And nothing really mattered to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   His stepfather was violent when he was drinking-he verbally abused Mr. Davis and would beat him until he passed out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b619] Mr. Davis also testified regarding his incarceration. He described the programs he completed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I've completed a lot of the anger management, Thinking for a Change, the drug and alcohol programs, vocational programs, carpentry, electronics, drafting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I think the journaling classes that I took is the ones I think I've gotten the most out of. And it's helped me come up with different ways to think through problems before I react.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Twenty-eight pages of certificates from courses Mr. Davis completed over the years were provided to the court. He stated that he no longer feels angry and when asked what changed, he responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I grew up was the biggest part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I grew up, matured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I was very immature, you know, uneven at 17. You know, even when after I went to prison 18, 19 I was still-I look back I was pretty immature even then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   And then I grew up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Davis currently resides in K unit, the working pod at the penitentiary. At the time of the hearing, he had lived there for three years. To qualify for K unit, an inmate must have at least six months with no write-ups and remain write-up free. It had been over four years since Mr. Davis had a write-up at the time of the hearing. Mr. Davis testified that he got along well with his coworkers and his supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b620] The State presented Mr. Davis' prison disciplinary records. During thirty-four years in prison, Mr. Davis received seventeen write-ups, never had a violent altercation, and was never charged with any crimes. Several of his write-ups, however, reveal threats made to prison staff and one reveals consumption of marijuana while incarcerated. He has not received a write-up since 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b621] After the hearing, the sentencing court issued a written ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In order to properly apply the [\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud\n   </em>\n   ] factors, as outlined by the Wyoming Supreme Court, this Court carefully reviewed the pleadings, record, and considered the testimony from the Defendant and witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court notes that several of the [\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud\n   </em>\n   ] factors intermingle, and they will therefore not be addressed separately, but rather as a narrative. First, the Court notes that in reading the original Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI), it appears that Defendant was not a stranger to the criminal justice system, but had rather been, if not a frequent, but at least [a] persistent participant from the time he was twelve (12) years old, until he was around sixteen (16) years old. It appears that most of his juvenile infractions were property related-possession of a stolen vehicle and a couple of burglaries. It appears that the Defendant was in juvenile detention for extended periods and that at least two (2) psychological evaluations were completed, both of which concluded that Defendant was uncontrollably aggressive and could fly into a rage from unpredictable triggers. Taking the circumstances of the subject offense into consideration-the victim was handcuffed and his throat slit from one side to the other-Defendant's history of aggressive behavior is troubling. Defendant further conspired with his co-defendant in planning and executing the robbery-turned-homicide, and, there is nothing in either Defendant's original statement, nor his testimony to this Court, which suggests that he was pressured into committing the crime by someone else. Rather, it is well documented, and Defendant said as much when testifying, that when he and his co-defendant first started contemplating the crime, Defendant told his codefendant \"not to worry about it, I'll think of something.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court further notes that at the time of the offense, Defendant was living independently from his family in Gillette, Wyoming, while his family lived in Michigan. He was also employed at a restaurant up until just a few days before the murder occurred, and it seems that he had maintained employment in various restaurants for approximately two (2) years prior to the events. In light of that, the Court finds that in spite of his youth, Defendant was in essence emancipated, and participating in society as an adult.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court must also consider the potential of rehabilitation-in this case, it appears that even though the Defendant has been presented with, and completed, a vast\n   range of programs aimed at assisting incarcerated persons personal growth, Defendant still seems to maintain a violent and aggressive attitude based on statements he has made, and incidents he has been involved in, as described above. This also seems consistent with the reports from Defendant's youth as described in the PSI, wherefore the Court finds that rehabilitation is unlikely at this stage in Defendant's life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ... Defendant was literally days away from his eighteenth (18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ) birthday at the time of the crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b622] The district court concluded that the \"Defendant in this matter is one of those rare cases where the sentence previously imposed was appropriate and the Court therefore declines to modify it.\" Implicit in this statement is the conclusion that Mr. Davis is unredeemable, and thus the aggregate sentence of life without the possibility of parole was appropriate.

If he serves the shortest possible sentence for aggravated robbery, he will have served almost fifty-four years in prison and will be released when he is seventy-one years old. At Mr. Davis' earliest projected parole eligibility date, he will have served forty-six years and will be sixty-four years old. Mr. Davis argues that even if he had originally been sentenced to serve twenty-five years to life on the murder charge, his aggregate sentence would be a minimum of forty-five years. He contends, therefore, that his sentence amounts to a de facto life sentence without parole according to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud III\n   </em>\n   , and that it is consequently prohibited by the Eighth Amendment's constraint against cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b625] In\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud III\n   </em>\n   , we considered the question of whether Mr. Bear Cloud's aggregate sentence violated the Eighth Amendment.

We have several concerns with this finding. First, the evaluations relied upon by the district court were dated, even at the time of the original sentencing. Second, the district court extracted observations concerning aggression and rage and used them in a way that is not supported by the actual evaluations. Finally, the psychological examination done at the state hospital after Mr. Davis committed the homicide for which he was sentenced did not contain similar observations of uncontrollable aggression or unpredictable triggers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   [\u00b684] With regard to the timing of the evaluations on which the district court relied, they were completed years prior to the\n   crime. The first of the two referenced evaluations was completed in 1975, when Mr. Davis was in the fifth grade and seven years prior to the crime. The second evaluation was done in 1980, over two years prior to the crime. The lack of proximity of those evaluations to the homicide and the initial sentencing casts doubt upon their reliability and whether they support a continued finding that Mr. Davis was \"uncontrollably aggressive and could fly into a rage from unpredictable triggers\" even at the time of the original sentencing. They carry even less weight now. The PSI summarized those evaluations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   A psychological evaluation performed on Donald on March 13, 1980 by Mark L. Berman, Ph.D. reported that information received from a diagnostic center in Michigan indicated Donald started to become a behavioral problem at home at the age of four years. He was a disturbing element in the classroom from the first grade through the fifth grade. In the latter grade, he was completely evaluated at the Diagnostic Center in Michigan. That evaluation showed Donald to have difficulties with \"impulse control and overt aggression. The result was inpredictable [sic], uncontrolled aggression.\" The Diagnostic Center, in February of 1975, noted that \"Don sometimes would fly into a rage and do destructive things without any apparent trigger, and that he frequently left home for several hours at a time, always returning at night.\" Further acting-out and unpredictable behavior (by Don) was observed by teachers in the school and it was recommended that he be placed in a special education program at the ninth grade level. In addition, Don's self-concept was quite poor at the time. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Arizona.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   The psychological report did mention that David Biegen, EED, conducted a psychological evaluation of the defendant on November 15, 1979. The [evaluation] found Donald to be a \"very angry boy who is attempting to get even with his parents.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   The psychological report performed at the Adobe Mountain School of Donald in April of 1980, further depicted Donald as seeing himself as \"a total failure in life and that he is such a miserable person, that he and everyone else in the world necessarily should dump on him because of his badness.\" Mr. Berman, the evaluator, further elaborated, \"I see Don at this time as being in a position emotionally in which he could very easily not only contemplate, but engage in self-damaging or even self-destructive behaviors.\" Mr. Berman felt that some of Don's behavioral and academic problems might be neurological in nature. He also felt additional sources of stress appear to include \"his highly ambivalent home situation, (his mother having had a rather variable and changing relationship with her ex-husband, as well as the impact on the entire family of his step-father's alcoholism.) The evaluator saw the defendant as being highly emotionally constricted and confused in terms of how to work his way out of his current problems. The belief of Donald that he is a bad person and must act out that way, or if he wishes to follow what appears to be at least some well-defined positive instincts and engage in desirable behavior, creates a great deal of tension in Donald. Thus, he is very easily triggered-off to engage in very impulsive acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The full text of this evaluation does not support a conclusion that Mr. Davis \"was uncontrollably aggressive and could fly into a rage from unpredictable triggers\" at the time the PSI was prepared or even at the time of the second evaluation referred to in the PSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   [\u00b685] After Mr. Davis was charged in this case, his attorneys raised concerns regarding his mental fitness to assist in his defense and be tried, and the district court ordered an evaluation by the state hospital. The state hospital evaluation found Mr. Davis able to assist in his defense and fit to be tried. That report states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   Results of objective and projective psychological tests, as corroborated by the individual interview indicated that he is without a serious mental problem. He does not appear to be psychotic or mentally ill. His psychological difficulties appear to be essentially characterological in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   ... On the ward, Mr. Davis displayed no bizarreness of behavior or speech. He was able to understand and comply with ward regulations. He socialized with others. He received no psychotropic medication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The WSH report diagnosed Mr. Davis with alcohol dependence (continuous), cannabis abuse (episodic), intermittent explosive disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. The WSH report, however, did not contain observations of uncontrollable aggression or unpredictable triggers that were mentioned in the 1975 evaluation. It did state that his \"psychological difficulties appear to be essentially characterological in nature.\" It is not clear what the term \"characterological\" means in this context. Maybe it means Mr. Davis' psychological condition is fixed, not temporary, but the report contains no explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   [\u00b686] The WSH report also did not define \"intermittent explosive disorder\" and \"antisocial personality disorder.\" Perhaps the two diagnosed disorders suggest something related to uncontrolled aggression and unpredictable triggers noted in the much earlier evaluations, but the WSH evaluation does not report those types of observations or provide that link. Based upon this record, the district court abused its discretion when it concluded that Mr. Davis is \"uncontrollably aggressive and could fly into a rage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   [\u00b687]\n   <strong>\n    \"The Court further notes that at the time of the offense, Defendant was living independently from his family in Gillette, Wyoming, while his family lived in Michigan.

A few days later he was arrested for his connection with the immediate offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   [\u00b689] The PSI summarized Mr. Davis' employment history from December 30, 1980 to the date of his crimes: Salad Bar Restaurant (Arizona) for about two weeks; Dairy Queen (Arizona) for one month; McDonald's (Gillette) for three months; Left Bank Restaurant (Michigan) for one month; and Mine Shaft Restaurant (Gillette) for about two weeks. The state hospital's report notes that Mr. Davis \"has got no substantial work history.\" Both the PSI and WSH evaluation also note Mr. Davis' alcohol and drug abuse, which began when he was fourteen years old and continued up until the date of his crimes.

Mr. Davis' violations may very well be evidence of irreparable corruption/permanent incorrigibility; however, on the whole, Mr. Davis' prison record casts doubt upon the district court's conclusion. Mr. Davis has taken advantage of many classes and self-improvement programs. He has a job in the prison and resides in K unit, the working pod of the penitentiary, where an inmate must be free of write-ups for a year and meet other qualifications.

Without such input, however, Mr. Davis' prison record simply does not support a conclusion that he is incapable of rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   [\u00b696] In addition to the issues discussed above regarding the district court's findings, we would be remiss if we did not remark upon factors that should have been considered, but weren't. The district court failed to consider Mr. Davis' family and home environment in any meaningful way, and it failed to consider whether Mr. Davis \"might have been charged ... [with] a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with his youth.\"\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6974819\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/294/36/\">\n    294 P.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   [\u00b697] Regarding his family and home environment, the district court failed to take into account a number of facts that were in the record. For example, Mr. Davis was subjected to verbal, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his stepfather. His peers bullied him both at school and when he was in the\n   juvenile treatment facilities. Ultimately, Mr. Davis left his family home at the age of seventeen due to the abusive relationship with his stepfather. These facts, and others contained in the record concerning Mr. Davis' family and home environment, should have been considered by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   [\u00b698] With respect to whether Mr. Davis might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offence if not for the incompetencies of youth, the district court should have taken into account the circumstances surrounding his original plea. Mr. Davis' most pressing concern at the time of his plea was with being sentenced to death. Without the benefit of negotiations regarding a plea, he entered a plea of guilty to first degree felony murder. Two months later, he entered pleas on the remaining murder and aggravated robbery counts in accordance with a plea agreement in exchange for the State's agreement to a merged life sentence on the murder charges, with a consecutive twenty to fifty years on the aggravated robbery charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   [\u00b699] Mr. Davis argues that a more mature defendant might not have entered a cold plea to the felony murder charge and that, without such a plea, the prosecutors might have amended the charges based upon the evidence that Mr. Cotton may have participated in the killing and that the murder was not premeditated. Mr. Davis also claims that a more mature defendant might have insisted on going to trial, rather than accepting a plea bargain for \"the maximum penalty prescribed by law.\" While it is difficult to say what would have transpired, but for the incompetencies of youth, this mitigating factor was not considered by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   [\u00b6100] Other courts have concluded that when sentencing courts fail to adequately consider youth and its attendant characteristics, the sentence is constitutionally infirm. For example, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals addressed the appeal of a defendant who was convicted of first degree murder for fatally shooting the victim from a car as he was jogging.\n   <em>\n    Luna\n   </em>\n   , 387 P.3d at 958. Because the sentencing jury did not consider evidence of chronological age and its hallmark features or whether the circumstances suggested that the appellant could be rehabilitated, the court reversed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 962.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   [\u00b6101] In\n   <em>\n    Alvira v. State\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder, armed carjacking, armed robbery and other related offenses after carjacking and stabbing a woman, and dumping her body in a field, when he was sixteen.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203548256\">\n    2016 WL 3548256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1-2. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals concluded that the sentencing court failed to properly consider the defendant's youth when it sentenced him to life without parole and additional consecutive and concurrent sentences.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *2. The sentencing court acknowledged the defendant's age and stated that the defendant was \"consumed with evil\" on the night of the crime and that the court \"expect[s] you are filled with evil.

The court also admonished the sentencing court for its reliance on a psychologist's opinion that the defendant's prognosis for change in the next five years was poor.

The district court's failure to consider Mr. Davis' family and home environment and whether he might have been convicted of a lesser offense but for incompetencies associated with youth, without providing an explanation for omitting analysis of those factors, also constituted an abuse of discretion. Finally, the district court abused its discretion by failing to make a finding of permanent incorrigibility based upon its analysis of all the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors. When the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors are not properly considered and weighed and when there is no finding of permanent incorrigibility, or when a finding of permanent incorrigibility is not supported by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors, the resulting sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   [\u00b6107] Accordingly, we reverse.

Consequently, remand for an additional sentencing hearing and resentencing is appropriate. On remand, the sentencing court should approach the case with the understanding that, more likely than not, life without parole is a disproportionate sentence for Mr. Davis, and it should consider the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors and decide whether he is the truly rare individual mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   who is incapable of reform.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-260\">\n    At the arraignment, the State provided a similar factual basis for the charges:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n    [O]n September 7, 1982, [a Johnson County resident] advised the Sheriff's office that she had observed what she believed to be a dead body along the Mayoworth road ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n    [A]t the location [law enforcement officers] observed a young Indian male approximately 20 years of age.

However, just last month, well after the\n   <em>\n    Batts\n   </em>\n   decision, the Pennsylvania Superior Court determined that any prohibition of \"de facto\" life without parole sentences for juveniles applies only to individual sentences, and not to the total of consecutive sentences. In determining whether two consecutive sentences of 30 years to life were unconstitutional, the Pennsylvania court said, \"we hold that we must consider the individual sentences, not the aggregate, to determine if the trial court imposed a term-of-years sentence which constitutes a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   LWOP sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Foust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Pa.%20Super.%2039\">\n    2018 PA Super 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493410\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/416/\">\n    180 A.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. Ct. 2018). It then determined that the separate, consecutive 30 years to life sentences did not violate requirements of the U.S. Constitution. That should be the result in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Foust,\n   </em>\n   the Pennsylvania Superior Court declined to give juvenile criminals a \"volume discount\" for committing multiple crimes before age 18. The majority opinion results in exactly such a volume discount. It permits juveniles to commit multiple crimes without facing appropriate responsibility for those crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   [\u00b6115] I also must register disagreement with the majority's footnote directed to our legislature (footnote 4). This footnote suggests that there is a \"discord\" in Wyoming law, and that the legislature should address consecutive sentences for multiple crimes committed by juveniles in the same way the majority has. Implicit in this \"encouragement\" to the legislature is the idea that the U.S. Supreme Court requires the position the majority takes. The U.S. Supreme Court has not adopted the position taken by the majority. The states who have considered the matter have reached a variety of possible conclusions. Fourteen states have joined with the Wyoming Attorney General in requesting certiorari from the U.S. Supreme Court to obtain direction from that body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   [\u00b6116] It is premature to suggest that the approach to \"de facto life\" taken by this Court is the definitive and appropriate application of the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment. Any \"incongruity\" or \"discord\" in the state of Wyoming law on this matter is the result of this Court going beyond what the U.S. Supreme Court has decided up to this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burden of Proof at Individualized Sentencing Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   [\u00b6117] In my judgment, the majority opinion makes it impossible for a trial judge to\n   ever find that a juvenile who has committed multiple, heinous crimes should serve a sentence longer than what this court believes is the \"functional equivalent\" of life without parole. The majority opinion acknowledges this, stating \"the task of determining whether a juvenile is permanently incorrigible is difficult, if not impossible.\" By establishing a presumption against such consecutive sentences, and providing that the presumption can only be overcome by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant can never be rehabilitated, the majority has precluded any finding that the juvenile should serve such a sentence. The factors to sentencing, including potential youthfulness and immaturity, or the potential for gaining sufficient maturity to have self-control, are not the types of facts that can be determined \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Sentencing judges have been given significant latitude because the sentencing factors are not typically capable of such determination. By establishing an impossible burden of proof on the rehabilitation factor, the majority has, in effect, removed discretion from sentencing judges. The majority opinion goes far beyond any ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, and effectively permits juveniles to escape significant consecutive consequences for significant, separate crimes. It has created policy that should only be established by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review/Abuse of Discretion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   [\u00b6118] I dissent from the majority's creation of a new standard of review for juvenile sentences. It calls the standard a\n   <em>\n    review for abuse of discretion, \"but will not be lenient.\"\n   </em>\n   This is not an abuse of discretion review at all, but is a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review where the majority substitutes its judgment for that of the trial court. For example, the majority substitutes its judgment for the trial court here by finding that Mr. Davis was not \"an essentially emancipated minor functioning as an adult.\" Rather than reviewing the evidence which supports that finding by the trial court, the majority discounts that evidence to reach its own conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   [\u00b6119] The majority justifies its unique standard of review by analogizing Mr. Davis' consecutive sentence to capital punishment. Mr. Davis has received neither a death sentence nor a sentence of life without parole. The only person subject to a death sentence in this case was Mr. Davis' victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   [\u00b6120] Few principles have been more firmly established in Wyoming law than the standard that sentencing is left to the discretion of the trial judge absent a clear abuse of discretion. I do not believe this principle should be discarded. This Court has commented on this standard many, many times. \"We have an abiding reluctance to review a trial judge's determination of sentence. The determination is a burdensome decision which no trial judge could lightly make and which we will not lightly overturn.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

He said the inmates had nothing to lose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   \u2022 In November 2001, at age 37, Mr. Davis threatened officers, stating \"I wish you [expletives] would quit [expletive] with me and purposely pushing my [expletive] buttons. I have one [expletive] button left, come on, push this [expletive] button.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   \u2022 In July 2002, Mr. Davis threatened a corrections officer and a nurse, stating\n   that, \"This won't work [the room temperature].

He stated, \"I've been down [a long] time, I'm not the (expletive) to hit a [Corrections Officer] once and stop.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   \u2022 In 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011 Mr. Davis received various prison disciplines for smoking, failing to report to work and refusing to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   \u2022 In 2013, Mr. Davis moved for \"correction\" of his sentences, seeking lesser sentences based on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   [\u00b6123] The district judge's decision considered the factors required by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bear Cloud\n   </em>\n   . It was supported by facts in the record. The facts support the district judge's conclusions that these crimes were not the result of youthful \"underdeveloped sense of responsibility.\" They were not the result of juvenile propensity to engage in reckless behavior, nor the result of negative influences or peer pressure. These crimes were not the result of transient youthful immaturity. The district judge could properly reach these conclusions both from the nature of the crimes and from Mr. Davis' threats made 30 years later. Mr. Davis' character remained constant until he pursued release based on this Court's misapplication of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The facts show that these crimes were a calculated, depraved aggravated robbery and a cold, calculated execution. Under any reasonable standard of review, the district judge's decision was not an abuse of discretion. I would affirm the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
