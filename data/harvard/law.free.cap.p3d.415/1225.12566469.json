He also contends that the imposition of mandatory deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) collection and crime victim penalty assessment (VPA) fees violated his substantive due process rights, and he requests that appellate costs be waived. Finally, he raises additional claims in a statement of additional grounds (SAG).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that (1) Horn's right to present a defense was not violated, (2) the mandatory imposition of DNA and VPA fees did not violate his substantive due process rights, (3) under RAP 14.2, Horn may challenge costs on appeal before our court commissioner if the State requests them and he objects to them, and (4) Horn's SAG claims fail. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Horn and Suzy Oubre became romantically involved while Oubre was estranged from another man with whom she had had a relationship. Horn and Oubre began openly dating in January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In January 2015, Horn and Oubre were at Oubre's residence drinking alcoholic beverages. While Oubre was using her cellphone, Horn grew angry and accused her of texting the man with whom she had been involved. According to Oubre, she had never seen him have \"an episode like this before.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 141. Horn grabbed Oubre's night shirt and ripped it open, hitting her on the chest in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Scared that the downstairs neighbor would hear the scuffle, Oubre and Horn went to Horn's home. Once they arrived and got out of the car, Oubre told Horn that she was going to leave, but Horn grabbed her. They began wrestling when Horn pushed her against a wall and down into a flower bed. He bit her multiple times. Oubre did not call the police. After this incident, when Horn would drink too much and get aggressive, she would refer to that facet of Horn's personality\n   as \"Bo-Bo.\" RP at 151. When \"Bo-Bo\" came out, Oubre was scared for her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On August 7, 2015, Oubre texted Horn that she could no longer \"worry about him\" and that she had a fear of \"Bo-Bo.\" RP at 196-97. Horn later brought wine and dinner to her house. After dinner, Oubre was on her bed in the master bedroom playing a cellphone game when Horn asked who she was texting. Like the January incident, Horn became angry and accused her of texting the individual with whom she had been involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Oubre told Horn that their relationship was \"not going to work.\" RP at 205. In response, Horn ripped off Oubre's bra and told her she was not going anywhere. After Oubre struck Horn in the chest a couple of times, Horn punched her in the eye, knocking her across the bedroom floor. Horn demanded that Oubre retrieve her cellphone so that he could see the text messages. Oubre, who was now scared, complied and gave her cellphone to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 As Horn was looking through the text messages, Oubre tried to push past Horn and leave the master bathroom. Horn blocked her path to the door, and pushed, punched, and kicked her. Eventually, Oubre asked Horn if she could lie down on the bed and have some ice for her eye injury, but he told her that she was not \"going to need to worry about [her] eye.\" RP at 213. He said that he had thought \"about this a long time, and you and I are going to die tonight.\" RP at 213. Oubre believed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Horn retrieved Oubre's gun from under the mattress, and then straddled her, cocked the gun, and put it in his mouth. He asked her how she \"was going to feel when he blew his brains out on the ceiling.\" RP at 216. Horn subsequently took the gun out of his mouth and pointed it at Oubre's head. He told her that she was \"going to go to heaven or hell tonight, whichever one [she] deserve[s].\" RP at 218-19. As Horn locked the door to the master bedroom, he repeatedly said that they were both going to die. Oubre believed Horn and felt like her life was going to end that night. Oubre got up and tried to leave, but Horn stopped her by pushing her onto the floor and by punching and kicking her. Eventually, Oubre was able to coax Horn to lay down and fall sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 While Horn was asleep, Oubre left and went to the hospital where her extensive injuries were treated. She spoke with the police while at the hospital, and Horn was then arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Among other offenses, Horn was charged with domestic violence felony harassment based on the August incident. Horn posted bail on August 20, 2015. Oubre and Horn got engaged on September 5 and took a trip together. Horn was later charged with violating a no-contact order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to which he pled guilty in district court. As part of the events related to that charge, videotape evidence showed Horn naked while jumping on top of Oubre's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Before trial on the felony harassment charge, the State sought to introduce evidence of the January 2015 incident under ER 404(b) to show that Horn's threat to kill Oubre in August 2015 placed her in reasonable fear that the threat would be carried out. One of the elements of felony harassment is that the victim be placed in reasonable fear that a threat will be carried out. RCW 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i), (b), (2)(b)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 The defense objected and in the alternative argued that if the State was permitted to introduce this evidence, the defense should be able to introduce evidence of Oubre and Horn's engagement and trip after August 2015. In the defense's view, this evidence showed that Oubre did not have a reasonable fear that Horn would carry out his threat to kill her on August 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 The State opposed the admission of evidence of their engagement and trip because \"it triggers a bunch of things,\" including Horn's later violation of a no-contact order where he was naked and jumping on top of Oubre's vehicle. RP at 72. The State also did not believe the evidence was relevant to whether Oubre was fearful in August, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The subsequent knowledge does not address the fear on the day of the crime. You can't retroactively apply that fear. The fear has to be at that time, what the victim knew at that point in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   RP at 73. The defense responded that without this evidence, the jury is left\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   with the false impression that Mr. Horn is this horrible abuser, and they can't even hear about the fact that even though this allegedly happened, she's going off with him ..., knowing there's a protective order, having a good time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   RP at 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The trial court first determined that evidence related to the January incident would be admitted because it would \"help the jury to determine whether [Oubre] had ... a reasonable fear or not.\" RP at 79. However, it declined the defense's request to admit the evidence of the engagement and vacation, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I understand where [the defense] is coming from. ... [I]f we're to ascertain or determine what her fear was on August 7th, what happened afterwards informs the jury to a certain extent of how fearful she was on August 7th. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   And I think but-for the complications and the muddying of waters that occurs with charges in another court, ... I think I would be inclined to allow some of that information, if it was close in time of the assault. Because I think that does inform whether her fear was reasonable, you know, like a day or two afterwards. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [H]ere we're talking he was out [on bail] by August 20th, they were engaged by September 5th, so we're talking a month later. At that point I'm concerned because people do things to protect themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   An alleged victim very well may say the best way I can protect myself is when he's kind of on the ropes when the police are after him and he's facing charges. Maybe now is a good time. I, quote-unquote, ... can't get rid of him now, but maybe if I can keep him at bay by placating him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I don't know what's going on in a person's mind, but I think if I were to allow open what happened subsequent, especially a month, month and a half later, that muddies the water too much. And if I were to allow that, then I think the State would have an opportunity to say, look, you violated the no-contact order violation, and that goes to her fear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [I]f we didn't have the complications of the muddied waters, of the violation of a no-contact order, allegations of climbing naked, entering into the home without permission, I think that goes too far afield, and I think that would confuse the jury as to the issues, and I think it actually could shed a very negative light on Mr. Horn, maybe even worse than allowing the January event, so that's my rationale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   RP at 80-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 During trial, Oubre, Horn, and the police officers testified. Horn's statements given in an interview with police immediately after the August 7 incident were admitted into evidence. In that interview, he told the interviewing officer that he drank alcohol, \"blacked out,\" and did not remember what happened that night. RP at 558. When he testified in his own defense, Horn stated that he drank, and he did not remember the night of the August 7 incident because he \"blacked out.\" RP at 598-99, 602-03, 611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 The jury found Horn guilty of two counts of fourth degree assault, unlawful possession of a firearm, and domestic violence felony harassment. At sentencing, the court imposed mandatory DNA collection and VPA fees. Horn appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I. RIGHT TO PRESENT DEFENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18 Horn argues that his Sixth Amendment right to present his defense was violated because the trial court did not admit evidence of Oubre and Horn's engagement and trip taken after the August 7 incident. For the reasons below, we hold that Horn fails to show a Sixth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19 We review a Sixth Amendment right to present a defense claim under a three-step test.

Therefore, to preserve both our de novo review of constitutional claims and the review of evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, we review the first prong of the test above, whether the evidence of Oubre and Horn's engagement and trip is minimally relevant, for an abuse of discretion. To ensure de novo review of the Sixth Amendment claim itself, the second and third prongs of the test would be reviewed de novo.

Under\n   <em>\n    Seward\n   </em>\n   , we uphold the imposition of these fees on Horn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   III. SAG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 32 Horn's first SAG claim is not an argument, but a question: \"I want to know if my speedy trial rights were violated?\" SAG at 1. This generalized question is not particularized enough to permit appellate review. We are \"not obligated to search [the] record in support of claims made in [the SAG].\" RAP 10.10(c) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4028800\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/169/436/\">\n    169 Wash.

Although Horn questions whether his speedy trial rights might have been violated, we cannot assume the role of an advocate and comb the record to determine whether he has a meritorious speedy trial right claim. Therefore, we decline to address this claim any further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 33 Horn's second SAG claim states that he \"was not allowed to complete [his] mental health evaluation for ... [ (post-traumatic stress disorder ) ] PTSD.\" SAG at 1. Assuming this to be true, Horn fails to articulate how this prejudiced his trial. The record shows that his defense counsel elicited evidence regarding his PTSD, and his PTSD diagnosis was brought out during closing argument. For these reasons, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 34 Horn's final SAG claim is that he \"didn't have any witnesses! I had 0-the State had 18.\" SAG at 1. First, Horn did have a witness testify in his defense-himself. To the extent he is arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   because his attorney failed to call more witnesses, nothing in the appellate record indicates that Horn had any other favorable witnesses that would have testified on his behalf. If Horn believes otherwise, he should supplement the record and make this claim in a personal restraint petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. McFarland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433058\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/127/322/#p338\">\n    127 Wash.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20P.2d%201251\">\n    899 P.2d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 35 For these reasons, Horn's SAG claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   IV. APPELLATE COSTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 36 Horn asks that we exercise our discretion to deny any appellate costs the State requests. Under RAP 14.2, a commissioner of this court will determine whether to award appellate costs if the State decides to file a cost bill and if Horn objects to that cost bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 37 Horn's right to present a defense was not violated, and his other claims fail.
