We hold that the record does not support a conclusion that Celestine's waiver of the right to testify was voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made. Because the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate the conviction and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 24, 2013, around 2:40 a.m., an officer of the Honolulu Police Department driving along Meheula Parkway saw Celestine's vehicle in the \"planter area.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appeared to the officer that the vehicle had jumped the curb. After Celestine exited her vehicle, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol emitting from Celestine's breath and that her eyes were red, bloodshot, and glassy. The officer requested that Celestine perform three field sobriety tests. According to the responding officer, Celestine demonstrated clues suggesting intoxication on all three tests, and she was subsequently placed under arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the police station, an officer read Celestine the implied consent form for testing, which provided, inter alia, as follows: \"if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood or urine test, you shall be subject to up to 30 days imprisonment and/or a fine of up to a thousand dollars.\" Celestine refused the blood test but opted to take the breath test. About 3:15 a.m., Celestine underwent an Intoxilyzer 8000 breath test. Celestine's breath alcohol content was 0.098 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2013, Celestine was charged by complaint in the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or (a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Celestine pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   prior to the presentation of evidence, the district court advised Celestine as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Miss Celestine, to advise you of your rights at trial, at some point in time the State will rest, okay, and you'll have an opportunity to testify or remain silent. Should you choose to remain silent, the Court can infer no guilt because of your silence. Basically, you'll be invoking your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Okay, you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: However, if you do wish to testify, you need to be sworn in, you're also subject to cross-examination by the State's attorney. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE DEFENDANT\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   : Okay.

Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the State rested,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defense advised the court that it would not be presenting evidence. The court then proceeded with the\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. For defense case, okay, Miss Moss Celestine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Just in caution, okay, I had explained to you, okay, on the 12th that you had the right to testify and the right to remain silent, okay. They call this your\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   rights. It's based on a\n   case law that the appellate court found that the trial court needed to inform you of your rights, okay. If you chose not to testify, the Court could infer no guilt because of your silence; basically you would be invoking your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Okay. On the other hand, if you do wish to testify, you need to be sworn in, you also will be subject to cross-examination by the State's attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Okay. Your attorney just indicated to the Court that you will not be testifying. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Is anybody forcing you not to testify?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. It's your own decision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, very good....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following the colloquy, the district court heard Celestine's motion to suppress her breath test results, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court found Celestine guilty as charged under HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) and HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(3) and imposed sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Celestine timely filed a notice of appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ICA Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In her opening brief, Celestine set forth two points of error: (1) the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress, and (2) the district court violated her constitutional right to testify when it failed to conduct a proper\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy. The State responded that the court's\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy was adequate and that, in the alternative, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed Celestine's conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ICA concluded that the district court's end-of-trial\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy was adequate and that Celestine's waiver of the right to testify was validly made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Chief Judge Nakamura dissented, concluding that the district court erred by failing to adequately advise Celestine that if she wanted to testify, no one could prevent her from doing so. Because Celestine did not testify at trial, the dissent concluded that the error was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The validity of a defendant's waiver in a criminal case of the right to testify is a question of constitutional law reviewed by this court under the right/wrong standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, the Majority states that the district court should have engaged in a verbal exchange with Celestine after the court stated, \"Your attorney just indicated to the Court that you will not be testifying. Is that correct?\" and Celestine replied, \"Yes, sir.\" Majority at 171-72, 415 P.3d at 913-14. The Majority concludes that \"the court's question does not indicate whether [Celestine] was expressing that she did not wish to testify or merely confirming that her attorney had just told the court she would not be testifying.\" Majority at 172, 415 P.3d at 914.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Respectfully, such formalism is not the best method to protect a defendant's right to testify. This court instituted the\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy as a prophylactic measure to protect that right. This measure is a means of ensuring that defendants do not forfeit their constitutional rights unwittingly, not an end unto itself. Accordingly, the appropriate inquiry for our review of an alleged\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   violation is whether, in light of the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the defendant's waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Han\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n    130 Hawai'i at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n    306 P.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A court's flawlessly executed colloquy cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that a defendant's waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does a court's failure to strictly comply with the guidelines of our\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   case law compel the conclusion that the defendant's waiver was constitutionally invalid, so long as the facts and circumstances indicate that it was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Reducing our review of waivers of the right to testify to a checklist detaches the\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy from the vital constitutional concerns that led to its creation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In the present case, Celestine was advised of her right to testify at the beginning of trial\n   pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , responding, \"[y]es, sir\" when asked if she understood. The district court's ultimate colloquy advised Celestine that 1) she had the right to testify; 2) she had the right to remain silent; 3) if she chose not to testify, the court could infer no guilt because of her silence, as she would be invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination; and 4) if she chose to testify, she would need to be sworn in, and would be cross-examined by the State. The court then asked her if she was choosing not to testify, to which she responded, \"[y]es, sir.\" The court asked her if anyone was forcing her not to testify, to which she responded, \"[n]o, sir.\" Finally, the court asked her if not testifying was her own decision, to which she responded, \"[y]es, sir.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, the district court conducted a valid\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   pretrial colloquy as well as an ultimate colloquy that explicitly advised Celestine of four out of the five components of her right to testify under\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   . The court failed to tell Celestine that no one could prevent her from testifying, but it did ask her if anyone was forcing her not to testify, to which she responded, \"[n]o, sir.\" This question strongly implies that it would be impermissible for someone to force her not to testify, and I fail to see what benefit Celestine might have derived from the more explicit advisement. Moreover, Celestine responded clearly to the court's questions, and the record contains no indication of a language barrier, mental illness, or other salient fact suggesting that she might not have comprehended the court's plain English advisements regarding the waiver. Accordingly, I would hold that Celestine's waiver of her right to testify was valid, as the circumstances indicate that it was \"voluntarily and intelligently undertaken.\"\n   <em>\n    Han\n   </em>\n   , 130 Hawai'i at 89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n    306 P.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Majority cites\n   <em>\n    Han\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"beyond advising defendants of the rights afforded to them, a court must engage defendants in a true colloquy to ascertain whether the defendant understands the right to testify and the right not to testify and whether the decision not to testify is made with an understanding of these rights.\" Majority at 171, 415 P.3d at 913. In\n   <em>\n    Han\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the trial court should have elicited responses from the defendant after advising him that he had a right to remain silent, and after the trial court stated to the defendant, \"now that the State has finished its case and you had a chance to discuss what happened with your attorney, and based on that discussion, you have decided that you are not going to testify on your behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Han\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n    130 Hawai'i at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n    306 P.3d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A trial court is far better situated than we are to \"read\" a defendant and understand how best to communicate the complex legal principles that underlie a\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy. The trial court here evidently believed that its reference to \"invoking your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination\" would resonate with the defendant, and achieve the ultimate goal of\n   ensuring a knowing and voluntary waiver. In contrast, requiring the court to read from a script could be far less effective. In any event, I believe we should give the trial courts some leeway in their approach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and evaluate the waiver based on the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In conclusion, the approach used by the Majority in today's decision is not the best method to achieve the objectives of\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   -to \"protect defendants' rights while maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259867\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/79/226/#p236\">\n    79 Hawai'i at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259867\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/79/226/#p236\">\n    900 P.2d at 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In Part VII-B of the opinion, we noted that the presence of a salient fact \"underscores the importance of the court's colloquy as a procedural safeguard that protects a defendant's right to testify or to not testify.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n     at 92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n     306 P.3d at 137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, we determined that the presence of a salient fact-the defendant's need for an interpreter-only made the court's error in failing to ensure Han's understanding \"\n    <em>\n     more egregious\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). The salient fact therefore only exacerbated the trial court's failure.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311922\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/83/#p90\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Hence, the dissent incorrectly contends that\n    <em>\n     Han\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable because there was no showing of a salient fact that might have prevented Celestine from understanding the court's advisements.
