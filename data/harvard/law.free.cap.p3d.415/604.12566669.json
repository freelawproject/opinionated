Specifically, Defendant argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to timely move for a mistrial after a potential juror allegedly tainted the prospective juror pool. We reverse the trial court's denial of the mistrial motion, vacate Defendant's conviction, and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant was charged with a drug-related crime. During jury selection, defense counsel asked the prospective jurors whether any of them knew himself or Defendant. One prospective juror (Juror Five) responded affirmatively and offered additional unsolicited information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   [Defense counsel]: Does anybody know myself or Mr. Courtney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Juror Five]: Due to my years in law enforcement, yes. I have had affiliations with him, especially during the time that I was serving as an agent for the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The court's questioning of the venire continued without further attention being drawn to this exchange. A few minutes later, however, the court asked the jury, \"Would any of you have difficulty in affording the defendant his guarantee of being considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or, stated differently, would any of you believe that because the defendant has been charged in this case by the State that there must be some basis for his guilt?\" Juror Five raised her hand, but before she could speak, the court cut her off and asked both counsel to approach the bench for a discussion out of the potential jurors' hearing. At the bench discussion, the court and both counsel discussed Juror Five's first response:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE COURT: We dodged a bullet the first time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Defense counsel]: No, we didn't. We-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: Well I mean I guess what I'm saying is we didn't dwell on it. We didn't linger on it. I recognize what you're saying, but the problem is there's no way to anticipate that she would say what she said....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Well I don't think there's any question that she is gone. I guess the bigger issue though is I don't want her tainting the [juror] pool and if we have an issue now where you already feel that she has done that, then we need to make a record on it because I don't want to plow through, pick a jury of eight and then have this become an issue. I mean I guess I don't know how we're going to determine whether she has tainted the pool or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b64 The court and both counsel eventually agreed to excuse Juror Five immediately and to highlight another reason for doing so, in hopes of minimizing the taint. In front of the entire prospective juror pool, and before Juror Five could explain why she had raised her hand, the court excused her on the basis of a potential conflict:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: The discussion that we had at the bench was based on the fact that your husband comes to my court every Thursday as a probation officer[.] I think it would be better to just excuse you at this time.... So rather than have you stay here only to excuse you at the end, I think what we'll do is just let you get on your way now[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 After Juror Five was excused, a jury of eight jurors was selected from the remaining prospective juror pool and sworn in. Immediately afterward, and outside the presence of the jury, the court and both counsel again discussed Juror Five's statements. Defense counsel noted Juror Five had \"set up controlled buys when she was a Weber-Morgan Strike Force Agent\" and that her \"comments to that end here today\" included a reference to \"knowing my client in that capacity in front of all the jurors.\" Defense counsel also stated that he had been looking at \"other jurors' faces as she was making [her] comments and there were a couple of jurors that kind of you know [perked] up when they were listening to what she was saying.\" Defense counsel described the effect as \"possible jury tainting.\" And defense counsel further noted that, \"when the Court asked can anybody here not afford [Defendant] the right of innocence until proven guilty,\" Juror Five had \"popped back up\" and was \"the only person that raised her hand to that question.\" Defense counsel agreed that \"the Court did the best the Court could to quash the issue when it arose, but I mean up to that point there's possible bias already and maybe tainting of the jury pool at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 The court asked why an objection or motion for mistrial \"was never brought or even alluded to\" at the bench discussion. Defense counsel replied that \"there was never a break again,\" that \"the jury was in the room the whole time,\" and that he had not \"had a chance to talk to my client about his concerns about it.\" Defense counsel admitted that he had not made a motion for mistrial and that he had \"missed the Court swearing the jury\" because he \"was re-organizing and shifting sides and wasn't paying attention.\" The court expressed frustration with counsel's failure to move for a mistrial, noting that \"[t]he minute the response was made we could have excused the panel and [trial counsel] could have made that motion right at that moment.\" The court then asked defense counsel whether he was moving for a mistrial but defense counsel declined to answer immediately because he wanted to consult with Defendant. The court granted a recess for defense counsel to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 After the recess, and still outside the presence of the jury, the discussion continued. The court noted, \"Here we have what I perceive as a pretty significant situation,\" and stated, \"I don't know how to cure it at this point and maybe we can't[.]\" The court was also worried about an appeal should Defendant be convicted: \"I just don't want to try this again in a year or two years because [the appellate courts] send it back on an ineffective assistance [of counsel claim.]\" Nevertheless, the court indicated that if defense counsel moved for a mistrial, \"the likelihood that I'm going to grant it is very slim mostly because of untimeliness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 Both the court and the prosecutor expressed concern that, because the jury had been sworn, jeopardy had attached. Consequently, they speculated as to whether Defendant could \"waive double jeopardy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then asked whether defense counsel wanted to move for a mistrial, defense counsel made the motion, and the trial court denied it as untimely. The jury was then called into the courtroom, and the trial proceeded, ultimately resulting in Defendant's conviction. Defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 On appeal, and represented by new counsel, Defendant contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance from his defense counsel when counsel failed to make a timely motion for mistrial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review; consequently, we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Layton City v.

Defendant asserts that, to fulfill this responsibility, counsel should have moved for a mistrial before the jury was sworn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 Generally, if counsel knows or believes that a juror or jury should be disqualified due to bias or prejudice, the correct time to raise an objection is before the jury is sworn.\n   <em>\n    Burton v.

This is because the range of remedies short of a mistrial may be reduced after the jury has been sworn and jeopardy attaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant notes that defense counsel had \"multiple opportunities to move for a mistrial before the jury was sworn but failed to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 The State responds that \"counsel properly chose to postpone his mistrial motion.\" Citing rule 18 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, the State argues that \"[c]hallenges to juror bias must be against an individual juror\" and not against an entire prospective juror pool. According to the State, if defense counsel had raised a challenge before the jury was selected, he would have had to question each member of the venire individually as to whether they heard and were affected by Juror Five's comments. As a result, the State insists that it was objectively reasonable for defense counsel to avoid drawing attention to those comments by postponing the challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 \"The interpretation of a rule of procedure is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We do not agree that, before the swearing of the jury, defense counsel was limited only to challenging prospective jurors individually. Rather, defense counsel could have properly moved for a mistrial during jury selection. Such a motion would have been equivalent to a motion for new trial under rule 24 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Crim. P. 24(a). Unlike a challenge to an individual juror made pursuant to rule 18 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, a motion for new trial pursuant to rule 24 may be made at any point during the\n   trial process; the only timing restriction is that such a motion \"shall be made not later than 14 days after entry of the sentence, or within such further time as the court may fix[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986040\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/262/468/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 24(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

While it is true that a motion for new trial is timely at any point during the trial process, it is also incumbent upon the parties to make such motions at the earliest possible opportunity to avoid wasting time and resources. As the State points out, defense counsel had several opportunities after the problematic comments were made and before the jury was sworn to move for a mistrial outside the jury's hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, at any of those times, defense counsel could have asked the court for time to speak with Defendant privately.

The State asserts, \"Because they knew [Juror Five] worked in law enforcement, they may well have concluded that her 'affiliations' were with the criminal defense attorney representing Defendant.\" However, it is unlikely that prospective jurors would have reached this understanding; when responding to a question, people rarely refer to the questioner in the third person rather than the second person. It would not be logical for a prospective juror to believe that Juror Five would reply to trial counsel's question by stating that she had \"had affiliations with him\" when she meant she had \"had affiliations with you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 The State also responds that the prospective jurors might have understood that the \"affiliation\" was \"as a witness, a victim, or a confidential informant.\" But these categories still bear a reasonable inference that Defendant had previously engaged in drug-related activities of the sort for which he was on trial, especially when Juror Five's comment referred to her multiple interactions \"with him.\" Indeed, many confidential informants in drug cases agree to become informants in order to \"work-off\" their own drug-related charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 In any event, the issue is not whether the prospective jurors\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   arrived at an innocent understanding of Juror Five's comment but rather whether it is reasonable to presume they all did.

But, more importantly, Juror Five was not a witness and her comment was not made under oath. The comment added corroborating weight to the evidence adduced at trial but was not subject to cross-examination by Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

After dismissing Juror Five, the court asked the remaining prospective jurors about the presumption of innocence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Would any of you have difficulty in affording the defendant his guarantee of being considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or stated another way would any of you believe that because the defendant has been charged in this case by the State, that there must be some basis for his guilt? All right. I don't see any hands raised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State argues that the lack of response to this question indicated that the prospective jurors did not consider Defendant more likely to be guilty of the charged crime as a result of Juror Five's comment made during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 We do not agree that this question was a panacea for Juror Five's comment. The question asked by the court was focused on ferreting out possible bias arising from the fact that Defendant had been charged by the State. It was not aimed at establishing whether the prospective jurors believed it was more likely that Defendant was guilty of the charged drug crime due to his previous \"affiliations\" with the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force. Consequently, the trial court's question did not shed much light on the potential taint caused by Juror Five's improper comment. Furthermore, \"[r]uling that a prospective juror is qualified to sit simply because he says he will be fair ignores the common-sense psychological and legal reality of the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

[C]oncluding the issue by taking a juror's conclusory statement that he or she will ... decide the case fairly is not sufficient\"). The trial court's question about the presumption of innocence therefore was not sufficient by itself to eliminate the possibility that Juror Five's comment tainted the other prospective jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Juror Five's comment suggested that Defendant had repeatedly had some involvement in the type of crimes he was on trial for, and the comment improperly corroborated a witness's testimony. Absent Juror Five's comment, there is a reasonable likelihood that the result of Defendant's trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b615 note 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 We conclude that trial counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced Defendant.
