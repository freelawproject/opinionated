He claimed self-defense at trial and contends he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his lawyer on direct appeal failed to assign error to the trial court's refusal to instruct jurors that he had no duty to retreat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 His petition fails for either of two reasons. First, there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Harvey had a right to be in the private parking lot of an apartment complex where he shot the two victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Second, he persuaded the trial court not to give a first aggressor instruction that the State requested and that, while not necessary, was supported by the evidence. The trial court accepted his contention that both sides would be able to argue their theories to the jury without a first aggressor instruction. By placing his strategic priority on avoiding a jury determination whether he was the first aggressor, Mr. Harvey waived his right to an instruction that would not apply if he\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the first aggressor. The petition is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Convictions, appeal, and the present petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In late September 2009, Merle Harvey shot and killed Jack Lamere and Jacob Potter. The State charged him with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm. Mr. Harvey admitted that he shot the men, but claimed he did so in self-defense. The jury found him guilty of the first degree murder of Mr. Lamere, the second degree murder of Mr. Potter, and both charges of unlawfully possessing a firearm. On appeal, this court affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Mr. Harvey successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to permit supplementation of the record, the matter was remanded, briefed and argued further, and Mr. Harvey's convictions were again affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In a timely personal restraint petition, Mr. Harvey now argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to assign error to the trial court's refusal to give a \"no duty to retreat\" instruction requested by his trial lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Relevant trial evidence, jury instruction proposals, and objections\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 It was undisputed that what precipitated the killing of Mr. Lamere and Mr. Potter was Mr. Harvey's effort on a fall evening in 2009 to reclaim a Chevrolet Blazer from Mr. Lamere in the parking lot of the apartment complex where Mr. Lamere's girlfriend lived. Several months earlier, Mr. Harvey and Mr. Lamere exchanged vehicles, with Mr. Harvey obtaining a Cadillac from Mr. Lamere and Mr. Lamere obtaining Mr. Harvey's Blazer. Mr. Harvey's version of the exchange was that he had only agreed with Mr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lamere to test drive each other's vehicles but that Mr. Lamere took off with the Blazer and refused to return it, leaving Mr. Harvey with a Cadillac with mechanical problems that he did not want.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 On the evening Mr. Lamere and Mr. Potter were shot, Mr. Harvey and his girlfriend, Diane Richardson, drove around in Mr. Harvey's flatbed pickup truck looking for the Blazer. At around 9:00 p.m., the pair found Mr. Lamere and the Blazer in the parking lot of the apartment complex where Mr. Lamere's girlfriend was a tenant. Ms. Richardson, who was driving the flatbed truck, pulled into the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Only two eyewitnesses to the shooting that followed testified at trial: Mr. Harvey and Lori Averill, a tenant at the apartment complex who was sitting outside near where the shooting occurred. Hiram Michel, also a tenant, testified to events he saw before the shooting and after he emerged from his apartment later and heard shots being fired. A Spokane police detective, Chet Gilmore, testified to what Mr. Harvey told him several weeks following the shooting, after Mr. Harvey had been located and agreed to make a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Harvey, the evidence showed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey never traded vehicles with Mr. Lamere but was only the victim of Mr. Lamere tricking him into test driving each other's cars, only to drive off with Mr. Harvey's Blazer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey wanted his Blazer back, so when he and Ms. Richardson came across Mr. Lamere in the parking lot of the apartment complex where Mr. Lamere's girlfriend lived, they decided to approach him about obtaining the return of the Blazer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00a6 The only reason Mr. Harvey had two rifles in his flatbed truck on the day he came across Mr. Lamere was because he had gone target shooting that afternoon;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a6 After speaking with Mr. Lamere and learning of his insistence that the Cadillac be delivered, Ms. Richardson left and borrowed a phone to arrange for someone to deliver it, reporting to Mr.\n   Lamere on her return that it was on its way as requested;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00a6 While Ms. Richardson was gone, Mr. Harvey (who remained seated in the flatbed truck) saw Mr. Lamere and Mr. Potter (who was in the parking lot with Mr. Lamere when Mr. Harvey and Ms. Richardson arrived) whispering in what he believed to be a menacing way;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey knew that Mr. Lamere was a violent and dangerous person, so the conduct of Mr. Lamere and Mr. Potter made him fearful;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey assembled and loaded one of his rifles for the protection of himself and Ms. Richardson;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey saw Mr. Potter rummaging for something in the back seat of his truck and believed he grabbed a gun and put it in his waistband;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00a6 After Ms. Richardson returned from making a phone call, she resumed her position in the driver's seat of the flatbed truck and she, not Mr. Harvey, pulled it forward to block Mr. Lamere from leaving in the Blazer;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Lamere was slamming doors and yelling angrily while Mr. Harvey attempted to explain that someone was bringing the Cadillac; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey did not begin firing on Mr. Lamere and Mr. Potter until he saw them and a third man moving toward his truck, reaching for guns in their waistbands,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   causing him to fear for his and Ms. Richardson's lives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 10 Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence showed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey had Mr. Lamere's Cadillac and Mr. Lamere had Mr. Harvey's Blazer for a couple of months before the shooting, during which Mr. Harvey had sometimes acknowledged to trial witnesses that the two men had made a trade. But witnesses were also aware that Mr. Harvey was unhappy about the trade and had pressed Mr. Lamere to return the Blazer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey was very angry on the day of the murders about Mr. Lamere's refusal to return the Blazer and left an angry and profane voicemail message for a friend of Mr. Lamere's that was played to jurors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey knew that Mr. Lamere was violent and had seen him act violently with little provocation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Harvey, who had previously been convicted of a serious offense and could not legally possess a firearm, took two rifles with him when he went looking for Mr. Lamere and the Blazer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00a6 One of the rifles was already loaded when Mr. Harvey and Ms. Richardson arrived at the parking lot and Mr. Harvey assembled and loaded the other while Ms. Richardson was off making a phone call to arrange for delivery of the Cadillac;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00a6 When Ms. Richardson returned and told Mr. Lamere the Cadillac was coming, Mr. Lamere told her and Mr. Harvey that they had a done deal and he wanted them to \"get out of [ ]here.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 349;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00a6 When Mr. Lamere then got into the Blazer, Mr. Harvey told Ms. Richardson to pull the flatbed truck forward and \"pin Mr. Lamere in so he couldn't drive\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   that Blazer out of there,\" RP at 850, which she did;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00a6 After blocking Mr. Lamere from leaving in the Blazer, Mr. Harvey then stepped out of the truck angrily, said, \"[G]et that f***ing truck,\" or he was \"taking the f***ing truck ... right now,\" and said he \"was done with [Mr. Lamere] ripping people off.\" RP at 351-52, 355. He then reached into his truck, retrieved his gun, and shot Mr. Lamere and then Mr. Potter; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00a6 Mr. Lamere was carrying a gun in his waistband but had not drawn his gun or pointed it at Mr. Harvey or Ms. Richardson, and Mr. Potter, who had been looking for a tool in his truck when the\n   shooting started, proved to be carrying a pistol-grip flashlight, not a gun, when he was shot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State did not contest Mr. Harvey's right to having the jury instructed on self-defense, but proposed that jurors also be given a first aggressor instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 12 The record is clear that in arguing how the jury should be instructed, Mr. Harvey's priority was to avoid the giving of a first aggressor instruction. At the outset of trial, he filed a brief opposing the giving of the instruction, arguing that first aggressor instructions \"are not favored by Washington Courts.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 181. He quoted this court's 1985 decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Arthur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804142\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/42/120/\">\n    42 Wash. App. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=708%20P.2d%201230\">\n    708 P.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which stated, \"[F]ew situations come to mind where the necessity for [a first] aggressor instruction is warranted. The theories of the case can be sufficiently argued and understood by the jury without such instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=708%20P.2d%201230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 13 Argument over the giving of the first aggressor instruction was protracted. Over 40 pages of the verbatim report of proceedings reflect the court's consideration of Mr. Harvey's objections to the first aggressor instruction. The trial court first heard argument over the giving of the instruction on the afternoon before the case was submitted to the jurors. The court observed, \"Sometimes it's kind of hard to know where to go on these cases where you've got the aggression coming from both sides.\" RP at 1130. The court was persuaded that afternoon that it should give the instruction. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [I]n this case, you've got this incredibly volatile situation. You've got Mr. Harvey on the day of this incident ranting over the phone, angry, belligerent about this car. ... [T]here is evidence that he's driving around looking, you know. He's looking for Jack Lamere. He's looking for his Blazer. ... I think the issue here is going to be is this behavior on the part of Mr. Harvey that wasn't perhaps pulling the gun first still sort of aggressive enough that it created this belligerent response in [Mr.] Lamere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Certainly, Mr. Harvey knew it didn't take a lot, according to the evidence ... it didn't take a lot to provoke Jack Lamere. And Mr. Harvey is ... out of control. He's positioning his truck so Mr. Harvey can't get out-or Mr. Lamere can't get out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   So again, the issue here is was Mr. Harvey using more than his words. And I have to find that he was, and I think it's an appropriate case for the first aggressor instruction. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Giving the first aggressor instruction, I think, is helpful to the jury in this particular case because of these particular circumstances. It allows the State to argue its side of the case. It allows the defense to argue its side of the case. It just gives the jury a little more assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   RP at 1133-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 14 Following the ruling, defense counsel argued that giving the first aggressor instruction would create a need to give further instructions; for instance, it would require an instruction that words alone do not make one a first aggressor. The trial court told defense counsel to research any problems created by giving the instruction and it would entertain further argument in the morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 15 Later that same afternoon, there was discussion of Mr. Harvey's proposed \"no duty to retreat\" instruction-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WPIC\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   16.08. Discussion of WPIC 16.08 was brief. When the trial court questioned Mr. Harvey's lawyer about whether the instruction applied, he responded \"I do. I am requesting it. I would object to not giving it.\" RP at 1188-89. He did not elaborate further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 16 Asked to respond, the prosecutor stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I don't believe this one is appropriate under the facts of this case. The facts in this case indicate Mr. Harvey went to where Mr. Lamere resided and confronted him at that place.\n   <em>\n    I don't believe that he had a right necessarily to be there\n   </em>\n   at that home of Mr. Lamere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   RP at 1189 (emphasis added). The prosecutor conceded, however, that the no duty to retreat instruction should be given if the first aggressor instruction was given and the court agreed. Defense counsel's only further argument that Mr. Harvey had a right to be in the apartment parking lot was that Mr. Lamere, who was only a visitor to the apartment complex, had no right to order him to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 17 The following morning, Mr. Harvey made further arguments against the giving of a first aggressor instruction. He told the court, \"To give this instruction is a comment upon the evidence and it's likely to cause [Mr. Harvey] to have an unfair trial. We'll be right back here in a couple of years.\" RP at 1212. The court conceded, \"I worry about giving the aggressor instruction. But I also worry about not giving it.\" RP at 1216.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 18 After hearing from both parties, the trial court said, \"Okay. I'm going to reverse myself and not give the first aggressor instruction.\" RP at 1229. The court made clear that it was persuaded by defense counsel that\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   giving the instruction was the conservative way to go. The trial court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [I]f I make a mistake, and I think this is a real borderline issue on both sides, if I make a mistake and I give the aggressor instruction ... and if there is a conviction, there is a fairly significant chance I would be reversed. If I make a mistake the other way and I don't give the aggressor instruction, and there is a conviction, nobody is going to reverse on that. ... I hate to put it in such crass terms. I think there is a bigger pothole here if I give the instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I still think it's a real close call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 19 Immediately after this ruling, the prosecutor stated that because the trial court's decision to give the no duty to retreat instruction had gone hand in hand with giving the first aggressor instruction, the no duty to retreat instruction should be stricken. Asked to respond, defense counsel stated only, \"State says someone held at gunpoint, judge,\" and began to explain that the apartment complex manager had testified that Mr. Lamere was not himself a tenant, but the guest of a tenant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   RP at 1230. The court ruled it would not give either the first aggressor or no duty to retreat instructions. Mr. Harvey later made formal objection to the court's refusal to give the no duty to retreat instruction, but never argued any other reasons why refusal to give the instruction was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 20 Mr. Harvey appealed. He did not argue in his brief on appeal or his statement of additional grounds that the trial court erred by refusing to give a no duty to retreat instruction. The argument is raised for the first time in this timely personal restraint petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 21 Mr. Harvey argues that his appellate counsel provided ineffective representation by failing to assign error to the trial court's refusal to give his proposed no duty to retreat instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 22 To obtain relief in a personal restraint petition, Mr. Harvey must show actual and substantial prejudice resulting from alleged constitutional errors or, for alleged nonconstitutional errors, a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

It will thereby enable both sides to argue their theories. From the three instructions, a defendant can argue that he or she was not the first aggressor and was entitled to stand his or her ground. From the three instructions, the State can argue that if the jury finds that the defendant\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the first aggressor, then he or she must retreat before enjoying a revived right of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 39 Sometimes, however, as happened here, a trial court will be persuaded that caution dictates not giving a first aggressor instruction even where the evidence would support it.

We infer that defense counsel's point was going to be that Mr. Lamere was not himself a tenant and could not order anyone to leave.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    As Professor Stoebuck has observed, \"While Washington has recognized hardly any of the many privileges described in the\n    <em>\n     Restatement of Torts\n    </em>\n    , there is reason to suppose the\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    would be persuasive in Washington on the question of privilege, as it has been on other aspects of trespass law.\" 17 William B. Stoebuck &amp; John W. Weaver, Washington Practice: Real Estate: Property Law \u00a7 10.2, at 650 (2d ed. 2004).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    As the parties recognize, a secured party's statutory privilege under RCW 62A.9A-609(b)(2) to repossess property if it proceeds without breach of the peace did not apply to Mr. Harvey, who had no Article 9A security interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The State argues persuasively that the prosecutor's emphasis on the fact that Mr. Harvey did not leave was not to suggest that he had a duty to retreat, but was instead in support of the State's contention that these were premeditated murders. Mr. Harvey's trial lawyer appears to have believed as well that premeditation was the point of the prosecutor's references. When Mr. Harvey's proposed no duty to retreat jury instruction was discussed toward the end of trial, defense counsel did not argue that the instruction was needed because the State had implied through opening statement and testimony that Mr. Harvey had a duty to retreat.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
