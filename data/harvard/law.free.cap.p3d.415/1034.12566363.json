Or. Laws 1967, ch. 242, \u00a7 1 (stating the purposes of the act). That statute, which was codified as ORS 305.655, set out formulas that multistate businesses could use to determine the portion of their income that was subject to taxation in Oregon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1993, the Oregon legislature provided that businesses could not use the apportionment formulas set out in ORS 305.655 to the extent that those formulas differed from apportionment formulas set out in another set of Oregon statutes. Or. Laws 1993, ch. 726, \u00a7 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2010 and 2011, Health Net, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively \"taxpayer\") sought a refund for tax years 2005 to 2007, claiming that ORS 305.655 had created contractual obligations, which the 1993 law impaired in violation of the state and federal contract clauses. The Tax Court rejected that claim, holding that ORS 305.655 created only statutory rights, which the legislature was free to modify. In doing so, the Tax Court aligned Oregon with all the state courts that have addressed this issue. We now affirm the Tax Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case presents primarily two issues. The first is whether, in enacting ORS 305.655, the 1967 legislature went beyond enacting a statute intended to promote the uniform taxation of multistate businesses and instead entered into a binding contract, which the 1993 law impaired in violation of the state and federal contract clauses. The second is whether the 1993 legislation impliedly repealing part of ORS 305.655 violated Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution by not setting out the text of that statute. Before addressing those issues, we first describe briefly the background that underlies taxpayer's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    National developments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1957, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws promulgated a uniform act-the Uniform Distribution of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA)-to provide a fair way to apportion income earned by multistate businesses among the various states. Arthur D. Lynn, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Ohio%20St.%20L.J.%2041\">\n    19 Ohio St. L.J. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958).

Of relevance here, UDITPA provides that all business income shall be apportioned using an equally weighted average of three ratios, which reflect a business's property, payroll, and sales within and without a state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Richfield Co. v.

Specifically, the Court held that the Commerce Clause did not prohibit Minnesota from taxing a foreign corporation's in-state sales, even though those sales were exclusively in furtherance of interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n    at 452, 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n    79 S.Ct. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court accordingly found it unnecessary to decide whether\n   a different method of apportioning income from interstate sales would raise constitutional issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The decision in\n   <em>\n    Northwestern Cement Co.\n   </em>\n   led to two related but separate congressional responses. First, six months after\n   <em>\n    Northwestern Cement Co.\n   </em>\n   was decided, Congress enacted a statute that precluded a state from taxing an out-of-state corporation's income when the corporation's only activity within the state was either soliciting sales or using an independent contractor to solicit those sales.

Second, Congress appointed a commission to study whether further federal measures were necessary to avoid unduly burdensome taxation of multistate businesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Among other things, the resulting study noted that there was a \"widespread adoption of the three-factor property-payroll-sales formula\" for apportioning income.\n   <em>\n    State Taxation of Interstate Commerce: Report of the Special Subcommittee on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce\n   </em>\n   , H.R. Rep. No. 88-1480, at 119 (1964). The study also noted, however, that there were variations in the way that sales were allocated to states, and Congress considered legislation that would have limited the states' authority to tax multistate business income.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Frank M.

Rev. at 158. To further promote the uniform taxation of business income and to ward off further federal intervention in state taxation, the Council of State Governments drafted the MTC in 1966 and circulated it among the states in early 1967. The MTC consists of 12 articles. Article IV incorporates the apportionment formulas set out in UDITPA. Article III permits a multistate business to elect either the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV or apportionment formulas set out elsewhere in a state's tax code to determine the portion\n   of the business's income that is subject to taxation in that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Article VI creates the Multistate Tax Commission, which is composed of representatives from member states and funded by donations and grants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commission may recommend rules to member states to advance the uniform application of state tax laws, but member states are free to accept or reject any rule the commission recommends. Art. VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two other articles provide additional means for enhancing the uniform application of state tax laws. Article VIII permits a member state to ask the commission to audit a corporation's books, papers, and records, but \"only in those party States that specifically provide therefor by statute.\" Art. VIII, \u00a7 1. Article IX provides for arbitration of a state agency's determination regarding apportionment or allocation if the commission adopts a regulation \"placing this Article in effect.\" Art. IX, \u00a7 1. California enacted the MTC on the condition that Article IX not be placed in effect, and that article is not in effect.\n   <em>\n    Gillette Co. v.

Because Article IV of the MTC incorporates UDITPA, those two Oregon statutes initially provided the same formulas for apportioning business income.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ORS 314.605 to 314.675 (1965) (Oregon's version of UDITPA),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Article IV of ORS 305.655 (incorporating the apportionment formulas from UDITPA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Article III of ORS 305.655, a business could elect either set of apportionment formulas. However, because the formulas were the same, the ability to elect one or the other initially made no difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beginning in 1989, the legislature enacted a series of amendments to the apportionment formulas in Oregon's version of UDITPA, which progressively increased the weight given the sales factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Or. Laws 1989, ch. 1088, \u00a7 1 (increasing the weight given the sales factor from 33.33 percent to 50 percent); Or. Laws 2001, ch. 793, \u00a7 1 (increasing the weight given the sales factor to 80 percent); Or. Laws 2003, ch. 739, \u00a7 1 (increasing the weight given the sales factor to 90 percent). In 2005, the legislature completed that progression by providing that only the sales factor would be used to determine the percentage\n   of a multistate business's income that is taxable in Oregon.

Laws 2005, ch. 832, \u00a7 49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the legislature modified the apportionment formulas set out in Oregon's version of UDITPA, the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV of ORS 305.655 remained unchanged. At first, that difference had no practical effect on multistate businesses. Under Article III of ORS 305.655, a multistate business could elect to have its taxable Oregon income determined using either the formulas set out in Article IV of ORS 305.655 or the modified formulas set out in Oregon's version of UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 1993, however, the legislature provided that, to the extent that Oregon's version of UDITPA conflicted with ORS 305.655, Oregon's version of UDITPA controlled. Or. Laws 1993, ch. 726, \u00a7 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powerex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363759\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/40/#p60\">\n    357 Or. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363759\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/40/#p60\">\n    346 P.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying that rule). As a result of the 1993 act, Oregon eliminated a multistate business's ability to elect the statutory apportionment formulas set out in Article IV of ORS 305.655 and required instead that the business use the modified apportionment formulas set out in Oregon's version of UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Procedural background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Taxpayer is a multistate corporation that has been doing business in Oregon since at least 1989. In 2010, taxpayer filed refund claims with the Oregon Department of Revenue (the department) for the 2005 and 2006 tax years. In 2011, taxpayer filed a refund claim for the 2007 tax year. Taxpayer's refund claims rest on the following propositions: In enacting ORS 305.655 in 1967, the Oregon legislature entered into a contract with other states that enact the MTC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the terms of the MTC, the legislature could not eliminate taxpayer's right granted by Article III to elect the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV unless Oregon withdrew from the contract pursuant to Article X, which Oregon had not done at that point. It followed, taxpayer concluded, that the department had breached the contractual obligations created by Article III when it failed to honor taxpayer's election. Taxpayer recognized that the Oregon legislature had altered those obligations in 1993. However, it contended that the 1993 act impaired its contract rights in violation of the state and federal contract clauses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Tax Court granted the department's motion and denied taxpayer's. It did so for three reasons. The Tax Court concluded that: (1) even assuming that ORS 305.655 gave rise to contractual obligations, those contractual obligations were illusory because Oregon was free to withdraw from the MTC at any time; (2) the text and context of ORS 305.655 do not reflect an unambiguous intent to create contractual, as opposed to statutory, obligations; and (3) the course of conduct by other states that had enacted the MTC (subsequently overriding the election provisions of Article III) was further evidence that Article III of ORS 305.655 did not create contractual obligations. The Tax Court accordingly entered judgment in the department's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This appeal presents essentially two issues. The first is whether the 1993 act eliminating\n   a business's right under Article III of ORS 305.655 to elect the apportionment formulas in Article IV of that statute violates either the state or federal contract clauses. That issue turns initially on a subsidiary state-law question: whether, in enacting ORS 305.655, the 1967 legislature intended to impose contractual obligations on the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

The second issue is whether the bill enacting the 1993 act failed to comply with Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution because it did not set out the text of ORS 305.655. We begin by considering whether ORS 305.655 created contractual obligations or only statutory ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III. ORS 305.655\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Taxpayer argues that, when the Oregon legislature enacted ORS 305.655 in 1967, it entered into a contract\n   with other states that also enacted the MTC. Taxpayer bases that argument primarily on the use of the word \"compact\" in ORS 305.655, the conditions that Article X places on ORS 305.655 going into effect and on withdrawing from the compact, and the history that preceded the drafting of the MTC. The department responds that, in determining whether ORS 305.655 created contractual obligations rather than statutory ones, we should begin with the standard that this court customarily applies: before a statute will give rise to contractual obligations, the legislature's intent to do so must be clear and unmistakable. Additionally, the department argues that we should focus on how ORS 305.655 functions, not on the label that the legislature used. Applying those principles, the department reasons that ORS 305.655 is functionally no different from a uniform law, the enactment of which does not create contractual obligations. At a minimum, the department contends, the legislature's intent to create contractual obligations was ambiguous-a conclusion that, under this court's cases, defeats taxpayer's attempt to convert statutory rights into contractual ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nationally, the proposition that underlies taxpayer's argument-that states that enact the MTC enter into a contract with each other-has given rise to two related but separate legal challenges. The first occurred five years after the MTC was drafted and circulated among the states. In 1972, corporations faced with an audit under Article VIII of the MTC argued that the MTC was an \"Agreement or Compact\" among the states within the meaning of the Compact Clause of the federal constitution and, as a result, was unenforceable because Congress had never approved it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp. v.

Rather, the state courts that have reached the issue uniformly have concluded, albeit for differing reasons, that enacting the MTC gave rise only to statutory rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At first blush, it would appear that only the latter group of cases would bear on the state-law contract question that this case presents. Although the issue presented in the second group of cases is virtually indistinguishable from the issue presented here, the United States Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   also warrants consideration. That decision laid the groundwork for much of the analysis that followed in the later state cases, even though the two sets of issues are not identical. We accordingly begin by describing the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   We then discuss\n   the variations on that reasoning in the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gillette\n   </em>\n   and the Minnesota Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kimberly-Clark Corporation\n   </em>\n   , the leading state cases addressing whether enacting the MTC created contractual obligations. Finally, we turn to the question whether, as a matter of Oregon law, our legislature entered into a contract with other MTC states when it enacted ORS 305.655.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Decisions from other jurisdictions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    United States Supreme Court:\n   </em>\n   U.S. Steel Corp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , a group of multistate businesses sought to avoid application of the audit provisions in Article VIII of the MTC on the ground that the MTC was unenforceable under the Compact Clause. That clause provides: \"No. State shall, without the Consent of Congress, * * * enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3. Because Congress has not consented to the MTC, the question before the Court was whether the MTC was an \"Agreement or Compact\" within the meaning of the Compact Clause.

Nor is there any delegation of sovereign power to the [Multistate Tax] Commission; each\n   State retains complete freedom to adopt or reject the rules and regulations of the Commission. Moreover, as noted above, each State is free to withdraw at any time.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that view of the rights and obligations created by the MTC, the Court concluded that the MTC did not encroach upon the sovereignty of the federal government and, as a result, did not require congressional approval to become effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   is limited to the Compact Clause, its reasoning reaches more broadly. As the Court described the rights and obligations created by the MTC, they resemble a uniform law rather than a contract among the states that enact it. As the Court recognized, the MTC does not create reciprocal obligations among the member states. Rather, each state that enacts the MTC can apply Articles III and IV of the MTC regardless of whether any other state adopts the MTC. Conversely, if any state that enacted the MTC later modified its terms or repealed it entirely, those actions would have no effect on the ability of another state to apply the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV to determine the portion of a multistate business's income that is subject to taxation in that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Put differently, each state can apply Articles III and IV independently, as is true of a uniform law. That conclusion is hardly surprising since Articles III and IV merely implement a uniform law, UDITPA, which individual states are free to adopt, modify, or repeal independently. Moreover, as the Court explained, in enacting the MTC, states do not delegate their sovereign power to a regulatory agency in return for binding rules that apply to multiple jurisdictions. Rather, the commission created by the MTC can only recommend rules, which member states are free to adopt or reject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In short, as the Court described the MTC, it resembles a uniform law, not a binding contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To be sure, in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the Court did not reach the question whether states that enact the MTC enter into a binding contract with each other. However, the state courts that have decided that question have agreed, for reasons that parallel the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , that no contract was formed.

Rather, each state that enacts the MTC is free to apply the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV of ORS 305.655 regardless of whether any other state enacts, repeals, or modifies the MTC. Indeed, as explained above, two years before Oregon enacted the MTC, Oregon enacted UDITPA, a uniform law that initially applied the same apportionment formulas set out in Article IV of the MTC. If Oregon's enactment of UDITPA did not result in its entering into a contract with every other state that enacted UDITPA, then it is difficult to see why Articles III and IV of the MTC, viewed functionally, should lead to a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Not only are Articles III and IV functionally identical to a uniform law that each state may enact independently, but, as the United States Supreme Court explained, the MTC lacks a \"delegation of sovereign power to the [Multistate Tax] Commission; each State retains complete freedom to adopt or reject [the Commission's proposed] rules.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    434 U.S. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the creation of the Commission provides no basis for saying that Oregon (or any other member state) contracted away its sovereign authority to determine tax policy to a central agency in return for binding multistate rules. Textually and functionally, the structure of Articles III, IV, and VI of ORS 305.655 is far closer to a uniform law, which each state can adopt independently and which each state remains free to modify if it chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Taxpayer, however, points to other aspects of ORS 305.655, which it contends demonstrate that the legislature created contractual rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayer focuses primarily on the use of the word \"compact\" in ORS 305.655. Taxpayer reasons that, because a compact is a contract, the use of that term implies that the legislature intended that ORS 305.655 would create binding contractual obligations. In our view, the use of the word \"compact\" has less significance than taxpayer perceives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is certainly true that many interstate compacts are contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

But it does not follow that all interstate compacts are agreements or compacts within the meaning of the Compact Clause, nor does it follow that every statute labeled a compact is a contract, as taxpayer asserts. As discussed above, the United States Supreme Court explained that labeling the MTC a compact did not mean that it was an \"Agreement or Compact\" within the meaning of the Compact Clause.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    434 U.S. at 470-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What mattered, the Court reasoned, was how the resulting combination of states functioned, not the label used to describe the combination. We are persuaded, as other state courts have been, that that reasoning applies equally to the question presented here: The MTC's use of the label \"compact\" is not controlling; also significant is the way the resulting combination of states functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The same conclusion follows from the contemporaneous use of the term \"compact.\" At approximately the same time that the Council of State Governments was drafting the MTC in 1966, the term \"compact\" was being used to describe what were merely cooperative arrangements among states.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   David E. Engdahl,\n   <em>\n    Characterization of Interstate Arrangements: When is a Compact Not a Compact?\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%2063\">\n    64 Mich.

As Engdahl explained a year before the MTC was drafted, \"[t]he most common type of 'compact' currently being concluded merely creates a study or advisory commission of representatives from each participating state,\" who \"are instructed to recommend to their respective individual states coordinated programs of legislation designed to deal with whatever problems of conservation, health, safety, or similar matters the 'compact' may contemplate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%2063\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%2063\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Felix Frankfurter and James M.

That contemporaneous use of the term \"compact\" cuts\n   against taxpayer's argument that the use of that term in ORS 305.655 necessarily establishes that the Oregon legislature intended to create binding contractual rights and obligations when it enacted ORS 305.655.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Taxpayer argues additionally that ORS 305.655 contains procedural features that demonstrate that it creates contractual obligations. In our view, the strongest support for taxpayer's position is found in the prefatory language to ORS 305.655 and Article X. The prefatory language states that the MTC \"is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state.\" ORS 305.655. Article X provides that the compact goes into effect if six other states enact similar legislation. ORS 305.655, Art. X. It also provides that \"[a]ny party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Yale%20L.J.%20685\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those provisions assume that a compact exists (or can exist) separately from individual legislative acts enacting and repealing it. We agree with taxpayer that those parts of ORS 305.655 support an argument that the act creates obligations beyond those ordinarily flowing from legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   However, saying that parts of ORS 305.655 are consistent with taxpayer's claim that ORS 305.655 created contractual obligations does not mean that the text of ORS 305.655 expresses that intent clearly and unmistakably. Rather, as explained above, other parts of ORS 305.655 point in a different direction. Not only are Articles III and IV of ORS 305.655 functionally no different from a uniform law, but the absence of reciprocal legislation and a regulatory commission also cut against the conclusion that the statute imposes contractual obligations. Given those competing considerations, we cannot say that the text of Articles III and IV clearly and unmistakably creates contractual obligations, which is the standard that taxpayer must meet to convert a statute into a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Context\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Taxpayer argues, however, that the context of ORS 305.655 demonstrates that the 1967 Oregon legislature intended to create contractual obligations. The context on which taxpayer relies consists primarily of the legal backdrop against which ORS 305.655 was enacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Figueroa v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414813\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/142/#p147\">\n    361 Or. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414813\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/142/#p147\">\n    390 P.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (identifying existing law as context). As noted above, in 1959, the Court held that the Commerce Clause does not bar a state from taxing sales solicited by foreign companies even though those sales were exclusively in furtherance of interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    Northwestern Cement Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n    358 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659482\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/450/\">\n    79 S.Ct. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, Congress enacted a statute that required foreign corporations to have a physical presence within a state as a predicate to taxing the corporation's in-state sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Congress also considered legislation that would have imposed additional restrictions on the states' ability to tax income earned by multistate businesses. As taxpayer notes, to avoid those proposed restrictions, states sought to increase uniformity in state taxation. Toward that goal, more states adopted UDITPA. By 1967, 19 of the 38 states that taxed income earned by multistate businesses had adopted all or virtually all of UDITPA. Keesling and Warren, 15 UCLA L. Rev. at 158. Additionally, by 1972, 21 of those 38 states had adopted the MTC, which incorporates UDITPA.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    434 U.S. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Taxpayer infers from that context that, in adopting the MTC, states intended to enter into binding contractual obligations. However, that inference does not necessarily follow from the goal that taxpayer identifies. Rather, states could increase uniformity in taxation and thus attempt to ward off further\n   federal legislation either by collectively adopting uniform legislation or by entering into an agreement adopting uniform legislation. Either form of legislation advances the goal of state tax uniformity, and it does not follow from the states' desire to avoid further federal legislation that states necessarily chose one form of legislation rather than the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To be sure, a binding contractual agreement among the states could provide a more durable guarantee than\n   collectively enacting uniform legislation, which each state would be free to repeal unilaterally at any time. However, the MTC permits member states to unilaterally withdraw from the MTC by repealing the enacting statute at any time and for any reason. It thus permits states to avoid their obligations under the MTC the same way and with the same ease that they can avoid statutory obligations. Because one form of legislation provides no more durable protection than the other, the context that taxpayer identifies does not persuade us that, in enacting ORS 305.655, the Oregon legislature intended to enter into a binding agreement with the other states that enacted the MTC as opposed to collectively enacting uniform legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Legislative history\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the most part, the legislative history of ORS 305.655 focused on the goal that the statute was intended to serve-to forestall further congressional intervention in state taxation by making state taxes on multistate businesses more uniform.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minutes, Joint Ways and Means Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 10, 1967, 92-93 (remarks of Sen. Morgan); Minutes, House Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Feb. 15, 1967, 1-2 (remarks of Paul Liniger). As explained above, however, identifying that goal does not establish that, in enacting ORS 305.655, the Oregon legislature intended to enter into a binding agreement as opposed to collectively enacting a uniform law. Both forms of legislation advance the goal. At times, however, the legislative history touches on how the MTC, if enacted, would function, which sheds greater light on the issue presented here. We first set out the legislative history in greater detail and then explain why that history does not establish an unmistakable intent to enter into a binding contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   House Bill (H.B.) 1124, which was codified as ORS 305.655, was proposed by the Oregon State Tax Commission and initially considered by the House Taxation Committee.

More specifically, he did not say whether he had told the Governor's office that the MTC, if enacted, would bind the state contractually or merely impose statutory obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Ted de Looze, an assistant attorney general for the Oregon Tax Commission and Oregon's representative on a working group on the MTC, also spoke in support of the bill.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In testifying that the legislature should enact the MTC, de Looze framed the issue as whether the federal government or the states should decide state tax policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistently with that broad brush approach, de Looze spent much of his testimony describing two pending bills in Congress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He told the committee that it was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"necessary to know something about [the two bills] in order to know what the choice you're making between congressional action and between state action and to know\n   that the basic choice that you're making is between a restriction by Congress on the rights of the state to tax a corporation and the [authority] of the states to give corporations uniformity of treatment so that they're not subject to different types of enforcement laws and different rules and regulations under the laws and multiplicity of taxation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2271044\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/24/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He stressed that states should make their own policy choices about taxation by passing the MTC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Having framed the issue broadly, de Looze did not discuss the legal consequences if Oregon and six other\n   states enacted the MTC; that is, he did not expressly discuss whether enacting the MTC would create contractual obligations that would preclude Oregon from later modifying the MTC or merely statutory ones. One remark, however, that de Looze made before the House Taxation Committee touched on the issue. He told the committee that, although he could not guarantee that passing the MTC would forestall the pending federal legislation, he could say that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"if the states adopt the compact\n   <em>\n    and Congress gives us an enabling act\n   </em>\n   , then there's less likelihood that Congress will adopt [the pending federal legislation] because the states are showing that they will take care of the [uniformity] problems that Congress itself said exist.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Because congressional consent is required for certain interstate compacts, it is possible to infer from de Looze's statement, \"if *** Congress gives us an enabling act,\" that the MTC would create a compact or agreement among the states that would be effective only if Congress approved it. However, de Looze did not make that point explicitly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The House Taxation Committee approved the bill, which then went to the Joint Ways and Means Committee. As in the House Taxation Committee, the members of the Joint Ways and Means Committee focused primarily on the reasons for enacting the bill-the threat of congressional intervention into state taxation and the possibility that more uniform state taxation would forestall federal intervention. Minutes, Joint Ways and Means Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 10, 1967, 92-93 (remarks of Sen. Morgan).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, Representative Lang noted that the Council of State Governments had drafted a compact \"to head off intervention by the Federal Government in this area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92. Similarly, Senator Morgan noted that the bill was \"an attempt to prevent the Federal Government from dictating what taxes states can impose on foreign corporations\" and that \"[a]n attempt will be made to have some uniformity by the states involved so that the corporations will know\n   what one state will do in comparison to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92-93.

The first involved a colloquy between Representative Bedingfield and de Looze:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"Representative Bedingfield asked whether anything that were done as to tax laws of Oregon would have to be ratified by the Legislature. Mr. Theodore W. de Looze, attorney for the Tax Commission, said basically the laws of the state would not be changed; that any substantive change would have to be ratified by the Legislature. Authority is delegated to the Compact to adopt uniform rules and regulations,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   but the determination of who[m] Oregon would tax is a matter of substantive law determined by the Oregon Legislature. The basic purpose is to protect taxpayers from double taxation, and to\n   protect the states from having this done by the Federal Government.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2271044\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/24/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That colloquy focused on the extent to which Oregon would retain authority to determine its own tax policy, and de Looze explained that \"basically the laws of the state would not be changed.\" The colloquy could be read either broadly for the proposition that the Oregon Legislature would retain its customary authority to enact and modify its own tax laws or narrowly for the proposition that enacting the MTC would not change Oregon's tax laws because Article IV of the MTC would duplicate UDITPA, which Oregon had enacted two years earlier. The colloquy permits either interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The second interchange occurred when Representative Bedingfield asked \"what the effect would be on agreements reached by the Compact, assuming the compact has been in existence [for a number of] years, and the state\n   withdraws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. de Looze responded that he \"did not think there would be any effect as the state probably would not change its interpretation of law, and it is always beneficial to have uniform interpretations of the laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That colloquy is something of a\n   <em>\n    non sequitur\n   </em>\n   . The representative's question assumes that the Compact would reach \"agreements,\" while de Looze's answer appears to focus on interpretations of the tax laws (or perhaps interpretations of the MTC in the form of regulations proposed by the Commission) and whether those interpretations would remain in effect if Oregon were to withdraw from the compact. Ultimately, the interchange offers little insight into the question presented here. Whether ORS 305.655 created statutory obligations or contractual ones, the Commission's interpretation of either the statute or its own regulations would not bind Oregon if it were to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The final interchange bears more directly on the issue presented here. The minutes state that, \"[i]n response to Senator Newbry's question, Mr. de Looze said the Compact would have to be ratified by Congress, and a consent bill is being drafted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is possible to infer from de Looze's answer that the MTC, if enacted by seven states, would be the type of agreement or compact among the states that would require congressional ratification to be effective. However, as in the House, de Looze did not state that proposition explicitly. He stated only that \"the Compact would have to be ratified by Congress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   A similar discussion occurred before the Senate Taxation Committee. Liniger began by explaining the reasons for the act. He told the committee that the act would \"facilitate determination of tax liability of multistate taxpayers, promote uniformity or compatibility, facilitate taxpayer convenience and compliance and avoid duplicate taxation.\" Minutes, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 21, 1967, 1. He said that three states had adopted the compact, that it \"would become effective after seven state[s] adopt it.\n   <em>\n    This is providing that Congress passes a consent act\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As we read Liniger's comments, he recognized, as de Looze had before the Joint Ways and\n   Means Committee, that, even if seven states enacted the MTC, it would become effective only if \"Congress passes a consent act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Similarly, de Looze told the Senate committee that the bill \"would create uniformity in taxation\" and that it was \"hoped that the passage of this bill by the several states would persuade Congress to pass the consent legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Senator Cook asked \"what binding effect this legislation would have on Congress,\" de Looze responded that \"he would get this information from the Council of State Governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two days later, de Looze wrote a letter to the Senate committee answering Senator Cook's question. The letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"The *** question was whether, if Congress enacted a consent Act and the Multistate Tax Compact were adopted by seven or more states and were thus in operation, Congress could subsequently enact federal legislation which would be in conflict with the Compact. I have checked with the attorney for the Council of State Governments and have talked to Assistant Attorney General Timothy Malone of the Washington State Tax Commission\n   and both agree that Congress could enact legislation at a subsequent date in conflict with the provisions of the Compact. This obtains because Congress is not party to the Compact in giving its consent, and also because the Contracts Clause in the United States Constitution is binding only on the states and not on the federal government.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Exhibit, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 21, 1967 (Mar. 23, 1967, letter from Theodore W. de Looze to Sen. Harry D. Boivin). In his letter, de Looze recognized that two conditions were necessary for the compact to go \"in [to] operation\": (1) the adoption of the MTC by seven states and (2) a \"Consent Act\" passed by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As noted above, for the most part, the legislative history focused primarily on the reasons for enacting the MTC, without specifying whether doing so would result in binding contractual obligations or merely uniform collective action by the states. However, a minor theme also runs through the legislative history. de Looze's testimony before the House Taxation Committee, Liniger and de Looze's testimony before the Senate Taxation Committee, and de Looze's\n   answer to Senator Newbry's question in the hearing before the Joint Ways and Means Committee all assume that, if seven states enact the MTC, an interstate compact or agreement among the states would arise. That same legislative history, however, also establishes that the witnesses and the Oregon legislature understood that the MTC was the type of interstate agreement compact that required congressional consent to become effective. That was the message from both de Looze and Liniger, as well as the general understanding at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Keesling and Warren, 15 UCLA L. Rev. at 158 (\"As of this writing twelve states have adopted the Compact[,] but the consent of Congress is required before the Compact can become effective.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   That understanding poses a difficulty for taxpayer's argument that the Oregon legislature intended to enter in a binding contract. If the MTC was the type of interstate compact that required congressional consent and Congress consented, then the compact's operative force would derive from federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716395\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/433/\">\n    449 U.S. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439 &amp; n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716395\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/433/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716395\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/433/\">\n    66 L.Ed. 2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) (explaining that it had been settled since at least 1940 that \"congressional consent transforms an interstate compact within this Clause into a law of the United States\"). Conversely, if the MTC required congressional consent and Congress withheld its consent, then the compact or agreement would violate the Compact Clause, which provides that \"[n]o State shall, without the Consent of Congress *** enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.\" U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3. No. witness testified before the Oregon legislature that the MTC was the sort of interstate compact or agreement that did not require congressional consent and, as a result, would go into effect even if Congress refused to consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To be sure, in 1978, 11 years after Oregon enacted the MTC, the Court held that the MTC was not the sort of interstate compact that required congressional approval to become effective.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    434 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, nothing in the 1967 legislative history of ORS 305.655\n   suggests that the Oregon legislature understood that the MTC was the sort of interstate compact that would go into effect without congressional consent; rather, all the legislative history that bears on that issue points in precisely the opposite direction. It follows that the Oregon legislature would have understood from de Looze and Liniger's testimony that, without Congress's consent, the MTC would not go into operation as an interstate compact. Without consent, ORS 305.655 would have at most the force of an ordinary statute, or so the legislature would have understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Considering the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 305.655, we cannot say that those sources clearly and unmistakably establish that the Oregon legislature intended to enter into a binding contract. Textually, the terms of the statute point in two directions. As discussed, the preface to\n   ORS 305.655 and Article X contain terms that suggest that the legislature intended to enter into a compact or agreement. However, functionally, the terms of ORS 305.655 bear little resemblance to a contract. As the United States Supreme Court explained, the MTC does not permit member states to do anything collectively that each state could not do unilaterally.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    434 U.S. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184861\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/452/#p458\">\n    98 S.Ct. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the context is equally consistent with the adoption of a uniform act and an interstate compact. And while there is legislative history to support the proposition that the Oregon legislature understood it was entering into an interstate compact, that history also supports the proposition that the legislature understood that the compact would require congressional approval before the compact would go \"in[to] operation.\" In our view, those sources do not add up to a clear and unmistakable intent to enter to an agreement that would bind the states in the absence of congressional consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The concurrence would reach a different conclusion, although it ultimately agrees that taxpayer has no contractual right to enforce Article III. In our view, the concurrence's conclusion that, in enacting ORS 305.655, the 1967 legislature clearly and unmistakably intended to enter into a binding contract, misses the mark because it looks at only part of the picture. Textually, the concurrence focuses on the aspects of the MTC that favor its conclusion the legislature intended to enter into an agreement and concludes,\n   from that limited perspective, that the Oregon legislature clearly and unmistakably intended to bind the state contractually. However, the concurrence overlooks or summarily dismisses those terms of the MTC that demonstrate that the MTC bears little resemblance to a binding interstate agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Similarly, the concurrence infers from the legislative history that the Oregon legislature intended to enter into an interstate compact, and it concludes from the context that the legislature would have been familiar with the workings of interstate compacts. However, the legislative history demonstrates that the Oregon legislature understood that the MTC was the type of interstate compact that required congressional consent to be effective. Nothing in the legislative history or the context of ORS 305.655 suggests that the Oregon legislature understood that the MTC was the sort of interstate compact that would be effective in the absence of congressional consent. If we assume, as the concurrence does, that the legislature would have been familiar with the workings of interstate compacts, then it follows that it also would have understood that, with congressional consent, the MTC would have the force of federal law. Without it, the MTC would violate the Compact Clause, leaving ORS 305.655 with at most only statutory force. We accordingly do not infer from the enactment of ORS 305.655, as the concurrence would, a clear and unmistakable intent to enter into a binding contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   We accordingly agree with the Tax Court and the other state courts that have considered this issue that Articles III and IV of ORS 305.655 created only statutory obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   IV. STATE AND FEDERAL CONTRACT CLAUSES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Our conclusion that no contractual rights and obligations exist as a matter of state law is not necessarily the\n   end of the inquiry, at least for federal Contract Clause purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223783\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/181/#p187\">\n    503 U.S. at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223783\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/181/#p187\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the Court retains \"the duty to exercise [its] own judgment\" regarding the existence of an enforceable contract obligation). In this case, however, taxpayer does not argue that the federal Contract Clause decisions lead to a different conclusion than a state-law contract analysis does; that is, taxpayer does not argue (and we see no reason to conclude) that, even if no contractual obligation exists as a matter of state law, such an obligation exists as a matter\n   of federal constitutional law. It follows that taxpayer's state and federal contract clause claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   V. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 22\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \"No. act shall ever be revised, or amended by mere reference to its title, but the act revised, or section amended shall be set forth, and published at full length.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Taxpayer contends that, when the 1993 legislature eliminated the right set out in Article III of ORS 305.655 to elect the apportionment formulas set out in Article IV of that statute, the 1993 act \"revise[d] or amended\" ORS 305.655 without setting out the full text of that statute, as the Oregon Constitution requires. The department responds that Article IV, section 22, applies only to acts that alter the text of an existing statute. Because the 1993 act did not alter the text of ORS 305.655 but impliedly repealed part of that statute, the department concludes that Article IV, section 22, does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Textually, Article IV, section 22, applies to acts that \"revis[e] or amen[d]\" an existing act.

In 1993, the legislature provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \"In any case in which the provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.670 [Oregon's version of UDITPA] are inconsistent\n   with the provisions of ORS 305.655, the provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.670 shall control.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Or. Laws 1993, ch. 726, \u00a7 20,\n   <em>\n    codified as\n   </em>\n   ORS 314.606 (1993).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 1993 act eliminated the right in Article III of ORS 305.655 to elect the apportionment formulas in Article IV of that statute. It replaced a taxpayer's ability to elect those formulas with a requirement that a taxpayer use the apportionment formulas set out in Oregon's version of UDITPA to the extent the latter formulas differed from the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The legislative policy choice embodied in the 1993 act to apply the apportionment formulas in Oregon's version of UDITPA rather than the apportionment formulas in Article IV of ORS 305.655 is no different from the policy choice embodied in the 1893 act to permit counties to assess taxes that school districts, towns, and cities previously had assessed. The 1993 act reflects a \"complete and perfect\" legislative choice to replace one set of apportionment formulas with another in much the same way that the 1893 act reflected a \"complete and perfect\" legislative choice to replace one taxing entity with another. The 1893 act did not run afoul of Article IV, section 22, and neither does the 1993 act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we are not persuaded that the 1993 act violated Article IV, section 22, nor are we persuaded that applying that act to determine the portion of taxpayer's income subject to tax in this state violated the state or federal contract clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Nakamoto, J., concurred in part and concurred in the judgment in part and filed an opinion in which Flynn and Duncan, JJ., joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   NAKAMOTO, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In 1967, Oregon entered into the Multistate Tax Compact of 1966 through legislation that was codified at\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967),\n   <em>\n    repealed by\n   </em>\n   Or.

I write separately on taxpayer's contract clause argument because, although I agree with the majority's ultimate result, I cannot agree with the majority's keystone conclusion that Oregon did not enter into an interstate compact-a contract among states-and instead, because the Multistate Tax Compact either did not need or did not obtain congressional approval, that the 1967 Oregon Legislative Assembly intended to enact a uniform law.\n   <em>\n    Health Net, Inc. v.

That analysis of text and context-along with consideration of legislative history-yields one reasonable and unmistakable conclusion: the legislature intended to enter into an interstate compact when it enacted the MTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   I am concerned that the majority's reasoning and mode of analysis will apply to other interstate compacts that the legislature has determined were proper and beneficial for Oregon. However, this case should not be viewed as an invitation for wholesale challenges to interstate compacts based on the \"functionality of a uniform law\" analysis, rather than a more focused analysis on the text, context, and legislative history of the compact to determine whether it provides the claimant with the particular right asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As noted, I concur in the disposition-but on different grounds. Taxpayer is not a party to the Multistate Tax Compact of 1966. On appeal, taxpayer presses its refund claims based on (1) the express premise that the state was barred from enacting ORS 314.606 in 1993 because it contradicted and impaired a statutory contract provision in the MTC and (2) the implicit premise that taxpayer is a third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce the MTC's apportionment formula in Article IV, despite ORS 314.606. Taxpayer's position hinges on its contention that, as part of an interstate compact, the apportionment formula was necessarily binding on Oregon and prohibited later legislatures from effectively disabling it through adoption of ORS 314.606. Although the MTC was, and indeed remains, an interstate compact, I concur in the disposition because I conclude that taxpayer did not establish that the apportionment formula was unmistakably immutable absent complete withdrawal from the Multistate Tax Compact and that taxpayer was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the apportionment formula in\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967). Therefore, I would affirm the Tax Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   During the tax years in question, Article III of the MTC provided that the taxpayer could apportion its multistate business income under the standard provided in Article IV of the MTC or another standard provided by Oregon law, at the taxpayer's election. In the tax years in question, the apportionment formula in Article IV was more advantageous to taxpayer than the formula in Oregon's uniform law concerning division of multistate business\n   income-the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA), ORS 314.605 to ORS 314.675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   However, according to the terms of another statute, ORS 314.606, taxpayer was prevented\n   from using the formula in Article IV of the MTC. In 1993, 25 years after Oregon had enacted the MTC, the Legislative Assembly enacted ORS 314.606. Or. Laws 1993, ch. 726, \u00a7 20. That statute provides that UDITPA governs if it conflicts with the MTC. In its current form, ORS 314.606 provides: \"In any case in which the provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.675 are inconsistent with the provisions of ORS 305.653 [the current codification of the MTC], the provisions of ORS 314.605 to 314.675 [UDITPA] shall control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Thus, ORS 314.606 rendered the election option in Article III of the MTC valueless because, under the terms of the statute, the apportionment formula in Article IV cannot be used when it conflicts with UDITPA's apportionment formula. In the Tax Court, taxpayer argued that ORS 314.606 violated provisions of the state and federal constitutions by impairing a statutory contract-the MTC-and that it was entitled to use the apportionment formula in the MTC. On cross-motions for summary judgment by taxpayer and the department, the Tax Court agreed with the department that the legislature's enactment of ORS 314.606 did not violate provisions of the state and federal constitutions.\n   <em>\n    Health Net, Inc. v.

In its order, the court concluded that ORS 314.606 was applicable to taxpayer based on multiple grounds-including that, due to the absence of consideration, Oregon never entered into a valid contract with other states when it enacted the MTC,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205249431\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 142-46\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and that no refund was due.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    In enacting the MTC, did the 1967 Legislative Assembly enter into an interstate compact?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The text of\n   </em>\n   former\n   <em>\n    ORS 305.655 (1967) establishes an interstate compact.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The text of the preamble in the MTC is itself compelling evidence that the legislature intended to enter into an interstate compact.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 introduces the Multistate Tax Compact by stating, \"The Multistate Tax Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows[.]\" Through that statement, the legislature unmistakably introduced what follows as an interstate compact-an agreement among states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Beyond the fact that the legislature named the compact as such, the preamble's text further underscores that it is a compact by stating that the legislature has \"entered into\" the compact \"on behalf of this state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is beyond dispute that a statute enacted by the Oregon Legislative Assembly is not \"entered into.\" Rather, and commonly, a contract is \"entered into.\" Moreover, the legislature's intention in entering into an agreement with other states that similarly enter into the compact could hardly be clearer: it declares that the compact is \"entered into\" \"\n   <em>\n    with all other jurisdictions\n   </em>\n   legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Other parts of the text of the MTC beyond the preamble unmistakably point to the legislative intention that the state enter into an interstate compact. For instance, as the majority acknowledges, Article X provides that \"[t]his compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states\" and shall \"become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967), Art. X, \u00a7 1. Again, a model statute would not include a provision for its prospective effectiveness only if a required number of states also joined in its enactment. Nor would a model statute provide for later \"withdrawal from this compact\"-and specify the mode of withdrawal by repeal. But that is what Article X of the MTC further provides: a party state \"may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing\n   the same,\" but \"[n]o withdrawal shall\n   affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2. As\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   Interstate Commission for Juveniles and the Association of Compact Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children argue, the \"requirement that seven states needed to enact the compact for it to become effective confirms that the states intended the reciprocity that comes from\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   action as opposed to several independent actions,\" and \"the presence of a withdrawal provision illustrates that the states intended an interstate compact because no other type of cooperative legislation contains such a provision.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   And\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967), Article XII, provides, among other things: \"If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\" Like the text of other provisions noted, Article XII directly refers to other states that enter into the compact. There would be no need for a model statute to have to anticipate the effect of the invalidity of some aspect of one party state's enactment of the model statute and to declare the ongoing validity of the statute for all other \"party states,\" because model statutes are just that: models. The states independently decide to what extent they will borrow from model statutes, such as those proposed by the Uniform Law Commission, perhaps best known for its Uniform Commercial Code, or by another body advocating adoption by the states.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Community Bank v.

Considering context, it is difficult to see how the words of the preamble are consistent with a mere model statute, as the majority characterizes the MTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   First, the Oregon Legislative Assembly does not preface its independent statutes by declaring that they are \"entered into\" or adopted or enacted \"on behalf of this state,\" even when they are based on a uniform law. For example, the same 1967 Legislative Assembly that enacted\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967) also enacted the Uniform Federal Lien Registration Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Or.

There was no introduction or other part of that uniform law as enacted that stated that the law was \"entered into\" or enacted \"on behalf of\" Oregon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502380\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/326/236/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Second, the preamble's wording in the MTC echoes the wording of other compacts that the legislature had entered into before 1967. For example, the legislature enacted the Western Interstate Corrections Compact in 1959, Or. Laws 1959, ch. 290, \u00a7\u00a7 2 to 8, and provided: \"The Western Interstate Corrections\n   Compact hereby is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows[.]\" ORS 421.284. Another example is the Interstate Library Compact enacted in 1965.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 357.340 (stating\n   that the \"Interstate Library Compact hereby is enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Legislative history confirms the plain meaning of the text.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   If the text and context of\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967) were alone insufficient, its legislative history supplies further, and in my view compelling, evidence for the case that the Legislative Assembly in 1967 intended to and did enter into, on behalf of Oregon, an interstate compact and not a model law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Legislative Assembly enacted\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 in 1967 as House Bill 1124.

The Chairman of the State Tax Commission, Paul Liniger, introduced the bill by reading a statement expressing the tax commission's support of H.B. 1124 and describing the commission's activities preceding the bill's introduction.

Liniger's prepared remarks included informing the members of the House Taxation Committee that the tax commission had kept the Governor's office apprised of federal legislation concerning state taxation of multistate companies and the commission's efforts. He announced that \"Governor McCall has recently expressed concurrence of his administration in the Commission's proposal of and support of the Tax Compact to this Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502380\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/326/236/#p241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   An Assistant Attorney General for the tax commission, Theodore de Looze, then testified in favor of the bill and gave a detailed explanation of the MTC and its introduction in other western states as part of an effort to limit federal government action in the area of interstate commerce regulation.

Exhibit 1, House Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Feb. 15, 1967 (Remarks by Commissioner P. F. Liniger). Accordingly, various members of the committee, including then-Representative James Redden, asked de Looze questions throughout his testimony. Minutes, House Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Feb. 15, 1967. Among other questions legislators posed, de Looze was asked about the costs of entry into the compact. He responded that the Council of State Governments estimated total costs in the vicinity of $250,000 per year to operate the Multistate Tax Commission if seven states enacted the compact.

And, de Looze explained that Article VIII of the compact provided that the commission can audit corporations and that one audit could cover multiple states and apportion the taxes due, which would be a benefit to the states and to the taxpayer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:11.45. Near the end of his testimony, he was asked, \"This must be taken as is?\" He responded, \"That's right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:25.20. The obvious inference is that the committee members understood that the compact was not a model statute that they might enact only in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The bill was approved by the House Taxation Committee during its meeting on February 20, 1967.

Exhibit 4, Joint Ways and Means Full Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 10, 1967 (Tax Commission's Explanation). The tax commission's explanation stated that the states had responded to the threat of federal legislation with a call for states to adopt existing uniform legislation, specifically the UDITPA, and with a call for preparation of a multistate compact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   \"In January 1966, in response to the threat posed by the drafting of H.R. 11798, the states, as members of the National Association of Tax Administrators met at Chicago, Illinois, in executive session. The N.A.T.A adopted a resolution calling for state action in several areas. One was the adoption of legislation which would create better uniformity and equality of treatment between multistate taxpayers, such as the adoption of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act. This Act, which was adopted by Oregon in its 1965 legislative session, provides for the use of the so-called 'Massachusetts' or three-factor formula for the apportionment of net income through the use of property, payroll and sales. It was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1957 and has received the approval of the American Bar Association and many other national organizations. Thirteen states have adopted this Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \"In addition, the resolution called for the preparation [of] a multistate tax compact through which the states could effectively provide to the taxpayer uniformity of apportionment and avoidance of duplication of taxation, and ease of compliance through a simplified return for the small volume taxpayer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \"The Council of State Governments, which has had vast experience in the drafting of state compacts, volunteered its services for the task of drafting such a compact.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2271044\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/24/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The joint committee was thus informed that an interstate compact provided a separate and different approach from a uniform law like UDITPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally H.B. 1124 arrived at the Senate Taxation Committee, where Liniger and de Looze again testified in support of the bill. Minutes, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 21, 1967. The Chairman of the Washington Tax Commission, George Kinnear, also presented testimony in support of H.B. 1124. He stated that Washington had already passed legislation to enact the compact and that it was extremely important for other states to adopt it to avoid federal intervention. Minutes, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Apr. 4, 1967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   At the hearing on March 21, 1967, de Looze was asked to answer two questions that came up concerning H.B. 1124. Exhibit 2, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 21, 1967 (Mar. 23, 1967, letter from Theodore W. de Looze to Sen. Harry D. Boivin). He answered those questions two days later in a letter to the chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee, Senator Harry Boivin.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Both the first question and de Looze's response reflect that the senators at the hearing well understood that H.B. 1124 would be entering into an interstate compact on behalf of Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   As de Looze recounts, the first question he was asked was \"whether, if Congress enacted a consent Act and the Multistate Tax Compact were adopted by seven or more states and were thus in operation, Congress could subsequently enact federal legislation which\n   would be in conflict with the Compact.\" Exhibit 2, Senate Taxation Committee, H.B. 1124, Mar. 21, 1967 (Mar. 23, 1967, letter from Theodore W. de Looze to Sen. Harry D. Boivin). The question itself, presumably from a senator at the hearing on the bill, indicates an understanding of how the compact would come into force and, if it did, that Congress then might have to approve it. The answer from de Looze to the Senate Taxation Committee was this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   \"I have checked with the attorney for the Council of State Governments and have talked to Assistant Attorney General Timothy Malone of the Washington State Tax Commission and both agree that Congress could enact legislation at a subsequent date in conflict with the provisions of the Compact.\n   <em>\n    This obtains because Congress is not party to the Compact in giving its consent, and also because the Contracts Clause in the United States Constitution is binding only on the states and not on the federal government.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"I am advised by the Council of State Governments, however, that at no time\n   <em>\n    in the history of compacts\n   </em>\n   has this occurred.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). The emphasized portion of de Looze's answer makes it clear to the senators on the Senate Taxation Committee that the Contracts Clause in the federal constitution is \"binding\" on the states, and both the question and answer reflect the committee's sophistication regarding the contractual nature of a compact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   He ended his letter by urging the committee to act favorably on the bill, specifically noting the benefit of the audits of businesses that Oregon could obtain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   \"Four states, Washington, New Mexico, Idaho and Arkansas, have enacted the Compact. One house has passed it in Kansas, Texas and Oregon. There appears to be good reason that it will become operative. I hope your committee will act favorably, as I believe it is beneficial to Oregon audits of taxpayers.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Senate Taxation Committee approved H.B. 1124 on April 28, 1967. Minutes, Senate Taxation Committee, Apr. 28, 1967. After approval by the legislature, H.B. 1124 was signed into law by the Governor on May 5, 1967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The text, context, and the legislative history of\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967) illustrate the legislature's understanding and its intention. That evidence runs counter to the majority's conclusion that, because de Looze anticipated that the Multistate Tax Compact of 1966 would be submitted to Congress for its consent but Congress never provided that consent, then the legislature intended the MTC to be a run-of-the-mill statute.\n   <em>\n    Health Net\n   </em>\n   , 362 Or. at 726-28, 415 P.3d at 1047-49. First, that conclusion lacks any direct support in the text, context, and legislative history of the MTC. For example, there is no provision in the MTC requiring congressional consent before the compact would become effective; indeed, the text runs counter to that notion by providing that \"[t]his compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states\" and shall \"become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967), Art. X, \u00a7 1. And, given that provision and the actual text of the MTC, it is speculative at best to think that events that occurred (or did not occur) well after the legislature enacted the MTC somehow transformed the MTC from an interstate compact into a mere statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The bottom line of the majority opinion is that the 1967 Legislative Assembly did not know the contractual nature of an interstate compact and the import of its enactment of the MTC. I disagree with that remarkable conclusion. I note that the department does not go as far as the majority does, even as it defends against taxpayer's refund claims: The department does not dispute that the\n   MTC as a whole is an interstate compact, an agreement among states. Rather, the department asserts that \"Oregon did not unmistakably promise other states or taxpayers that it would allow an election under Article III.1 until it repealed all of [the Compact].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In sum, the 1967 Legislative Assembly was not confused about intending to adopt a model statute rather than its actual entry on behalf of Oregon into an interstate compact-an agreement among Oregon and the other states that entered into it. Thus, I would hold that the legislature \"has clearly and unmistakably expressed its intent to create a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Moro v.

I disagree. In my view, the key issue is not whether the MTC is an interstate compact, but rather is more specific: whether taxpayer, a third party, was entitled to have its taxes determined by applying Article IV's apportionment formula in the face of the legislature's enactment of ORS 314.606 directing use of the UDITPA formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Taxpayer contends that it is entitled, under Article III of the MTC, to choose to use the apportionment formula in Article IV of the MTC because the state Contract Clause in Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution renders ORS 314.606 unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article I, section 21, provides: \"No. *** law impairing the obligation of contracts shall ever be passed.\" Taxpayer argues that, because the Tax Court read ORS 314.606 to eliminate the Article III election, the statute necessarily violates the state Contract Clause by impairing the MTC. Viewed another way, taxpayer's argument assumes that the legislature could not enact a competing apportionment formula and require its use given the MTC's status as an interstate compact and that taxpayer-a nonparty to the compact-can enforce its provisions. Given\n   <em>\n    Moro v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   , that argument assumes too much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   One of the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Moro\n   </em>\n   teaches that the individual terms of the MTC must be examined to determine whether the legislature unmistakably intended any particular\n   compact term to be a contractual obligation enforceable by a taxpayer, a nonparty to the MTC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   357 Or. at 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363922\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/167/#p195\">\n    351 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like the PERS members in\n   <em>\n    Moro\n   </em>\n   , taxpayer contends that an Oregon statute created its enforceable contractual right (in this case, it asserts, to elect and to apply the MTC's apportionment formula for purposes of its taxes), despite a later legislative enactment requiring that the UDITPA apportionment formula apply in case of any conflict between the two. Whether the 1967 Legislative Assembly did create such an enforceable contractual right should be a question of legislative intent, and taxpayer should have to meet the same \"clearly and unmistakably expressed its intent\" standard of legislative intent to bind future legislatures. That is due, in part, to the \"canon of construction that disfavors interpreting statutes as contractual promises,\"\n   <em>\n    Moro\n   </em>\n   , 357 Or. at 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363922\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/167/#p195\">\n    351 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that bar later-elected legislatures from responding to then-current needs or from making different policy choices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Taxpayer's apparent answer is that by its very nature, a compact is a contract and so all the provisions of\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 305.655 (1967) are binding contractual terms that it may enforce. But that does not answer the precise inquiry required by\n   <em>\n    Moro\n   </em>\n   , namely, a review of the nature of\n   the specific contractual terms at issue and what the 1967 Legislative Assembly intended by them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Articles III and IV\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The department squarely addresses that precise question. First, the department correctly notes that the MTC does not expressly state one way or the other whether Oregon or other parties to the compact may unilaterally modify the apportionment formula available to multistate taxpayers through Articles III and IV. And, the department adds, the express withdrawal provision in Article X does not settle the matter by providing that a state \"may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\" Thus, in the department's view, the 1967 Legislative Assembly did not evince an unmistakable intention to prevent future legislatures from limiting use of the apportionment formula in Article IV. In light of the overall weakness of the compact as drafted, I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   Council on State Taxation aptly puts it, the Multistate Tax Compact \"represents a minimalist approach to corporate tax uniformity with the member states ceding only as much of their sovereignty as necessary to keep Congressional critics from interfering with state taxation.\"\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   Multistate Tax Commission, the administrative body created by the compact, concurs. The commission, which under Article VI of the compact is governed by taxing agency representatives of the member states, argues that the MTC \"is in the nature of an advisory compact\" that created a commission with \"only limited advisory powers and without any authority to bind its member states in any fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   States of Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Washington and the District of Columbia (party states) and California, Michigan, and Minnesota (former party states and current commission members), take the same position as the department and the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The Multistate Tax Compact was drafted so that, from the start, party states could enact a variety of tax bases, tax rates, and apportionment schemes, but through Article III, the compact gave taxpayers the choice of the UDITPA formula or other state apportionment formulas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   However, citing both federal and state case law, the department argues that the states' course of performance confirms that the party states \"never intended Articles III.1 and IV to bind a state until that state withdrew from the entire compact.\" Like the department, the commission argues that the compact \"includes no explicit prohibition against or penalty for unilaterally altering, amending or repealing any apportionment provision\" and further contends that member states have \"no obligation to interpret or apply\" the apportionment provisions \"in the same way as any other state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Under Oregon law, a lengthy course of performance under a contract can be used to discern the intention of the parties.

In the context of the MTC, the promisee and the promisor are member states of the compact. To establish that taxpayer is an intended beneficiary, taxpayer must establish that \"recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the member states, and that either of the two circumstances delineated in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) exist.\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 302(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Even assuming that it might be appropriate to recognize a right of performance in taxpayer, taxpayer cannot establish the second element necessary for status as an intended third-party beneficiary. First, taxpayer is plainly not a creditor of a promisee, as provided in section 302(1)(a). Second, the circumstances do not indicate that the other member states intended to give taxpayer the \"benefit of the promised performance,\" as provided in section 302(1)(b). In this case, the \"benefit of the promised performance\" is ultimately an irrevocable right to use the apportionment formula in Article IV. Taxpayer asserted a right to use that formula more than a decade after the Oregon legislature enacted ORS 314.606 and demonstrated that Oregon did not intend to allow taxpayers to use the formula. For the reasons noted above with respect to the effect of ORS 314.606, it is difficult to conclude that the promisees-the other member states-nevertheless intended to give Oregon taxpayers the benefit of the election in Article III and, ultimately, the apportionment formula in Article IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Accordingly, taxpayer is an incidental beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See Restatement\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 302(2).
