BARNES, PRESIDING JUDGE:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 1 Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) appeals from the district court's dismissal of its action to enforce a federal foreclosure judgment it obtained against W. Jeffrey Dasovich and Sally W. Dasovich. Based on our review of the law and the record presented, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2007, BANA filed a foreclosure action against the Dasoviches in Oklahoma County District Court. The Dasoviches were served and filed an answer. However, prior to filing their answer, the case was removed, on diversity grounds, to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Thereafter, BANA filed a motion for summary judgment in the federal case, to which the Dasoviches filed an objection and response. In August 2008, the federal court granted BANA's motion as to its right to foreclose, but denied the motion as to the amount of damages. On February 13, 2009, BANA filed another motion for summary judgment as to the amount of damages. The federal court sustained that motion by separate order and on March 19, 2009, the federal court entered its foreclosure judgment awarding judgment to BANA in rem and in personam against the Dasoviches in the amount of $201,597.82 with interest on that amount from November 2006 at the rate of 6.875% per annum, and a reasonable attorney's fee and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In the foreclosure judgment, the federal court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [T]his case [is] remanded to the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma [,] and a Special Execution and Order of Sale\n   issue out of the office of said District Court Clerk, directed to the Sheriff to levy upon, advertise and sell, after due and legal appraisement, the [subject] real estate and premises ..., subject to unpaid real estate ad valorem taxes and/or special assessments, if any, and pay the proceeds of said sale to the Clerk of the District Court of Oklahoma County, as provided by law, for application as follows: [to payment for the costs of the sale, to BANA for payment of its foreclosure judgment, and to payment of the junior lien holders.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Said order reserving the right of [BANA] to recall said execution by oral announcement and/or further order of the District Court of Oklahoma County prior to the sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The foreclosure judgment stated \"[i]ncluded in the remand are all matters pertaining to the enforcement of this judgment, including but not limited to confirmation of the sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 On June 23, 2010, the federal court clerk for the western district sent a letter to the Oklahoma County Court Clerk that was filed in the Oklahoma County court case on July 6, 2010. The letter stated that pursuant to the March 2009 foreclosure judgment, \"this case was remanded to your court for all matters pertaining to the enforcement of [the foreclosure] judgment, including but not limited to confirmation of the sale.\" It also stated that \"enclosed\" was a certified copy of the remand order and a certified copy of the docket sheet in the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 On July 30, 2010, BANA issued a Special Execution and Order of Sale out of the office of the Oklahoma County Court Clerk and Sheriff's Sale was set for September 16, 2010, but was later recalled. An alias special execution and order of sale was issued in October 2010, and Sheriff's Sale was set for December 2010. On November 24, 2010, the Dasoviches filed an application for temporary restraining order in which they admitted they were made aware of the foreclosure judgment in mid-August 2010 when they received notice of the Sheriff's Sale. Among other matters, they claimed they had no notice of the filing of the motion for summary judgment in the federal case, had made attempts to get certain financial information from BANA in November 2010 via subpoena duces tecum but had received no documentation from BANA's attorneys, and were \"desirous of resolving their continuing dispute with [BANA].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 On May 25, 2016, the Dasoviches filed a motion to dismiss BANA's action for lack of jurisdiction and failure to properly register the foreclosure judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    12 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 719 - 726. Between November 2010 and May 2016, BANA had issued two other alias special executions and order of sale, the Dasoviches filed three other applications for temporary injunction, the court entered an order sustaining the Dasoviches' fourth application for temporary restraining order, and the court granted BANA's motion to vacate the temporary restraining order and set an evidentiary hearing for March 2016 to determine the amount needed to satisfy the debt obligation, but that hearing was postponed until August 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The hearing apparently did not occur; however, on August 18, 2016, having previously received the briefs and arguments of the parties, the trial court heard arguments on the Dasoviches' motion to dismiss. On November 2, 2016, the Oklahoma district court entered its order sustaining the Dasoviches' motion finding that the \"certified copy\" of the foreclosure judgment filed by the federal court clerk did not satisfy the requirements of the UEFJA \"of filing an 'authenticated' copy of the judgment. Accordingly, this Court lacks jurisdiction over any further post-judgment execution proceedings in this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 BANA appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The trial court dismissed BANA's action because it determined it lacked jurisdiction to proceed in the matter. \"The standard of review for questions concerning the jurisdictional power of the trial court to act is de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Dilliner v.

As BANA states, the reason many of these courts do so is because \"interests of efficiency and judicial economy favor a policy of giving continued effect to pleadings and motions filed in federal court prior to remand. This rule mirrors the federal post-removal procedure of picking the case up where it left off and avoids the necessity of duplicative filings.\"\n   <em>\n    Crumpton v.

App. 1998) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 In all of the cases cited by BANA, however, the cases were remanded because\n   the federal court determined it did not have subject matter jurisdiction, either because it lacked diversity of citizenship or a federal question,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or because the federal court exercised its discretion to remand state claims properly removed with the federal jurisdiction claim after the federal claim was resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In none of those cases did the federal court render final judgment on the claim and remand for\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   of its judgment in the state court and no pendant state claim remained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   BANA has not cited, nor have we found, statutory or decisional authority that gives a federal court the discretion, under the circumstances presented here,\n   <em>\n    to remand\n   </em>\n   a case over which the federal court properly exercised jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 We, therefore, conclude the foreclosure judgment in this case is a foreign judgment that BANA may seek to enforce in Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    II. District Court's Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 As BANA concedes, it may seek enforcement of a foreign judgment in Oklahoma courts either through filing a lawsuit to enforce that judgment or through the provisions of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    12 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 719 - 726.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It asserts it \"substantially complied with the spirit of the UEFJA\" and, thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the case because the court determined it lacked jurisdiction. BANA claims it substantially complied because the clerk of the court from which the foreclosure judgment was entered filed a certified copy of that judgment along with a certified copy of the docket sheet from the federal action on July 6, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 The motion and arguments made by the Dasoviches in support of their motion call\n   for dismissal \"with prejudice\" of BANA's \"action\" because, they claim, it did not comply with the mandatory requirements of the UEFJA. They argue the foreclosure judgment was not \"properly registered\" because it was not properly authenticated; it was not separately filed or file-stamped; the court clerk did not file proof of mailing of notice of the filing of the foreign judgment to them; BANA did not file proof of mailing of notice of the filing of the foreign judgment to them; BANA did not make or file an affidavit setting forth the name and last-known post office address of the judgment debtor and of the judgment creditor; and BANA did not pay the required filing fees to register a foreign judgment. The Dasoviches argue the trial court lacked jurisdiction to domesticate the foreclosure judgment because the UEFJA requirements are mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 While the trial court sustained the Dasoviches' motion, the trial court did not expressly dismiss BANA's claim \"with prejudice.\" The court determined an \"authenticated\" copy of the foreclosure judgment had not been filed; thus, it lacked jurisdiction \"over any further post-judgment execution proceedings in this matter.\" The trial court did not grant BANA leave to amend or otherwise cure the defective registration as provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    12 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 2012(G).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Pellebon\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The [Oklahoma] Supreme Court has interpreted this obligation in \u00a7 2012(G) to grant leave to amend \"as a mandatory duty placed on trial courts, as long as the defect can be remedied.\" [\n   <em>\n    Fanning v.

The Supreme Court further explained, however, that 12 O.S. \u00a7 706(A)\"applies to all judgments of courts of record of this state, and judgments of courts of the United States ... which award the payment of money, regardless of whether such judgments also include other orders or relief\"; however, \u00a7 706(D)\"specifically requires that '[e]xecution shall be issued only from the court which granted the judgment being enforced.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. \"Thus, while domestication of a foreign judgment may be obtained by its filing in any county, execution of that foreign judgment requires that it be filed in the county of the court that enforces the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10455218\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/546/285/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 In\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   , while the bankruptcy judgments were domesticated in July 2002 in Oklahoma upon their filing in Payne County, the county in which the debtors owned property, they were not filed in the Oklahoma County case until after the 2007 and 2010 orders in that case.

Unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   , here the foreclosure petition was filed in Oklahoma County against the Dasoviches in April 2007 and they filed an answer in June 2007. The case was then removed to the federal district court and a foreclosure judgment was entered in March 2009 against the Dasoviches and in favor of BANA. The foreclosure judgment also remanded the case to the Oklahoma County District Court for enforcement of its foreclosure judgment. On July 6, 2010, a letter to the Oklahoma County Court Clerk from the Deputy Court Clerk of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dated June 23, 2010, was filed in the present case. That letter informed the Oklahoma County Court Clerk that pursuant to the foreclosure judgment the case was remanded to the state court for all matters pertaining to enforcement of the foreclosure judgment and stated \"a certified copy of the remand order and a certified copy of the docket sheet\" were enclosed. A copy of the foreclosure judgment was attached with an attestation from the Deputy Court Clerk that the judgment was \"[a] true copy of the original.\" Thereafter, BANA repeatedly sought special execution on that judgment, an attempt at execution that the Dasoviches successfully thwarted over more than five years of litigation prior to the filing of their motion to dismiss. Unlike the bank in\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   , BANA does not seek to enforce any orders of the state district court entered prior to registration of the foreclosure judgment. Further, unlike the bank in\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   , a copy of the foreclosure judgment was filed in the very Oklahoma County court from which enforcement of that judgment was sought. The jurisdictional infirmity\n   present in\n   <em>\n    Vaughan\n   </em>\n   is not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 21 While we agree that authentication of the foreign judgment pursuant to the UEFJA is a requirement to registering that judgment, we do not agree that lack of authentication is a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived by a party.

There, the defendant argued a sister-state judgment was not authenticated as required by \u00a7 721 and, therefore, the district court lacked authority-jurisdiction-to enforce it under the UEFJA.\n   <em>\n    Concannon\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3. In addressing the lack of authentication argument, the Supreme Court stated: \"Authentication may be defined as the act of giving legal authority to a written instrument or a certified copy thereof, so as to render it legally admissible into evidence.... Authentication is evidentiary, not jurisdictional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (footnotes omitted).

In 1995, the debtors became guarantors of a commercial loan from a bank. In 2002 the bankruptcy court denied a discharge of the bank's debt and entered judgment against the debtors in a certain sum and also entered an order for costs and attorney fees against debtors. The bank initiated various collection procedures against the debtors and registered the bankruptcy judgments in Payne County, the county in which the debtors' homestead was located. In 2001, while the bankruptcy stay was in effect, the bank filed a lawsuit in Oklahoma County against debtors' relatives and a family trust pursuant to the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. In September 2007, the Oklahoma County trial court entered an order finding the debtors' income had been fraudulently transferred to a sham corporation to avoid garnishment of that income and ordered the corporation to turn over a percentage to the bank. Debtors, however, were not joined in the UFTA case until November 2007. In 2010, upon the bank's motion for contempt against debtors, the Oklahoma County trial court withdrew its 2007 order, but issued a new order finding one of the debtors in contempt of the 2007 order but giving the debtor an option to avoid imprisonment. In April 2011, the bank sought contempt to enforce the 2010 order. It was not until August 18, 2011, that the bank filed one of the bankruptcy judgments-the one for costs and attorney fees-in the UFTA case.

Nevertheless, the nature and content of the documents sent to defendant and defendant's prompt action thereafter seeking a stay make it clear that he was actually aware that the Michigan judgment had been filed in New York. Where, as here, no prejudice has resulted to defendant from this technical violation of [the UEFJA], [the trial court] did not err in rejecting [the] objection to the service as a defense to enforcement of the Michigan judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"581402\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/309/1029/\">\n     309 A.D.2d at 1031\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"581402\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/309/1029/\">\n     765 N.Y.S.2d 683\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We note that in these cases a \"technical\" error occurred such that the notice attempted was not strictly in compliance with UEFJA notice requirements, while in the current appeal it appears no notice was issued by the clerk or BANA. However, like the judgment debtors in those cases, the Dasoviches had actual notice of the filing of the foreclosure judgment. The record demonstrates the Dasoviches had actual notice of the foreclosure judgment since about two months after the foreclosure judgment was filed in the present case and they have had an opportunity to contest the foreclosure judgment and have done so for more than five years of continuous litigation. The trial court did not identify lack of notice as a reason for its dismissal of BANA's action. We agree with the trial court's implicit finding that whatever defect may have been present as to notice has long since been resolved and the Dasoviches have suffered no prejudice as a result.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We note the majority of the Dasoviches' argument about notice concerns their purported lack of notice of the filing of the motion for summary judgment in the federal case. They appear to argue the multiple applications for temporary injunction they filed in the present case concern this alleged deficiency that eventually resulted in the foreclosure judgment. This argument, however, does not support the trial court's dismissal of BANA's action because of needed registration requirements under the UEFJA. They are, instead, an attack on the foreclosure judgment itself. Whether such a collateral attack is permissible concerns facts and legal issues not encompassed within the dismissal order and this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Given our conclusion, we find unpersuasive the Dasoviches' argument that the foreclosure judgment is now dormant because more than five years have lapsed since the judgment was filed in March 2009, citing\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n      12 O.S. 2011\n     </extracted-citation>\n     \u00a7 735\n    </em>\n    .

The docket sheet amply supports the conclusion that BANA has repeatedly sought to enforce the foreclosure judgment and defeat the Dasoviches' attempts to thwart that enforcement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
