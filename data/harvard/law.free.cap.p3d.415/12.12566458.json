Third Judicial District Court, Lyon County; John Schlegelmilch, Judge. Appellant Ryan Joe Coddington was sentenced to a prison term of life without the possibility of parole with an additional, consecutive prison term of 96-240 months for using a deadly weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Coddington appeals his conviction based on the following arguments: (1) there was insufficient evidence for a first-degree murder conviction; (2) he was denied the right to a fair trial because the courtroom bailiff was married to the prosecuting attorney; (3) during voir dire, the jurors saw Coddington enter the room cloaked in a \"garb of guilt,\" which denied him his right to a fair trial; (4) the State committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments by wrongfully shifting the burden of proof onto Coddington; (5) the district court's demeanor during Coddington's closing argument influenced the jury and denied him the right to a fair trial; (6) the district court abused its discretion because it failed to give a self-defense jury instruction and gave two additional inapplicable jury instructions; (7) evidence the State used against Coddington was not given to him until the third day of trial in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

To convict an individual of first-degree murder, the jury must \"conclude that the defendant committed a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing. Willfulness is the intent to kill. Deliberation requires a thought process and a weighing of the consequences.

While Coddington claims that these witnesses were biased against him, the basis of their bias was made known to the jury. Hardin testified to being present at Coddington's house in Dayton when he killed the victim. Specifically, she testified to hearing Coddington hit the victim on the side of the head with a hatchet. Hardin further testified to helping Coddington burn and dispose of the body. Baker testified that Coddington told her in detail how he murdered the victim with a hatchet and burned and disposed of her body. Additionally, the victim's head had a depressed fracture, which one of the State's experts described as consistent with being hit on the head with a hatchet. Therefore, a reasonable jury \"could have been convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence that was properly before it.\"\n   <em>\n    Lay,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8557985\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/110/1189/#p1192\">\n    110 Nev. at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8557985\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/110/1189/#p1192\">\n    886 P.2d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Coddington received a fair trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A criminal defendant has a fundamental right to a fair trial secured by the United States and Nevada Constitutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Hightower v.

Coddington argues that he was denied the right to a fair trial because the courtroom bailiff was the prosecutor's wife, the jury saw Coddington enter from the secured area, the State committed prosecutorial misconduct, the district court conveyed its bias to the jurors through its demeanor, and the district court improperly instructed the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Using the prosecutor's wife as a bailiff did not deny Coddington a fair trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Coddington argues that the prosecutor and bailiff were married, which created the appearance of a partial tribunal. We disagree. There is no evidence to support, and Coddington does not argue, that any specific juror was aware of the fact that the bailiff was married to the prosecutor or that it influenced the jury's decision. In denying Coddington's objection, the district court noted that the bailiff would not wear identification and would be referred to \"as Madame Bailiff\" to avoid associating her with the prosecuting attorney. Nothing in the record demonstrates that this protocol was not followed. Therefore, using the prosecutor's wife as a bailiff did not deny Coddington a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Coddington's entrance during voir dire did not deny him a fair trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During a chamber's conference, Coddington expressed concern that his entrance during voir dire from a secured area \"placed [him] in the 'garb of guilt,' \" violating the presumption of innocence. \"This court has recognized that a defendant has the right to appear before the jury in the clothing of an innocent person because [t]he presumption of innocence is incompatible with the garb of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Further, \"[t]he garb of guilt necessarily includes physical restraints as such restraints, like prison clothing, erode the presumption of innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this case, there is no evidence in the record that demonstrates that the jury actually saw the area that Coddington entered from, let alone that they knew it was a jail or secured area for inmates. Additionally, Coddington was unrestrained, wearing a suit, and the district court directed the bailiff to ensure that Coddington was seated prior to the jury entering the courtroom in the future. Therefore, Coddington's entrance did not deny him a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The prosecutorial misconduct did not deny Coddington a fair trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Coddington argues that the prosecutor impermissibly shifted the burden onto the defense during closing arguments. The prosecutors statements at issue were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Now, the defense presented some evidence in this case. And they don't have to prove anything. The State has to prove this case. But you evaluate that evidence just as do you the State's evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   And let's see what they gave you. Nothing about the crime, nothing about what happened in the [Dayton] house.

Because the State has the burden of proving a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it is impermissible for the State to make comments that \"suggest[ ] to the jury that it [i]s the defendant's burden to produce proof by explaining the absence of witnesses or evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Barron v.

So, if the evidence in the case convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of Ryan Coddington on the charged offense you should so find, even though you may believe one or more persons are also guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that the district court did not err in giving the multiple actors instruction. This instruction admonished the jury to ignore anyone else's culpability in determining whether Coddington was guilty. This instruction was appropriate and necessary given the fact that Hardin and Baker were also charged with crimes relating to the victim's death and both were involved in disposing of the victim's body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guy v.

However, the State did not discover the photo until the third day of trial, which it then disclosed to Coddington. Coddington moved for additional discovery of all photos taken by the investigating officer on the day he took the photo of the text messages. The State expressed confusion as to what kind of motion Coddington was making and if it was one under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), but Coddington did not address the State's concern. The district court questioned the investigating officer about the number of photos he took, and the officer stated, \"I believe it was one. I don't have copies. I don't-I honestly don't know, Your Honor.\" The district court appeared to accept the deputy's answer and determined that \"there was no material prejudice to the defendant\" because the contents of the text messages in the photo were described in multiple police reports that were produced during discovery, the State did not withhold evidence from Coddington, and his ability to cross-examine witnesses was not limited by the late disclosure. Coddington moved the district court for a mistrial, which the district court denied for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the district court referenced \"material prejudice,\" which is included in the analysis under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , there was no mention of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   by the district court. Further, \"a true\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation occurs only when a court determines that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

The record demonstrates that the State gave the photo of the text messages to Coddington immediately after discovering it. Moreover, the substance and timing of the text messages were described in police reports that were produced in discovery, which demonstrates that Coddington had the information depicted in the photo prior to trial. Notably, Coddington cross-examined Baker on the information in the text messages. Additionally, the district court gave Coddington the opportunity to recall the investigating officer for cross-examination, but Coddington chose not to do so. Therefore, we conclude that no relief is warranted for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to present evidence regarding Coddington's statements about the victim's death\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During trial, Coddington presented a toxicologist who testified that deaths from methamphetamine use are not uncommon. Following the toxicologist's testimony, the State requested to recall a deputy to present rebuttal evidence. Coddington objected, arguing that the deputy's testimony would be improper rebuttal evidence because it would shift the burden onto the defense. The State indicated that the officer's testimony would show that Coddington previously stated that the victim did not overdose. The district court concluded that it was proper rebuttal evidence for the State to demonstrate that Coddington never claimed the victim overdosed. The district court further noted that if the State asked an improper question that shifted the burden, Coddington could object during the testimony. The State then recalled the deputy, who testified that during a police interview Coddington stated that the victim did not overdose. Coddington did not object to the officer's testimony. \"Admission of rebuttal evidence is within the discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.
