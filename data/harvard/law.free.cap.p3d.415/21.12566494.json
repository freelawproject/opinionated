Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Elizabeth Goff Gonzalez, Judge. Estrada argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel and that the district court erred in denying his petition. We disagree and affirm.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n   To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that prejudice resulted in that there was a reasonable probability of a different outcome absent counsel's errors.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687-88 (1984) ;\n   <em>\n    Warden v.

When offered to show why the police pursued a particular course of action and not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, course-of-investigation testimony is admissible and not barred by the hearsay rule or the Confrontation Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 n.9 (2004) (\"The [Confrontation] Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\");\n   <em>\n    Wallach v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8557656\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/106/470/#p473\">\n    106 Nev. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8557656\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/106/470/#p473\">\n    796 P.2d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (1990). Substantial evidence supports the district court's findings that these statements were non-hearsay elicited in order to show why Estrada was developed as a suspect and that they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, particularly as the evidence presented at trial showed that the coconspirators lied in these initial statements to the detective. Further, evidence as to Estrada's development as a suspect was relevant to rebut the defense theory of the case that the victim's potentially criminal conduct made him a target for other unknown assailants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    United States v. Hawkins,\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806830\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1489/#p1495\">\n    905 F.2d 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1495 (11th Cir. 1990) (concluding that investigator's testimony was admissible to explain why the investigation commenced and to rebut defense claims that the investigation was baseless and sought to harass the target). Despite trial counsel's mistaken assertion of her own deficiency regarding this issue during the evidentiary hearing, neither trial nor appellate counsel were deficient in omitting a futile Confrontation Clause challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Ennis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205461\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/694/#p706\">\n    122 Nev. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205461\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/694/#p706\">\n    137 P.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (2006). The district court therefore did not err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   Second, Estrada argues that trial and appellate counsel should have contested the admission of the detective's \"exciting\" summary of the course of the investigation. Estrada fails to show that counsel was deficient in his regard, as he does not identify inappropriately \"exciting\" testimony and the authority proffered is distinguishable. Estrada's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Abram v. State\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because that case involved an officer's \"highly prejudicial\" testimony regarding inadmissible character evidence that was not relevant to the State's theory of the case,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4799104\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/95/352/#p355\">\n    95 Nev. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4799104\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/95/352/#p355\">\n    594 P.2d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1144-45 (1979), while here the testimony was relevant to the State's development of Estrada as a suspect and to rebut the defense theory of other unknown assailants.\n   <em>\n    Sandersfield v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, as that case involved an officer's improperly prejudicial testimony that the defendant had been arrested for murder where the charge before the jury was misdemeanor assault.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794558\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/461/1019/\">\n    461 P.2d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -20 (Okla. Crim. App. 1969). No similar testimony or impropriety was present here. Nor does\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reyes\n   </em>\n   show that counsel was deficient, where that case does not control and focused on whether a jury would consider non-hearsay testimony for the truth of the matter asserted,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502380\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/65/#p70\">\n    18 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (2d Cir. 1994), while the out-of-court statements here contained numerous falsehoods, such that it was evident from both their substance and context that the accounts were not likely to be taken for the truth of the matter asserted. Estrada has failed to show that a challenge by either trial or appellate counsel on this basis was not futile. The district court therefore did not err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n   Third, Estrada argues that trial and appellate counsel should have challenged as improper vouching the detective's assessment that one of the coconspirators lied in her initial statement. The coconspirator did not testify, and thus the State did not vouch for or against the credibility of a witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Lisle v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11791660\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/540/#p553\">\n    113 Nev. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11791660\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/540/#p553\">\n    937 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481 (1997) (defining prosecutorial vouching); 98 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Witnesses\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1 (2018) (defining \"witness\"). As Estrada has not shown that a challenge by either trial or appellate counsel on this basis was not futile, the district court did not err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fourth, Estrada argues that trial counsel should have proffered a jury instruction on proximate causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury was instructed that an act must be \"a substantial factor in causing death\" and that the cause of death must be \"part of a continuous transaction\" with the act. By instructing the jury that causation must be continuous between Estrada's act and the victim's death, the district court properly instructed the jury on proximate causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Etcheverry v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558540\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/782/#p785\">\n    107 Nev. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558540\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/782/#p785\">\n    821 P.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (1991) (discussing proximate causation). Estrada has not shown that trial counsel was deficient in not proffering an alternative jury instruction on proximate causation, nor that he was prejudiced in its omission, particularly as trial counsel presented the theory that the victim's severe heart disease and fall while rehabilitating were intervening causes that in fact caused the victim's death. Further, Estrada has failed to show that an appellate challenge to the district court's failure to sua sponte give a different instruction of proximate causation was not futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558540\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/782/#p785\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558540\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/782/#p785\">\n    at 784-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558540\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/782/#p785\">\n    821 P.2d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court therefore did not err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   Estrada next argues that trial and appellate counsel should have objected to jury instructions on implied malice, premeditation, and equal and exact justice. As this court has held the language used in the implied-malice instruction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Leonard v. State,\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"9272230\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/53/#p78\">\n    117 Nev. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78-79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9272230\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/53/#p78\">\n    17 P.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (2001), the premeditation instruction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Evans v.

The district court therefore did not err in denying this claim.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-16\">\n   Estrada next \"endorses\" the claims raised in his pro se petition with a bare reference to that filing and its claims. As Estrada has failed to provide argument or authority showing that the district court's denial of these claims was in error, we decline to consider this \"endorsement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Maresca v.

Even assuming that instances of deficient performance may be cumulated,\n   <em>\n    McConnell v.
