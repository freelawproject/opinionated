Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Linda Marie Bell, Judge.</p><p id=\"p-10\">This court's review of this appeal reveals a jurisdictional defect. The documents before this court indicate that a petition has not been filed in district court case number A748886, the case number designated in this notice of appeal, since December 30, 2016. Notice of entry of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order was filed on September 14, 2017.
