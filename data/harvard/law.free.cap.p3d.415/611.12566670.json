Irby contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss. This ruling was based on the trial court's finding that Irby did not establish prejudice arising from the actions of jail guards who opened and read written communications from Irby to Irby's lawyer. The trial court erred, Irby asserts, because it reached this conclusion without presuming that the constitutional violation was prejudicial and without holding the prosecution to its burden to present evidence sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the presumption of prejudice was overcome and that the violation did not prejudice him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order denying Irby's motion to dismiss and remand this matter for further\n   proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In April 2005, Irby was charged with one count of burglary in the second degree, alleged to have occurred on March 6, 2005, and the following counts alleged to have occurred on March 8, 2005: one count of aggravated murder in the first degree with an alternative allegation of first degree felony murder, one count of burglary in the first degree, one count of robbery in the first degree, three counts of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, and one count of attempting to elude a police vehicle. The latter charges arose out of the robbery and bludgeoning death of James Rock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In January 2007, a jury found Irby guilty of murder in the first degree with aggravating circumstances, felony murder in the first degree, and burglary in the first degree. Four years later, the Washington Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the cause for a new trial in light of the court's determination that Irby's due process rights had been violated during jury selection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State prosecuted the same charges that were brought during the first trial and Irby was convicted as charged. Notably, at the retrial, Irby was allowed to proceed pro se. He also voluntarily absented himself from the trial. We subsequently reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the cause for yet another new trial because the trial judge had erroneously seated a juror who had demonstrated actual bias against Irby during voir dire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Attorney Jennifer Rancourt filed a notice of appearance on Irby's behalf. In mid-March, the State filed an amended information charging Irby with one count of premeditated murder in the first degree and one count of burglary in the first degree. Two days later, Irby appeared in court and was arraigned on the charges. He entered pleas of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In mid-March and again in late March, Irby requested to represent himself. Following a colloquy with the trial court in mid-April, Irby's request was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Four months later, Irby filed a pro se motion to dismiss the charges against him. In his motion, Irby alleged misconduct by jail guards, claiming that (during the period of time during which Ms. Rancourt represented him) they had improperly opened outgoing mail containing privileged legal communication intended for his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The trial court denied Irby's motion. The trial court did determine that the jail guards had violated Irby's right to counsel by opening and reading privileged attorney-client communications. Although Irby argued that the trial court's determination mandated that a presumption of prejudice be imposed, the trial court placed on Irby the burden of proving prejudice and concluded that he did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 One month later, Irby informed the trial court that he had decided not to attend the trial and waived his right to be present at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 After a jury was selected without Irby's participation, the evidentiary stage of Irby's third trial began. Irby did not attend the trial. The State presented its case in chief and gave closing argument. No defense or closing argument were presented on Irby's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 The jury returned verdicts finding Irby guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Irby was sentenced to concurrent terms of incarceration of 388 months for the murder in the first degree conviction and 54 months for the burglary in the first degree conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Irby contends that the trial court erred in denying his CrR 8.3(b) motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Irby's contention has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 This matter involves an alleged deprivation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right.

This might include considering the motivations of the jail guards, Irby's failure to follow Skagit County Jail policies regarding outgoing legal mail, and the extent to which, if at all, Irby's privileged attorney-client communications were utilized by the State in its third prosecution of Irby or could be so utilized in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b660 In the event that the trial court determines that a remedy short of dismissal is warranted, vacation of the judgment will nevertheless be necessary. In addition, in anticipation of yet another trial, other remedies might include-singularly or in combination-suppression of evidence, disqualification of specific attorneys from Irby's prosecution, disqualification of the Skagit County Prosecuting Attorney's Office from further participation in the case, or exclusion of witnesses tainted by the governmental misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b661 We reverse the trial court's order denying Irby's motion to dismiss and remand this matter with instructions set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b662 The remainder of this opinion has no precedential value.
