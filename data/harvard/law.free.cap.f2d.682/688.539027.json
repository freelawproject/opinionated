He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>raises numerous issues on appeal, but only one is of moment. That issue is whether Massarella\u2019s conviction of the felony of perjury in Illinois\u2019 courts violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Federal Constitution. U.S.Const. art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The facts of Massarella\u2019s case are recited in detail in <em>People v. Massarella, </em>80 Ill.App.3d 552, 36 Ill.Dec. 16, 400 N.E.2d 436 (1979) <em>cert. denied, Massarella v. Illinois, </em>449 U.S. 1077, 101 S.Ct. 855, 66 L.Ed.2d 799 (1981), and will be stated only briefly here. In 1973 an Illinois jury found Massarella guilty of conspiracy, theft, and one count of perjury. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, including two years\u2019 periodic imprisonment, for the theft, and one to three years\u2019 imprisonment for the perjury. The sentences were to run concurrently. Massarella was also fined, but the present record is not clear on the total amount, nor on the offenses for which fines were imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The history of Massarella\u2019s perjury conviction is a convoluted one. Massarella was indicted on June 8, 1973, for statements made around August 30, 1971. At the time of the commission of the perjury, the offense was an \u201cindictable misdemeanor,\u201d punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 32-2 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of Massarella\u2019s indictment, the offense was a \u201cpure\u201d felony. See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 32-2 (1973). This change was effected by the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, which, Massarella argues, also extended the limitation period for prosecution of perjury from eighteen months to three years. The extension took effect in January of 1973, approximately one month before the former eighteen month statute would have barred Massarel-la\u2019s perjury prosecution. (Massarella was not indicted until about twenty-two months after the perjury was committed.) In this appeal, Massarella argues that, as applied to his case, both the extension of the limitations period and the reclassification of the perjury from \u201cindictable misdemeanor\u201d to felony violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Massarella\u2019s objection to the enlargement of the limitation period has no merit. Extending a limitation period <em>before </em>a given prosecution is barred does not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. <em>Clements v. United States, </em>266 F.2d 397, 399 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 985, 79 S.Ct. 943, 3 L.Ed.2d 934 (1959). As the Supreme Court recently noted, \u201cno ex <em>post facto </em>violation occurs if the change effected is merely procedural, and does \u2018not increase the punishment nor change the ingredients of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt.\u2019\u201d Weaver v. <em>Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 29 n.12, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, n.12, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), <em>quoting Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 590, 4 S.Ct. 202, 210, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884). The extension of the statute of limitations in this case was just such a \u201cmerely procedural\u201d change.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The reclassification of the offense is more troublesome. The state argues that the reclassification was merely nominal, since Massarella, as the new Unified Code required, was permitted to choose between being sentenced under the Unified Code or under the law as it stood at the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of the perjury. Massarella rationally chose to be sentenced under the later law, which set a higher fine but a lower maximum prison sentence for perjury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He now contends that the reclassification of the offense, apart from direct changes in possible sentences, created a host of adverse collateral consequences<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that fall on a convicted felon. Whether this retrospective reclassification worsens the conditions imposed under the former state law is a federal question. See <em>Weaver v. Graham, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 33, 101 S.Ct. at 966; <em>Lindsey v. Washington, </em>301 U.S. 397, 400, 57 S.Ct. 797, 798, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937). In this case, however, it is a question involving numerous and subtle issues of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">It is not at all clear that Illinois would not have considered Massarella a felon had he been convicted of perjury in 1971. In 1971 in Illinois, perjury was punishable with a penitentiary sentence. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 32-2 (1969). Under a literal reading of the statutes then in force, the offense was thus a felony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2-7. On this appeal, however, the state argues that Mas-sarella now stands convicted of a misdemeanor, apparently conceding that the offense was so classed under former law, at least for the purpose of determining the collateral consequences of a perjury conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We must, however, reject the state\u2019s argument that, by operation of a state statutory provision concerning the application of the Uniform Code of Corrections,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Massarella does not now stand convicted of a felony. For determining the period of limitation on Massarella\u2019s perjury prosecution, the state unquestionably classed the offense a felony. See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 3-5; id. \u00a7 32-2 (1973). Yet after conviction, the state argues a different <em>classification </em>of the offense from statutes dealing only with <em>punishment </em>of the offense. In short, the state has pointed to nothing to show that Massarella will not suffer the collateral consequences of which he complains. We hold, therefore, that Massarella\u2019s conviction of the retroactively reclassified offense of perjury violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The matter of remedies is a difficult one in this case. Massarella seeks an unconditional writ that would have the effect of vacating his perjury conviction. The Supreme Court, however, has noted that \u201c[t]he proper relief upon a conclusion that a state prisoner is being treated under an <em>ex post facto </em>law is to remand to permit the state court to apply, if possible, the law in place when his crime occurred.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Graham, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 36-37 n.22, 101 S.Ct. at 968-69 n.22. (Citing <em>Lindsey v. Washington, supra, </em>301 U.S. at 402, 57 S.Ct. at 799.) In so remanding, we are confident that there is little need to point out the constitutional pitfalls of imposing on Massarella any more onerous sentence than he originally received.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Before remanding to the state court, however, the district court should resolve the fact question whether Massarella was fined $10,000 for his perjury conviction. If so, this fine would, under the principles noted above, be an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">We have fully considered Massarella\u2019s other arguments and hold that none establishes errors for which habeas corpus relief is appropriate. The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case remanded for action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">. <em>People v. Massarella, 53 </em>Ill.App.3d 774, <em>10 </em>Ill.Dec. 912, 368 N.E.2d 507, 508 (1977) reports $10,000 fines for both the theft and perjury convictions. The Illinois Supreme Court, reversing, noted only one $10,000 fine, but did not tie it to any offense. See 72 Ill.2d 531, 21 Ill.Dec. 898, 382 N.E.2d 262, 263 (1978). On remand, the Illinois Court of Appeals noted only one fine imposed on Massarella individually.

An indictable misdemeanor is a relatively new type of offense, created over the last decade or two in connection with new types of criminal conduct, as to which conduct the legislature appears to wish to give the State and/or trial judge a broad discretion in respect of penalty, ranging from the felony penalties of imprisonment in the State penitentiary for more than one year and/or a fine, to the misdemeanor penalties of imprisonment in a correctional institution other than the penitentiary for not more than one year and/or a lessor [sic] fine.</p>\n<p id=\"Aean\"><em>People v.
