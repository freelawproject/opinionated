The district court answered that question in the affirmative. 518 F.Supp. 1114 (D.D.C.1981). We conclude that the district court\u2019s response was too quick and categorical to comport with the congressional directive. That directive, we hold, requires a more particularized showing by the government and a more precise examination by the district court before a judgment may be made that the production sought would \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">Appellant Campbell held various technical positions with appellee Eli Lilly and Company for a quarter-century. From April 1973 through January 8, 1978, he worked on research teams studying the drugs darvon, aprindine, and monensin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In late 1977, Campbell informed Lilly\u2019s staff counsel that his superiors had failed to report to the FDA adverse reaction data and toxicological information concerning these drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an in-house investigation, Lilly placed Campbell on unpaid leave and ultimately discharged him. Campbell sought damages and reinstatement in the Indiana state courts. His complaint was dismissed on the ground that Indiana law does not recognize a cause of action for retaliatory discharge in the circumstances Campbell\u2019s case presented. <em>Campbell v. Eli Lilly and Co., </em>413 N.E.2d 1054, 1059-62 (Ind.App.1980), <em>transfer denied, </em>421 N.E.2d 1099 (Ind.1981). Campbell also informed the FDA of his allegations that Lilly had not reported to the agency safety- and health-related problems associated with its products. The agency thereupon commenced an investigation which is still in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">On July 21, 1980, while appellate review of his state court action was pending, Campbell sought access to four categories of documents concerning the FDA investigation. His letter request asked the agency for an opportunity to inspect and copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>1. Any internal pre-investigation memoranda prepared by Lilly officers or employees which were submitted to the FDA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><em>2. </em>Any written statements provided by present or former officers or employees of Lilly[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">3. Any depositions or other statements given to the FDA by present or former officers or employees of Lilly[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">4. Any letters, memoranda or other transmittals from Lilly to the FDA concerning the investigation, together with enclosures thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Joint Appendix (J.A.) 6. This specification was designed to elicit only those documents provided by or available to Lilly or its past and present employees, not internal FDA materials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">On August 14, 1980, the FDA notified Campbell that it had no records responsive to category 1 of his request and invoked Exemptions 4<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 7(A)-(C)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as grounds for withholding information in the other categories. J.A. 73-74. Campbell filed an administrative appeal. When the agency failed to resolve the appeal within twenty working days, <em>see 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), Campbell sought injunc-tive relief from the district court on November 2, 1980.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">On February 2, 1981, the district court granted Lilly\u2019s unopposed motion to intervene as a party-defendant. J.A. 33. Pursuant to its established policy requiring the submitter of confidential commercial information to defend the trade secret status of such materials in FOIA litigation, <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.53 (1981),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the FDA had notified the company of Campbell\u2019s resort to judicial remedies. The applicable regulation required Lilly, a potential target of enforcement proceedings, to itemize, index, and justify the withholding of the documents for which Exemption 4 was claimed. Alleging that providing Lilly access to these materials would alert the company to the direction, focus, and scope of the investigation, the government sought to defer the trade secrets issue pending resolution of the Exemption 7 question. J.A. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">On February 25, 1981, the agency submitted three public and four in camera affidavits in support of its position that all documents in its possession responsive to Campbell\u2019s FOIA request are records properly withheld under Exemption 7. On April 6, the government moved for summary judgment on this basis. On July 21, the district court granted this motion and entered an order dismissing the case. Campbell thereupon appealed, contending that the court had misconstrued Exemption 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and denied him a meaningful opportunity to participate in the litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">To establish that Exemption 7 permits withholding documents in its possession, an agency must show (1) that the requested documents are \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d and (2) that release of the material would have one of the six adverse consequences specified in the Act. <em>FBI v. </em>Abramson, - U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 2054, 2059, 72 L.Ed.2d 376 (1982). Campbell concedes that the documents he seeks satisfy the first requirement: the FDA obtained the requested information in connection with its investigation of Campbell\u2019s allegations that Lilly had failed to submit reports required by law concerning the safety of darvon, aprindine, and monensin. The controversy before us centers upon whether disclosure of these records would, as stated in Exemption 7(A), \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Both sides press extreme positions on the showing an agency must make to establish the requisite interference. Campbell asserts that Exemption 7(A) applies \u201conly on a document-by-document basis.\u201d Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant at 10. The government maintains, and the district court ruled, that an agency carries its burden simply by demonstrating that \u201cthe withheld information was clearly related to [an ongoing investigation].\u201d 518 F.Supp. at 1115. We reject both formulations. Campbell\u2019s would impose an unreasonably onerous standard upon the agency; the PDA\u2019s would automatically shield from disclosure all records relating to an ongoing investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress, we conclude, based on the words it employed and the relevant legislative history, did not authorize blanket exemption for such records. It required something more. We hold that, to prevail under Exemption 7(A), the government must show, by more than conclusory statement, how the particular kinds of investigatory records requested would interfere with a pending enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Throughout this litigation, in the district court and on appeal, the FDA has responded to a case other than the one Campbell brought. To assure that, on remand, the government will advert specifically to the case at hand, we underscore the nature of Campbell\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">This is not a situation in which the potential target of an enforcement action seeks access to records not in its possession. Instead, a third party is attempting to procure materials that a target prepared and submitted to the agency. Campbell confined his FOIA request to four categories of documents \u201cobtained by the Food and Drug Administration in connection with the FDA\u2019s investigation of Eli Lilly and Company concerning Lilly\u2019s suppression of adverse drug reaction data and/or toxicological information regarding the drugs darvon, apri-dine [sic] and monensin.\u201d J.A. 6. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sought access to statements, depositions, letters, memoranda, and other written materials prepared by present or former Lilly officers or employees. See <em>supra </em>p. 258. He limited his request to information Lilly personnel submitted to the agency after the initiation of the FDA investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Campbell sought no documents supplied by sources other than Lilly personnel. He did not request any materials developed by the agency in the course of its investigation. <em>See supra </em>note 3 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Remarkably, in light of a request so circumscribed, the government\u2019s submissions appear to assume that Campbell seeks a full accounting of the investigation in progress. For example, the in camera affidavits describe the course and conduct of the investigation and the various sources from which evidence was gathered. Three of these affidavits contain lists of records, some acquired from sources other than Lilly or its present and former officers or employees, and some prepared by FDA officials. <em>No submission lists clearly and discretely the agency records responsive to Campbell\u2019s request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Similarly, all of the affidavits repeat the government\u2019s dominant assertion that disclosure of the documents could aid Lilly or other potential targets in determining the scope, direction, and focus of the investigation. This may well be true of information gathered from sources outside the Lilly firm and materials generated by the agency itself. However, the government\u2019s submissions do not explain how information submitted by the company\u2019s present and former officers or employees since the FDA began its investigation could reveal the direction of the investigation to Lilly or alert it to anything it does not know already. The government\u2019s submissions are similarly unilluminating with regard to the prospects for tipping off other targets. In addition, the record does not indicate how disclosure to other persons of materials that Lilly has turned over to the agency would lead to alteration or destruction of evidence. The government makes that claim but, consonant with the style it has adopted for its other assertions of interference with the investigation, it offers not even a slim bill of particulars.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Instead of describing the range and depth of its investigation, the government should have responded to the FOIA request as Campbell framed it. The response should have focused on documents Lilly personnel submitted after the FDA began its investigation of Campbell\u2019s charges. The references to information supplied by other sources or generated within the agency itself were not warranted and may have conveyed to the district court an inaccurate impression of the dimensions of this case. The FDA should have explained how the material Campbell in fact sought, and only that material, would reveal to potential targets \u2014 Lilly or others \u2014 the scope, direction, and focus of the inquiry or otherwise interfere with the investigation. On remand, in the discretion of the district court, such explanations may be made in camera. <em>See infra </em>pp. 265-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">With a view to this restatement of the claim Campbell presented \u2014 a claim centered on information Lilly provided after the FDA launched its investigation, not a sweeping demand for the variety of information the agency has gathered \u2014 we turn to the guides to decision we have found in the legislative history of Exemption 7(A) and in the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The legislative history of Exemption 7(A), limited as it is,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> nonetheless contains persuasive indications that the government must show something more than a direct relationship between agency records and a pending investigation in order to demonstrate that disclosure would interfere with enforcement proceedings. As originally enacted, Exemption 7 authorized agencies to withhold \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a private party.\u201d Act of July 4, 1966, Pub.L. No. 89^487, 80 Stat. 250, 251. The committee reports accompanying the bill explained that the exemption would protect \u201cthe Government\u2019s case in court,\u201d S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., Freedom of Information Act Source Book: Legislative Materials, Cases, Articles 36, 44 (Committee Print 1974) [hereinafter cited as 1974 Source Book], by preventing \u201ca private party [from obtaining] indirectly any earlier or greater access to investigatory files than he would have directly in such litigation or proceedings,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 2418, 2428, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 Source Book at 22, 32.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In 1974, Congress undertook an extensive revision of the FOIA. The bills that ultimately reached the floor suggested no change in Exemption 7.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During the Senate debate, however, Senator Hart introduced an amendment modeled after a recommendation of the Administrative Law Section of the American Bar Association. The ABA proposal included the exact language of the current exemption 7(A).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That proposal made two alterations in the law enforcement exception. First, it changed the focus of the exception from \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d to \u201cinvestigatory records.\u201d Second, it required the government to show that release of such records would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>result in one of several specified harms in order to justify nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Senator Hart explained that the new Exemption 7(A) was meant to apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amk\">whenever the Government\u2019s case in court \u2014 a concrete prospective law enforcement proceeding \u2014 would be harmed by the premature release of evidence or information not' in the possession of known or potential defendants. This would apply also where the agency could show that the disclosure of the information would substantially harm such proceedings by impeding any necessary investigation before the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">1975 Source Book, <em>supra </em>note 15, at 333. The amendment had a particular purpose. It would restore the intent of the Congress that had enacted the original FOIA by rejecting four decisions of this court. <em>Id. </em>at 335 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy), 349 (colloquy between Sens. Kennedy &amp; Hart). Those decisions had applied Exemption 7 to materials related to investigations that had been terminated and to cases in which no enforcement action was contemplated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See also id. </em>at 335 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy), 378 (remarks of Rep. Moorhead).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">President Ford vetoed the bill, in part because he believed that the revised Exemption 7 would subject the millions of pages of investigatory files to \u201ccompulsory disclosure at the behest of any person unless the Government could prove to a court \u2014 separately for each paragraph of each document \u2014 that disclosure \u2018would\u2019 cause a type of harm specified in the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. Various legislators argued that the President had exaggerated the administrative burden and deleterious effects of the changes. In particular, Senator Hart emphasized that Exemption 7(A) would eliminate \u201cagency incentive to commingle various information into one enormous investigatory file and then claim it is too difficult\u201d to separate exempt from nonexempt records. <em>Id. </em>at 451. <em>See also id. </em>at 406 (remarks of Rep. Moorhead), 413 (remarks of Rep. Reid), 420-21 (remarks of Rep. Erlenborn), 424 (remarks of Rep. Horton), 440 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy). Congress then overrode the veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Congress did not have specifically in view the novel case of a request for information supplied to an agency by the target of an investigation when it considered current Exemption 7(A). The history of revised Exemption 7, however, strongly suggests that the standard urged by the government and adopted by the district court is incompatible with the congressional intent to heighten or refine agency attention to FOIA requests. If an agency may withhold any document merely because it relates to a pending investigation, the 1974 version of Exemption 7(A) would apply to everything properly placed in investigatory files, yet Congress plainly mandated a focus upon records, not files. Furthermore, the \u201cclearly related to [an ongoing investigation]\u201d test fails to distinguish between records generated within the agency or otherwise \u201cnot in the possession of known or potential defendants,\u201d the typical Exemption 7(A) situation to which Senator Hart referred, and documents submitted to the government by such targets in the course of an investigation. By lumping the two together, the test would render it unnecessary for the agency to show in the latter case precisely how the disclosure would \u201cimped[e] any necessary investigation before the [law enforcement] proceeding.\u201d <em>See supra </em>p. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Although we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling rests upon an overly expansive reading of Exemption 7(A), we cannot attribute to the provision the meaning Campbell urges, which would require the FDA to justify on a document-by-document basis its withholding of any of the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>he requested. Congress rejected that interpretation in overriding President Ford\u2019s veto of the 1974 FOIA amendments, and judicial decisions construing the exemption have followed Congress\u2019 understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The leading case under Exemption 7(A) is <em>NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978). In <em>Robbins Tire, </em>an employer charged with committing unfair labor practices sought, in advance of the administrative hearing on those charges, to obtain copies of statements submitted to the NLRB by all prospective witnesses. The Board denied the request, claiming that prehearing disclosure would interfere with the enforcement proceedings. The employer argued that the Board had failed to show specifically that release of the particular statements would impede the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Court, in a three-step analysis, upheld the agency\u2019s position. First, it observed that the language of Exemption 7(A), unlike the terms of other subdivisions of the investigatory records exception, \u201cappears to contemplate that certain generic determinations might be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 98 S.Ct. at 2317-18.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Second, the Court reviewed the legislative history and concluded that Exemption 7(A)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a6i-dedup-0\">was designed to eliminate \u201cblanket exemptions\u201d for Government records simply because they were found in investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes .... Congress did not intend to prevent the federal courts from determining that, with respect to particular kinds of enforcement proceedings, disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 2324. Third, the Court examined the possible consequences of prehearing disclosure of statements of prospective witnesses and held that the Board had satisfied its burden of demonstrating that such premature revelation would interfere with enforcement proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 236-42, 98 S.Ct. at 2323-27.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Robbins Tire </em>is sufficient to dispose of Campbell\u2019s contention that the FDA must justify its withholding of each and every document responsive to his request.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under <em>Robbins Tire, </em>the agency need only show that release of the particular kinds of records a requester seeks would interfere with an actual or contemplated enforcement action. At the same time, that decision does not authorize an agency to refuse to disclose any record compiled in anticipation of enforcement action merely because the record has found its way into an investigative file. If a direct relationship between an active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>investigation and withheld information constituted a sufficient predicate for the invocation of Exemption 7(A), the Court in <em>Robbins Tire </em>would not have examined the special risks entailed in premature disclosure of statements of prospective witnesses in NLRB proceedings, the particular kind of records at issue in that case. Instead, the Court would simply have held those statements clearly related to a concrete enforcement matter and, on that account, with no need for further inquiry, properly withheld.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Even the decisions relied upon by the FDA suggest that the district court acted with unwarranted haste in dismissing Campbell\u2019s complaint. For example, the court in <em>Stephenson v. IRS, </em>629 F.2d 1140 (5th Cir. 1980), vacated a grant of summary judgment for the government because the affidavit describing the withheld documents afforded an inadequate factual basis for the decision. In contrast to this case, all of the decisions the FDA cites involved FOIA requests by actual or potential targets of concrete, prospective enforcement proceedings for materials compiled by the investigative agency or derived from third parties and to which the requester otherwise had no access. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1143 n.5 (memoranda of IRS interviews with and records received from third parties, summonses and other documentary requests to such persons, internal memoranda and work sheets of IRS agents, and sworn statements of third parties); <em>Barney v. IRS, </em>618 F.2d 1268, 1271 n.5 (8th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (copies of all information the IRS compiled on requesters since specified date); <em>Moorefield v. United States Secret Service, </em>611 F.2d 1021, 1022 (5th Cir.) (all documents concerning requester), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>449 U.S. 909, 101 S.Ct. 283, 66 L.Ed.2d 139 (1980); <em>Grabinski v. IRS, </em>478 F.Supp. 486, 487 (E.D.Mo.1979) (information received from and letters to and from third parties, and memoranda, notes, and work sheets prepared by IRS agents); <em>Steinberg v. IRS, </em>463 F.Supp. 1272, 1273 (S.D.Fla.1979) (internal IRS documents regarding audits and investigations, notes of agents conducting a specific investigation, correspondence between the IRS and other agencies and prospective witnesses).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Two recent district court decisions illustrate the focused analysis of Exemption 7(A) claims contemplated under <em>Robbins Tire. </em>In <em>Parker/Hunter, Inc. v. SEC, </em>[1981-1982 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 98,279, at 91,778-79 (D.D.C.Apr. 29, 1981), the court required the agency to supplement its initial submissions, which stated only in general terms that disclosure of the requested information could jeopardize future enforcement action by revealing the direction of the investigation and the strength of the evidence. The court pointedly observed that the proffered justification would warrant withholding any document in an open investigatory file, contrary to the holding of <em>Robbins Tire. </em>The supplemental affidavit, which the court found adequate to support the agency\u2019s position, \u201cdescribe[d] in detail the material in the SEC files that [was] responsive to each category of plaintiff\u2019s request, and describe[d] how disclosure of the material in each category would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91,778. Similarly, in <em>OKC Corp. v. Williams, </em>489 F.Supp. 576, 583-86 (N.D.Tex.1980), the target of an SEC investigation sought access to fourteen broad categories of agency records. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>granted summary judgment for the Commission on thirteen of the categories, which on their face called for portions of the agency\u2019s work product concerning the target company. However, the court denied summary judgment with respect to the final category, which covered some items, such as the corporation\u2019s annual Form 10K reports, that could not possibly interfere with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The unusual facts of the case at hand, moreover, should have signaled to the district court with particular clarity the court\u2019s responsibility to insist on a presentation by the FDA tuned to Campbell\u2019s request, and the need to apply to the government\u2019s affidavits a more rigorous analysis. Unlike the requesters in previous Exemption 7(A) cases, Campbell is not an actual or potential target of an FDA enforcement proceeding who seeks early discovery of the strength of the government\u2019s case in order to tailor his defense. Rather, he is a third party seeking information to which a potential target apparently has access and, indeed, has submitted to the agency. This circumstance does not mean that Campbell must prevail in resisting the government\u2019s invocation of Exemption 7(A). It does mean, however, that the district court must conduct a more focused and particularized review of the documentation on which the government bases its claim that the information Campbell seeks would interfere with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">On remand, the district court should require the submission of affidavits and entertain argument addressing the precise terms of Campbell\u2019s request. The government\u2019s submissions should relate with particularity to the documents submitted to the FDA by Lilly and its present and former officers or employees after that agency commenced its investigation of Campbell\u2019s allegations. The government may focus upon categories of records encompassed by the request; a document-by-document response is not required under Exemption 7(A). However organized, the submissions must demonstrate specifically how each document or category of documents, if disclosed, would interfere with the investigation, for example, how revelation of any particular record or record category identified as responsive to Campbell\u2019s request would reveal to particular targets, actual or potential, the scope, direction, or focus of the FDA inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Materials submitted to justify withholding the documents Campbell requested may contain information that could itself interfere with subsequent enforcement proceedings. For this reason, the district court, in its discretion, may accept in camera submissions. This court has expressed grave reservations regarding nonpublic government presentations absent sensitive national security concerns. <em>See, e.g., Yeager v.

Generic rather than document-by-document determinations may be made in ruling upon the application of Exemption 7(A). The government must show only that the documents at issue are investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, a matter not in dispute in this case, and that disclosure of each type of record requested would interfere with pending enforcement proceedings. In such a situation, the interests of the adversary process may be outweighed by the agency\u2019s legitimate interest in secrecy. <em>See Barney, supra, </em>618 F.2d at 1272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">We do not consider the application <em>vel non </em>of Exemptions 7(B) and 7(C) because the district court did not explain why it concluded that these provisions authorize withholding the information at issue. <em>See supra </em>note 5. As with Exemption 7(A), the government does not meet its burden, nor does the district court discharge its responsibility, through eonclusory statements, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>accompanied by supporting detail, that these exceptions are applicable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Exemption 4 issue remains open. <em>See supra </em>note 4.

Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">.

Under the standard urged by the government and adopted by the district court, the in camera affidavits the FDA submitted were superfluous. Campbell does not dispute the pendency of an investigation, and his request is confined to documents submitted by the target firm, its officers and employees.

While these considerations would support the agency\u2019s reluctance to respond to an indiscriminate request for investigative records, Campbell explicitly disavows any interest in learning the preliminary results of the FDA review of his allegations. <em>See supra </em>text accompanying notes 3 &amp; 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b315-5\">.

The floor debate on this provision was unenlightening. The Senate passed the original FOIA by voice vote without debate. 111 Cong. Rec. 26821 (1965). That chamber had approved a predecessor bill containing a somewhat different investigatory files exemption the previous year in similar fashion. <em>See </em>1974 Source Book at 103-09.

Two companion bills introduced in 1973, S. 1142 and H.R. 5425, which were predecessors of the legislation enacted the following year, would have substituted a new investigatory records exemption covering, in pertinent part, \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for any specific law-enforcement purpose the disclosure of which is not in the public interest, except to the extent that \u2014 (A) any such investigatory records are available by law to a party other than an agency.\u201d Although the hearings on these proposals demonstrated considerable support for some alteration of Exemption 7, the committees apparently concluded that these particular changes might engender needless confusion. <em>See NLRB v.

The Court noted that other portions of this exception refer to situations in which disclosure might deprive particular persons of their right to a fair hearing or privacy, for example, and thus suggest the need for the government to show \u201cthat the factors made relevant by the statute are present in each distinct situation.\u201d Exemption 7(A), on the other hand, addresses possible obstruction of enforcement proceedings, apparently a more general concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">.

Campbell cites three decisions in support of his contention that release of documents to which a potential target has access cannot interfere with enforcement proceedings. Even if all potential targets of the current FDA investigation do have access to the records he seeks, a question we are not positioned to address, Campbell\u2019s reliance on these decisions is misplaced. In <em>Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, </em>617 F.2d 854, 870 (D.C.Cir.1980), this court found that the government had failed to demonstrate the pendency of an investigation. Release of the documents at issue therefore could not have interfered with an enforcement proceeding. In <em>Wellford v. Hardin, </em>444 F.2d 21, 24 (4th Cir. 1971), decided under the original Exemption 7, the investigation had terminated and no enforcement action was contemplated. Under the current law, in those circumstances, the information would not be protected. Finally, in <em>Education/Instruction, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>471 F.Supp. 1074, 1078 (D.Mass. 1979), the agency had submitted the document in question to a court in another case. Accordingly, the information at issue was a matter of public record, unlike the material Campbell has requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\">. For this reason, we believe that Lilly exaggerates the significance of the statement in <em>Robbins Tire </em>that \u201cthe release of information in investigatory files prior to the completion of an actual, contemplated enforcement proceeding was precisely the kind of interference that Congress continued to want to protect against.\u201d 437 U.S. at 232, 98 S.Ct. at 2322. Similarly, Lilly\u2019s reliance upon <em>Carson v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>631 F.2d 1008, 1018 (D.C.Cir.1980), is misplaced. <em>Carson </em>holds only that the pendency of a specific, prospective enforcement proceeding is a necessary condition for invocation of Exemption 7(A); the decision does not suggest that this condition, in addition to being necessary, is also sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">. The other principal decision cited by the government holds only that the FOIA does not expand the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v.
