The SSA concedes that the checks were dishonored because of a \u201ctypographical\u201d error made by an SSA keypuncher who wrongly entered a notation that Cecilia had died on March 26, 1975, instead of the correct date of March 26, 1975. The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of this error, (a) several banks required him to pay back money that they had previously given him (presumably when he cashed the checks that his mother had endorsed); (b) his credit rating was seriously affected; (c) he had to borrow money from friends and acquaintances to repay the banks; (d) the Secret Service began to investigate him for fraud, making constant inquiries of his employer; (e) he was humiliated and suffered the stress of severe financial problems, resulting in great physical, mental, and emotional damage, affecting him and his entire family. All of this, says Jimenez Nieves, constitutes a tort under the law of Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He seeks recovery of damages from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The United States moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the action is barred by (1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1976), restricting court jurisdiction in social security cases, and (2) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (1976), which denies consent to sue the United States on claims arising out of \u201clibel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights... . \u201d The district court held that plaintiff\u2019s claim was indeed a claim of \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d and it therefore dismissed the complaint. While we agree that dismissal of most of the claims in the complaint was proper, we believe that the court\u2019s ground for dismissal was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">1. We turn first to the Government\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument. That argument is based on a provision in Subchapter II of the Social Security Act \u2014 a sub-chapter entitled \u201cFederal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Benefits.\u201d The provision at issue states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">No finding of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). The Government concludes that plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy\u2014 the \u201creview ... herein provided\u201d \u2014 lies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which, in effect, provides for court review of an administrative record, using the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976). The principal support the Government offers for this claim is a quotation from <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 760, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2464, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (stating that it would be \u201cfruitless to argue that this action does not also arise under the Social Security Act\u201d). The Government also asserts that, otherwise, \u201cvirtually any error in the administration of the Social Security Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>could be translated into a tort action against the United States.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We find the Government\u2019s position unacceptable. The language of \u00a7 405(h) applies only to a \u201cclaim arising under this subchap-ter.\u201d An action for damages based on a tort committed in the course of administering the Social Security Act does not arise \u201cunder\u201d a \u201csubchapter\u201d that provides for the payment of social security benefits any more than a tort claim based on a negligently driven postal truck arises under the postal acts. The Government quotes <em>Wein-berger v. Salfi </em>out of context, for the plaintiffs in that case sought social security <em>benefits </em>(although their argument rested on constitutional rather than statutory grounds), not tort damages. Moreover, we do not accept the Government\u2019s suggestion that, unless tort claims are viewed as \u201carising under\u201d the benefits subchapter, future claimants will simply transform claims for benefits into tort actions. The action here is not one for benefits or for \u201cnegligent denial of benefits;\u201d it thus supplies no precedent for any wholesale transformation of \u201cbenefit claims\u201d into \u201ctort claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">More importantly, however, to accept the Government\u2019s argument would imply that tort claims against the Government in general arise not only under the Federal Tort Claims Act and state law, but also under whatever statute the defendant agency happens to be administering. Such statutes may well have jurisdictional limitations or unique procedural requirements, as, for example, does the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act, which forbids court review of any administrative decision under the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the Government\u2019s argument, if accepted, would replace a reasonably uniform and clear system for handling tort suits against the government (embodied in the Tort Claims Act) with a hodge-podge of procedural requirements, drawn from a host of different statutes, not necessarily drafted with tort suits in mind. In this case, for example, the \u201cadministrative hearing\u201d procedures of \u00a7 405(g) are well suited to the decision of benefit claims. But they are anomalous if applied to tort claims. Tort claims are ordinarily presented to a district court for <em>de novo </em>decision within six months of an agency decision. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675. By contrast, a claim that reaches the district court via the administrative hearings of \u00a7 405(g) and (h), is subject to a different time limitation and does not receive a <em>de novo </em>court hearing. If \u00a7 405(g) and (h) apply, the agency would enjoy an unusual amount of discretion to decide the facts of the tort claim against it. We are aware of no reason why so totally different a system for resolving tort claims against the government should apply to claims that happen to grow out of administration of the Social Security Act. The Government offers us no evidence that such was the intent of Congress, here or elsewhere, nor does it explain how, or why, that result would be desirable. Thus, we find its \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">2. We also believe that the district court erred in finding plaintiff\u2019s claim covered by the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act. In determining the proper scope of the \u00a7 2680(h) exceptions, we must turn to the \u201ctraditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and commonly understood definition of the tort.\u201d <em>United States v. Neustadt, </em>366 U.S. 696, 706, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 1300, 6 L.Ed.2d 614 (1961). To accomplish this task, we refer, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Neustadt, </em>to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and to federal cases construing the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The district court based its holding that this was a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d case upon the fact that the harm to the plaintiff was caused by a false statement, namely, the keypunching error which resulted in entering into the social security records the \u201cfact\u201d that plaintiffs mother died in 1975, rather than 1976. But, <em>this </em>false statement did not <em>directly </em>injure the plaintiff; it was simply the internal bureaucratic cause of other agency action \u2014 dishonoring the checks. It was failure to honor the checks that hurt the plaintiff and about which he now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">If the fact that a tortious act is <em>caused </em>by a false statement were sufficient to bring it within the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s misrepresentation exception, the results would be bizarre. An injured pedestrian could not recover if, for example, the government truck driver ran over him because his coworker falsely told him that the light was green. Nor could a homeowner recover should a government demolition crew wreck his house after being sent to the wrong address. Such cases are not, however, typically considered as examples of the separate tort category of \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d Rather, the Restatement, noting that \u201cmisrepresentation runs all through the law of torts as a method of accomplishing various types of [other] tortious conduct,\u201d adds that such cases are \u201cusually grouped under categories of their own.\u201d <em>Id., </em>ch. 22, scope note at 54. Thus, inducing a person to eat chocolates that are poisoned is considered a \u201cbattery,\u201d restraining a person by falsely claiming legal authority to arrest him is considered \u201cfalse imprisonment,\u201d and causing an accident by signalling a wrong turn is treated as ordinary negligence. <em>Id. </em>Dean Prosser adds that such \u201cmisrepresentation has been merged to such an extent with other kinds of misconduct that neither the courts nor legal writers have found occasion to regard it as a separate basis of liability.\u201d W. Prosser, <em>Torts </em>684 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Insofar as \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d is viewed as a separate, independent tort, it involves activity different from that at issue here. The tort arose out of \u201cdeceit,\u201d initially in commercial contexts, where one party to a business transaction would falsely represent to another facts likely to influence the other\u2019s decision. While the Restatement indicates that the tort of misrepresentation involves the dissemination of information generally and not only in commercial contexts, it makes clear that one essential element of misrepresentation remains reliance <em>by the plaintiff himself </em>upon the false information that has been provided. Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 525 at 55, \u00a7 537 at 80, \u00a7 552 at 126, and \u00a7 552C at 141. Even when the misrepresentation is made to a third party, the plaintiff must have suffered damages because <em>he </em>himself acts in \u201cjustifiable reliance upon ... the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 533 at 72-73. (Emphasis added.) Similarly, one who is negligent in making a misrepresentation as to information \u201cfor the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by <em>their </em>justifiable reliance upon the information.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 552 at 126. (Emphasis added.) Dean Prosser, too, lists \u201c[\u00a1justifiable reliance upon the representation on the part of the plaintiff, in taking action, or refraining from it,\u201d as an essential element. Prosser, <em>supra, </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The requirement that the plaintiff himself has relied upon the false information makes sense if one sees the traditional tort as protecting a person\u2019s interest in obtaining true information (from those with a duty to provide it) when making up his mind about an important matter. The cases support such a requirement. Thus, the cases cited by the Government and the district court finding \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d for Tort Claims Act purposes all involve \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 the core element of reliance by the plaintiff himself upon false information. In <em>Neustadt, </em>for example, the Feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>al Housing Administration falsely stated that a house was worth $27,000; the plaintiff, relying on this information, bought the house which was later discovered to have severe structural defects. The Court held that this was \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d even if the Government\u2019s conduct was negligent, not intentional. Similarly, in <em>Fitch v. United States, </em>513 F.2d 1013 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 866, 96 S.Ct. 127, 46 L.Ed.2d 95 (1975), the Sixth Circuit found that a government \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d led the plaintiff to enlist in the Army, and it also explicitly noted that plaintiff, when signing up, relied upon the Army\u2019s false statement that he had a low draft number. Conversely, courts have held that a suit against a doctor who wrongly diagnoses a plaintiff\u2019s condition falls outside the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d exception if the tort is based upon improper treatment that was <em>caused by </em>the false diagnosis. <em>Beech v. United States, </em>345 F.2d 872 (5th Cir. 1965). A suit claiming a government trespass is also outside the exception where the trespass is caused by the mistaken belief of the <em>trespassing officers </em>about the rights they had received in a prior conveyance. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>259 F.Supp. 148 (E.D.Pa.1966). <em>Compare Rey v. United States, </em>484 F.2d 45 (5th Cir. 1973) (suit barred where plaintiff, relying on incorrect information from Department of Agriculture veterinarian that his hogs had cholera, killed his own livestock), <em>with Ware v. United States, </em>626 F.2d 1278 (5th Cir. 1980) (suit not barred where government agents misdiagnosed cattle as tubercular and killed the cattle themselves). <em>See also Coastwise Packet Co. v. United States, </em>398 F.2d 77, 78-79 (1st Cir. 1968) (statements made to plaintiff) (a case which is perhaps better viewed as an instance of defamation, <em>see </em>p. 6 <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Additional support can be found for this view of the underlying tort in those cases which have refused to bar suits against the government when the false statement\u2014 though made directly to plaintiff \u2014 was \u201coperational,\u201d consisting, for example, of faulty aviation charts. <em>Sullivan v. United States, </em>299 F.Supp. 621 (N.D.Ala.1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>411 F.2d 794 (5th Cir. 1969) <em>(per curiam). </em>In such cases, the false statement not only conveys information but also operates as an instruction or a direction, taking the case some distance from the \u201cproviding information for making up one\u2019s mind\u201d rationale. <em>Compare Sullivan v. United States, supra; Ingham </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>373 F.2d 227 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 931, 88 S.Ct. 295, 19 L.Ed.2d 292 (1967) (suit not barred where air controllers did not supply weather information that was up to date); <em>and United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener, </em>335 F.2d 379 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 951, 85 S.Ct. 452, 13 L.Ed.2d 549 (1974) (suit not barred where air controllers negligently fail to warn airline of hazardous flight training near airplane\u2019s route), <em>with Marival, Inc. v. Planes, Inc., </em>306 F.Supp. 855 (N.D.Ga.1969) (suit barred where plaintiff relied on Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s certification of airworthiness when buying plane). <em>See also United States v. Neustadt, </em>366 U.S. at 711 n.26, 81 S.Ct. at 1302 n.26 (Court states that a suit based upon a driver\u2019s misleading hand signal is not a suit based upon misrepresentation). <em>But see Neal v. Bergland, </em>646 F.2d 1178 (6th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Block v. Neal, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2267, 73 L.Ed.2d 1282 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">We need not, however, explore the intricacies or the rationale of these \u201coperational statement\u201d cases. Regardless of whether one views the false statement at issue here as, in essence, an instruction or direction to those within the Social Security Administration, that statement was not made to the plaintiff and he did not rely upon it. That is sufficient to remove this case from the core, or traditional, view of \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d as a separate tort. Moreover, all the cases here cited suggest that the word \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d in the Tort Claims Act should be confined to its traditional, or core, meaning as a separate tort. And, we can discern no congressional purpose that might have been served in defining it more broadly, to include false statements that are happenstance causal elements of other torts. Thus, the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>3. While the false date of death statement does not bring plaintiff\u2019s claims within any of the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s exceptions, several of plaintiff\u2019s claims are nonetheless barred by the exception for \u201clibel\u201d and \u201cslander.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). In examining a complaint we are bound to look beyond the literal meaning of the language used to ascertain the real cause of the complaint. <em>Fitch v. United States, </em>513 F.2d at 1015; <em>Hall v. United States, </em>274 F.2d 69, 71 (10th Cir. 1959). Much of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that dishonoring the checks harmed him because it injured his reputation in the eyes of third parties\u2014 hence, they would not extend him credit, ridiculed him and his family, and so forth. The Federal Tort Claims Act, however, explicitly exempts \u201clibel\u201d and \u201cslander\u201d\u2014 what amounts to \u201cdefamation,\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 111 at 737\u2014from the claims to which the United States grants consent to be sued. And, plaintiff\u2019s claim fits \u201c \u2018the traditional and commonly understood legal definition\u2019 of the tort of defamation.\u201d <em>Hoesl v. United States, </em>451 F.Supp. 1170, 1175 (N.D.Cal.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>629 F.2d 586 (9th Cir. 1980) <em>(per curiam), quoting Neustadt, </em>366 U.S. at 706, 81 S.Ct. at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">To create liability for defamation there must be \u201c(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (b) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (c) fault amounting to at least negligence; and (d) [certain types of harm].\u201d Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 558 at 155. A \u201cstatement\u201d simply means a \u201ccommunication\u201d that tends \u201cto harm the reputation of another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 559 at 156. And, as the Restatement\u2019s note makes clear, \u201ccommunication\u201d is interpreted broadly \u201cto denote the fact that one person has brought an idea to the perception of another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Comment (a) at 156. In fact, even an activity, such as \u201cshadowing\u201d someone can count as a \u201ccommunication\u201d if that activity communicates an idea to a third party. <em>Id., </em>Comment at 156, 170, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">All of plaintiff\u2019s claims which involve the injury to his reputation and the consequent harm suffered by him when the Social Security Administration\u2019s actions in dishonoring the checks implicitly communicated defamatory statements about him are therefore barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act. Such claims resound in the heartland of the tort of defamation: the injury is to reputation; the conduct is the communication of an idea, either implicitly or explicitly. <em>Cf. Maymi v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, </em>63 P.R.R. 515 (1944). The only contrary authority we can find is <em>Quinones v. United States, </em>492 F.2d 1269 (3d Cir. 1974), in which the Third Circuit allowed an action against the United States based on failure to use due care in maintaining personnel records. The court held that the claim was not one for defamation, although the injury was to reputation, because \u201cnegligence is conceptually distinct from defamation,\u201d and because \u201cthe negligence alleged here was distinct from ... mere writing or speaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281. However, we decline to follow the Third Circuit in this case because we do not believe that the fact that a defamation is caused negligently makes it any the less a defamation. Indeed, it is commonly held that defamation can be caused by negligence. Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 580B at 221-22.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we believe that plaintiff\u2019s complaint \u2014 insofar as it alleges harm caused by an injury to his reputation \u2014 must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">4. We note that there are several paragraphs of the complaint which appear to allege some sort of direct injury to the plaintiff that does not depend upon an injury to reputation. Insofar as they allege injury caused by the Government\u2019s criminal investigation, we suspect that they fall within the exemption to the Tort Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Act for \u201cdiscretionary\u201d actions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) (1976). Insofar as they claim direct (nonreputational) injury caused by the Government\u2019s failure to honor its checks, we are uncertain how they set out the elements of a tort under the laws of Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, these issues have not been argued to us and we believe plaintiff should have an opportunity at least to make an argument in support of the existence of such theories. Therefore, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>Vacated and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">. Claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act are determined \u201cin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (1976). In this case, the claims would arise under the Civil Code of Puerto Rico:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">A person who by act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done. Concurrent imprudence of the party aggrieved does not exempt from liability but entails a reduction of the indemnity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\">Art. 1802, 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 5141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\">. The Government also refers us to three district court cases in which it is said that the bar of \u00a7 405(h) was accepted. Only one of those cases, <em>Muenich v. United States, </em>410 F.Supp. 944 (N.D.Ind.1976), is reported. That case is clearly distinguishable as the amounts claimed in that case were attorney\u2019s fees provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), a provision of the Social Security Act, and therefore the claim obviously arose under the subchapter. Neither of the other cases, <em>Parmenter v. United States, </em>Civil No. 80-3009 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 31, 1981), and <em>Barton v. Harris, </em>Civil No. 80-18 (S.D.Tex. May 13, 1980), is sufficiently detailed in either facts or legal reasoning to be useful as precedent \u2014 no doubt this is why the courts issued them in unpublished form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-12\">. The Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act provides that \u201cthe decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration providing benefits for veterans and their dependents or survivors shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b66-5\">. We are also uncertain about the <em>Quinones </em>court\u2019s view that the defamation exception reflected only heightened congressional desire to free government officials to write and speak as they choose, rather than a diminished congressional desire to protect reputational interests. But, in any event, even if it was Congress\u2019s intent to protect official speech activity, the conduct at issue in this case must have consisted of a form of speech activity that explicitly or implicitly communicated negative propositions to third parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
