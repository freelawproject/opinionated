The previous appellate panel remanded the case to the District Court with instructions for resolving several then outstanding factual disputes. The District Court on remand conducted further proceedings and entered judgment. Because we find that the District Court misunderstood the instructions of the earlier panel specifying the issues to be addressed on remand, we vacate the judgment before us and, once again, remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Over eight years ago, on February 4, 1974, plaintiff-appellant Richard Owen initiated this action seeking redress for, <em>inter alia, </em>the deprivation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights during his incarceration in the Indiana State Prison at Michigan City, Indiana. Specifically, Owen alleged that, during a period extending from March 1973 to February 1974, he was denied the right to correspond with a newspaper reporter and two individuals whose names he had received from a religious organization. Owen sought injunctive relief and damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983,1985 and 1986, against the defendant-appellee Russell E. Lash, both individually and as the Warden of the Indiana State Prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">On November 5, 1976, in response to Lash\u2019s pre-trial motion, the District Court dismissed Owen\u2019s claims based upon the denial of his right to correspond. The District Court held that these claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata in light of the decision in <em>Aikens v. Lash, </em>371 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Ind.1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>514 F.2d 55 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>vacated, </em>425 U.S. 947, 96 S.Ct. 1721, 48 L.Ed.2d 191 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">On appeal, this Court reversed the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Owen\u2019s correspondence claims, ruling that the issue of the denial of Owen\u2019s personal correspondence rights had not been presented in <em>Ai-kens </em>v. <em>Lash </em>and, therefore, that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the present suit. As to the merits of Owen\u2019s correspondence claims, the Court stated that \u201c[c]on-sidering the conclusive evidence adduced at the hearing that Owen\u2019s communications with Kenny were stopped for the sole reason that he was a newspaper reporter and that his communication with Rutkowski and Graff was stopped solely because he didn\u2019t know them prior to incarceration, it cannot be said that he failed to state a claim . . . . \u201d <em>Owen v. Lash, </em>Unpublished Order, No. 78-1208 at p. 7 (7th Cir. June 14, 1979). 601 F.2d 600. The Court added, however, that the prison\u2019s limitations on Owen\u2019s correspondence right could not be found to have violated the Constitution if such restrictions had been justified by \u201crational\u201d and \u201clegitimate\u201d state interests. <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that even if the restrictions on Owen\u2019s right to correspond were found to have violated the Constitution, Warden Lash might be shielded from personal liability by the \u201cqualified immunity\u201d accorded to executive officials. Therefore, the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether the denial of Owen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>right to correspond had been supported by a \u201crational basis\u201d and whether the defendant Lash was protected from individual liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On remand, the District Court conducted further proceedings and concluded that \u201cthe state\u2019s justification for the inhibition on prisoner correspondence\u201d did not \u201cpass muster\u201d and had to be \u201crejected.\u201d The trial court ruled, therefore, that Owen had proven that the restrictions on his correspondence had violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">At that point in its opinion, the District Court posed the question \u201cWhat kind of rights are we talking about?\u201d, and concluded that the violation under consideration was merely the denial of \u201ccourt created procedural due process rights.\u201d Having so ruled, the trial court then focused on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977) \u2014 a case involving the denial of public school students\u2019 procedural due process rights \u2014 in order to formulate the damage award. Finding that there was no \u201cbasis in the record at all for awarding .. . any punitive damages\u201d and that Owen had failed to present proof of actual damages, the court concluded that, \u201cunder the teaching of <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus,\u201d </em>only nominal damages in the sum of one dollar should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The District Court was also faced with deciding against whom the judgment should be entered. Ruling that \u201cthere is no claim proven here against the defendant Russell E. Lash individually,\u201d the court entered judgment solely against Lash as Warden of the Indiana State Prison. Finally, in response to a subsequent motion by Owen as a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff, the District Court refused to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Dissatisfied with the one dollar judgment, Owen brought this appeal. He argues that the District Court\u2019s characterization of the violation at issue as a denial of procedural due process was erroneous and, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s decision to award only nominal damages to compensate for this deprivation must be reversed. Owen also contends that the trial court erred in absolving the defendant Lash from individual liability. He asks this Court to enter judgment against the defendant Lash individually, awarding plaintiff-appellant a \u201cfair compensatory award,\u201d punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">The linchpin of the District Court\u2019s decision was the ruling that the constitutional violation at issue was the denial of Owen\u2019s procedural due process rights. A finding that governmental action deprived a citizen of his right to procedural due process differs greatly from a ruling that such action violated an independent substantive right secured by the Constitution. The guarantee of procedural due process<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> places restrictions on the manner in which the government may undertake actions that infringe upon the rights of the citizenry; it imposes no limitations on the ends that such governmental action, accompanied by proper procedures, may achieve. The right to procedural due process \u201c \u2018raises no impenetrable barrier to the taking of a person\u2019s possessions\u2019 or liberty, or life. Procedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty or property.\u201d <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 259, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977) (quoting <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 81, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1994, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">Of course, the specification of procedural safeguards that must precede or accompany governmental action may serve as a prime deterrent against malicious and improper conduct. \u201cMoreover, proper procedures will surely eliminate some of the arbitrariness that results, not from malice, but from innocent error.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 591, 92 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>2701, 2716, 33 L.Ed.2d 648 (Marshall, J., dissenting.) \u201cFor when a person has an opportunity to speak up in his defense, and when the State must listen to what he has to say, substantively unfair and simply mistaken deprivations of [rights] can be prevented.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 81, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1994, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). Yet, despite the fact that the right to procedural due process may have an incidental effect on the substance of the actions undertaken by the government, it is clear that the guarantee of procedural due process merely imposes upon the State a duty to follow a fair process of decision making. Thus, a determination that governmental action violated a citizen\u2019s right to procedural due process is merely a condemnation of the procedures that attended the action and not an assessment of the constitutionality or propriety of the action itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">By ruling that \u201cthis case in my judgment falls clearly on the side of the establishment of the violation of a procedural rather than a substantive due process,\u201d the District Judge of necessity held that the State did not violate Owen\u2019s constitutional rights by confiscating his letters and interrupting his correspondence with the outside world for over a year. Rather, according to the District Court\u2019s opinion, the only constitutional violation in this case was the State\u2019s failure to utilize proper procedures \u2014 such as providing notice and an opportunity to be heard \u2014 prior to depriving Owen of his correspondence rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The District Court\u2019s ruling that the only right at issue in this case was Owen\u2019s right to procedural due process is extremely surprising in light of the history of this lawsuit. Until this appeal, neither party in this case ever mentioned the right to procedural due process. No paper filed in the suit referred to that right until the District Court\u2019s decision. And during its initial consideration of Owen\u2019s correspondence claims prior to dismissing the claims as barred by res judicata, the District Court itself never once discussed the right to procedural due process. Owen had alleged in his complaint only that he had been deprived of his First and Fourteenth Amendment right to correspond, and not that this deprivation \u2014 regardless of its legality \u2014 had been accomplished without constitutionally required procedural safeguards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Owen had sought redress only for the denial of his substantive correspondence right \u2014 for the restriction upon his freedom to send and receive letters and thereby to communicate with the outside world \u2014 and not for the unconstitutional manner in which this restriction had been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The District Court\u2019s ruling that the deprivation at issue in this case was objectionable only on procedural due process grounds also conflicts with both the controlling precedent in this Circuit and the law of this case. The controlling precedent in this Circuit was delineated in the en banc decision authored by Judge Pell in <em>Morales v. Schmidt, </em>494 F.2d 85 (7th Cir. 1974). In that opinion, Judge Pell explained that in order for a restriction on prisoner correspondence not to violate substantive constitutional rights, the \u201cState must show on challenge that such restriction is related both reasonably and necessarily to the advancement of a justifiable purpose of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>prisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. The ruling of the previous appellate panel in this case \u2014 the law of this case \u2014 merely followed that en banc decision. Thus, the earlier panel ruled that Owen\u2019s complaint had stated a claim for the deprivation of his correspondence rights in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The panel remanded the case for findings of fact, in conformity with Judge Pell\u2019s en banc decision, as to whether the restriction on Owen\u2019s correspondence rights was \u201creasonably and necessarily related to a justifiable purpose of imprisonment.\u201d The panel\u2019s instructions to the District Court specifying the issues to be addressed on <em>remand </em>\u2014 i.e. the nature <em>of </em>the State\u2019s countervailing interest and the immunity of the individual defendant \u2014 did not afford the District Court the leeway to conclude that, although the State\u2019s countervailing interest \u201cdid not pass muster,\u201d the State had only violated Owen\u2019s right to procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The District Court did not explain its reasons for concluding that the defendants merely violated Owen\u2019s procedural due process rights. Rather, in reaching this conclusion, the District Court simply cited the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977) as well as this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Konczak v. Tyrrell, </em>603 F.2d 13 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1016, 100 S.Ct. 668, 62 L.Ed.2d 646 (1980), and then stated, \u201cI think we\u2019re dealing with the basically court created procedural due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The court\u2019s reliance on <em>Carey </em>and <em>Konc-zak </em>is as puzzling as its ultimate ruling. In <em>Carey, </em>the Supreme Court held that public school students who had proven a denial of procedural due process, but who had failed to prove actual injury, could recover only nominal damages. The Supreme Court in that case was faced only with formulating the proper damage remedy for a proven violation of procedural due process protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Konczak, </em>this Court affirmed a jury verdict awarding $12,500 compensatory damages to a couple who had been the victims of an unlawful search and seizure conducted by members of a county sheriff\u2019s department. No procedural due process claim was ever raised in <em>Konczak </em>and, unlike in the present case, none was ever considered by the trial court or this Court. The <em>Konczak </em>opinion did reject an argument advanced by the defendants that the plaintiffs were entitled only to nominal damages, distinguishing the nominal damage award in <em>Carey </em>by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201c[T]he officers charge that under <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>the Supreme Court requires that actual damages must be proven for every violation of a constitutional right. The defendants misread the case. In <em>Carey v. Piphus </em>the Supreme Court held that where a plaintiff has proven a denial of procedural due process without proving any actual injury, he may only recover nominal damages. The Court, however, distinguished procedural constitutional violations from substantive ones such as those asserted by the plaintiffs here. In any event, we believe the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of actual damages in this case.\u201d <em>Konczak v. Tyrrell, </em>603 F.2d, at 17.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Thus, neither <em>Carey </em>nor <em>Konczak </em>support the proposition for which they were cited by the District Court in this case, and neither opinion in any way mandates the conclusion that Owen suffered only a violation of procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Having found that the justifications advanced to support the restriction upon Owen\u2019s freedom to correspond \u201chad to be rejected,\u201d the District Court was required by this Court\u2019s previous instruction and by settled law to find that Owen had been deprived of the substantive right to correspond secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Another issue that needed to be addressed in analyzing this \u00a7 1983 damage claim was the question of which party, if any, should be held responsible for monetary damages. Because actions that violate \u00a7 1983 must have been committed \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d the defendants in \u00a7 1983 suits are often employees of government entities. These defendants will frequently be shielded from liability for monetary damages by some form of immunity, and therefore, aggrieved plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 suits may often be limited to securing only injunctive and declaratory relief. Analysis of the immunity question, therefore, may moot the need to address such issues as the proper amount of compensatory damages and the availability of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In the present case, the District Court did ultimately decide the question of which of the \u201ctwo\u201d named defendants \u2014 Russell E. Lash individually or Russell E. Lash as the Warden of the Indiana State Prison\u2014 should be liable for the monetary damages owed to Owen. The Court\u2019s ruling, however, was inconsistent with the Eleventh Amendment and was apparently reached without any consideration of the law governing the immunity of executive officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1973), the Supreme Court clearly delineated the restrictions imposed by the Eleventh Amendment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on a federal court in awarding an aggrieved plaintiff relief in a \u00a7 1983 suit: \u201cIn a \u00a7 1983 action ... a federal court\u2019s remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief, <em>Ex Parte Young </em>[209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714], <em>supra, </em>and may not include a retroacr tive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury, <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury </em>[323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389], <em>supra.\u201d </em>415 U.S., at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 1362. The Supreme Court in <em>Edelman </em>explained that the bar against the award of monetary damages exists, even though a State is not named a party to the action, as long as the funds used to satisfy the judgment will come from the state treasury. <em>Id. </em>at 663, 94 S.Ct. at 1355, <em>see Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1973). \u201c[W]hen the action is in essence one for recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity\u201d under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, </em>323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945); <em>see Carey v. Quern, </em>588 F.2d 230 (7th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Five years after <em>Edelman, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed that case\u2019s holding, quoted above, and expressly rejected the proposition that \u00a7 1983 abrogated the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1978). The impropriety of awarding monetary damages in a \u00a7 1983 action, to be paid by the State, was so clearly established by <em>Edelman </em>and <em>Quern </em>as to prompt one commentary to declare: \u201cThe issue of state liability for damages against the State itself under section 1983 is closed ... .\u201d Rushing and Bratcher, <em>Section 1988 Defenses, </em>14 Urb.Law 149, 162 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">Without ever referring to the Eleventh Amendment, the District Court entered judgment against, and ordered nominal monetary damages to be paid by, Russell E. Lash, in his official capacity \u201cas Warden and not individually.\u201d Neither party disputes the fact that this damage award must now be satisfied with state funds<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Indiana has not waived its Eleventh Amendment protection; in fact, both sides agree that the decision of the District Court violates the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In attempting to defend the judgment despite the violation of the Eleventh Amendment, counsel for Lash suggests that we find the violation to be \u201charmless error.\u201d We cannot adopt this suggestion for several reasons. First, although a State may waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the defense, absent waiver, \u201cpartakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar .... \u201d <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S., at 678, 94 S.Ct., at 1363. \u201cThe . . . Amendment declares a policy and sets forth an explicit limitation on federal judicial power .... \u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, supra, </em>323 U.S., at 467, 65 S.Ct., at 352. Second, although this error presently seems \u201charmless\u201d and will continue to be relatively \u201charmless\u201d if only nominal damages are awarded in this case, there is at least a possibility, as fully explained below, that the District Court on remand may decide upon a much more substantial compensatory award. Finally, overlooking the error of assessing monetary damages against the State would fail to isolate and clarify the major questions that still remain to be disposed of in this suit: (1) given that Owen has proven a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and given that the State of Indiana is immune from paying damages, can Owen collect monetary damages against the only other defendant in the case, Russell E. Lash individually?; and (2) if Owen is entitled to collect damages from Lash as an individual, is Owen limited in this case to recovering the sum of one dollar?</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In dismissing the claims against Lash individually, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">\u201cFirst of all, a simple matter, there is no claim proven here against the defendant Russell E. Lash individually. There is none asserted and none proven. And to the extent that Russell E. Lash the defendant is sued in an individual capacity, the case is dismissed in his favor on any such claims. Judgment entered on individual claims in favor of Russell E. Lash and against the plaintiff Richard Owen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Because this ruling is phrased in purely conclusory terms, without any explanation or citation to the record, it is somewhat difficult to discern the exact meaning of the dismissal. Certainly, Owen \u201casserted a claim\u201d against Lash, who was the Warden of the prison at the time Owen was denied his right to correspond and who was named in the complaint as being the person who was responsible for the enforcement of the prison\u2019s correspondence rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">The District Court\u2019s isolated and conclu-sory statement that no claim \u201cwas proven\u201d against Lash individually is as confusing as the court\u2019s statement that no claim was asserted. The earlier opinion of this court, holding that Owen had stated a claim and remanding for analysis of the State\u2019s countervailing interest, combined with the District Court\u2019s ruling on remand that the State\u2019s asserted justifications had to be rejected, established that Owen\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment correspondence rights had been violated. The record in this case reveals, not surprisingly, that Warden Lash\u2019s signature appears on most of the paperwork relating to the denial of these rights. Given the complaint, the record, and the other judicial rulings in this case, it is hardly possible to read the District Court\u2019s decision as holding that Warden Lash was not even partly responsible for the proven deprivation of Owen\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>It is likely that what the District Court meant in dismissing Lash in his individual capacity and in ruling that no claim was \u201casserted\u201d or \u201cproven\u201d against Lash individually was that, although Lash\u2019s actions contributed to the violation of Owen\u2019s rights, Lash undertook these actions in good faith as part of his duties as Warden and, therefore, should not be held personally responsible to pay monetary damages. The law governing \u00a7 1983 suits is neither so wooden nor so unjust as to force government officials, who carry out their duties diligently and in good faith, to shoulder the burden of paying monetary damages if their actions are subsequently found to have violated the rights of a citizen. These officials, however, are protected not by their unexplained dismissal from a given lawsuit, but rather, by application of the doctrine of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In <em>Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 561, 98 S.Ct. 855, 859, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1977), the Supreme Court held that a state prison official\u2019s exposure to personal liability in a \u00a7 1983 suit is controlled by the doctrine of \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d Under this doctrine, a state prison official will be immune from having to pay damages unless the official \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the [citizen] affected, or [unless] he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury .... \u201d <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 306, 322, 95 S.Ct. 992, 1000, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), <em>quoted in Procunier v. Navarette, supra, </em>434 U.S., at 562, 98 S.Ct., at 859; <em>see Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 498-504, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2906-2909, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1977) (tracing the development of and extending the qualified immunity doctrine); Note, <em>Civil Rights Suits Against State and Local Governmental Entities and Officials: Rights of Action, Immunities and Federalism, </em>53 S.Calif.L.Rev. 945, 1052-1053 (analyzing judicial applications of qualified immunity doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In elaborating on the first part of the qualified immunity standard delineated in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Procunier v. Navarette </em>explained that an official is not immune if \u201cthe constitutional right allegedly infringed . .. was clearly established at the time of [the] challenged conduct, if [he] knew or should have known of that right, and if he knew or should have known that his conduct violated the constitutional norm.\u201d <em>Procunier v. Navarette, supra, </em>434 U.S., at 562, 98 S.Ct., at 859. It is clear that in order to apply this first prong of the qualified immunity test an appellate court must rely on the district court\u2019s findings of fact as to: (1) when the violation was committed; (2) whether a given official knew or reasonably should have known about the right at the time the violation was committed; and (3) whether a given official knew or reasonably should have known that his conduct violated the constitutional rights at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Although specifically instructed by the previous appellate panel to address the issue of qualified immunity on remand, the District Court failed to examine the question; in fact, the word \u201cimmunity\u201d was never mentioned in the District Court\u2019s oral opinion. Because the District Court ignored the immunity question and because the Court failed to provide any analysis supporting or explaining the decision to dismiss Lash in his individual capacity, the Court\u2019s decision is devoid of the findings of fact, delineated above, necessary to decide whether Lash is immune from personal liability. The case must be remanded once again to the District Court to enable that Court to consider whether Russell E. Lash is protected from personal liability under the doctrine of \u201cqualified immunity\u201d as explained in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Procunier v. <em>Navarette, supra, </em>and its prog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>eny in this Circuit. <em>See Lock </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>641 F.2d 488 (7th Cir. 1981) (prison officials immune from award of money damages for unconstitutional use of tear gas and unconstitutional confinement of pretrial detainees); <em>Hayes v. Thompson, </em>637 F.2d 483 (7th Cir. 1980) (prison officials immune from award of money damages for unconstitutional denial of request for witnesses and failure to furnish adequate statement of reasons in administrative proceeding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Having ruled that only Owen\u2019s procedural due process rights had been violated (and having overlooked the Eleventh Amendment ban), the District Court followed the \u201cteachings\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977), and held that since Owen had failed to present proof of \u201cactual injury,\u201d he could only recover nominal damages in the sum of one dollar. Our ruling that Owen has suffered a deprivation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment right to correspond raises a difficult question of first impression in this Circuit: can a plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 action who has proven a deprivation of substantive rights secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments recover damages, greater than mere nominal damages, in the absence of proof of consequential injury?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">As noted above, the Supreme Court in <em>Carey </em>held that nominal damages were all that could properly be awarded to public school students who had proven a violation of their right to procedural due process, but who had failed to present proof of \u201cactual injury.\u201d In so doing, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of this Court, which had ordered the award of damages \u201cneither so small as to trivialize the right nor so large as to provide a windfall.\u201d <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>545 F.2d 30, 32 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977). In reaching its decision, this Court relied on several earlier cases \u2014 dealing primarily with voting rights and Fourth Amendment rights \u2014 which had based the award of damages in the absence of proof of consequential injury on the theories that: (1) injury could be inferred from the circumstances of the given case; and (2) injury could be \u201cpresumed\u201d to exist \u201cas inherent in the nature of the wrong\u201d at issue. <em>See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., </em>491 F.2d 634 (7th Cir. 1974) (\u201cHumiliation can be inferred from the circumstances\u201d following a discriminatory refusal to lease housing.); <em>Sexton v. Gibbs, </em>327 F.Supp. 134, 142-43 (N.D.Tex.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>446 F.2d 904 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1062, 92 S.Ct. 733, 30 L.Ed.2d 751 (1972) (Since \u201c[tjhere is no doubt that Plaintiff suffered humiliation, embarrassment and discomfort\u201d from unlawful search, Plaintiff may recover $500.00 despite failure to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201csubmit proof\u201d of actual damages.); <em>see also Dellums v. Powell, </em>566 F.2d 167, 195 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>428 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1977). (Loss of opportunity to express oneself constitutes a deprivation of an intangible First Amendment interest entitling plaintiff to recover \u201cnot insignificant\u201d damages.); <em>Gore v.

Morton, </em>562 F.2d 1279, 1282 (D.C.Cir.1977) (\u201cThe right to demonstrate is a significant strand of the cluster of First Amendment rights.... It is in the public interest that there be a reasonably spacious award for denial or curtailment of the right to demonstrate.\u201d); <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Seiler, </em>558 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1977) (\u201cDamage [may] be presumed from the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d); <em>Wayne v. Venable, </em>260 F. 64, 66 (8th Cir. 1919) (\u201cIn the eyes of the law [the right to vote] is so valuable that damages are presumed from the wrongful deprivation of it without evidence of actual loss of money, property, or any other valuable thing, and the amount of damages is a question peculiarly appropriate for the determination of the jury----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Rather than overrule this fairly long line of cases awarding damages even in the absence of proof of consequential injury, the Supreme Court in <em>Carey </em>chose to distinguish these cases and expressly to reserve judgment as to their merits. That Court stated clearly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">\u201cMore importantly, the elements and prerequisites for recovery of damages appropriate to compensate injuries caused by the deprivation of one constitutional right are not necessarily appropriate to compensate injuries caused by the deprivation of another. As we have said, these issues must be considered with reference to the nature of the interests protected by the particular constitutional right in question. For this reason, and without intimating an opinion as to their merits, we do not deem the cases relied upon to be controlling.\u201d 435 U.S., at 264-65, 98 S.Ct., at 1052-53 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Since <em>Carey, </em>those courts that have considered the question whether more than nominal damages may be awarded upon proof of a violation of a constitutional right, other than the right to procedural due process, despite the absence of proof of consequential injury, have divided on the issue. In <em>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391 (5th Cir. 1980), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit awarded nominal damages to compensate for a deprivation of First Amendment associational rights. The court explained that this conclusion was mandated by the opinion in <em>Carey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has made abundantly clear in <em>Carey v. Piphus </em>that private plaintiffs suing for violation of rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are entitled to compensatory damages only upon proof of actual injury. Mere proof of the violation of a right will not support such award of damages. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cThe Court in <em>Carey </em>also held, however, that even in the absence of proof of compensable injury, demonstration of a denial of the \u2018absolute\u2019 right to procedural due process required an award of nominal damages not to exceed one dollar. We believe that the rationale of <em>Carey </em>similarly requires an award of nominal damages upon proof of infringement of a fundamental First Amendment liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">In contrast to the Fifth Circuit, several courts since <em>Carey </em>have relied on the two theories of awarding damages employed in the pre-Carey cases (discussed above) and have awarded significant damages to compensate for the deprivation of a constitutional right despite the absence of proof of consequential injury. The courts in these cases have readily distinguished <em>Carey </em>by focusing on the nature of the constitutional right at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">In <em>Herrera v. Valentine, </em>653 F.2d 1220 (8th Cir. 1981), an Indian woman named Yellow Bird brought a \u00a7 1983 action against a city police officer alleging various incidents of mistreatment. At trial, the jury was instructed to award damages for physical harm, emotional and mental suffering, and for the violation of \u201cher substantive constitutional rights to liberty and to due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that Yellow Bird was entitled to recover damages, \u201cindependent of any recovery for actual physical and emotional injury,\u201d for the deprivation of: (1) her Due Process right to be free from the \u201cuse of excessive force;\u201d (2) her Due Process right to medical assistance; (3) her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable arrests and unwarranted intrusions into privacy; and (4) her constitutional right to counsel. The court noted that part of the injury suffered by Yellow Bird was the loss of these rights themselves. \u201cTo secure complete satisfaction, damage awards must take account of the intrinsic dimension that envelopes each substantive constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228. The damages awarded were also held necessary to protect fully the citizenry from the violation of their constitutional rights. \u201cMany substantive constitutional guarantees may be violated without accompanying consequential or actual injury. If consequential injury were the touchstone for substantial compensatory awards, many blatant consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tutional violations would remain unre-dressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228, n. 7.; <em>see also </em>Note, <em>Damage Awards for Constitutional Torts: A Reconsideration After Carey v. Piphus, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. 966, 976-77 &amp; nn. 68-69 (1980) (arguing the inadequacy of, and the lack of logic supporting, a remedial scheme making recovery of damages contingent on proof of actual injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The court in <em>Herrara </em>rejected the assertion that the decision in <em>Carey </em>controlled the case and mandated that Yellow Bird be awarded merely nominal damages. The court stated that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Carey </em>was specifically limited to its facts.\u201d 653 F.2d at 1228. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s warning in <em>Carey </em>that the analysis of the proper damage award may vary depending on the nature of the constitutional right at issue, the Court of Appeals in <em>Her-rara </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cOur aim here is simply to distinguish the substantive rights involved in this case from the right that was involved in <em>Carey. </em>The Court in <em>Carey </em>determined that the <em>procedural </em>right at issue there was nothing more than a mechanical process designed to avoid the mistaken or wrongful infringements of other <em>substantive </em>constitutional guarantees. In this case, by contrast, substantive constitutional rights, highly prized in our federal system of government, are clearly at stake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1230. Stating that \u201c[i]n our view, <em>Carey </em>presents no bar to the recovery of substantial nonpunitive damages for violations of the substantive rights involved in this case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1229 n. 8, the court presumed that Yellow Bird had suffered compensable injury and awarded her damages for the violation of her constitutional rights. <em>See also, Williams v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>660 F.2d 1267, 1272 (8th Cir. 1981) (\u201c[D]amages for emotional harm are to be presumed where there is an infringement of a substantive constitutional right.\u201d). <em>See also Halperin v. Kissinger, </em>606 F.2d 1192, 1207 and n. 100 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>aff\u2019d in part, </em>452 U.S. 713, 101 S.Ct. 3132, 69 L.Ed.2d 367 (1981). (Because the substantive right to be free from unlawful searches was \u201cof a much different character\u201d than the right to procedural due process at issue in <em>Carey, </em>damages should be \u201cinferred from the circumstances\u201d of the case.); <em>Mickens v. Winston, </em>462 F.Supp. 910, 913 (E.D.Va.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>609 F.2d 508 (4th Cir. 1979) (Compensatory damages may be awarded without proof of actual injury since \u201cofficial racial segregation is inherently injurious ... \u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Having aired this issue fully and having alerted the District Court as to the existence and scope of the controversy about it, we decline to attempt to resolve the question at this point. As detailed above, this case must be remanded to the District Court for a determination whether defendant Lash, in his individual capacity, is immune from liability for damages. If the trial court concludes on remand that Lash is immune, there will then be no named defendant in this action who may be held liable for monetary damages \u2014 regardless of the amount of such damages \u2014 and Owen will be denied the recovery of a monetary award. The question of the amount of damages to be awarded to compensate for a violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment protections in the absence of proof of consequential injury may therefore never need to be addressed in this lawsuit. Although the question is likely to be raised once again in this Court at some later date, the Court then facing the issue may have before it different facts and may also have the benefit of the additional precedent and wisdom that often come with the passage of time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The District Court\u2019s decision to award damages against the State violates the Eleventh Amendment and must be reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court to consider whether defendant Lash, in his individual capacity, is protected from personal liability by the doctrine of \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d If the District Court concludes on remand that defendant Lash is not immune, it should then address the question of the appropriate damage award to compensate Owen for the deprivation of substantive constitutional rights in the absence of proof of consequential injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-11\">. Charles E. Moore, the Assistant Warden of the Indiana State Prison, was originally named as a defendant in this suit.

Lash, </em>371 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Ind.1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>514 F.2d 55 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>vacated, 425 U.S. </em>947, 96 S.Ct. <em>1721,48 </em>L.Ed.2d <em>191 </em>(1976), was a class action brought by inmates of the Indiana State Prison challenging conditions in the prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">.

A single act of depriving a citizen of his right to correspond may simultaneously constitute a violation of substantive constitutional rights and of the right to procedural due process. Because the right to correspond is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the <em>result </em>of depriving a citizen of this right will violate those substantive guarantees unless the action is justified by sufficiently compelling, countervailing state interests. At the same time, because the interest in corresponding is a \u201cliberty\u201d interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, the <em>manner </em>of depriving a citizen of this right could violate the procedural norms embodied in the Due Process Clause. <em>See, e.g., Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1973) (analyzing restrictions on a prisoner\u2019s correspondence rights as a violation of both substantive constitutional rights and the right to procedural due process).</p>\n<p id=\"ADdq\">In the present case, however, Owen challenged only the denial of his right to correspond and not the manner in which the decision to impose this restriction was reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">.

Because the trial court failed to focus on the Eleventh Amendment issue, there is no evidence in the record as to whether the Indiana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>State Prison is fully supported by the State, and, therefore, whether this damage award must be paid from the state treasury. However, since both sides concede that the damage award violates the Eleventh Amendment, there is no reason to assume that the state prison is not fully funded by the State. This issue can be addressed on remand if it appears that the question of the prison\u2019s source of funding is in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b709-15\">. Despite the contrary findings and evidence in the record, it is at least conceivable that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that no claim \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>proven\u201d against Lash was actually a factual finding that Lash was in no way involved in or responsible \u2014 by law or in fact \u2014 for the decision to prevent Owen from corresponding with the three people in question. This issue can be addressed further on remand if there appears to be a genuine controversy about it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. The term \u201cconsequential injury\u201d seems preferable to \u201cactual injury\u201d because, depending on the proper answer to the question expressly reserved in this opinion, see <em>infra </em>p. 659, the violation of the substantive constitutional right might itself constitute \u201cactual injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">. For similar reasons, we decline to reach the question, raised by Owen\u2019s counsel, whether a <em>pro se </em>litigant may recover attorney\u2019s fees in a \u00a7 1983 action. Those courts that have considered the issue to date have answered this question in the negative. <em>Cofield v. City of Atlanta, </em>648 F.2d 986, 988 (5th Cir. 1981); Lo-<em>vell v. Snow, </em>637 F.2d 170, 171 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>Davis v. Parratt, </em>608 F.2d 717 (8th Cir. 1979). The Civil Rights Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, permits a court to award the \u201cprevailing party\u201d a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs of an action to enforce a provision of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 1983. Because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>determination of which party is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in this suit can be made until after the remand, the issue of a <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs ability to recover attorney\u2019s fees in a \u00a7 1983 action may never need to be addressed in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">Finally, we need not address Owen\u2019s claim for punitive damages. Obviously, if Owen is barred from recovering compensatory damages, he will similarly be unable to collect punitive damages. Moreover, the factual findings which must be made on remand to answer properly the question of whether Lash is immune from personal liability will greatly clarify the issue of the availability of punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
