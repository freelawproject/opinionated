We agree, and affirm the judgment of District Judge William O. Bertelsman.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">I. BACKGROUND OF THE EDUCATION FOR ALL HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">This action arises under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (\u201cHandicapped Children Act\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq. </em>The Handicapped Children Act was enacted in part to insure the right to a free, appropriate education for all handicapped children. S.Conf.Rep. 94-455, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 27, <em>reprinted in, </em>[1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1425, 1480; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412. Under the Act, every handicapped child must receive an Individualized Educa-</p>\n<p id=\"b650-18\">tion Program (\u201cIEP\u201d), designed specially for that child\u2019s unique educational needs. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-19\">The Handicapped Children Act also provides handicapped children with various procedural protections. These procedural safeguards extend to the identification and any subsequent evaluation of a child as a handicapped person. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A handicapped child\u2019s initial educational placement and any subsequent change in the placement are also governed by these procedural protections. <em>Id. </em>A multi-disciplined group makes or reviews all placement decisions which affect a handicapped child. In Kentucky, the Administrative Admissions and Release Committee (\u201cAARC\u201d) performs this function. <em>See </em>707 Ky.Ad.Reg. 1:051, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\u201cSection 504\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, complements the Handicapped Children Act. Section 504 bars discrimination against handicapped persons by programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. Many of the procedural protections provided in the Handicapped Children Act are also contained in Section 504\u2019s implementing regulations. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84. Specifically, the regulations provide that plenary due process procedures govern the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of a handicapped child. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Plaintiff, Michael Kaelin (\u201cMichael\u201d), was a 15 year old ninth grade student at the Walton-Verona Public Schools during the 1978-79 academic year. He has been identified as a handicapped child since kindergarten. In August 1978, the Walton-Verona High School identified and evaluated Michael as a \u201chandicapped or an exceptional child\u201d. Pursuant to an Individualized Education Program (\u201cIEP\u201d), he was placed in an Educable Mentally Handicapped (\u201cEMH\u201d) classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">On March 13, 1979, Michael defied the authority of his teacher, William C. Daniel (\u201cMr. Daniel\u201d). Michael refused to complete assigned classroom work. He also destroyed a work sheet and one of Mr. Daniel\u2019s coffee cups. Moreover, in attempting to leave the classroom, Michael pushed, kicked and hit Mr. Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-19\">The next day, Michael was suspended from school. On April 17,1979, the Walton-Verona Board of Education (\u201cBoard\u201d) held a hearing concerning Michael\u2019s behavior. The Board did not convene or consult the AARC before or during this hearing. Moreover, the Board did not address the relationship, if any, between Michael\u2019s handicap and his disruptive behavior. On April 18, the Board concluded that Michael had violated Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 158.150<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Walton-Verona Board of Education Policy 609.1. Consequently, the Board expelled Michael from school for the remainder of the 1978-79 school year. This expulsion was effective April 30, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Following his expulsion, Michael, through counsel, requested a due process hearing pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415. He sought this hearing to review the Board\u2019s refusal to convene the AARC prior to his expulsion. However, the Kentucky Superintendent of Public Instruction (\u201cState Superintendent\u201d) and the Head of the Kentucky Bureau for Exceptional Children (\u201cExceptional Children Bureau Head\u201d) denied his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Michael filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky alleging that he was a handicapped child within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act. He named as defendants the Superintendent of the District (\u201cDistrict Superintendent\u201d), and the chairman and members of the Board, in their official and individual capacities. The State Superintendent and the Exceptional Children Bureau Head were also named as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Michael alleged that the defendants violated the Handicapped Children Act, Section 504, and the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He also alleged that Kentucky\u2019s expulsion statute, Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 158.150,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague. In an amended complaint, Michael claimed that any Kentucky statute or regulation authorizing expulsions in contravention of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 is constitutionally invalid. A supplemental complaint sought, <em>inter alia, </em>to expunge all records of his expulsion until a due process hearing was conducted pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">The district court entered judgment for Michael. The court held that: 1) Michael\u2019s expulsion constituted a change of placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act; 2) the defendants did not provide a due process hearing for Michael within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act; and 3) the procedures used to expel Michael violated the change of placement procedures of the Handicapped Children Act, and of 707 Ky.Ad.Reg. 1:051.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court issued an injunction requiring the District Superintendent and the Board to expunge the record of Michael\u2019s expulsion from the Board\u2019s minutes and from his attendance record. Moreover, the maintenance of any other record concerning Michael\u2019s expulsion was also enjoined. The defendants perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">In this case, Michael was expelled without receiving the procedural protections afforded by the Handicapped Children Act and Section 504\u2019s implementing regulations. The Board did not address the relationship between Michael\u2019s disruptive behavior and his handicap. Moreover, the AARC was not convened before or during the Board\u2019s expulsion hearing. In addition, the State Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>perintendent and the Exceptional Children Bureau Head refused Michael\u2019s request to convene the AARC following his expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">It is undisputed that Michael is a handicapped child within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the defendants argue that the procedure used to expel Michael was proper because an expulsion is not a change in placement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Michael contends that the Handicapped Children Act\u2019s procedural protections applied because an expulsion constitutes a change in placement. The sole issue on appeal, therefore, is whether an expulsion is a change in educational placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">The defendants\u2019 argument that an expulsion is not a change in placement ignores a well-reasoned opinion from the Fifth Circuit. In <em>S-1 </em>v. <em>Turlington, </em>635 F.2d 342 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1030, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>S.Ct. 566, 70 L.Ed.2d 473 (1981), the plaintiff school children were mentally handicapped. These plaintiffs were expelled from school for alleged misconduct without receiving the procedural protections required by the Handicapped Children Act, Section 504, and its implementing regulations. The court held that \u201can expulsion must be accompanied by a determination as to whether the handicapped student\u2019s misconduct bears a relationship to his handicap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346. The state and local school authorities have the burden of determining whether a student\u2019s misconduct is a manifestation of the student\u2019s handicap. <em>Id. </em>at 349. The court did not hold, however, that handicapped children could never be expelled from school. Rather, \u201cexpulsion is still a proper disciplinary tool under the [Handicapped Children Act] and section 504 when proper procedures are utilized and under proper circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. Unlike the expulsion of a non-handicapped child, however, \u201cthe complete cessation of educational services during an expulsion period\u201d could not be authorized for a handicapped child. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The court in <em>Turlington </em>also addressed the issue of whether an expulsion is a change in placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act. The court held that \u201ca termination of educational services, occasioned by an expulsion, is a change in educational placement, thereby invoking the procedural protections of the [Handicapped Children Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The court noted that neither the Handicapped Children Act, Section 504, nor its implementing regulations provided any guidance on this-issue. Instead, the court found the reasoning of <em>Stuart v. Nappi, </em>443 F.Supp. 1235 (D.Conn.1978); <em>Sherry v. New York State Education Department, </em>479 F.Supp. 1328 (W.D.N.Y.1979); and <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. 225 (N.D.Ind.1979), persuasive support for its holding that an expulsion is a change in educational placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><em>Stuart v. Nappi, </em>443 F.Supp. 1235, is the seminal case which addresses this issue. The plaintiff, a high school student with complex learning disabilities, limited intelligence, and a history of behavioral problems, was suspended from school following her involvement in several school-wide disturbances. She contested a recommendation that she be expelled, requested a hearing and sought review of her special education program. The court enjoined the school board from conducting a hearing to expel the plaintiff. The court reasoned that the Handicapped Children Act prescribed a procedure for transferring disruptive children. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.522. Only a professional team analogous to Kentucky\u2019s AARC could change a handicapped child\u2019s placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The court noted that there was a conflict between the procedures required by the Handicapped Children Act and the disciplinary procedures of the local school. The court, however, relied upon a comment contained in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">While the placement may not be changed [after a complaint proceeding has been initiated], this does not preclude a school from using its normal procedures for dealing with children who are endangering themselves or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The court interpreted this regulation and the Handicapped Children Act as prohibiting disciplinary measures which effectively change a handicapped child\u2019s placement. The court also reasoned that the \u201cright to an education in the least restrictive environment may be circumvented if schools are permitted to expel handicapped children.\u201d Id. at 1242. Therefore, the court concluded that the \u201cuse of expulsion proceedings as a means of changing the placement of a disruptive handicapped child contravenes the procedures of the [Handicapped Children Act]\u201d Id. at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The court in Stuart <em>v. Nappi, </em>however, did not hold that handicapped children were immune from school discipline. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">Handicapped children are neither immune from a school\u2019s disciplinary process nor are they entitled to participate in programs when their behavior impairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the education of other children in the program. First, school authorities can take swift disciplinary measures, such as suspension, against disruptive handicapped children. Secondly, a [special education committee] can request a change in the placement of handicapped children who have demonstrated that their present placement is inappropriate by disrupting the education of other children. The Handicapped Act thereby affords schools with both short-term and long-term methods of dealing with handicapped children who are behavioral problems. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. 225, the plaintiff, a mentally handicapped student, was expelled for disciplinary reasons. The plaintiff requested and was denied a special hearing used in the placement of handicapped students. The court held that the language of the Handicapped Children Act and the accompanying regulations indicated clearly that the Act was intended to limit a school\u2019s right to expel handicapped students. The court noted that neither 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 nor any of the accompanying regulations provide for the expulsion of handicapped students. Moreover, schools were not to expel students whose handicaps caused them to be disruptive. Instead, the schools were to appropriately place these students in a more restrictive environment. Therefore, the court concluded that a handicapped child could not be expelled if his handicap caused his disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Like the courts in <em>Turlington </em>and <em>Stuart v. Nappi, </em>however, the court in <em>Roger </em>did not hold that the Handicapped Children Act prohibits the disciplining of disruptive handicapped children. The court noted that 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 does not prohibit the expulsion of handicapped children. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">For an appropriately placed handicapped child, expulsion is just as available as for any other child. Between a handicapped child and any other child, the distinction is that, unlike any other disruptive child, before a disruptive handicapped child can be expelled, it must be determined whether the handicap is the cause of the child\u2019s propensity to disrupt. <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. at 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The court concluded that the Handicapped Children Act\u2019s change of placement procedures should be followed in determining whether the child\u2019s handicap caused the disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">In <em>Sherry v. New York State Education Dept., </em>479 F.Supp. 1328, the plaintiff was a legally blind, deaf student who suffered from brain damage and an emotional disorder which caused her to act in a self-abusive manner. As a result of this self-abusive behavior, she was hospitalized and subsequently suspended indefinitely from the New York State School for the Blind. The court held that the indefinite suspension was a change of educational placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act. The court relied upon the comment in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a, the same comment which the <em>Stuart v. Nappi </em>court found persuasive. However, the court in <em>Sherry </em>concluded that the regulation did not permit the procedural protections of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 to be ignored when a temporary, emergency response to a handicapped student\u2019s behavior becomes a change in placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">In this case, the defendants argue that Kentucky\u2019s expulsion statute, Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 158.150, applies with equal force to handicapped and non-handicapped children. Specifically, they argue that the holdings in <em>Turlington; Doe v. Roger; Stuart v. Nappi</em>; and <em>Sherry </em>create a double standard for student conduct. Handicapped children will be entitled to commit disruptive acts with impunity while a non-handicapped child would be punished for \"the same action. We disagree. We adopt the analysis contained in <em>Turlington. </em>Accordingly, we hold that an expulsion from school is a change in placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Under the <em>Turlington </em>analysis, a handicapped child is not totally immunized from disciplinary action by the Handicapped Children Act, Section 504, or supporting case law which holds that an expulsion is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>change in placement. First, it is well-settled that a handicapped child may be suspended temporarily without employing the procedures in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415. <em>Stuart v. Nappi, </em>443 F.Supp. at 1242; <em>Sherry, </em>479 F.Supp. at 1337; <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. at 229. Second, as long as the procedural protections of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 are followed, a handicapped child may be expelled in appropriate circumstances. <em>Turlington, </em>635 F.2d at 348; <em>H. R. v. Hornbeck, </em>524 F.Supp. 215, 219 (D.Md.1981); <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. at 229. A handicapped child may not be expelled, however, if his disruptive behavior was a manifestation of his handicap. <em>Turlington, </em>635 F.2d at 348; <em>Doe v. Roger, </em>480 F.Supp. at 229. Moreover, even during the expulsion period there may not be a complete cessation of educational services. <em>Turlington, </em>635 F.2d at 348. Therefore, handicapped children can generally be disciplined in the same manner as nonhandicapped children. Only the procedural safeguards for removing a handicapped child are affected by our conclusion that an expulsion is a change in educational placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The defendants contend that this approach to disciplining handicapped children creates an artificial distinction between expulsions and suspensions. We disagree. Requiring state and local officials to follow the procedural protections of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 for expulsions, but not suspensions vindicates two important policy interests. First, school officials still retain the authority to control violent or anti-social behavior of handicapped children. These students may be suspended temporarily as long as they receive the procedural protections of <em>Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. </em>729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, one of the principal features of the Handicapped Children Act is the concept of individualized educational planning for handicapped children. This concept would be eviscerated if school officials could expel handicapped children using traditional expulsion procedures. Following the procedures of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, however, preserves individualized education planning for the handicapped child. The AARC can address the important questions of whether the child\u2019s disruptive behavior is a manifestation of his handicap and whether the child\u2019s educational placement should be changed. Consequently, our holding that an expulsion is a change of placement within the meaning of the Handicapped Children Act strikes a delicate balance between the special educational needs of handicapped children and the need of school officials to discipline disruptive children. Accordingly, we affirm the well-reasoned judgment of District Judge William O. Bertelsman.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 provides in pertinent part: \u00a7 1415.

Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), the Supreme Court held that students facing a 10-day suspension for disciplinary reasons have property and liberty interests under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, the court held that \u201cdue process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 739. The court noted that \u201c[t]here need be no delay between the time \u2018notice\u2019 is given and the time of the hearing\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 582, 95 S.Ct. at 740. As a general rule, however, \u201cnotice and hearing should precede removal of the student from school.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9x\">The Due Process Clause also applies to expulsions of students from tax-supported educational institutions. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. at 576 n.8, 95 S.Ct. at 737 n.8, and the cases cited therein. Therefore, handicapped children have a constitutional' right to procedural due process independent of the due process rights provided in the Handicapped Children Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
