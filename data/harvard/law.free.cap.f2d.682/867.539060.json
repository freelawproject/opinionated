The Company refused to bargain with the Wholesale Delivery Drivers and Salesmen Local 848, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Amer-ica, contending, in defense of the alleged violation of section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) (1976), that the use of a student legal assistant as a hearing officer in the representation hearing rendered certification improper. We enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">A hearing may be conducted by an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d of the regional office. National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 9(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c)(1) (1976). Normally, a hearing officer will be an attorney or field examiner but may be another qualified official. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.20 (1981). The hearing officer makes no findings or recommendations. His function is to insure that the record contains the pertinent facts necessary for determination of the case by the Regional Director. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.64 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Respondent does not question the fact that a student assistant is an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the statute. There is nothing in the record which would permit us to conclude that the individual designated as a hearing officer by the regional director was unqualified to perform that function or that the regional director did not consider the individual\u2019s qualifications before he selected him to serve as a hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Nevertheless, the job description for student assistant indicates that their duties include, among other things, \u201c[ajttending, for information purposes, .. . hearings conducted in representation cases.\u201d Thus, it is evident that the job description does not contemplate that a student assistant will ordinarily conduct a representation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">While we believe that, under the circumstances of this case, the order must be enforced, we are troubled by the inconsistency between the job description and the job assignment. If the Board intends to permit student assistants to conduct representation hearings in the future, it would be well advised to modify its present job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">As to the Company\u2019s remaining contention, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings that the Company chemist was a supervisor, and that the two inventory control workers were office clerical workers. <em>NLRB v. Big Three Industries, Inc., </em>602 F.2d 898 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, their exclusion from the bargaining unit was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">The order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
