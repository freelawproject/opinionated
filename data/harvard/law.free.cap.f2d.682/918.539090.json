The Board found that Brewton had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by interrogating its employees about their union activities, by creating the impression of surveillance of those union activities, and by threatening its employees with discharge because they engaged in such activities. The Board also found violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(3) and (1), in the discharge of two employees, Kathleen Chavers and Grace Boozer, for their protected, concerted activities. We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">Brewton Fashions manufactures women\u2019s blouses in Brewton, Alabama. In 1963, the Board found the company in violation of the NLRA by discriminatorily discharging ten employees, one of whom was Kathleen Chavers. The employees were later reinstated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">Since 1978, Brewton has pursued a campaign to improve the efficiency of its plant. Some jobs were abolished, and certain tasks were consolidated within the remaining job descriptions. In March 1979, Kathleen Chavers was informed that in addition to her duties as a trimmer in the cutting room, she would have to push a cart loaded with her finished material into the sewing room. She pushed the loaded cart on one occasion, but then complained that it was too heavy and that she was unable to perform the task alone. Subsequently, a fellow employee, Grace Boozer, volunteered to help Chav-ers push the cart to the sewing room, and together they unloaded its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">On March 30, Plant Manager Robert Bays called Chavers and Boozer to his office and inquired why they refused to do their assigned work, i.e., pushing and unloading the cart individually. Both employees told Bays that they were physically unable to push the cart alone. Bays reprimanded Chavers and Boozer and told them to think about the matter over the week end. He gave them a choice of either performing the job as directed or not returning to work at all on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Chavers and Boozer reported to work on Monday, April 2, but continued to push the cart together. Later that day, they were again called into Bays\u2019s office and asked whether they intended to perform the job separately. Both employees responded, as before, that they were physically unable to do the work as directed. After some discussion, the Vice-President of Manufacturing, James Byrd, joined the meeting. There is some dispute over what actually transpired during the rest of the meeting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it is agreed that Chavers and Boozer continued after March 30 to push the cart together despite the repeated requests of their immediate supervisor, Charles Hawkins, to push it alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">During April, 1979, another employee, Louise English, contacted the union through the aid of Kathleen Chavers, and on April 17 a union<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> representative arrived at Brewton to begin an organizational drive. Brewton admitted that it was aware in April of the union\u2019s activities and that it knew Chavers and Boozer were involved with the union at that time. During this period, Supervisor Hawkins had a discussion with Grace Boozer about the union. He told her that the union had closed the plant where he had worked in Mississippi. Boozer replied that she did not believe that the union would close the company\u2019s plant in Brewton. Hawkins concluded the conversation with the remark, \u201cWell, it will close the plant for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">On April 23, Chavers and Boozer met with vice-president Byrd in his office and again protested that they were physically unable to push the cart alone. Byrd responded by telling the two employees that he did not care how they worked the job out, but that Chavers and Boozer had to do the job as it was outlined, which meant pushing the cart individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Another Brewton employee, Helen Pugh, spoke with Mr. Byrd in his office on April 25. Byrd told Pugh that he had heard that she had been seen passing out \u201crecipe cards.\u201d He further stated that they had \u201ca girl that would testify in court that you were passing out recipe cards during working hours.\u201d Tr. 141. Pugh admitted to passing out <em>union </em>cards but stated that this had been done before working hours. She also mentioned that she had been with the union before and knew that she could lose her job for distributing union cards on company time. Byrd agreed, saying \u201cyou\u2019re right, you could,\u201d and \u201cwe don't want [the union] down here, we don\u2019t need it and we don\u2019t intend to have it.\u201d Tr. 142. Pugh had worked for Brewton for seven years, but this was the first time she had ever been called to the vice-president\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Around May 3, Byrd held a meeting in his office with employees from each section of the company. He discussed such topics as plant production and hospital insurance. During the discussion, one employee commented that if the employees had had a union, they would have had a retirement plan. Byrd responded by stating that \u201cthe union is really not interested in getting you a retirement plan.\u201d Tr. 315. He then reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a flyer which had printed on it the words, \u201cDon\u2019t Buy Judy Bond Blouses.\u201d After that, Byrd told the employees that \u201cyou think someone[,] a union would want to give you insurance and help you when they are saying don\u2019t buy Judy Bond blouses.\u201d Tr. 316. Byrd admitted, however, that the flyer had been printed at least 16 years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Byrd made a speech over the plant\u2019s public address system sometime in June, 1979, in which he complimented the employees on their job performance during the first six months of the year. He then proceeded to relate that some people had asked him \u201chow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>to get rid of some strangers that were coming to their house.\u201d Tr. 313. Byrd informed the employees that they did not have to permit anyone to enter, their homes whom they did not wish to be there. He further told the employees that anyone allowed to enter could be asked to leave and, if anyone refused, the employee could contact the sheriff or police department. Byrd mentioned that he had been advised that some employees were complaining about strangers visiting their homes and staying until 11:00 at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">On June 18, 1979, Chavers and Boozer were called into the plant manager\u2019s office and were terminated when they once again refused to push the cart alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The Board found that Brewton Fashions had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act and ordered reinstatement of the discharged employees and other remedial measures. The company, in opposition to enforcement of the Board\u2019s order, argues that the finding of the Board that Brewton Fashions violated \u00a7 8(a)(1), based on comments contained in a single conversation between vice-president Byrd and Helen Pugh, is not supported by substantial evidence on the record. It also contends that Brewton Fashions lawfully terminated Chavers and Boozer and that the Board\u2019s findings that these terminations violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) are not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cinterfere with, restrain or coerce\u201d employees in the exercise of their right of, <em>inter alia, </em>self-organization under \u00a7 7 of the Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. A violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) occurs when an employer\u2019s questions, threats, or statements tend to be coercive and not only when the employees are in fact coerced. <em>TRW-United Greenfield Division v. N. L. R. B., </em>637 F.2d 410, 415 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>596 F.2d 1295, 1309 (5th Cir. 1979). The coercive nature of an employer\u2019s conduct is to be determined in light of all the circumstances surrounding that particular instance of conduct. TRW<em>\u2014U</em>nited <em>Greenfield Division v. N.L.R.B., supra, </em>637 F.2d at 415-16; <em>N.L.R.B. v. Laredo Coca Cola Bottling Co., </em>613 F.2d 1338, 1342 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 889, 101 S.Ct. 246, 66 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980). On this basis, we examine the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations found by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The Board found that vice-president Byrd\u2019s conversation of April 25 with Helen Pugh constituted illegal interrogation. Employer interviews or interrogations of employees are not <em>per se </em>violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1). <em>TRW, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>654 F.2d 307, 314 (5th Cir. 1981). An interrogation becomes illegal only when \u201cthe words themselves or the context in which they are used . .. suggest an element of coercion or interference.\u201d <em>Delco-Remy Div., General Motors Corp., supra, </em>596 F.2d at 1309 (quoting from <em>N.L.R.B. v. Weingarten, Inc., </em>339 F.2d 498, 500 (5th Cir. 1964)). We often consider a number of factors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in determining whether the interrogation in question tends to be coercive. A proper evaluation of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>dence, however, requires more than merely examining a list of factors since \u201c[i]ntimidation may occur even if all factors cut in favor of the employer.\u201d <em>Sturgis Newport Business </em>Forms, <em>Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>563 F.2d 1252, 1256 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Here, we are presented with a situation in which the vice-president of manufacturing called an employee into his office ostensibly to discuss whether she had been distributing \u201crecipe\u201d cards during working hours. This was the first time Helen Pugh had ever been asked to report to Mr. Byrd\u2019s office during her seven years of employment with Brewton. The Board was within its rights in finding that the purpose of the conversation was to elicit information from Pugh on whether she had been passing out <em>union </em>cards. Pugh admitted that she had been distributing union cards but stated that it was not done on company time. She also stated that she was aware she could lose her job for passing out union cards during working hours. Byrd confirmed Pugh\u2019s understanding of company policy on distributing union cards and then voiced his general opposition to the union\u2019s presence at Brewton Fashions. The Board found that Byrd\u2019s comments on Pugh\u2019s possibly losing her job because of union activity constituted a threat of discharge. We conclude that the context in which Byrd\u2019s comments were made, including his statement of opposition to the union, support this specific finding of the Board and the overall finding of illegal interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The comments of Byrd to Pugh during their conversation of April 25 were also found by the Board to create the impression of surveillance. \u201cCreating the impression of surveillance of union activity can be as coercive as actual surveillance and, therefore, constitute an unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Anchorage Times Publishing Co., </em>637 F.2d 1359, 1366 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 835, 102 S.Ct. 137, 70 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980). The impression of surveillance was created by Byrd\u2019s statements that he had heard that Pugh had been seen passing out \u201crecipe\u201d cards and that the company had \u201ca girl that would testify in court that [Pugh was] passing out recipe cards during working hours.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In view of all the circumstances surrounding these comments, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Brewton Fashions violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">We next review the evidence on the discharges of Brewton employees Grace Boozer and Kathleen Chavers. The Board found these discharges to constitute unfair labor practices under both \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act. Section 8(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-10\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-11\">(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">This provision is supplemented by \u00a7 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), which authorizes the Board to take remedial action but with the limitation that \u201c[n]o order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"azd-dedup-0\">Brewton Fashions argues that Chavers and Boozer were lawfully terminated for refusing to perform their work as directed. The refusal of the two employees to push the cart separately, the company contends, justified their discharge. The Board found, however, that \u25a0 Brewton\u2019s asserted basis for the employees\u2019 termination was pretextual, and that Chavers\u2019s and Boozer\u2019s discharges were the result of their \u201cunion and protected, concerted activities.\u201d Substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Chavers and Boozer were discharged at a time when Brewton\u2019s opposition to the presence of the union at the plant had become clearly evident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Beginning with its initial knowledge of the union\u2019s organizational efforts in April 1979, the company, through its officials, expressed its displeasure on a number of occasions at the possibility of a union at its Brewton plant. The April conversation that Supervisor Charles Hawkins had with Boozer presented the first evidence of the company\u2019s opposition to the union. Hawkins told Boozer of a union\u2019s closing the plant where he had worked in Mississippi and further stated to her that \u201c[the union] will close the plant for you.\u201d The Board found that Hawkins had threatened Boozer with closure of the plant if the union came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Vice-president Byrd\u2019s comment to Helen Pugh on April 25 is further evidence of Brewton\u2019s anti-union sentiments. His statement that \u201cwe don\u2019t want [the union] down here, we don\u2019t need it, and we don\u2019t intend to have it,\u201d clearly illustrates the company\u2019s opposition to union activity. Tr. 142. Byrd made other statements over the next two months that reinforced the company\u2019s position on the union\u2019s organizational efforts. In a meeting of plant employees in his office around May 3, he criticized the union, contending that it was not really interested in establishing a retirement plan for employees, and implied that the union sought to close the company, using an outdated union flyer as an example. Byrd\u2019s speech in June over the plant\u2019s public-address system provides further evidence of anti-union animus. His remarks concerning handling \u201cstrangers\u201d visiting the homes of plant employees were obvious references to the union\u2019s attempts at organizing workers at Brewton.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Chavers and Boozer were terminated on June 18, after most, if not all, of these incidents occurred. The Board found that the timing of the employees\u2019 discharge rendered the company\u2019s motive suspect, particularly considering Brewton\u2019s awareness of Chavers\u2019s and Boozer\u2019s active involvement with the union and the fact that the two employees were first reprimanded for refusal to push the cart separately on March 30, nearly three months earlier. See <em>N.L.R.B. v. J. W. Mortell Co., </em>440 F.2d 455 (7th Cir. 1971). Brewton Fashions offers a different explanation for its termination of Chavers and Boozer on June 18. It argues that plant management made a conscious decision to permit the two employees to continue working at Brewton in the hope that their supervisor, Charles Hawkins, would succeed in persuading them to perform the job as directed. The company\u2019s position is not without support in the record. See Tr. 264-66. Brewton also contends that its final decision to discharge Chavers and Boozer came only after two other employees had complained about the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d accorded Chavers and Boozer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not deny that the evidence presents a close question; however, \u201cthe Board is not required to establish substantial evidence that conduct is motivated <em>solely </em>by anti-union animus. It is sufficient if substantial evidence shows that the force of anti-union purpose was <em>\u2018reasonably equal\u2019 </em>to the lawful motive prompting conduct,\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Aero Corp., supra, </em>581 F.2d at 514-15 (emphasis ours), and that discharge would not have occurred in the absence of protected activity. We conclude that the Board has met that standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The Board also found that Chavers and Boozer had engaged in protected, concerted activity in protesting the company\u2019s demand that they push the cart separately. The Administrative Law Judge in his opinion, which was adopted by the Board, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>There is no evidence which would demonstrate that Boozer or Chavers was insincere in their [sic] asserted belief that they [sic] would be hurt physically by pushing the cart alone. Each is a relatively small, middle aged woman and each had experienced serious health problems before the spring of 1979. The fully loaded cart weighed between 300 and 700 pounds and the wheels of the cart was [sic] often clogged by lint and material as it was pushed across the floor. Boozer and Chavers acted in concert when they went to Mr. Byrd on April 23, and protested that the job of pushing the cart alone was too much for either of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">R. 344 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Brewton Fashions contends that no protected activity was involved because the employees\u2019 conduct was to obtain an unlawful objective, was personal to Chavers and Boozer, and was not part of a group action. The company argues that the employees\u2019 refusal to push the cart separately was an effort to force Brewton to define jobs based on sexual stereotypes and therefore unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). See <em>Pond v. Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 161, 166 (5th Cir. 1974). This argument is based on evidence that Grace Boozer stated to Mr. Byrd that pushing the cart was \u201ctoo heavy for a woman\u201d and that it was \u201ca man\u2019s job.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These statements are, however, open to a different interpretation and actually may be supportive of the Board\u2019s findings. No evidence suggests that Chavers and Boozer had anything other than a genuine, good-faith belief that they would be physically injured by pushing the cart alone. And it may reasonably be inferred from her statements that Boozer believed that such work would be injurious to most women at the plant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So the employees\u2019 conduct may not have been purely personal to them. In addition, the fact that their conduct involved only two employees does not preclude it from being deemed concerted activity. See <em>N.L.R.B. v. C. J. Krehbiel Co., </em>593 F.2d 262 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Modem Carpet Industries, </em>611 F.2d 811 (10th Cir. 1979) (actions of three employees constituted concerted activity). We conclude that the Board\u2019s finding that Chavers and Boozer had engaged in protected, concerted activity is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Finally, the Board determined that Chav-ers and Boozer were treated differently from other Brewton employees who had also refused to push the cart alone. This finding was based on evidence that, in 1978, prior to the commencement of union organizing at the plant, employees Mary Nelson, Lois Hart, and Maxine Cunningham, were each asked to push the loaded cart alone, and each refused the request. None of these employees was disciplined as a result of her refusal to perform the job. Tr. 154-56. In addition, Louise English, who was also employed as a trimmer and bundler, was asked by plant manager Robert Bays, on the day Chavers and Boozer were discharged, if she wanted the job of pushing the cart. She declined, stating that her asthmatic condition prevented her from performing such strenuous work.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> English was neither disciplined nor terminated because of her refusal. Tr. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Brewton Fashions argues that there was no disparate treatment of Chavers and Boozer because none of the other named employees was similarly situated to them. The company notes that Nelson, Hart, and Cunningham were asked to push the carts in 1978, <em>before </em>the reorganization <em>o\u00ed </em>jobs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the cutting room. None of these employees was assigned the particular task; they were simply offered the work because of a reduction in overall plant workload at the time.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Tr. 154-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The company contends that Louise English was not similarly situated to Chavers and Boozer because she was not employed as a trimmer on June 18, when the two employees were terminated and, therefore, the request to push the cart was not a specific assignment of the job. Tr. 170. Additionally, the company argues that if it had wanted to terminate union activists it could have terminated English on the same alleged pretext as Chavers and Boozer. English initiated the union organizing drive, and Brewton claims that it was aware of her activities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">These arguments have some merit. The Board\u2019s finding here, as with many of its other findings, is obviously not supported by everything in the record. It may be that, presented with such fairly conflicting views, this Court would have made a different choice had the case been before us as triers of fact. In situations such as this, however, we may not displace the Board\u2019s choice with our own. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Aero Corp., supra, </em>581 F.2d at 514. We conclude that the Board\u2019s determination that Chavers and Boozer were disparately treated was supported by substantial, although not uncontradicted, evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">We hold that the findings of the Board that Brewton Fashions committed unfair labor practices are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and the Board\u2019s entire order is therefore ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-21\">.

Pugh\u2019s testimony that she had been distributing union cards <em>before </em>working hours was un-rebutted by the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b977-7\">. We specifically note, lest there be any misunderstanding, that Brewton may dislike the union as much as it pleases and may use every legitimate means of keeping a union out of its plant. What it may not do is discharge an employee because of her union or other protected, concerted activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">. There was evidence that employees Georgia Little and Jessie Mae Wilson had complained to James Byrd about Chavers\u2019s and Boozer\u2019s jointly transporting the carts.

Robert Bays testified that Ms. Boozer said to \u2022 Mr. Byrd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">Well, Mr. Byrd, . . ., I never have been for this women\u2019s lib[.] I never believed in it and I still believe that it\u2019s too heavy for me to do.

This testimony is uncontested; Ms. Boozer did not deny using those words. Tr. 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b978-12\">. There was evidence that, at the Brewton plant, pushing the carts had been a task assigned, in the past, primarily to men. Tr. 28. Men also pushed the cart after Chavers and Boozer were terminated.
