It is clear to us that Morgan\u2019s plea of guilty was voluntary and that it was not based on a misunderstanding of the plea agreement which served as the basis for the plea. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>are moreover convinced that his sentence was not augmented by the court because it was incorrectly informed as to the quantities of cocaine involved in the transaction for which Morgan was convicted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
