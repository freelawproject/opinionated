Plaintiff was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis in both cases \u201cconditioned upon the payment of the filing fee in the amount of $60.00 (sixty) dollars in equal monthly installments . ... \u201d In the section 1983 case, the monthly installment was set at $10; in the federal case, $15. The orders granting such pauper status stated, \u201cFailure to submit the installment payments in a timely fashion will result in dismissal of this cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">After plaintiff failed to make his first two payments in the section 1983 case, plaintiff\u2019s case was dismissed without prejudice to reinstatement upon payment of the amount of installments in arrears. In the federal case, plaintiff immediately challenged the monthly installment plan. He took an appeal from both decisions. We consolidated these appeals for review and granted plaintiff leave to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">We reverse since we find no authority for this \u201cpay as you go\u201d approach to paying the docket fee. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) provides a fair measure of latitude for limited grants of pauper status. For example, the district court may grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis for all of the district court proceedings and the entire appeals process. Alternatively, its leave to proceed may be limited to the \u201ccommencement, prosecution or defense\u201d of the proceedings in the trial court. <em>Id. </em>There is, however, no provision for the novel installment plan applied in this case. The district court\u2019s inquiry on a litigant\u2019s indigence should be made after an examination of his ability to pay the entire docket fee at the time of his application for pauper status.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">For these reasons, we reverse and remand for a de novo determination of plaintiff\u2019s indigence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\">. The district court apparently found that plaintiffs claims were non-frivolous, the second test for the grant of leave to proceed in forma pauperis. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d); <em>Wartman v. Milwaukee County Court, </em>510 F.2d 130 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
