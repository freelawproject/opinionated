The trial court denied the motion and the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed on the previously unconsidered ground that the motion was a tactic to delay the start of trial. The United States District Court denied Fritz\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his motion to defend pro se was untimely. We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">In April 1975, Fritz was charged by the state of Washington with armed robbery. He jumped bail, but was rearrested in Florida and extradited to Washington in October 1976. He was scheduled to stand trial in December 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">Four days before the scheduled trial, Fritz\u2019s attorney moved to withdraw as counsel, explaining that he and Fritz could not agree on a defense strategy. The trial court granted the motion and appointed a public defender (Olson). Trial was rescheduled for February 2, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-21\">Thirty days before the February trial, Fritz moved to represent himself, asserting that Olson had not begun to prepare a defense. Olson and Fritz then met, and Fritz withdrew the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-22\">On the morning of the afternoon trial, Olson moved to withdraw as counsel and to allow Fritz to represent himself. Olson stated that he and Fritz had \u201ca very honest open disagreement and fundamental difference\u201d about the defense, and that both had previously believed their differences had been resolved. Olson and Fritz explained that Fritz wanted to defend on the ground of temporary insanity, while Olson intended to show that Fritz lacked the requisite intent to rob.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-23\">Olson moved alternatively for a 2-3 day continuance to locate a witness necessary to the \u201cintent\u201d defense. The state opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the continuance on the ground that it was having difficulty keeping track of its witnesses and that Fritz had already delayed trial by jumping bail and fighting extradition. After a hearing, the presiding judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">That afternoon, before the trial judge, Olson renewed his motion to withdraw. After further hearing, the trial judge denied the motion on the ground \u201cthat the defendant is not capable of knowingly, understandingly, and intelligently waiving counsel in the cause herein, nor is he competent to act as his own counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Fritz was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the Washington Court of Appeals held that Fritz was competent to defend himself, but affirmed the denial of his motion on the previously unconsidered ground that it was a tactic \u201cto delay his scheduled trial and obstruct the orderly course of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Fritz, </em>21 Wash.App. 354, 365, 585 P.2d 173, 180 (1978). The Washington Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Fritz then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and moved for an evidentiary hearing. After review of the state court record, a federal magistrate concluded that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary, and that Fritz\u2019s motion for self-representation on the morning of trial was untimely because it would have resulted in delay. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and denied habe-as relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The constitutional right of self-representation, recognized in <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), must be timely asserted. <em>United States v. Kizer, </em>569 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 976, 98 S.Ct. 1626, 56 L.Ed.2d 71 (1978). \u201cA defendant must [however] have a last clear chance to assert his constitutional right ... before meaningful trial proceedings have commenced.\u201d <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>553 F.2d 886, 895 (5th Cir. 1977). Thus, a motion to proceed pro se is timely if made before the jury is empaneled, unless it is shown to be a tactic to secure delay. <em>Maxwell v. Sumner, </em>673 F.2d 1031, 1036 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Chapman, </em>553 F.2d at 893-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Fritz asserted his <em>Faretta </em>right on the morning of an afternoon trial, before any trial proceedings had begun. It was therefore timely as a matter of law, unless it was made for the purpose of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">The district court made no finding of <em>purpose </em>to delay. Rather, in ruling that Fritz\u2019s motion was untimely, the court relied solely on the <em>effect </em>of delay. The court reasoned that Fritz would have needed a continuance to prepare his insanity defense, and that the resulting delay, in the wake of prior delays, would have prejudiced the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Delay per se is not a sufficient ground for denying a defendant\u2019s constitutional right of self-representation. Any motion to proceed pro se that is made on the morning of trial is likely to cause delay; a defendant may nonetheless have bona fide reasons for not asserting his right until that time, <em>see Chapman, </em>553 F.2d at 888-89, and he may not be deprived of that right absent an affirmative showing of <em>purpose </em>to secure delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s request to defend himself is a tactic to secure delay, the court may, of course, consider the effect of delay. A showing that a continuance would be required and that the resulting delay would prejudice the prosecution may be evidence of a defendant\u2019s dilatory intent. In this case, for example, where Fritz\u2019s pre-trial conduct had already caused substantial delay, a showing that his motion included a request for a continuance would be strong evidence of a purpose to delay. The inquiry, however, does not stop there. The court must also examine the events preceding the motion, to determine whether they are consistent with a good faith assertion of the <em>Faretta </em>right and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>whether the defendant could reasonably be expected to have made the motion at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Because the district court\u2019s inquiry was too narrow, and was based on an apparent misapprehension of the timeliness rule, we remand for a determination of whether Fritz\u2019s motion was a tactic to delay the start of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The district court also denied Fritz\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing, on the ground that the state-court record amply supports a finding of untimeliness. Because the district court applied an incorrect legal standard of timeliness, it did not determine whether the state-court record supports a finding of purpose to delay. After review of the state-court record, we conclude that Fritz is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the Supreme Court held that a habeas petitioner has a right to an evidentiary hearing in federal court, if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reasoning that the opportunity for federal redress of an alleged constitutional violation \u201cpresupposes the opportunity to be heard [and] to argue and present evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 312, 83 S.Ct. at 756, the Court concluded that \u201cin every case in which the state court has not after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts,\u201d the federal habeas court has a duty to try the facts anew. <em>Id. </em>at 318, 83 S.Ct. at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The state appellate court, relying on evidence in the trial court record, made a finding of purpose to secure delay. 21 Wash.App. at 365, 585 P.2d at 180. We recognize that findings by state appellate courts, as well as state trial courts, are entitled to deference in a federal habeas proceeding. <em>See Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 545-48, 101 S.Ct. 764, 767-69, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1980). If, however, the material facts were not adequately developed in state court, or the state-court hearing was otherwise deficient, no deference is warranted, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(3) &amp; 2254(d)(6), and the petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court. <em>Townsend, </em>372 U.S. at 317-18, 83 S.Ct. at 759-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Both the state presiding judge and the state trial judge held hearings on Fritz\u2019s motion to defend himself. Neither judge made an express inquiry into Fritz\u2019s purpose, however, focusing instead on the nature of the <em>Faretta </em>right and on Fritz\u2019s ability to waive knowingly his right to counsel. To be sure, much of the evidence adduced at the hearings is pertinent to Fritz\u2019s motivation. The evidence is incomplete, however, and material facts \u2014 such as when it became clear that Fritz and Olson had irreconcilable differences, and whether Fritz had a bona fide reason for not asserting his <em>Faretta </em>right before the morning of trial \u2014 were never developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Moreover, the evidence that was adduced is ambiguous on the question of Fritz\u2019s purpose. In concluding that Fritz\u2019s motion was a delaying tactic, the Washington Court of Appeals focused on Fritz\u2019s past behavior\u2014 the facts that he jumped bail and then fought extradition, and that he dismissed his first counsel, thus obtaining a continuance from the original trial date \u2014 as well as the prejudice that further delay would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>caused the prosecution. While those facts may support an inference of dilatory intent, other facts support an inference of good faith. Olson testified that the conflict over defense strategy was genuine and that he had been unsuccessful in locating a witness who was essential to his proposed \u201cintent\u201d defense. It is entirely possible that Olson\u2019s failure to locate a key witness heightened Fritz\u2019s dissatisfaction with Olson\u2019s proposed defense and precipitated Fritz\u2019s last-minute motion to defend himself. It is also possible that, until the morning of trial, Fritz believed Olson would present an insanity defense. The record, however, sheds no light on these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">We do not hold that findings of fact made by an appellate court after an evidentiary hearing in trial court can never satisfy the <em>Townsend </em>criteria. We hold only that the facts material to Fritz\u2019s constitutional claim were not adequately developed in state court and that Fritz is thus entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal district court to determine whether his motion to proceed pro se was made as a tactic to delay the start of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The order of the district court is VACATED and the cause REMANDED for an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\">. The <em>Townsend </em>court identified six circumstances in which a federal habeas petitioner has a right to an evidentiary hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not supported by the record as a whole; (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">372 U.S. at 313, 83 S.Ct. at 757. Most of the <em>Townsend </em>criteria were codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), which establishes a presumption, subject to enumerated exceptions, that state court findings are correct. <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 395-96, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1237-38, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
