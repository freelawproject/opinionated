Kennedy Airport, a resulting $6.5 million verdict against Eastern and the United States, an apportionment of 60% of the damages against one of the impleaded defendants, a question of the application of the Warsaw Convention and Montreal Agreement, and a series of questions pertaining to the verdict and the judgments entered thereon. We find that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Henry Bramwell, Judge, erred on the Warsaw Convention question, and that the verdicts are excessive as well as conflicting. We reverse on Eastern\u2019s Warsaw defense, and we reverse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>remand for a new trial as to damages unless the plaintiff-appellee is agreeable to the remittitur we set forth below. We affirm, however, with respect to the apportionment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Stratis, a Greek seaman, sustained burns and a cervical fracture in the air crash. He was initially treated at Jamaica Hospital, owned and operated by The Jamaica Hospital, Inc. (Jamaica), and was then transferred to Harlem Hospital, owned and operated by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (NYCHHC). On the fourth day of his stay at Harlem Hospital doctors discovered that Stratis was quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Stratis sued Eastern and the United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recover damages for his injuries. Eastern impleaded, and the Government cross-claimed against, Jamaica and NYCHHC, alleging that malpractice by the hospitals aggravated Stratis\u2019s neck injury and thereby caused his quadriplegia. All passenger actions arising out of the crash, which only 11 of the 124 persons on board ultimately survived, were consolidated on the issue of the liability of Eastern and the United States. On the eve of trial the United States consented to the entry of a liability judgment against it; Eastern went to trial and a jury found it negligent. This court affirmed, <em>In re Air Crash Disaster at John F. Kennedy International Airport on June 24, 1975, </em>635 F.2d 67 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The trial on the issues of Stratis\u2019s damages and the defendants\u2019 malpractice claims against Jamaica and NYCHHC culminated in a jury verdict awarding Stratis $6.5 million. The jury found that Jamaica was not liable, but that NYCHHC was negligent and was responsible for 60% of the damages. Because actions against the Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cshall be tried by the court without a jury,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2402, the court used the jury verdict as an advisory one in its findings against the Government. As had the jury with respect to Eastern, the court concluded that the Government was liable to the extent of $6.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Curiously, the district court let the question of plaintiffs future expenses for attendant care if he remained in the United States go to the jury. Under the plaintiff\u2019s evidence this question could have been resolved in his favor to the tune of $2,002,000, projecting $52,000 a year over plaintiff\u2019s life expectancy of 38.5 years. In its findings against the Government, however, the district court found not only that the plaintiff had not established that he would be able to come to this country from his native Greece except on temporary visas for trial and the like, but that in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the total amount needed for his attendant-care costs in Greece to the end of his life would be only $335,230. Thus the jury\u2019s verdict against Eastern probably contains $2 million in costs for attendant care within its $6.5 million total while the court\u2019s same total judgment against the United States contains only $335,000 for attendant care. This alone would require reversal of the judgment against Eastern; the evidence was insufficient, as the court noted in its findings against the Government, to permit reasonable persons to conclude that Stratis would receive attendant care in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">For clarity, we will discuss the facts pertaining to the Warsaw Convention question and the facts pertaining to damages separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">I. <em>Warsaw Convention and Montreal Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">Stratis successfully moved below for partial summary judgment striking Eastern\u2019s affirmative defense of limitation of liability under the Warsaw Convention<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>real Agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Surprisingly, Stratis, who could not be affected by a limitation of Eastern\u2019s liability because he has the United States as a responsible defendant, is the only one of the parties who argues in his appellate brief that the Convention is inapplicable. The United States, which had agreed to a split of any damages with Eastern, has had no need to discuss the point in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">On June 23, 1975, Stratis was discharged from his Greek ship, the S.S. Paros, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Stratis had requested the discharge, apparently because he was suffering from phimosis. His Seamen\u2019s Articles, Greek law, and the immigration laws of the United States required that he be repatriated at the expense of the vessel\u2019s owner. Indeed, under United States immigration laws Stratis, along with the three other unlucky Greek seamen who were to be repatriated by way of Eastern Flight 66, had to make \u201cdefinite arrangements\u201d to depart from the United States before they could enter the country from their ship. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282(a); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 252.1(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The vessel owner\u2019s agents accordingly arranged for transportation for the seamen on Delta Flight 412 on June 24 from Baton Rouge to New Orleans and on Eastern Flight 66 on the same day from New Orleans to New York. The seamen were then to connect with Olympic Airways Flight 418 from New York to Athens, also leaving on June 24. Stratis received a ticket covering only the domestic Delta and Eastern flights, though a prepaid ticket \u201cadvice\u201d for Olympic Airways Flight 418 was evidently prepared in Olympic\u2019s New York City office. The information on this ticket advice was communicated by telephone to the American Airlines desk at John F. Kennedy International Airport, whose personnel operate the Olympic Airways station there. At the airport a ticket which lacked both a date of issuance and a validation stamp was issued for Stratis and a seat for him was confirmed. Validation would have been necessary before Stratis boarded but the deposition testimony of the Olympic revenue accounting manager, Spoulides, was that there was no reason that the ticket could not have been validated when issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Immigration and Naturalization Service Form 1 \u2014 408, dated June 23, 1975, was filed on behalf of Stratis in order to permit his entry into the United States. As required by INS regulations, the document specifically listed the seamen\u2019s \u201carrangements for departure from the U.S.\u201d as involving Delta Flight 412, Eastern Flight 66, and Olympic Flight 418, all on June 24, 1975. A telex dated June 25 from the vessel\u2019s agents in the United States to the vessel\u2019s agents in Greece, which contained news of the crash, also confirmed that the seamen had been scheduled to connect with the Olympic flight upon their arrival in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">The rub in the case is, of course, that the only ticket actually delivered to Stratis was the ticket covering the domestic flights. The prepaid ticket advice prepared by Olympic indicated that the passenger should contact the \u201cAir Counter\u201d to pick up the ticket, but because of the crash Stratis obviously was unable to do so. Stratis argues that because a passenger ticket for an international flight was never delivered to him, the Warsaw Convention does not apply. Eastern argues, on the other hand, that it is immaterial that the ticket for the international portion of the flight was not delivered, because an international flight was contemplated by the parties; an international ticket was issued, if not validated or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>delivered; and the ticket that was issued and delivered for the domestic portion of the flight contained the statement about the applicability of the Warsaw Convention that is required by a Civil Aeronautics Board regulation, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.175. We are thus presented with a novel question of law concerning the applicability of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">As clarified in <em>Georgakis v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>512 F.Supp. 330 (E.D.N.Y.1981) (holding Eastern collaterally estopped from relitigating against another S.S. Paros seaman, Stratis\u2019s Flight 66 seatmate, the Warsaw Convention issue decided in <em>Stratis), judgment vacated by stipulation </em>(filed Sept. 23, 1981), the court struck Eastern\u2019s limitation-of-liability defense first, because Stra-tis possessed a ticket for purely domestic travel at the time of the crash, and second, because Stratis was inadequately notified of the Warsaw/Montreal limitation-of-liability provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Warsaw Convention applies to \u201call international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft for hire.\u201d Art. 1. Under Article 3(1), the carrier \u201cmust deliver a passenger ticket\u201d containing information such as the places and dates of issue, departure, stops, and destination, and a statement that the Convention\u2019s limitation of liability is applicable. Article 3(2) then provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">The absence, irregularity, or loss of the passenger ticket shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of transportation, which shall none the less be subject to the rules of this convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier accepts a passenger without a passenger ticket having been delivered he shall not be entitled to avail himself of those provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Eastern argues that Stratis had been delivered <em>\u201ca </em>passenger ticket\u201d for the accident flight containing the required notice of limitation of liability, that the overall contract was one for international transportation within the meaning of Article 1(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the absence of a delivered international ticket is an irregularity not affecting the validity of the contract of transportation, rather than a failure to deliver disentitling Eastern to limit its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The relevant case law does not answer the argument. Each of the cases presented is distinguishable. In <em>Bayless v. S. A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Grandese, </em>10 Av.L.Rep. (CCH) 17,881 (S.D.N.Y.1968), a ticket was delivered but the court held that delivery was improper because the notice of limitation of liability was printed in an inadequate manner. In <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Flying Tiger Line, Inc., </em>341 F.2d 851 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 816, 86 S.Ct. 38,15 L.Ed.2d 64 (1965), the ticket for the accident flight was not delivered before the plane was boarded, and the notice of limitation of liability was printed in an improper manner. Here there is no contention that the ticket for plaintiff\u2019s transportation on Eastern Flight 66 was not properly delivered or that the limitation-of-liability notice on that ticket did not comply in all respects with the Montreal Agreement, <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra, </em>and the Civil Aeronautics Board regulation, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.175, with respect to wording and size of type.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">In <em>Grey </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>95 F.Supp. 756 (S.D.N.Y.1950), <em>aff'd on the opinion below, </em>227 F.2d 282 (2d Cir. 1955), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 989, 76 S.Ct. 476, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>L.Ed. 855 (1956), on which Eastern relies, the plaintiffs, bound for Mexico, boarded a plane in New York. Their tickets did not list the two intermediate stopping points, Washington and Dallas, and in this action arising out of a crash near Dallas the plaintiffs argued that the carrier\u2019s failure to comply with Article 3(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rendered the Convention\u2019s limitation inapplicable. The court disagreed, noting that Articles 4(4) and 9 (dealing with baggage checks and air waybills) expressly deny protection to the carrier with respect to baggage and goods unless certain particulars required by the sections corresponding to 3(1) are present. A comparison of these articles with 3(2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> indicated accordingly that delivery of a ticket suffices to limit the carrier\u2019s liability with respect to passengers even if the ticket does not contain the particulars required by 3(1). 95 F.Supp. at 758. But in <em>Grey </em>the international ticket omitted domestic stopping places; here, the traveler had been delivered only a domestic ticket, not showing the ultimate overseas destination. The question is whether this, like the omission of domestic stopping places in <em>Grey, </em>is simply a technical irregularity or one that goes to the very heart of the Convention\u2019s delivery requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In discussing <em>Grey, </em>this court in <em>Lisi v. Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane, S.p.A., </em>370 F.2d 508 (2d Cir. 1966), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion by an equally divided Court, </em>390 U.S. 455, 88 S.Ct. 1193, 20 L.Ed.2d 27 (1968), stated that the failure to list intermediate stops \u201cdid not change the \u2018international\u2019 character of the flight so far as plaintiffs were concerned. See Article I. Therefore, \u2018delivery\u2019 of the ticket had taken place ...\u201d 370 F.2d at 513 n.8. In <em>Lisi </em>the court held that delivery of a ticket without adequate notice that the flight was subject to the Convention was not sufficient to entitle the carrier to the limitation of liability. Rejecting a literal reading of Article 3(2)\u2019s requirement of mere delivery of a ticket in favor of a reading viewed \u201cin light of the other Articles and the overall purposes of the Convention,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 512, the court stressed that the key factor is whether the passenger had a reasonable opportunity to take precautions against the limitation of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-17\">[T]he <em>quid pro quo </em>for [the carrier\u2019s] one-sided advantage is delivery to the passenger of a ticket and baggage check which give him notice that on the air trip he is about to take, the amount of recovery to him or his family in the event of a crash, is limited very substantially.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">Here we must decide whether Stratis had such notice even though he had not received a ticket for the international flight. Eastern\u2019s reliance on <em>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>A.D.2d 832, 259 N.Y.S.2d 277 (1st Dep\u2019t 1965), a one-paragraph per curiam opinion, is misplaced. The plaintiffs in <em>Manufacturers Hanover </em>had international tickets but argued unsuccessfully that their New York-Los Angeles flight was separate rather than part of an international itinerary. Whether passengers can eliminate the international nature of their travel contract by separately purchasing their domestic and international tickets is a different question from whether the Convention applies when an international ticket has not in fact been delivered. Absent delivery of a ticket for the international leg of the journey, the question is not whether Stratis knew his domestic flight could be subject to the Convention as a leg of an international flight under Article 1(3), note 4 <em>supra, </em>but whether he had reason to know his overall flight was international. If not, he lacked a reasonable opportunity to buy insurance or take other precautions against the limitation of liability; if so, the treaty requires his domestic flight to be subject to the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">This court has recently stated that the possible unfairness of the Convention is no reason to construe it narrowly. <em>See Reed v. Wiser, </em>555 F.2d 1079, 1093 &amp; n.19 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 922, 98 S.Ct. 399, 54 L.Ed.2d 279 (1977). <em>See also Benjamins </em>v. <em>British European Airways, </em>572 F.2d 913 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1114, 99 S.Ct. 1016, 59 L.Ed.2d 72 (1979); <em>Smith v. Canadian Pacific Airways, Ltd., </em>452 F.2d 798 (2d Cir. 1971). At the same time, several courts have also noted that the Convention should be interpreted \u201cto accord substance to the protections that Article 3 . .. intended to provide airline passengers. The carriers are not to be permitted to use the article as a protective shelter to shield themselves from their responsibilities to the public.\u201d <em>Deutsche Lufthansa Aktienge-sellschaft v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>479 F.2d 912, 917 (D.C.Cir.1973). <em>See also Egan v. Kollsman Instrument Corp., </em>21 N.Y.2d 160, 170, 287 N.Y.S.2d 14, 20, 234 N.E.2d 199, 203 (noting that people travel more casually today than in the past, making appropriate a requirement of stricter compliance with the Convention).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In the end we are confronted with conflicting directives from the treaty. Under Article 3(1) \u201cthe carrier <em>must </em>deliver a passenger ticket\u201d (emphasis added) containing, <em>inter alia, </em>the place of destination. Under Article 3(2), however, \u201c[t]he <em>absence </em>... of the passenger ticket shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of transportation, <em>which shall none the less be subject to the rules of this convention\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the provision of 3(2) that disentitles the carrier to limit its liability'applies only \u201cif the carrier accepts a passenger without a passenger ticket having been delivered,\u201d which is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">If the \u201cabsence\u201d of a ticket does not affect the existence of the contract but the carrier \u201cmust deliver\u201d a ticket, what did the treaty-writers intend? We do not know, and to answer the question either way is equally arbitrary or reasonable as we see it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where, as here, a prepaid ticket advice for the international flight has been prepared and a ticket covering that flight has been issued though not validated or delivered to the passenger; a contract for international transportation had been made and the passenger could not cancel the international portion of the journey without running afoul of his commitments to the immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>gration authorities; and the passenger had been delivered a ticket from the domestic carrier that gave notice<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Warsaw/Montreal liability limitations, we hold that the passenger is assumed to know the flight was international and the Convention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>does apply. We specifically limit this holding to its facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">II. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A multitude of errors, among them exces-siveness and the fatal error above mentioned in allowing the jury to include in its award against Eastern a sum for future attendant-care expenses based on the cost of such care in the United States, crept into the total award necessitating a retrial unless Stratis accepts a remittitur. To be sure, Stratis is totally and permanently disabled. As a result of the accident he sustained burns over 30 to 36% of his body, a compression fracture of the cervical fifth vertebra that ultimately caused his quadriplegia, infections, abscesses, skin grafts, and pneumothorax. Hospital personnel performed various medical procedures on him, including a laryngoscopy, insertion of a chest tube, bronchoscopy, the extraction of a subclavian catheter that had been lost in his body, the use of Crutchfield tongs on his head in an attempt to alleviate the spinal-cord damage, mechanical respiration, a pye-logram, and a cystogram. At the present time Stratis suffers not only from quadriplegia, burn scars, diaphragmatic breathing, abnormal bladder and bowel, abnormal sex liie, spasticity and ankylosis, hypothermia, headaches, and other injuries, but also has the inevitable emotional difficulties caused by being handicapped and totally dependent on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On the positive side, Stratis is sufficiently emotionally recovered that he envisions keeping busy by buying and running a small business or store; although he cannot control his lower extremities or torso below his waist, he can position both arms and bring them to his mouth; he sees friends and even has a relationship with a female friend; he remains intellectually active and assists in his grooming and nourishment; he is able to have sexual relations; and he does not suffer physical pain. He has very little or no recollection of the horrible things he went through at Jamaica Hospital in the nine hours immediately following the accident, nor does he recall the first four days of his forty-two day stay at Harlem Hospital. His recollection begins after the point at which he had largely lost the ability to feel physical pain; in that part of his body still capable of feeling pain, his head, the insertion of the Crutchfield tongs involved discomfort but \u201cno serious pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The jury verdict of $6.5 million against Eastern, of which NYCHHC was found responsible for 60%, was not broken down into components. The district court, on the other hand, did break down its findings into components, and while we need not explore them in microscopic detail, it is plain that several are mistaken. Everyone agrees, and the district court found, that the past medical and related expenses total $85,-341.32. The district court properly found the future attendant-care expenses to be $335,230, because Stratis could not show in any manner, shape, or form that he would be able to stay in the United States indefinitely.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">We do not find excessive the district court\u2019s award of $11,000 for the exquisite pain and suffering Stratis endured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>eight to nine hours at Jamaica Hospital. Stratis was suffering from extensive first-, second-, and third-degree burns; had episodes of disorientation, apnea, and brady-cardia; underwent a laryngoscopy; and was administered numerous pain-killing drugs. Although Stratis does not remember his stay at Jamaica, the fact that he was administered the drugs, coupled with the evidence that he was not then quadriplegic, is in and of itself indicative that such an award is not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">For Stratis\u2019s forty-two day stay at Harlem Hospital, where he was in the burn unit and where, according to the jury, he became quadriplegic because of the hospital\u2019s malpractice (its manipulation and failure to discover his cervical fracture), the court awarded $1.2 million for pain and suffering. This amounts to approximately $29,000 a day, which in anyone\u2019s calculations has to be excessive, especially considering that because of his quadriplegia Stratis was unable to feel pain after the first four days. <em>See West v. Jutras, </em>456 F.2d 1222, 1225 (2d Cir. 1972) (a remand for a new trial, or affirmance conditioned on remittitur, is required when an award \u201cis so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand\u201d) (quoting <em>Dagnello </em>v. <em>Long Island Railroad Co., </em>289 F.2d 797, 806 (2d Cir. 1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On the other hand, the judge\u2019s award of $250,000 for pain and suffering in the period from August 6, 1975, until January 30, 1976, when Stratis was cared for in the Helen Hayes Hospital, was not out of line. Stratis learned at Helen Hayes that his paralysis was permanent, and went through the emotional trauma associated with that discovery as well as the rehabilitative and other procedures aimed at enabling him to cope with his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">For the pretrial period and the future, again using a 38.5-year life expectan-ey, the district court awarded Stratis $60,-000 a year for conscious pain and suffering and emotional trauma because of his lack of freedom of movement, his lack of a normal sex life, his dependence on others for attendant care, and the abnormality of his bladder and bowel functions. The district court also awarded $1.2 million for the \u201cpermanent injury\u201d of quadriplegia, a sum presumably intended to compensate for Stra-tis\u2019s physical disability as opposed to the emotional consequences of his condition. We do not know how the judge arrived at these extraordinary figures. In any event, we consider the aggregate award of $3,510,-000 for future pain and suffering plus disability to be excessive by at least one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Turning to Stratis\u2019s lost earnings, the testimony about past and future losses, presented through a Greek lawyer rather than a person expert in the marine industry, is insufficient to support the award. At the time of the crash Stratis was a twenty-year-old Greek seaman earning approximately $4,000 per year. The assumption of the Greek lawyer, Mr. Sfyroeras, was that Stratis would work 150 hours of overtime monthly, but Stratis\u2019s wage statements showed previous monthly overtime running from a minimum of 30 hours to <em>&amp; </em>maximum of 132 hours, averaging only 59 hours per month. With that alone the loss of past earnings would have to be reduced from $56,690 to $48,781, and his loss of future earnings from $592,451 to $478,580. Moreover, the court overlooked the evidence that all Greek males must serve two years in the military when they reach the age of twenty-five, which alone requires a further reduction of $16,260 in the award for past lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">In light of these errors in the calculation of damages, we would grant a conditional remittitur to $2,850,000, absent the acceptance of which a new trial on damages is hereby ordered.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>III. <em>Apportionment of Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ae1\">NYCHHC, which the jury found responsible for 60% of the damages, challenges the apportionment by arguing forcefully that Stratis was unsalvageably rendered a quadriplegic at the time of the crash on June 24, 1975. The short answer is, however, that while doubtless the cervical fracture occurred in the crash, there was ample expert and other evidence from which the jury could find that Stratis\u2019s quadriplegia was preventable, and that he was not rendered quadriplegic until he became a patient at Harlem Hospital and was subjected to its treatment. This evidence included the testimony of Eastern\u2019s expert in neurology and psychiatry, Dr. Kaplan, its internist, Dr. Vorhaus, and its radiologist, Dr. Carothers; the Government\u2019s trauma surgeon, Dr. Swan; and the hospital records at Jamaica and Harlem hospitals showing Stratis\u2019s ability to move his four limbs even after he was in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The records show an early orthopedic examination at Harlem Hospital indicating \u201cfull Range of Motion\u201d of upper extremities and \u201c[n]o gross loss of motor Power,\u201d as well as an entry by the surgical resident in charge almost twelve hours later that \u201c[p]atient can move all limbs\u201d and the next day a note by a neurologist that \u201cPt moves all extremities.\u201d The neurologist who saw Stratis as a quadriplegic three days later wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">COMMENT: Fx [fracture] obviously was present since admission. He apparently was intact at that time (at least 2 nurses remember him thrashing about [with] all 4\u2019s). Due to manipulation, intu-bation, turning, etc., he gradually and progressively (perhaps in intermittent fluctuating manner) sustained spinal cord injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">It is unnecessary to recount the other evidence from which the jury may have inferred that Harlem Hospital was attempting to cover its tracks \u2014 a parenthetical note scribbled into the record with a pen using a different color ink (\u201cI never saw any extremities move\u201d); the loss of the X-rays taken immediately after the quadriplegia was discovered. Suffice it to say that even without such an inference the jury\u2019s apportionment of damages seems justified.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The verdict in favor of Jamaica, which we find to be free from error, was also supported by ample evidence. The 284-bed community hospital was overloaded by the sudden arrival in the hospital of fourteen air-crash survivors, some \u201cburned literally to a crisp\u201d and \u201cpartially dismembered.\u201d An attending physician testified that Stra-tis himself was \u201cdying from shock,\u201d \u201cleaking like a peeled orange,\u201d and \u201cbeyond critical,\u201d so that first priorities involved saving his life rather than taking cervical and other X-rays, especially in view of his multiple contusions, extensive burns, and the question of inhalation injury. Stratis, it will be recalled, was in Jamaica Hospital for only eight or nine hours and the situation there, as the hospital\u2019s Dr. Block testified, was one of triage. It was thus reasonable for the jury to find that Jamaica\u2019s failure to X-ray and immobilize Stratis was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Judgment denying Eastern\u2019s Warsaw/Montreal defense reversed.

For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping pace in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit of liability of U.S. $75,-000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs. For such passengers traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.

Curiously, while the Olympic ticket advice covered all four Greek seamen from the Paros and the tickets issued were numbered serially, Stratis\u2019s being second in sequence, it was a different person (by number and by handwriting) who completed Stratis\u2019s ticket from the one who did the other three. Rather than assume that some fraud was involved, however, we assume that the agent who completed the other three simply was busy or interrupted and asked another agent to fill out Stratis\u2019s.

The district court also awarded $141,290 for auxiliary medical expenses Stratis would incur in the amount of $3,669.91 per year over his 38.5-year life expectancy. The $3,669.91 figure represents the annual cost of such services <em>{e.g., </em>annual checkup, wheelchair, hospital beds) in the United States. We find this award troublesome for two reasons. First, it is unclear that Stratis would obtain these services in the United States rather than Greece, where they presumably are far less costly. Second, the testimony was unclear concerning whether the $335,230 figure for expenses in Greece covered only attendant care or auxiliary services as well. Although we do not now find that this award constitutes error, in the event of a new trial the district court should clarify its findings in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">.

The charge was proper, was directed mainly at Jamaica Hospital\u2019s actions, and caused NYCHHC no harm. We have also reviewed the court\u2019s charge on proximate cause and found it to be a correct and clear statement of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b471-5\">NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Are\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Warsaw Convention<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits an airline to limit its liability for death or injuries suffered by an international passenger; for airlines flying to and from the United States the limit, modified by the Montreal Agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is $75,000. Before an airline receives the benefit of such a generous treaty, it should be clear that the terms of the treaty have been met. In this case, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion holding Eastern Airlines entitled to use the Convention in defense of the claim of Efstratios Stratis because, in my view, the terms of the Convention have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Article 3 of the Convention, which we all agree is an essential requirement for a carrier\u2019s limitation of liability, specifies that the carrier must \u201cdeliver\u201d a passenger ticket, which, according to Article 3(1), must contain certain information including the place of destination and a statement informing the passenger of the limitation of liability. It is undisputed in this case that the ticket for Stratis\u2019s foreign destination was never delivered to him or to anyone acting on his behalf. While Eastern\u2019s flight from New Orleans to New York City was crashing on its approach to John F. Kennedy Airport, Stratis\u2019s ticket from New York City to Athens awaited him at the ticket counter of Olympic Airways at JFK. Despite this clear-cut noncompliance with the Convention, the majority concludes that it nevertheless applies to limit Eastern\u2019s liability for Stratis\u2019s injuries. The majority appears to reason that the purpose of Article 3(l)\u2019s delivery requirement is to afford the passenger notice of the limitation of liability so that he can, if he chooses, secure insurance, and that in this case the delivery to Stratis of Eastern\u2019s domestic ticket for the flight from New Orleans to New York City furnished adequate notice since it contained the same explanation of the Convention that Stratis would have received from the New York City-Athens ticket, if that ticket had been delivered to him. Additionally, the majority finds an apparent contradiction between Article 3(l)\u2019s delivery requirement and Article 3(2), which provides that the limitation of liability shall apply notwithstanding the \u201cabsence, irregularity, or loss\u201d of the ticket. The majority seems to draw from this apparent contradiction a relaxation of the delivery requirement. In my view, the command of Article 3(1) is clear, it is not satisfied by delivery of a ticket for a domestic flight, and Article 3(2) can and should be read in a manner that avoids any contradiction with the terms of Article 3(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">As the majority recognizes, a purpose of the ticket delivery requirement of Article 3 is to provide the passenger with notice of the limitation of liability, one of the items that this article requires the ticket to contain. When the article also requires the ticket to contain the place of \u201cdestination,\u201d it seems clear enough that the ticket required to be delivered is the ticket that completes the international travel, since \u201cinternational transportation\u201d is defined by the Convention to mean \u201ctransportation in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination . . . are situated . . . within the territories of [two signatory nations].\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, \u201cdestination\u201d as used in Article 3 must mean Athens; if Stratis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>destination was not in a country other than the United States, the Convention would not even arguably apply to his flight from New Orleans to New York City. I do not doubt that when the ticket delivery requirement of the Convention has been met, the Convention applies to the domestic leg of an international journey. But I find nothing in the Convention that excuses non-delivery of the ticket for travel to the foreign destination simply because the ticket for the domestic segment of a trip contains notice of the liability limitation applicable to foreign travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">There is good reason for the Convention drafters to have insisted that notice of the limitation of liability be provided by the ticket for travel to the foreign destination. The notice appearing in both the undelivered Olympic ticket and the delivered Eastern ticket appears under the caption, \u201cAdvice to International Passengers on Limitation of Liability.\u201d A traveler on the domestic leg of an ultimately foreign journey might well fail to read the notice, thinking that, while on the domestic leg, he is not an \u201cinternational passenger\u201d to whom the notice is directed. However, this same caption appearing in his ticket to his foreign destination is more likely to attract his attention since he should reasonably expect a notice captioned \u201cAdvice to International Passengers\u201d to apply to a holder of a ticket to a foreign destination. Once alerted to the notice by a caption appearing in his foreign travel ticket, he then learns from the text of the notice that \u201con a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of origin\u201d a Convention limiting liability is applicable to \u201cthe entire journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Another reason why Article 3 should be interpreted to require delivery of the ticket for the passenger\u2019s foreign destination is the increased opportunity for a passenger to gain notice of important items like limited liability in a language he understands. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that while English is the international language of air travel, tickets issued by most carriers, including Olympic, print Warsaw Convention and other information in both English and the language of the carrier\u2019s country. A Greek passenger flying from New York City to Athens on Olympic Airways will be informed of the limitation of liability in Greek.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Of course, many travelers are subject to the Warsaw Convention when they fly from one country to another on a carrier based in a country whose language they do not understand, but delivery of the ticket for travel to the foreign destination will increase comprehension for many travelers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and would have been more informative for Stratis. In any event, delivery of that ticket is what the Convention requires. For the Convention to apply to Stratis, there must be delivery of his ticket for transportation to his \u201cdestination,\u201d Article 3(l)(b), which was Athens, whether that transportation is provided \u201cunder the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts,\u201d Article 1(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The majority asks, \u201cIf the \u2018absence\u2019 of a ticket does not affect the existence of the contract [per Article 3(2)] but the carrier \u2018must deliver\u2019 a ticket [per Article 3(1)], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>what did the treaty-writers intend?\u201d, <em>supra, at </em>412-414. I think the answer is obvious. They intended, just as they said, that a ticket must be delivered to the passenger; thereafter, the absence, even the loss, of that ticket when the passenger arrives to board the plane does not impair the contract of transportation or remove the limitation of liability. The second sentence of Article 3(2) supports this interpretation. By removing the limitation of liability for a carrier who accepts a passenger to whom a ticket has not been delivered, the Article plainly implies that the \u201cabsence\u201d of a ticket mentioned in the first sentence pertains to a passenger to whom a ticket has previously been delivered. With delivery, there is limited liability even if the ticket is later absent; without delivery, there is no limitation of liability. At a minimum, this reading of both subsections of Article 3 follows the traditional approach of according, whenever possible, a consistent reading to all the language of a document.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">I fully agree with the majority that, under our prior decisions, the possible unfairness of the Convention is no reason to construe it narrowly. But surely its unfairness is not a reason to construe it broadly. If there ever was a case where an entity seeking a windfall<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from the terms of a provision should be held to a literal application of those terms, it is a common carrier seeking refuge in a limitation of liability. <em>See Zacharia v. Harbor Island Spa, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 199 (2d Cir. 1982) (hotel not entitled to statutory limitation of liability for loss of guest\u2019s property where terms of liability not strictly observed, even though hotel furnished guest with notice of the limitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">I dissent from the ruling affording Eastern Airlines the protection of the Warsaw Convention.

The record does not disclose a translation of \u201climitation of liability,\u201d but we may be confident that one is available. <em>See </em>Akins, <em>The Greeks Had a Word For It </em>(1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b472-12\">. Toward that end, many carriers, including Olympic, print ticket notices in other languages in addition to English and the language of the country in which the carrier is based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\">. For Eastern Airlines transporting Stratis from New Orleans to New York City, application of the Convention is unquestionably a windfall. Unlike carriers transporting passengers from one country to another, which at least have the opportunity to adjust their level of liability insurance in light of the Convention\u2019s limitation of liability, Eastern had no idea that Stratis was on the domestic leg of an international journey and thus had no occasion to adjust its liability insurance in light of such a circumstance. Eastern would have had such knowledge if it had issued and delivered to Stratis a series of tickets for the entire journey, including the final leg to Athens. In that event, Eastern\u2019s entitlement to the Convention\u2019s protection would have been indisputable, even though the limitation of liability would probably have remained a windfall.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
