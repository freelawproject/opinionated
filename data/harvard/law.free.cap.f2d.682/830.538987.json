We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision on the installation tying claim is contrary to the law of the case and that the awards for damages and attorney fees were based on improper considerations without support in the record. Accordingly, for the third time, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b886-23\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b886-24\">The action began in 1969 when Eugene Granite &amp; Marble Works (EGM), Oregon\u2019s oldest retailer and installer of grave markers (a/k/a memorials and monuments), sued eight large \u201cendowment care\u201d cemeteries<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Lane County, Oregon and Jas. H. Matthews &amp; Son, a national manufacturer of grave markers. EGM alleged that the defendants violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act by monopolization, attempted monopolization, refusal to deal, conspiracy, and two tie-ins. The tying claims stemmed from the cemeteries\u2019 requirements that a purchaser of a cemetery lot buy a grave marker only from the cemetery where the lot is purchased (sales tie), and that the marker be installed only by the cemetery where the lot and marker are purchased (installation tie).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The district court granted defendants summary judgment on all counts. This court reversed and remanded the case for trial. <em>Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews &amp; Co., </em>473 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1973) <em>(\u201cMoore I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">At the conclusion of the liability portion of the bench trial, the district court again entered judgment for all defendants on all counts. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment on the monopolization, attempted monopolization, refusal to deal, and conspiracy counts, and as to the dismissal of defendant Jas. H. Matthews &amp; Co., but again reversed the district court on both of EGM\u2019s tie-in claims. <em>Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews &amp; Co., </em>550 F.2d 1207 (9th Cir. 1977) <em>(\u201cMoore II\u201d). </em>We concluded that \u201cseparate products and services are involved in each of the tying arrangements\u201d and that the district court \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d in upholding the cemeteries\u2019 quality control justification for the ties. 550 F.2d at 1215, 1218. We vacated the judgment on EGM\u2019s tie-in claims and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Following <em>Moore II, </em>three of the eight cemeteries settled with EGM and thereafter allowed EGM to sell and install markers on their properties. EGM and the remaining five cemeteries again went to trial on the tie-in claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The district court granted EGM judgment on the sales tying claim, but again held for the cemeteries on the installation claim. The district court found that the exclusive installation requirement was not an illegal tie because only a single product or service was involved. Having determined that installation was a part of a single product or service, the district court reasoned that the cemeteries\u2019 \u201cjustification defense\u201d need not be discussed. Nevertheless, \u201cfor purposes of clarity,\u201d the court went on to state that the cemeteries\u2019 justification defense was meritorious because \u201cinstallation guidelines simply would not work under the circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">The district court initially awarded EGM $31,128 in untrebled damages, but no costs or fees, and permanently enjoined defendants from engaging in the marker-sales tying practice. Both sides then moved to amend the judgment. The district court reopened proceedings, heard additional evidence, and issued a second decision awarding costs, trebled damages of $196,437, and attorney fees of $231,450.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Four of the five cemeteries affected by the judgment appeal, contending that the damage award was not supported by substantial evidence and that the award for attorney fees constituted an abuse of discretion because it was made without an adequate evidentiary record. EGM cross-appeals, claiming that the district court erred by rejecting the installation tying claim and that the awards for damages and fees were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Law of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">The \u201claw of the case\u201d rule ordinarily precludes a court from re-examining an issue previously decided by the same court, or a higher appellate court, in the same case. <em>See </em>IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>0.404[1], at 404-09 (2d ed. 1980). <em>See also In re Staff Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp., </em>625 F.2d 281, 282-83 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Adamian v. Lombardi, </em>608 F.2d 1224, 1228 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 938, 100 S.Ct. 2158, 64 L.Ed.2d 791 (1980). The law of the case principle is analogous to, but less absolute a bar than, <em>res judicata. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra, </em>at 404-09. Although the law of the case rule does not bind a court as absolutely as <em>res judicata, </em>and should not be applied \u201cwoodenly\u201d when doing so would be inconsistent with \u201cconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>erations of substantial justice,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the discretion of a court to review earlier decisions should be exercised sparingly so as not to undermine the salutory policy of finality that underlies the rule. <em>See Lathan v. Brinegar, </em>506 F.2d <em>677, </em>691 (9th Cir. 1974) (en banc); <em>United States v. Fullard-Leo, </em>156 F.2d 756, 757 (9th Cir. 1946). The Fifth Circuit has aptly summarized the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">While the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine is not an inexorable command, a decision of a legal issue or issues by an appellate court establishes the \u201claw of the case\u201d and must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal in the appellate court, unless the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues, or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-5\"><em>White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d 428, 431-32 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In <em>Moore II, </em>we vacated the judgment against EGM on the tie-in claims, and originally remanded the case \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d In denying the cemeteries\u2019 petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, however, the court amended the remand language to read: \u201cthe case is remanded for further proceedings <em>and factual determinations </em>consistent with <em>the standards articulated in </em>this opinion.\u201d 550 F.2d at 1220. (Emphasized language was added by the amendment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">The district court believed that prior to being amended, <em>Moore II </em>\u201cleft only the amount of damages and some sort of in-junctive relief\u201d for determination on remand. It evidently considered, however, that the amendment to <em>Moore II </em>somehow expanded the scope of remand to require having all the tying issues fully relitigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The district court\u2019s interpretation of our remand was erroneous and its disposition of the installation tying claim was directly contrary to <em>Moore II. </em>Review of the eight-page discussion of tying in <em>Moore II </em>indicates that the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for rejecting the installation tying claim were not among the \u201cmatters left open by the mandate of this court.\u201d <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 347, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1148, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 n. 18 (1979). The only issues left for determination by <em>Moore II </em>were on damages, attorney fees, and, as indicated in note 4, <em>infra, </em>the ties\u2019 effect on interstate commerce in the tied market. We believe that it was with these issues in mind that the court amended its remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">We commenced our discussion of tying in <em>Moore II </em>by noting that both the sales and the installation tying claims were under consideration and that all four cemeteries involved in the present (third) appeal engaged in both practices. 550 F.2d at 1212. The court noted that the first question under tying analysis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>are \u201cseparate and distinct products or services tied into a single package.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1214. After a lengthy analysis of the applicable case law, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">An application of the factors in <em>[Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United Steel Corp., </em>394 U.S. 495, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 22 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969)] <em>Fortner I </em>and our consideration of the \u201cfunction of the aggregation\u201d <em>leads inescapably to the conclusion that separate products and services are involved in each of the tying arrangements before us.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1215 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We later noted that, \u201c[i]n addition to their contention that only a single product is involved here, [the cemeteries] offer [two] justifications for the tying arrangements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. The first justification was a \u201cgoodwill and quality control argument,\u201d and the second justification was a \u201cregulated industry [state action] defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217, 1218. The court expressly rejected both justifications, noting, in regard to the first justification, that the cemeteries\u2019 legitimate concerns about quality and customer goodwill could be adequately maintained by specifications. 550 F.2d at 1217. Any doubt about our holding on the justification issue should have ended with our statement that the district court \u201cerred as a matter of law in recognizing the reasonableness of the tie-in restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The district court nevertheless rejected EGM\u2019s installation claim because it thought that separate products and services were not involved and that, even if they were, the cemeteries\u2019 installation practices were justified by quality control concerns. The amended remand cannot be construed to erase this court\u2019s unequivocal conclusion that \u201cseparate products and services are involved in each of the tying arrangements\u201d and that the district court \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d in upholding the cemeteries\u2019 quality control justification. 550 F.2d at 1215, 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Moreover, none of the limited exceptions to the law of the case rule is applicable here. <em>See United States v. Imperial Irrigation District, </em>559 F.2d at 520; <em>White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d at 431-32. The evidence developed on remand offered even stronger support than this court had available in <em>Moore II </em>for holding that marker installation is a separate service, and the cemeteries point to no contrary controlling authority or considerations of substantial justice that warrant reconsidering the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">The trial court prefaced its discussion of the damage issue by criticizing the cemeteries for not being as helpful as EGM in supplying a theory for calculating damages from the sales tie. The court noted that \u201c[i]n spite of the principal ruling of the Court of Appeals, [the cemeteries] continue to insist simply that there were no damages.\u201d The court then proceeded to discuss EGM\u2019s proof, which the court characterized as the only \u201creasonable theory for calculating damages.\u201d EGM\u2019s proof consisted primarily of the testimony and reports of Dr. Reinmuth, Dean of the Business School at the University of Oregon. Dr. Reinmuth based his testimony and reports on evidence in the record, including both sides\u2019 business records and interment data supplied by the State of Oregon. Dr. Reinmuth divided EGM\u2019s alleged damages from the sales tying claim into three categories (termed \u201cTypes 1-3\u201d by the parties and trial court). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Because EGM does not contest the district court\u2019s rejection of Type 3 damages as overly speculative, we do not discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Type 1 damages reflect the per-marker decrease in the average selling price EGM obtained for the few markers it sold for placement in the defendant cemeteries (effect on price). Type 2 damages were the profits EGM allegedly lost from being shut out from a representative share of the marker market in the defendant cemeteries (effect on market). Dr. Reinmuth based his calculation of Type 2 damages on the assumption that, but for the illegal sales tie, EGM would have sold the same percentage (50%) of markers in the defendant cemeteries as it did in other local cemeteries, including the three cemeteries that settled following <em>Moore II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The trial court reduced Dr. Reinmuth\u2019s Type 2 estimate of damages by fifty percent because the trial judge had a low opinion of EGM\u2019s manager, Arie Mack Moore. In the trial judge\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">I have observed Arie Mack Moore throughout these proceedings. He is given to gross overstatements. I believe that on an average he has exaggerated his loss data by one hundred percent. Furthermore, the evidence has shown that his marker installations have been done in a less than workmanlike manner. His sales techniques have been poor. He is often arrogant. His personality is such that his sales would not be as high as a more reasonable dealer. For these factors, I reduce the expert\u2019s estimated lost sales figures by fifty percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The cemeteries contend that the district court erred in awarding any Type 1 and 2 damages. EGM contends that the judge erred in reducing the Type 2 damages solely because of his adverse impression of EGM\u2019s manager, but does not contest the amount of Type 1 damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The well-settled rules applicable to proving antitrust damages were summarized in <em>Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., </em>548 F.2d 795, 811-12 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 910, 97 S.Ct. 2977, 53 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1977), where this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-11\">The Supreme Court has also established a relaxed standard for proving the amount of damages in an antitrust case once the fact of damage has been shown. . . . \u201cIt will be enough if the evidence shows the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate.\u201d ' [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-12\">A study of the adjudicated cases in this area readily dispels any impression that this question of damages is governed by an application of the common law rule of reasonable certainty. The cases have long since departed from this rule in antitrust litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-13\"><em>Accord, Greyhound Computer Corp. v. IBM, </em>559 F.2d 488, 505-07 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1040, 98 S.Ct. 782, 54 L.Ed.2d 790 (1978). In other words, an antitrust plaintiff is only obligated to provide the trier-of-fact with some basis from which to estimate reasonably, and without undue speculation, the damages flowing from the antitrust violations. <em>See Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., </em>327 U.S. 251, 264, 66 S.Ct. 574, 579, 90 L.Ed. 652 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">In light of the liberal proof-of-damages rule in antitrust cases, the cemeteries\u2019 continued insistance that EGM is entitled to no damages is meritless. Although EGM\u2019s proof may have lacked exactness, it was certainly within the liberal bounds permitted in antitrust cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">There was ample evidence to support the assumptions underlying Dr. Reinmuth\u2019s calculations. For instance, there was evidence that the cemeteries\u2019 restrictive policies compelled EGM to charge less for the few markers it sold for placement in the defendants\u2019 cemeteries than it otherwise would have (Type 1 damages). There was also evidence that, but for the tying restraints, EGM would have sold approximately 50% of the markers sold in defendants\u2019 cemeteries (Type 2 damages).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the cemeteries\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>repeated refusal to assist the district court in arriving at a fair calculation of damages, they are in no position to argue that Dr. Reinmuth\u2019s use of inexact figures rendered his damage calculations fatally speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The district court\u2019s rationale for reducing EGM\u2019s Type 2 damages is meritless. Although Dr. Reinmuth relied to a limited extent on business records and other information supplied by Moore, the bulk of his damage calculations were based on independent data in the record. The district court\u2019s opinion of Moore\u2019s personality and ability were improper reasons for reducing damages because Moore did not make the calculations or supply the critical data upon which the calculations were based. Even assuming that the district court\u2019s assertions about Moore were accurate, those factors would have adversely affected the past sales in the unrestricted cemeteries that Dr. Reinmuth used as the basis for his damage projections. Thus, if Moore\u2019s business abilities had been greater, EGM would theoretically have made an even greater percentage of the sales in unrestricted cemeteries which, in turn, would have actually increased Dr. Reinmuth\u2019s estimate of Type 2 damages. In short, neither the district court nor the cemeteries have offered a sound reason why EGM\u2019s Type 2 damages should have been arbitrarily reduced by fifty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the award of Type 1 damages, order the award of Type 2 damages to be doubled to the full amount proven by EGM, and remand for the district court to determine and award additional damages attributable to the illegal installation tie.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">On May 22,1979, EGM filed a request for fees supported by affidavits. The parties entered a stipulated order on June 4, 1979, providing that no discovery or hearing would be held on attorney fees pending the court\u2019s reconsideration of the damage issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">On February 4, 1980, the district court issued its amended decision. In addition to awarding EGM the damages discussed above, the court awarded attorney fees of $231,450 pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (mandating the award of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to prevailing antitrust plaintiffs).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">In its one-paragraph discussion of attorney fees, the trial court stated that it reduced the number of hours requested by two of EGM\u2019s three principal attorneys by fifty percent because they \u201cwere ... inclined to produce a large volume of less than useful material.\u201d The court then multiplied the approved number of hours by fifty dollars per hour. The court felt fifty dollars per hour was \u201creasonable compensation for each attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">The cemeteries argue that the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees without an adequate evidentia-ry basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The cemeteries contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>district court\u2019s handling of the matter unfairly deprived them of an opportunity to show that some of the hours requested by EGM\u2019s attorneys were spent on matters they were not entitled to be reimbursed for. Specifically, the cemeteries contend that they would have demonstrated that EGM sought fees for time spent prosecuting the non-tying claims that EGM did not prevail on, as well as for time devoted to prosecuting claims against those defendants that settled or were dismissed from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">EGM also claims that the fee award constituted an abuse of discretion. EGM argues that: (1) it was unreasonable for the district court to reduce the number of hours claimed by the two EGM attorneys by fifty percent, without reference to any legal standards, solely because the court thought they produced some \u201cless than useful material;\u201d and (2) the multiplier of $50 per hour was unreasonably low for experienced antitrust lawyers handling such a major and protracted litigation on a contingency fee basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Both sides are correct. The district court\u2019s failure to allow the parties to develop an adequate evidentiary basis for a fee award and to follow proper standards in awarding fees was inconsistent with the sound exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Given the stipulated order, the paucity of information available to the district court on the issue, and the substantial amount of money involved, the district court should not have awarded fees on such an inadequate evidentiary basis. Although a hearing on fees may be unnecessary when the affidavits and briefs submitted by the parties are sufficiently detailed to provide a basis for the award, <em>see Manhart v. City of Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power, </em>652 F.2d 904, 908 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 849 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981), the district court clearly lacked an adequate evi-dentiary basis here for awarding fees. Had the district court been properly guided by the standards discussed below for setting attorney fees, the need to obtain more information on which to base a fee award would have been apparent. <em>See Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., </em>399 U.S. 222, 223, 90 S.Ct. 1989, 1990, 26 L.Ed.2d 534 (1970); <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadelphia v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161, 169 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Among the factors that should be considered in awarding fees are: (1) the time and labor required, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the skill necessary to perform the legal services properly, (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case, (5) the customary fee, (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent, (7) time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances, (8) the amount involved and the results obtained, (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys, (10) the \u201cundesirability\u201d of the case, (11) the nature and length of the professional relations with the client, and (12) awards in similar cases. <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), adopted by this circuit in <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild Inc., </em>526 F.2d at 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">This court has repeatedly held that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court to award fees without considering these guidelines (known as the <em>\u201cKerr </em>guidelines\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Higgins </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>644 F.2d 1348, 1352 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Ellis v. Cassidy, </em>625 F.2d 227, 231 (9th Cir. 1980). Although not all twelve <em>Kerr </em>guidelines need be considered in every case, <em>see Manhart, </em>652 F.2d at 907; <em>Kessler v. Associates Financial Services Co., </em>639 F.2d 498, 500 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981), the need for meaningful review requires remand where, as here, the record on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>appeal fails to indicate which, if any, of the <em>Kerr </em>guidelines were considered. <em>Harmon v. San Diego County, </em>664 F.2d 770 at 772 (9th Cir. 1982) (as amended); <em>Fountila </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>571 F.2d 487, 496-97 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The rationale underlying the district court\u2019s award is clearly inadequate. Three attorneys have handled the bulk of EGM\u2019s work during the eleven years this case has been litigated. These attorneys documented having spent approximately seven-thousand hours working on the case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All three attorneys have distinguished backgrounds and extensive experience in antitrust work. In handling this case on a contingency basis for over eleven years, through three trials, and now three appeals, EGM\u2019s attorneys have taken an enormous risk. For the district court to reduce the attorneys\u2019 hours by half and allow less than one-half of their normal billing rate solely because it thought they produced some less than useful material<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">While we do not infer that there should be either an increase or decrease in fees, we remand the question with directions that the court gather additional evidence, make a new award, and substantiate its award consistent with this opinion. In calculating the new award, the district court should consider the time EGM\u2019s attorneys spent in successfully prosecuting the three appeals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">To minimize the possibility of misunderstanding, we offer the following additional guidance on remand. First, the district court should examine the merits of the cemeteries\u2019 contention that EGM s attorneys are not entitled to reimbursement for time they spent working on unsuccessful claims and matters pertaining to defendants that settled or were dismissed from the case in light of our recent decision in <em>Twin City Sportservice v. Charles O. Finley &amp; Co., </em>676 F.2d 1291 at 1312-1314 (9th Cir. 1982). <em>See also Rivera v. City of Riverside, </em>679 F.2d 795 at 796-797 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Thornberry </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>676 F.2d 1240 at 1243 (9th Cir. 1982). We articulated the following test in <em>Twin City </em>for determining when an antitrust plaintiff is entitled to fees for work related to the pursuit of both successful and unsuccessful claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">[A] prevailing antitrust plaintiff is entitled to recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for every item of service which, at the time rendered, would have been undertaken by a reasonable and prudent lawyer to advance or protect his client\u2019s interest in the pursuit of a successful recovery of anti-trust damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">676 F.2d at 1313</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Second, our decision should not be construed as mandating inflexible application of the <em>Kerr </em>criteria. Courts and commentators alike have criticized rigid application of the <em>Kerr </em>guidelines. <em>See, e.g., Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 890 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc); <em>In Re Capital Underwriters, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>519 F.Supp. 92, 99 (N.D.Cal.1981); <em>Stanford Daily, Inc. v. Zurcher, </em>64 F.R.D. 680 at 682; Berger, <em>Court Awarded Attorneys\u2019 Fees: What is \u201cReasonable\u201d?, </em>126 U.Pa.L.Rev. 281, 286-87 (1977). This criticism is directed principally at the redundancy among the guidelines<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>and the fact that they lack a practical framework for application.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">An alternative approach to calculating fee awards, termed \u201clodestar\u201d analysis, involves the calculation of a \u201clodestar\u201d figure based on multiplying the number of hours expended by counsel times the prevailing billing rate for comparable legal services in the community. Unless counsel is working outside his or her normal area of practice, the billing-rate multiplier is, for practical reasons, usually counsel\u2019s normal billing rate. Billing rates usually reflect, in at least a general way, counsel\u2019s reputation and status (i.e., as partner, associate, or law clerk). The relatively objective lodestar figure is then adjusted based on the quality and risk involved in counsel\u2019s efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Lodestar analysis was originally articulated by the Third Circuit in <em>Lindy Bros., </em>487 F.2d at 167-69, and, following remand, 540 F.2d 102, 112-18 (3d Cir. 1976), and has since been adopted and refined in a number of other circuits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This court has adhered to the <em>Kerr </em>guidelines and has yet to directly approve the use of straight lodestar analysis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Like the <em>Kerr </em>guidelines, lodestar analysis has been subject to criticism. Its critics contend that lodestar\u2019s emphasis on hours and billable rates woodenly inflates awards. <em>See, e.g., In re Capital Underwriters, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>519 F.Supp. at 99; <em>Stanford Daily v. Zurcher, 64 </em>F.R.D. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">We note with approval that district courts in this circuit have increasingly responded to the perceived flaws in the <em>Kerr </em>and lodestar approaches by blending the best features of the two approaches. <em>See, e.g., In re Capital Underwriters, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>519 F.Supp. at 100; <em>Keith v. Volpe, </em>86 F.R.D. 565, 573-77 (C.D.Cal.1980); <em>Donnarumma v. Barracuda Tanker Corp., </em>79 F.R.D. 455 (C.D.Cal.1978); <em>Lockheed Minority Solidarity Coalition v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., </em>406 F.Supp. 828 (N.D.Cal.1976); <em>Stanford Daily v. Zurcher, </em>64 F.R.D. at 682. This court recently upheld a fee award calculated with a blend of lodestar and <em>Kerr </em>analysis. <em>Thornberry v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>at 1242-1243. Although \u2014 consistent with the broad discretion accorded district courts in awarding fees \u2014 the \u201cblended\u201d approach taken in each of these cases differs slightly in response to the particular facts at issue, the common characteristic is the use of lodestar analysis as \u201ca procedure for ordering the examination of [the] factors listed in <em>[Kerr].\u201d In re Capital, </em>519 F.Supp. at 100 and <em>Knutson, </em>479 F.Supp. at 1270 n.10, quoting with approval, <em>Zurcher, </em>64 F.R.D. at 682. As noted in <em>In re Capital, </em>the courts utilizing a blended approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">generally begin by equating the first factor in the lodestar approach, \u201chours spent,\u201d with the \u201ctime and labor required\u201d element of <em>[Kerr] </em>.. ., then consider other <em>[Kerr] </em>factors in setting the hourly rate and determining whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>augment or decrease the award based on quality or contingency considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">519 F.Supp. at 100.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We believe that the blended approach is well suited to the facts of this case, and commend it to the district court for use in calculating the fee award on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The district court\u2019s decision on the installation tying claim is reversed. In regard to damages, we affirm the award of Type 1 damages, order the award of Type 2 damages doubled, and remand for the additional award of damages attributable to the illegal installation tie. Finally, we vacate the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. The distinguishing feature of an endowment care cemetery is that part of the purchase price of each cemetery lot is placed into a permanent trust to be used for the perpetual management and maintenance of the cemetery and any grave markers erected there. <em>See </em>Ore.Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 97.810[1] and [7],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-26\">. Briefly summarized, tying involves a seller\u2019s use of a dominant position in one product market to enhance its position in a separate product market by tying products from the two markets together for sale as a single unit at a single price. <em>Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number><em>ed States, </em>356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518-519, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958). Tying offends antitrust values because it denies competitors free access to the tied product market as well as limiting buyers\u2019 choices in the tied product market. This occurs not because the seller imposing the arrangement is offering a superior product, but solely due to the leverage exerted by the tying product. <em>Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 43, 47 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 955, 92 S.Ct. 1172, 31 L.Ed.2d 232 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">. <em>United </em>States v. <em>Imperial Irrigation District, </em>559 F.2d 509, 520 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>595 F.2d 524, <em>reversed in part, vacated in part, both on other grounds, sub nom.

Three criteria must be satisfied to demonstrate an illegal tying arrangement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">First, there must in fact be a tying arrangement between two distinct products or services. Second, the defendant must have sufficient economic power in the tying market to impose significant restrictions in the tied product market. Third, the amount of commerce in the tied product must not be insubstantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-10\"><em>Moore II, </em>550 F.2d at 1212 (citations omitted). The second and third criteria\u2014neither of which was a basis for the district court\u2019s rejection of the installation tying claim \u2014 merit brief consideration. Neither factor supports the cemeteries\u2019 contentions or warrants a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"AdE8\">The second criteria \u2014 market power in the tying product \u2014 may be shown by product uniqueness or desirability, a requirement we found satisfied in <em>Moore II. </em>550 F.2d at 1215. On remand, the district court also found that the cemeteries possessed the requisite degree of market power in the tying market of grave lots. Although this finding was made in regard to the sales tying claim, it is equally applicable to the installation claim, and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"avk-dedup-1\">To satisfy the third criteria \u2014 proof of an effect on interstate commerce in the tied market \u2014 the challenged restraint must implicate more than a <em>de minimis </em>amount of interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>commerce in the tied product or service. <em>Moore II, </em>550 F.2d at 1216. Although neither <em>Moore II </em>nor the district court\u2019s decision can be construed as having directly decided the issue, our review of the record indicates that it would be unfair to all concerned to remand the tying claims a third time on this issue. The effect-on-commerce criteria was clearly satisfied in regard to the sales tie. The cemeteries sold over 2 million dollars worth of markers between 1965 and 1978, virtually all of which originated from outside Oregon. Although admittedly a closer question, the record also demonstrates that sufficient lumber, nails, concrete, and other construction materials originating from outside Oregon were used in the hundreds of marker installations at issue in this case to satisfy the criteria as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">. Although EGM sold only about 4% of the markers placed in the defendant cemeteries, the company sold and installed approximately 50% of the markers placed in those Lane Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ty cemeteries that lacked restrictive practices. The cemeteries vigorously argued that the other cemeteries, none of which were endowment care cemeteries like the defendants, were inaccurate comparables. The defendants offered no explanation, however, for why EGM\u2019s sales increased to almost 50% at each of the three settling endowment care cemeteries following their discontinuation of the challenged exclusivity requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. We note that the calculation of installation damages can be made from the evidence already in the record. Because EGM\u2019s damage evidence was offered before the district court ruled on the tying claims, it necessarily included damages attributable to both ties. Indeed, proceeding on the assumption that both the sales and the installation restraints had been held illegal in <em>Moore II, </em>Dr. Reinmuth originally made no attempt to compute separately the damages from the two ties. It was not until after the district court upheld the installation tie and agreed to reopen proceedings to hear additional evidence on damages that Dr. Rein-muth separated the two charges. This was done, as the district court requested, using the information already in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b891-18\">. The district court denied the cemeteries\u2019 motion to reopen the amended decision in regard to damages and attorney fees. The judge observed that the \u201caward of damages that I would have made except for that mandate from the Court of Appeals <em>[Moore II] </em>would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>been zero,\u201d and that \u201cone reason the attorney\u2019s fees was low is that the amount of the [damage] award is too high.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\">.

The second contingency consideration \u2014 the risks assumed \u2014 is similar to the sixth <em>Kerr </em>guideline, requiring inquiry into the fixed or contingent nature of the fee. Parti-cularily in cases not involving a potential for substantial monetary recovery, an enhanced fee due to its contingent nature may be justified. Awards should not automatically be increased, however, merely because there are risks associated with contingent fee arrangements. In fee-generating cases where a large damage recovery is likely, the contingent fee arrangement, by its very nature, helps compensate the attorneys for the risks involved. This can be especially true in antitrust cases where treble damages are available. The fee, based on a percentage of the total recovery, may be generous, yet the plaintiff in such situations may recover even more than actual damages after paying such fee. Further, the deterrent effect on the defendant should adequately be accomplished by assessing treble damages plus a normal attorney\u2019s fee without enhancement for its contingency under those circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
