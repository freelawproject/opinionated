Finding no merit in any of his claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-24\">Substantial evidence was presented at trial that on November 21, 1980, Ortega-Chavez and Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez left the United States and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo. That same day, Sanchez applied for and received a permit to return to the United States with certain described merchandise. From Nuevo Laredo he and Ortega-Chavez proceeded to Sabinas Hidal-go, Mexico. The next day, November 22, these two met with Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado and five undocumented aliens at a restaurant in Sabinas Hidalgo. From the restaurant, all eight took a bus to Nuevo Laredo. The five undocumented aliens , then took a taxi from the Nuevo Laredo bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>terminal to a point close to the bridge leading into the United States. Appellant Ortega-Chavez, Sanchez, and Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado arrived at the bridge in a van. Ortega-Chavez instructed the five aliens to get into a hidden compartment in the van and to remain silent. The van was driven by Sanchez. Approximately halfway across the bridge, Ortega-Chavez got out of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">A Customs officer at the bridge, while inspecting the van\u2019s merchandise for compliance with the entry permit, noticed that the rear wall of the van on the inside appeared to be less deep than would be suggested by looking at the outside of the van. The van was inspected, the hidden compartment discovered, and Sanchez, Alejandro Gonzalez Delgado, and the five undocumented aliens were placed under arrest. Appellant Ortega-Chavez was arrested later. Ortega-Chavez was charged with conspiracy to bring or to attempt to bring undocumented aliens into the United States and five counts of aiding and abetting Sanchez\u2019s attempt to bring illegal aliens into the United States. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">On appeal, Ortega-Chavez raises several claims of prejudicial error not asserted below. It is well-established that the failure to timely and properly raise these contentions before the district court, either through objection, motion for mistrial, or other appropriate manner, precludes us from reviewing them unless they constitute plain error under Fed.R.Cr.P. 52(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>670 F.2d 622, 623 (5th Cir. 1982) (plain error applies to failure to object to evidence introduced at trial); <em>United States v. Chaney, </em>662 F.2d 1148, 1151 (5th Cir. 1981) (plain error applies to failure to object to waiver of counsel hearing conducted in presence of jury venire); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>639 F.2d 268, 270 (5th Cir. 1981) (plain error applies to failure to object to inculpatory answer elicited during cross-examination); <em>United States v. Okenfuss, </em>632 F.2d 483, 485 (5th Cir. 1980) (plain error applies to failure to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct at trial). Plain errors are \u201climited to those harmful ones that were so rank that they should have been apparent to the trial judge without objection, or that strike at the fundamental fairness, honesty, or public reputation of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>651 F.2d 268, 273 (5th Cir. 1981) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">Ortega-Chavez claims the district court erroneously permitted the government to call two unannounced rebuttal witnesses, in contravention of Fed.R.Cr.P. 12.1(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>When its witnesses were sworn prior to trial, the government volunteered that one of them might be called \u201cas a rebuttal.\u201d At trial, Ortega-Chavez did not testify and presented only one witness, Graciela Castaneda, whose sole testimony was that she and her husband had brunch with the appellant on November 22,1980, at their home in San Antonio, Texas. Following Mrs. Castaneda\u2019s testimony, the trial was recessed for the day. The next morning, at a conference prior to the jury being brought in, government counsel informed the court and the defense that he \u201cjust found this out yesterday that I did have some rebuttal witnesses\u201d and that he would call Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez\u2019s parents, neither of whom were among those previously sworn, to testify that appellant was in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 21 and 22, and thus rebut the alibi given by Mrs. Castaneda. Defense counsel then observed that at the beginning of trial the government \u201cindicated that there would be just the possibility of maybe one rebuttal witness; which was\u201d an individual <em>other </em>than either of Sanchez\u2019s parents. However, no objection or motion was then or thereafter made respecting the testimony of these witnesses. The jury was then brought in, and Sanchez\u2019s parents testified, his father placing the appellant in Sabinas Hidalgo on November 22, 1980, and his mother recalling having seen the appellant there on the evening of November 21, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">Allowing these witnesses to testify was not plain error. <em>See United States v. Vela, </em>673 F.2d 86, 89 (5th Cir. 1982). Rule 12.1(b) requires the government to provide the defendant written notice of \u201cthe witnesses upon whom the government intends to rely to establish the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the alleged offense and any other witnesses to be relied on to rebut testimony of any of the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses.\u201d This requirement, however, is only a reciprocal obligation triggered by the government\u2019s written demand, under Rule 12.1(a), of the notice to offer an alibi defense. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>637 F.2d 1052, 1059 (5th Cir. 1981). <em>See Vela, </em>673 F.2d at 88. Since the government made no written demand under Rule 12.1(a), it was under no duty to provide Ortega-Chavez with a list of rebuttal witnesses. <em>Benton, </em>637 F.2d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Appellant further argues that these government rebuttal witnesses, who were present in the courtroom during previous testimony, were allowed to testify despite a sequestration order made pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 615.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plain error is not established. While Rule 615 sequestration is mandatory, this Court has held that a trial court has discretion to allow the testimony of a witness who has violated the Rule and that a party must demonstrate an abuse of discretion and \u201csufficient prejudice\u201d to warrant reversal on account of such testimony. <em>United States v. Womack, </em>654 F.2d 1034, 1040 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1029, 71 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number><em>United States v. Warren, </em>578 F.2d 1058, 1076 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>612 F.2d 887 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956, 100 S.Ct. 2928, 64 L.Ed.2d 815 (1980); <em>United States v. Eastwood, </em>489 F.2d 818, 821 (5th Cir. 1973). Ortega-Chavez is unable to demonstrate either an abuse of discretion or sufficient prejudice from the testimony of the two rebuttal witnesses. Their testimony merely confirmed that of four previous witnesses, that Alfredo Ortega-Chavez was in Sabinas' Hidalgo on November 22, 1980.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the government had no way of knowing that these rebuttal witnesses would be necessary until it heard the testimony of Mrs. Castaneda that Ortega-Chavez had been in San Antonio on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Ortega-Chavez also objects to the manner in which a juror was questioned by both the trial judge and the government\u2019s attorney in regard to her friendship with defense counsel, Ms. Salinas. During the voir dire of the jury panel, the district judge inquired if anyone on the panel was a close personal friend of Ms. Salinas or \u201canything of that sort.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no response from any panel member <em>or from Ms. Salinas. </em>After the jury had been selected but prior to the commencement of any other proceedings in the case, it was revealed that one of the jurors knew Ms. Salinas. The district judge thereupon questioned the juror, Mrs. Guerrero, out of the presence of the other jury members, as to her ability to be impartial. During this conference, the government\u2019s attorney was allowed to ask the juror whether her friendship with another female lawyer in Laredo would unfairly affect her view of the case. Defense counsel made no objections. In fact, defense counsel never in any way even intimated the slightest displeasure with this proceeding or with the juror. The juror stated twice that she could be \u201cfair and impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">The district judge handled this situation commendably. Appellant\u2019s suggestion on appeal that the in camera hearing in some way operated <em>\u201cto </em>magnify the wrong,\u201d far from establishing plain error, is unsupported by a single shred of evidence. The decision to hold such a hearing is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d 974, 978 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 922, 99 S.Ct. 2030, 60 L.Ed.2d 395 (1979). This Court has recognized the district court\u2019s responsibility under Fed.R.Cr.P. 24(c) to inquire into a juror\u2019s ability to remain impartial. <em>United States v. Spiegel, </em>604 F.2d 961, 967 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 935, 100 S.Ct. 2151, 64 L.Ed.2d 787 (1980). The decision to remove a juror for impartiality is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>Judge Kazen conducted an inquiry that was both brief and sensitive to the concerns of both parties. He then gave counsel for both parties an opportunity to question Mrs. Guerrero. Defense counsel declined this invitation. Mrs. Guerrero indicated that she could be \u201cfair and impartial to both sides.\u201d After repeated assurances from Mrs. Guerrero that she could remain nonpartisan, Judge Kazen determined that she was not prejudiced by her relationship with defense counsel. That determination was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>604 F.2d 361, 364 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. <em>denied, </em>444 U.S. 1034, 100 S.Ct. 708, 62 L.Ed.2d 671 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">The remainder of Ortega-Chavez\u2019s claims are entirely without merit and do not warrant extended discussion. The allegation that the government\u2019s attorney made unspecified prejudicial comments in opening and closing arguments is raised for the first time on appeal and is unsupported by the record. Defense counsel\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s reference to a photo layout which included Ortega-Chavez was cured by the court\u2019s prompt instruction and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>moreover, all of the government\u2019s witnesses later identified the defendant by pointing to him in the courtroom. Equally thorough limiting instructions were given when the government adduced evidence of Ortega-Chavez\u2019s recent previous ventures into Mexico to smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States, and these instructions were repeated in the court\u2019s final charge to the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">While Ortega-Chavez claims that the trial court wrongly failed to inquire into his written waiver of a twelve-person jury, the record neither contains nor suggests the existence of any such document (or of any other waiver of a twelve-person jury). Further, the defendant was tried before and convicted by a panel of twelve jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The evidence was, to say the least, amply sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction. While the testimony of the accomplice, Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez, revealed several inconsistencies with his prior deposition statements, such testimony was certainly not incredible as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s challenge goes to credibility and weight, not competency. Issues of credibility, the weight of the evidence, and conflicts in evidence are matters for the jury. <em>United States v. Parr, </em>516 F.2d 458, 464 (5th Cir. 1975). The testimony of the other government witnesses not only corroborated the accomplice\u2019s testimony, but also, standing alone, more than sufficed to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">Lastly, appellant claims that the trial court \u201cfailed to maintain the appearance of impartiality.\u201d This contention is wholly frivolous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>entire record and it is plain that the able trial judge conducted all the proceedings not only fairly, conscientiously, and competently but in a manner that was in all respects fully considerate, courteous, evenhanded, and impartial. Counsel is obliged to be fearless and resolute in resisting any judicial partiality, actual or apparent; equally, however, it is counsel\u2019s duty to eschew utterly baseless charges of partiality or similar misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">The evidence against appellant is strong. He was fairly tried and convicted. There being no reversible error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">.

Fed.R.Evid. 615 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-8\">\u201cAt the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion.

Though neither had talked to the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting the case until the morning on which they testified, Sanchez\u2019s father had previously talked to another Assistant United States Attorney in connection with procuring a lawyer for his son. However, as noted, at no time was any objection or motion made in regard to the testimony of either witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">. Juan Gonzalez Torres testified that he saw Ortega-Chavez in Sabinas Hidalgo on both November 21, 1980, and November 22, 1980. Josefina Contreras de Gonzalez stated that she saw the appellant in Sabinas Hidalgo on the evening of November 21, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">. This inquiry was actuaiiy made twice, once respecting Ms. Salinas and once respecting her firm and its members, including herself. Similar questions, of course, were asked concerning government counsel. The court also had counsel for both sides rise and identify themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">. There was evidence of three such prior trips. Two, as to which defense counsel did lodge an objection, were testified to by Sanchez as having been made by him and Ortega-Chavez earlier in November 1980 using the same van with the hidden compartment and employing the same pi\u00f1atas as a \u201ccover\u201d as on the November 22, 1980 trip. This evidence was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) on several grounds; as evidence of the conspiracy with Sanchez and others, charged in count one, to illegally bring undocumented aliens into the country \u201con . .. and prior to November 22, 1980\u201d; as evidence of knowledge and intent (especially since appellant was not present when Sanchez and the aliens were discovered entering in the van, and since when the objection was made there was no indication of an alibi defense); and as showing such similarity of conduct \u201cthat it marks the offenses as the handiwork of the accused\u201d by demonstrating \u201ca modus operandi.\u201d <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 912 n. 15 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 920, 99 S.Ct. 1244, 59 L.Ed.2d 472 (1979). Certainly there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of this evidence. <em>United States v. Benton, </em>637 F.2d 1052, 1056 (5th Cir. 1981). The remaining prior trip was testified to briefly by the witness Saldana as having been made in July 1980 with appellant. While the proper relevance of this trip is somewhat more attenuated than that of the November trips, it was not objected to by the defense, and, in light of the other evidence and the limiting instructions, clearly does not rise to the level of plain error requiring reversal. Appellant also <em>apparently </em>complains of Sanchez\u2019s answer, \u201cHe brings people over here\" to the government\u2019s question, \u201cWhat does he [appellant] do?\u201d No objection or motion in regard to this testimony was made at trial, but the careful trial judge on his own initiative ordered the answer stricken and twice instructed the jury to disregard it. Clearly, none of these complaints present any error requiring reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">. The inconsistencies, moreover, did not in any direct sense relate to the degree or extent of appellant\u2019s participation in the alien smuggling operation. Sanchez\u2019s deposition testimony, a part of which was introduced in evidence by the defense, plainly and strongly implicated appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">. The one specific instance cited is the judge\u2019s statement, when the third government witness was called, that, \u201cIncidentally, ladies and gentlemen, in case you\u2019re curious, we swore all these witnesses as a group before you came in here. So they\u2019ve all been sworn to tell the truth under oath.\u201d Since the witnesses were all sworn out of the presence of the jury, this remark was entirely proper and helpful. At no time did defense counsel indicate any dissatisfaction in this regard, nor did counsel below ever in any way raise any complaints of lack of evenhandedness or request any \u201cbalancing\u201d ruling or instruction respecting any part of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-13\">We also note that the trial judge instructed the jury, both at the beginning of trial and in his final charge, not to \u201cinfer or conclude from any ruling that I may make or anything I say that I have any opinion about this case one way or the other\u201d and \u201c[n]ot to assume from anything I may have said to any witness or to any attorney, or any ruling I have made that I have any opinion about the outcome of this case one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>way or the other. ... So, except for my legal instructions to you, I tell you that you should disregard anything else that I have said in reaching your verdict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
