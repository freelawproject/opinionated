As a result of the closing, the Union charged Mastell with unfair labor practices and alleged that Mastell and an affiliated business, Instant Warehouse Corporation (IWC), constituted a single business enterprise and a single employer under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The National Labor Relations Board (Board) determined that Mastell had violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976) (the Act), by interrogating employees about union activities, by threatening employees with the closing of the shop and loss of their jobs because of their union activities, and by threatening employees with bodily injury because of their union activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the Board approved the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that Mastell and IWC constituted a single integrated business enterprise and employer within the meaning of the Act, and that the enterprise had violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (3)(1976), by discharging eleven employees on June 11, 1980, because of their union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Board ordered Mastell and IWC to desist from their unfair labor practices and required them to pay the discharged employees backpay from June 11, 1980, the date of termination, to the date of their employment or waiver of employment with Midway Trailer Service (MTS).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Mastell petitions this court for review, challenging the Board\u2019s determination that Mastell and IWC constituted a single integrated enterprise, as well as the validity of the backpay award. We affirm the Board\u2019s determination that Mastell and IWC constituted a single integrated enterprise, but vacate and remand the backpay award for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">I. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">A. <em>Single Employer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The Board may treat nominally separate but closely related enterprises as a single employer under the Act. <em>See Radio &amp; Television Broadcast Technicians Local Union 1264 v. Broadcast Service of Mobile, Inc., </em>380 U.S. 255, 256, 85 S.Ct. 876, 877, 13 L.Ed.2d 789 (1965); <em>Industrial Personnel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>657 F.2d 226, 227-28 (8th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1012, 71 L.Ed.2d 302 (1982). In determining whether two enterprises constitute a single employer, the Board should examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The Board makes an essentially factual determination which this court will affirm if supported by substantial evidence. <em>NLRB v. C. K. Smith &amp; Co., </em>569 F.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 957, 98 S.Ct. 3070, 57 L.Ed.2d 1122 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>whether the total relationship of two nominally separate businesses reveals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-16\">(1) some functional interrelation of operations, (2) centralized control of labor relations, (3) common management, and (4) common ownership or financial control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-17\"><em>[Miscellaneous Drivers and Helpers Union, Local No. 610 v. NLRB, </em>624 F.2d 831, 833 (8th Cir. 1980) <em>(per </em>curiam) (quoting <em>Pulitzer Publishing Co. v. NLRB, </em>618 F.2d 1275, 1279 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 875, 101 S.Ct. 217, 66 L.Ed.2d 96 (1980)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The facts amply support the Board\u2019s finding that Mastell and IWC constituted a single employer for purposes of the Act. According to the record, David Mastell founded and originally wholly owned both companies. Although he later sold twenty-five percent of IWC, he retained the remaining seventy-five percent. The evidence also indicates that the operations shared a common management and common office space with Mastell paying rent for the entire facility. In addition, the record reveals that Mastell employees worked for IWC, and that IWC did not have any separate employees. Mastell employees received the same compensation, had the same supervision, and worked under the same conditions of employment whether they performed work for Mastell or IWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">B. <em>Backpay Award.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The record in this case indicates that Mastell\u2019s repair shop and parts department had been failing for many months because of adverse business conditions. Mastell showed a net profit of $50,000 for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1979, but lost two of its largest accounts in January 1980. As a result, repairs and the sale of repair parts decreased substantially.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Because of its deteriorating financial condition, Mastell made substantial changes in its operation to reduce expenses. It closed its overflow repair shop, cut the president\u2019s salary by sixty percent, cut leadmen and office wages, and laid off three company employees. Mastell did not lay off repair workers, however, out of consideration for those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">In May 1980, Mastell\u2019s accountant advised closing the business and liquidating the inventory. In early June, after Mastell had an accumulated loss of $103,000 for the first seven months, its banker advised liquidation of as much of the inventory as possible. The record, therefore, indicates that Mastell was clearly failing and could not continue its operations in the absence of a quick business upturn. On June 11, David Mas-tell closed the repair shop and parts department after learning that his employees had decided to join the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">After a hearing, the administrative law judge awarded the discharged employees backpay from the date of their discharge to the date of employment or waiver of employment with MTS. In making the back-pay award, the administrative law judge noted that Mastell had not cut benefits to its shop employees prior to closing, and that David Mastell had indicated to employees in March that the repair shop continued to fare reasonably well in spite of the high interest rates on the extensive inventory and the downturn in sales. He suggested that Mastell offered its economic defense as a smokescreen for antiunion animus in discharging the shop employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The record establishes that David Mastell\u2019s knowledge that his employees had joined the Union triggered the discharges two days later. Ordinarily, reinstatement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and backpay would constitute a proper remedy. Here, however, Mastell\u2019s financial plight demonstrates that it would not have operated for very long. We cannot ignore these basic economic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">This court has only limited authority to review a backpay award.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">The Board possesses broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies once an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>fair labor practice is established, and our authority to review the remedial provisions of the Board\u2019s order is a limited one. <em>See NLRB v. Rutter-Rex Manufacturing Co., </em>396 U.S. 258, 262-63, 90 S.Ct. 417 [420], 24 L.Ed.2d 405 (1969); <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398 [405], 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964); <em>Packing House and Industrial Services v. NLRB, </em>590 F.2d 688 at 697 (8th Cir. 1978). Regarding a backpay order, the Supreme Court has said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">When the Board, \u2018in the exercise, of its informed discretion,\u2019 makes an order of restoration by way of back pay, the order \u2018should stand unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u2019 <em>[NLRB v. Rut-ter-Rex Mfg. Co., supra, </em>396 U.S. at 263, 90 S.Ct. at 420.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\"><em>[NLRB v. J. S. Alberici Construction Co., </em>591 F.2d 463, 468 (8th Cir. 1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">As we view the record, it justifies a back-pay order for a short period of time. Because Mastell\u2019s financial condition continued to deteriorate during June, July, and August, the record does not appear to support a backpay award for August. The award of backpay to August lacks eviden-tiary support, and, therefore, appears punitive in nature. <em>See Packing House and Industrial Services, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>590 F.2d 688, 697 (8th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">II. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Accordingly, we enforce the Board\u2019s order in part, but vacate and remand the backpay issue to the Board. The Board should employ an economic analysis to determine when Mastell, in the exercise of reasonable business judgment and, with appropriate concern for the welfare of its employees, would have been forced to close its repair shop and parts department. Backpay should then be computed from the date of actual discharge to the date the employees would have been discharged in the absence of antiunion animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Each party shall pay its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. The Board approved the finding of the administrative law judge \u201cthat Instant Warehouse and Mastell Trailer Corporation are affiliated businesses with common officers, ownership and operations, and that the two Companies constitute a single integrated business enterprise with a common labor policy with respect to its shop, parts and fabrication employees, and drivers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. On August 12, 1980, Mastell sold its parts inventory to two former supervisors, who began operating Midway Trailer Service, Inc. (MTS). MTS repairs trailers and sells parts out of the same location as Mastell, and shares the rent and utilities. The Union agreed with MTS not to seek remedial action requiring reopening of the repair shop and parts department, reinstatement of the discharged employees, or recognition of the Union by Mastell, in return for MTS\u2019s agreement to recognize and bargain with the Union, as well as to hire several of the discharged employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">.
