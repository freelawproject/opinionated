The Board determined that petitioner violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) by photographing employees engaged in a peaceful demonstration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board ordered petitioner to cease and desist from such photography, and to destroy all photographs taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">We believe that the evidence does not support the finding of a section 8(a)(1) violation. Therefore, we will set aside the decision and order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">\n<em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">This case is predicated upon a single, independent section 8(a)(1) allegation described in the complaint as follows: said employees engaged in protected concerted activity thereby creating the appearance of coercive surveillance for purposes of future reprisals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">On or about November 14,1979, the [petitioner] photographed its employees as</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-0\">Appendix at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-21\">The findings of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) may be summarized as follows: Petitioner operates a steel manufacturing facility, known as the South Works, in Chicago, Illinois. The employees of the plant are represented by Local 65 of the United Steel Workers of America (the \u201cUnion\u201d). Prior to the events at issue here, female employees at the South Works plant manifested their concern for the adequacy of locker room facilities made available for their use. In consequence, grievances were filed which, as of November 1979, had been heard at the third step of the established contractual dispute settlement procedures. In support of these grievances, on November 14,1979 a demonstration was held at a plant entrance under the sponsorship of the Women\u2019s Committee of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">Approximately fifty to seventy-five employees participated in the two-hour demonstration. The record shows that the participants, many of whom carried picket signs, were good humored and peaceable, and the rally encompassed neither violence nor other illegal activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No employee was disciplined as a result of the demonstration, and no legal action was taken by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-23\">Petitioner assigned two photographers, each with a camera, to record the demonstration. The photographers were given no guidelines or limitations in their task. Roughly 140 pictures were taken, including some close-up photographs of employees, and the picture-taking encompassed preparations for the demonstration as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>demonstration itself. The pictures were retained, although never used, by petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s photographic practice was undertaken on the advice of counsel, and had been implemented without challenge for each of thirteen previous demonstrations held at the plant during the preceding eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Based on his interpretation of the relevant law, the ALJ concluded that, unless petitioner provided a legitimate justification, its picture-taking constituted a violation of section 8(a)(1). Petitioner justified its action as anticipatory evidence-gathering for possible use in legal proceedings; however, petitioner admitted it had no reason to believe that unprotected activity would occur at the event. The AU concluded that petitioner\u2019s defense was \u201ctechnically deficient,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he therefore found that section 8(a)(1) was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nevertheless, the ALJ concluded that no remedial order was warranted. The ALJ noted that photography was prohibited by the Board because of its coercive implication of future reprisals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ listed several factual findings which \u201cnegate the assumption that employees herein were gripped by any deep concern\u201d regarding future reprisals. Appendix at 247. These findings include: a) absence of any evidence of anti-union animus; b) affirmative evidence of the protection of employees since 1942 by a bargaining representative with an amicable relationship to management; c) absence of potential for \u201chard feeling\u201d such as is present in disputes arising from organization or contract negotiation; d) absence of allegations of independent employer misconduct; e) absence of evidence of economic dependence; and f) evidence that demonstrators affirmatively sought and obtained media coverage of the event.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, the ALJ concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADf\">the violation was isolated, occurred in a context of a long bargaining history, involved an Employer which long ago had accepted principles of industrial democracy and finally focused upon employees who welcomed personal exposure of their activity through recordation from other sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Appendix at 249. Thus, although finding a technical violation of section 8(a)(1), the ALJ dismissed the complaint in its entirety. Appendix at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">On review, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s conduct violated section 8(a)(1), noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">an employer\u2019s photographing of its employees while they are engaged in protected concerted activity constitutes unlawful surveillance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Appendix at 254-55.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board also agreed that petitioner did not offer a legitimate justification for its conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">The Board disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that no remedial order was warranted. The Board concluded that a) petitioner\u2019s longstanding photographing practice showed that its conduct in this case was not \u201cisolated;\u201d b) amicable relations and the absence of anti-union animus are irrelevant to the question \u201cwhether [petitioner\u2019s] conduct in photographing employees reasonably tended to interfere with employee rights;\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and c) employee publicity efforts do not alter the coercive nature of employer surveillance. Thus, the Board concluded that petitioner\u2019s conduct, since it \u201ctended to interfere with, restrain, and coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed them,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> warranted the issuance of a remedial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The question before us is whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole, including any evidence detracting from the Board\u2019s view, to support the Board\u2019s finding of a violation of section 8(a)(1). <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>NLRB v. Craw, </em>565 F.2d 1267, 1270 (3d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Before reaching the question whether petitioner had a legitimate justification for its photographing, the Board and the AU first concluded that the photographing constituted unlawful surveillance in violation of section 8(a)(1). In making this initial determination, both the ALJ and the Board assumed that, without regard to the particular facts of the case, photographing of protected activity constitutes a <em>per se </em>violation of section 8(a)(1). We cannot agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>NLRB v. Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239 (3d Cir. 1976), this court enunciated the standard applicable in a section 8(a)(1) case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">To establish a violation of Section 8(a)(1), it need only be shown that <em>\u201cunder the circumstances existing, </em>[the employer\u2019s conduct] may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of rights protected under the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXv\">535 F.2d at 242, <em>quoting Local 542, International Union of Operating Engineers v. NLRB, </em>328 F.2d 850, 852-53 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 826, 85 S.Ct. 52, 13 L.Ed.2d 35 (1964) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <em>Armcor </em>court clearly recognized the need for case by case decision-making when examining alleged section 8(a)(1) violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">As the Board implicitly assumed, it is not essential to a finding of a section 8(a)(1) violation that the employer\u2019s conduct actually \u201cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees\u201d in the exercise of protected rights. <em>See, e.g., Armcor, </em>535 F.2d at 242. Rather, it is sufficient, as the Board stated, that the employer\u2019s conduct \u201cmay reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate\u201d employees in the exercise of these rights. <em>Id.; </em>Appendix at 257. The Board failed to recognize, however, that it is a reasonable tendency <em>under the circumstances </em>which governs the inquiry in each case. Consequently, the Board did not examine the factual setting of this case in reaching its conclusion that petitioner\u2019s surveillance was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">In <em>NLRB v. Computed Time Corp., </em>587 F.2d 790 (5th Cir. 1979), the Fifth Circuit confronted a case which presented a history similar to that in the instant case. In <em>Computed Time, </em>the Board had affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that the presence of management representatives at union functions has \u201can <em>inherent </em>tendency to impede employees in the exercise of their self-organization rights.\u201d 587 F.2d at 794 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Board ruled that such activity violates section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">The Fifth Circuit rejected the Board\u2019s <em>per se </em>doctrine. Surveillance by itself, the court held, does not violate the Act. Rather, \u201c[i]n order for an employer to violate Section 8(a)(1) by illegal surveillance ... he must \u2018interfere with, restrain, [or] coerce\u2019 employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights.\u201d 587 F.2d at 794, <em>quoting NLRB v. Atkins Saw Division of Nicholson File Co., </em>399 F.2d 907, 910 (5th Cir. 1968). The court noted that surveillance violates the Act \u201cbecause it indicates an employer\u2019s opposition to unionization\u201d and leads employees to think they are \u201cunder the threat of economic coercion, retaliation, etc.\u201d 587 F.2d at 794, <em>quoting Hendrix Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, </em>321 F.2d 100, 104-05 n.7 (5th Cir. 1963). <em>See Hedstrom Co. v. NLRB, (Hedstrom I), </em>558 F.2d 1137, 1144 n.18 (3d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>1977) (\u201cSurveillance which suggests coercion, or which inhibits the exercise of \u00a7 7 rights, violates \u00a7 8(a)(1).\u201d). Turning to the record before it, the court in <em>Computed Time </em>found no evidence of any interference, coercion, or restraint. Under the circumstances of the case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a section 8(a)(1) violation was not shown. 587 F.2d at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The <em>Computed Time </em>approach, examining surveillance in light of the circumstances of the case, was employed by federal appellate courts in many of the surveillance cases cited by the parties,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the ALJ and the Board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the courts in the remaining cases did not <em>expressly </em>connect the violation to the facts, <em>every </em>Board and federal appellate decision cited in which unlawful surveillance was found involved one or more of the following factors: a) an organizational or election campaign; b) evidence of anti-union animus; c) refusal to bargain; d) a strike; or e) independent unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In our view, the failure of these decisions explicitly to acknowledge the link between circumstances and viola-tive conduct does not justify the adoption of a <em>per se </em>rule which ignores these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The Board, in enunciating the <em>per se </em>rule in this case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> relied on three of its own decisions which found unlawful surveillance without <em>expressly </em>linking this finding to the circumstances. Nevertheless, each case presents facts which may be starkly contrasted to the peaceful relations in the instant case. <em>Glomac Plastics, Inc., </em>234 NLRB 1309 (1978) (Anti-union animus; bad-faith bargaining; pictures taken during strike); <em>Larand Leisurelies, Inc., </em>213 NLRB 197 (1974) (Pictures taken during unfair labor practice strike); <em>Flambeau Plastics Corp., </em>167 NLRB 735 (1967) (History of bad-faith bargaining; anti-union animus; pictures taken during strike).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Although the circumstances in this case were not discussed by the ALJ or the Board in relation to their finding of unlawful surveillance, the ALJ extensively discussed the circumstances of this case in reaching his conclusion that no remedial order was warranted. Appendix at 247-49. Indeed, a fair reading of the record shows that the ALJ essentially concluded that, under the circumstances, the petitioner\u2019s conduct did <em>not </em>reasonably tend to interfere with, restrain, or coerce the employees in the exercise of their protected rights. While ultimately dismissing the complaint, the ALJ, erroneously applying a <em>per se </em>doctrine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>found a technical violation of section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">With one exception, the Board on review did not disturb the AU\u2019s factual findings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record shows that amicable relations existed between petitioner and the Union; that employees were not economically dependent upon petitioner; that no independent unfair labor practice was committed by petitioner; and that the dispute did not harbor the potential for labor unrest as is present in disputes arising from organization or contract negotiation. Furthermore, the record shows that the demonstrators were good humored and the event peaceful; moreover, the participants did not shun identification.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, the record shows that petitioner engaged in the same practice during thirteen demonstrations over an eight-year period; there was no allegation that petitioner committed any unfair labor practice, such as a reprisal, arising from these occasions. We hold that, under these circumstances, petitioner\u2019s conduct did not reasonably tend to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their section 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Therefore, the decision and order of the Board will be set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-17\">. Section 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-20\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title [i.e., section 7 of the Act]....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-24\">. Both the ALJ and the Board concluded that the demonstration constituted concerted activity protected under section 7 of the Act. Appendix at 249, 258. In its reply brief, petitioner apparently disputes this conclusion for the first time. <em>See </em>Reply Brief of Petitioner at 4-5; Supplemental Brief of the NLRB at 1. We need not resolve this dispute in reaching our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">. Appendix at 248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">.

The \u201cunder the circumstances\u201d standard has been consistently applied by this court in section 8(a)(1) cases. See, <em>e.g., NLRB v. K &amp; K Gourmet Meats, Inc., </em>640 F.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Hedstrom Co. v.

The Board noted that petitioner had photographically recorded thirteen demonstrations over an eight-year period. (We note that no grievance was ever filed in regard to this practice. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 7.) In any event, we conclude that the frequency of petitioner\u2019s conduct does not alter our analysis in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">. Indeed, the employees and the Union actively sought publicity of the demonstration. Through the efforts of a publicity committee formed for this purpose, the public and the media were given advance notice of the demonstration. <em>As a result of these efforts, </em>1) a local newspaper publicized the demonstration nine days beforehand; 2) a Chicago area television station broadcast a film of the demonstration within one hour after it ended; 3) photographers from two Chicago area newspapers photographed the demonstrators; and 4) the newspaper of Local 65, which represents the employees involved, carried on the front page of its December 1979 issue photographs depicting identifiable demonstrators at the event, with an accompanying description. Appendix at 36-42; Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"A72\">The Board argues that picture-taking by third parties does not justify picture-taking by the employer, since the latter has the exclusive power to discipline. Appendix at 257-58. We need not confront this issue. We simply note that the seeking of publicity may be a relevant factor in determining whether, under the circumstances, employees feared future reprisals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b163-8\">A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">I set forth the Board\u2019s holding on the merits, because I think it is sound:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">In adopting the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, we note that it is well established that, absent legitimate justification, an employer\u2019s photographing of its employees while they are engaged in protected concerted activity constitutes unlawful surveillance. See, e.g., <em>Glomac Plastics, Inc., </em>234 NLRB 1309, 1320 (1978); <em>Larand Leisurelies, Inc., </em>213 NLRB 197, 207 (1974); <em>Flambeau Plastics Corporation, </em>167 NLRB 735, 743 (1967). We further find that Respondent has failed to establish any legitimate justification for its actions. In this regard, Respondent\u2019s superintendent, Studohar, who directed that arrangements be made for photographing the demonstration, testified that he did so for the purpose of securing evidence for possible litigation. However, he also admitted that he had no reason to anticipate that the participants in the demonstration would engage in violent or other illegal conduct. Furthermore, as noted above, the employees in fact did not engage in such conduct and Respondent did not institute any legal action as a result of the demonstration. In similar circumstances, the Board consistently has rejected the defense raised by Respondent here. Thus, it is well settled that \u201cpurely \u2018anticipatory\u2019 photographing of peaceful picketing in the event something \u2018might\u2019 happen does not justify [an employer\u2019s] conduct when balanced against the tendency of that con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>duct to interfere with the employees\u2019 right to engage in concerted activity.\u201d <em>Glomac Plastics, Inc., supra. </em>We, therefore, find Respondent\u2019s conduct violative of Section 8(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">255 N.L.R.B. No. 164, at 2-4 (May 7, 1981) (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Judge Hunter\u2019s thoughtful opinion for the majority accurately characterizes the Board\u2019s action. The Board did <em>not </em>examine the circumstances of <em>this </em>case when it concluded that the company\u2019s conduct tended to coerce the employees. Rather, the Board invoked a presumption that such photographing tends to coerce, and it placed the burden on the company to justify its conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Were we writing on a clean slate, I might agree that a close examination of whether coercion <em>in fact </em>occurred should be required in every ease. We are obviously obliged, however, to follow Supreme Court precedent, and at least one case specifically authorizes the procedures employed by the Board. In <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89, 1372 (1945) the Court held that the Board may, by decisional rule, create a presumption that a particular <em>class </em>of conduct is coercive under \u00a7 8(a)(1). Once the general counsel shows that such presumptively coercive conduct has occurred, the employer may avoid liability only by showing that, under the circumstances, its conduct was justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In <em>Republic Aviation </em>the Board had invoked a presumption that a no solicitation rule which precluded union solicitation on the employer\u2019s premises during non-working periods was invalid in the absence of special justification. The Court perceived \u201cno error in the Board\u2019s adoption of this presumption,\u201d 324 U.S. at 804, 65 S.Ct. at 988, and specifically approved placing the burden on the employer to show that the presumptively coercive restrictions were justified by \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d 324 U.S. at 803-4, n.10, 65 S.Ct. at 987-88, n.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">I need not discuss at any length the deference that we are obliged to afford the Board in its interpretation and effectuation of the National Labor Relations Act. In my view, it is reasonable to presume as the Board did that purely \u201canticipatory\u201d photographing of concerted activities tends to coerce as that term is used in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">However, I agree with the Board that the company failed to establish a justification for the taking of pictures in these circumstances. It is clear in this case that United States Steel had no reason to believe that any unlawful conduct was occurring. I therefore think it was proper for the Board to conclude that the company\u2019s conduct was an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(a)(1). I would affirm the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Certainly, some picture-taking is, at times, justified. Because litigation is so often a possibility in situations such as these, and because photographs are often the most useful records of what transpired, the company should be able to defend its conduct if it can show that it reasonably believed at the time it took the pictures that some form of unlawful conduct was occurring.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. Interestingly, the employers in <em>Republic Aviation </em>argued that an unfair labor practice finding must be supported by \u201cevidence before the Board to show that the rules and orders of the employers interfered with and discouraged union organization in the circumstances and situation of each company.\u201d 324 U.S. at 798, 65 S.Ct. at 985. The Court specifically rejected such an approach, and upheld instead the Board\u2019s presumption, a course which the majority in this case, by adopting an \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d test, has chosen not to follow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A1B\">. The Seventh Circuit has upheld the Board\u2019s right to place the burden on the employer to justify its actions in such situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlY\">We conclude that the Board may properly require a company to provide a solid justification for its resort to anticipatory photographing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apb\"><em>NLRB v. Colonial Haven Nursing Home, </em>[MO 542 F.2d 691, 701 (7th Cir. 1976)].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
