Robinson appeals from a judgment of the district court awarding Robinson only nominal damages for a violation of his right to procedural due process at a prison disciplinary hearing. Robinson contends that the defendants failed to prove that the denial of procedural due process did not alter the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding. Robinson also alleges that the district court erred in dismissing his claim against defendant Mason.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Defendant Wright has cross-appealed, alleging that the district court abused its discretion in failing to reduce or apportion the attorney\u2019s fees awarded in this case pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">We have carefully reviewed Robinson\u2019s claims and considered the district court\u2019s opinion, the briefs and the arguments of the parties. We find no error of law or fact and accordingly affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the rules of this court on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">We have also reviewed the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the case of <em>Eckerhart v. Hensley, </em>664 F.2d 294 (8th Cir. 1981) (unpublished), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1610, 71 L.Ed.2d 847 (1982). The question presented for review in that case is \u201cshould the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1988, be proportioned to accurately reflect [the] extent to which plaintiff has prevailed on the merits of his lawsuit in district court.\u201d 50 U.S.L.W. 3690. In this case, Robinson prevailed on only one of a number of claims raised and the district court awarded 100 percent of the fee requested by Robinson\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">In view of the apparent relevance of the <em>Hensley </em>case to the attorney\u2019s fees issue raised by the defendant, we remand the question of attorney\u2019s fees to the district court for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming disposition of the <em>Hensley </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
