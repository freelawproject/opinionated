Petitioner claims that the NRC violated the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in failing to consider, prior to granting the requested amendment, the long-range future effects of permitting the increased storage capacity, including the situation as it will exist on the date of the plant\u2019s permanent closing in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">We note that this same issue has, heretofore in the recent past, been raised in, and addressed by, this court. In <em>Minnesota v. NRC, </em>602 F.2d 412 (D.C.Cir.1979), this court, on virtually an identical set of facts, found itself unable to sustain, as against a claim of NEPA violation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an NRC order amending an operating license to expand spent fuel storage capacity, absent a meaningful exploration by the agency of the dangers presented by the continuing existence of the storage pool after the final closing date of the plant, and a finding based thereon that either (1) a satisfactory solution is presently available or (2) there is a reasonable probability of such availability by the shut-down date. This is precisely what the NRC failed to do in the case before us. Mindful of our rules with respect to the maintenance of uniformity in dispositions of like cases by different divisions of this court, we conform the result we reach in this case to that one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">In <em>Minnesota, </em>the court, despite the apparent NEPA violation, declined to vacate or stay the license amendment in question, indicating instead that the Commission was free to proceed with consideration of the effects of modifying the spent fuel storage capacity by such means as it might deem effective to that end. The court was careful to say that it did not contemplate that a trial-type adjudicatory proceeding was required, and it suggested the appropriateness of the generic rulemaking which the NRC had professed to have in view. Adopting the court\u2019s suggestion, on August 2, 1979, the NRC noticed a generic proceeding to reassess the outlook for the availability of safe nuclear waste disposal methods, focusing on the specific question raised by the <em>Minnesota </em>court. This rulemaking, termed by the Commission the \u201cWaste Confidence\u201d proceeding, is currently continuing. Therefore, as in <em>Minnesota, </em>we decline to vacate or stay the challenged license amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">The Commission has recently informed the court, in response to a specific inquiry by it after this case was taken under submission, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-12\">[t]he earliest that the proceeding might conclude and a decision issue would be about six months after the January 1982 oral presentations, but it is possible that a year or more might pass before a final Commission decision could be reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amk-dedup-1\">NRC Response to Request Concerning Status of Waste-Confidence Proceeding, at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>2-3. Implicit, however, in the disposition by the panel in <em>Minnesota </em>was the assumption that the NRC would proceed as expeditiously as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Under these circumstances, and taking into account the lengthy period of time that has elapsed since <em>Minnesota, </em>as well as the scientific and technical difficulties that appear to characterize this problem, we think an appropriate response to the NRC\u2019s latest progress report is for us to assert that its failure to act by June 30, 1983, will place in jeopardy the expanded authority at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The case is remanded to the NRC for further proceedings and consideration consistent with the purposes of this remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">.

I write separately, however, to illuminate the substantive issues underlying our <em>per curiam </em>disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">In 1971, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authorized the construction of VEPCO\u2019s North Anna power plant, the Commission also authorized the construction of an on-site pool for used or \u201cspent\u201d fuel assemblies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time, both the NRC and the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) expected the pool to be used to cool spent fuel assemblies for periods of five months, after which time the assemblies would be shipped to an off-site reprocessing or storage facility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As originally constructed, the North Anna spent-fuel pool could hold 400 spent fuel assemblies, more than would have had to be stored in the pool at any one time if the anticipated off-site facilities had been developed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such facilities, however, have not been developed and the North Anna spent-fuel pool has become a <em>de facto </em>mid-term nuclear waste repository, and may yet become a long-term repository.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the storage capacity of the spent-fuel pool has come to impose an impending constraint on the continued operation of the plant. Once the pool is full, and the last fuel assembly in the reactor is spent, the reactor cannot be refueled and the plant will have to shut down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-16\">From virtually the beginning of the North Anna plant\u2019s operating life,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> VEPCO recognized the critical function that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>spent-fuel pool would serve, and on May 1, 1978, it applied for an amendment to its operating license that would allow an expansion of the pool\u2019s capacity to 966 spent fuel assemblies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> VEPCO proposed to increase the pool\u2019s capacity by replacing the original storage racks with new, more closely spaced racks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The pool itself was to remain the same size. Without this modification, VEPCO predicts that the North Anna plant would be able to continue full operation only until the end of 1984.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">In reviewing VEPCO\u2019s application, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board analyzed the need for increased storage capacity at North Anna, alternatives to the proposed expansion, and the environmental effects of the expansion through the year 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board limited its environmental analysis to pre-2011 environmental effects because the plant\u2019s operating license expires in 2011. On the basis of its analysis, the Board concluded that \u201cthe proposed license amendment will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and that there will be no significant environmental impact attributable to the proposed action other than that which has already been predicted and described in the Final Environmental Statement dated November 1973.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Licensing Board also concluded that the alternatives to expanding the pool\u2019s capacity were either infeasible or environmentally less desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">On January 29, 1979, the Potomac Alliance was granted leave to intervene in North Anna\u2019s licensing proceeding,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and on June 15 of that year, the Alliance moved to introduce the issue of post-2011 environmental effects into the Licensing Board\u2019s determination of environmental significance. The Alliance argued that NEPA requires the Licensing Board to consider the environmental consequences of the proposed amendment over the entire time period during which the pool might be used for spent-fuel storage \u2014 even if that period extended beyond the operating life of the plant. Specifically, the Alliance contended that, under NEPA, the Board was obliged to undertake a two-step inquiry before approving the amendment: First, the Board needed to assess the possibility that the additional spent fuel contemplated by VEP-CO\u2019s proposal would remain in the on-site pool beyond the year 2011. If, at the time the proposal was evaluated, that contingency appeared \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d the Board was then required to consider its likelihood and environmental impact. In August 1979, however, the Board declined to consider the possibility of such a long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>term impact and approved VEPCO\u2019s license amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Potomac Alliance thereafter appealed the Licensing Board\u2019s decision to the Commission\u2019s Appeal Board but did not seek a stay pending the outcome of its appeal. VEPCO, therefore, proceeded with the expansion of the pool, completing the job on September 11, 1979, and placing the first load of spent fuel assemblies in the storage pool on October 17,1979. Ultimately, the Appeal Board affirmed the Licensing Board\u2019s decision and the Commission itself denied review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Potomac Alliance now seeks review of the NRC\u2019s action in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The NRC does not claim that its environmental assessment satisfied NEPA. Instead, the Commission argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Minnesota v. </em>NRC<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> authorized it to approve VEPCO\u2019s license amendment without considering the post-2011 environmental effects of doing so. This court has concluded that the NRC violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to consider the possibility that the expansion of the North Anna spent-fuel pool will result in additional nuclear waste remaining in the pool, and causing environmental damage, beyond 2011. Furthermore, the court has rejected the NRC\u2019s reading of <em>Minnesota </em>as providing blanket authority for its approval of spent-fuel pool expansions without a complete environmental assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">The present controversy centers on the NRC\u2019s compliance with section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-12\">The Congress authorizes and directs that, to the fullest extent possible ... all agencies of the Federal Government shall . . . include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-13\">(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-14\">(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-15\">(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-16\">As the Supreme Court has emphasized, these provisions impose on the agencies duties that are \u201cessentially procedural.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The particular duty involved in this case arises out of the agency\u2019s obligation to determine whether an action \u201csignificantly affect[s] the quality of the human environment.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That obligation imposes on the agency an essentially procedural duty<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to consider the environmental effects of a proposed action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our role, as established by the Administrative Procedure Act, is to determine whether the NRC made the decision now under review \u201cwithout observance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>of procedure required by law.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We may not substitute our own judgment for that of the NRC. Whether the benefits of expanding the North Anna spent-fuel pool outweigh the costs is a question we are ill-equipped and unauthorized to answer. Our limited objective, therefore, is to determine what procedures NEPA requires and whether the NRC has followed them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">B. <em>NEPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The starting point in any analysis-of an agency\u2019s compliance with section 102(2)(C) of NEPA is the \u201crule of reason,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> under which a federal agency proposing a major action must consider only the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If, after considering such prospective effects, the agency finds that the proposed action will not \u201csignificantly affect[ ] the quality of the human environment,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> then its obligation under section 102(2)(C) is satisfied, and it may proceed with the action. If, on the other hand, the agency cannot make a finding of insignificance, it must consider the environmental impact of the proposed action in greater detail and issue a detailed environmental impact statement before it may proceed. In this case, the NRC considered all environmental effects of VEPCO\u2019s license amendment through the year 2011 and concluded that the amendment would not significantly affect the environment. The only issue for this court to decide, therefore, is whether the NRC properly terminated its environmental consideration without assessing the possibility that there will be any post-2011 effects of the amendment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">The primary feature of VEPCO\u2019s license amendment is its provision allowing 966 rather than 416 spent fuel assemblies to be stored in the North Anna spent-fuel pool.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As a result of the amendment, the extra 550 fuel assemblies, along with the initially authorized 416, will remain in the pool until off-site waste-management facilities are developed, posing a possible environmental threat that continues as long as they are left there. Were it not for the license amendment, of course, those extra 550 spent fuel assemblies could not pose such a threat.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It follows that the time frame of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>a complete environmental assessment would have to extend throughout the period in which the spent fuel could, under reasonably foreseeable circumstances, remain in the North Anna pool. Such an assessment would necessarily include an analysis of the likelihood that off-site waste-management facilities will be available by the year 2011. If the NRC were to find it reasonably foreseeable that off-site facilities will not be available, then the NRC would have to assess the environmental implications of leaving the additional spent fuel in the pool until such facilities become available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Anything less would fail to satisfy the mandate of NEPA; for not only does section 102(2)(C) of NEPA generally contemplate comprehensive environmental review, but particular provisions of the Act explicitly mandate concern for the long run. Section 102(2)(C) itself requires agencies that propose major actions that will significantly affect the environment to consider and disclose \u201cthe relationship between local short-term uses of man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, section 101(b), which articulates the ultimate purposes of NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements, establishes the federal government\u2019s continuing responsibility to \u201cfulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3fP\">The NRC, therefore, can justify truncating its environmental assessment at the year 2011 only if it has found that no reasonably foreseeable contingency exists under which the spent fuel assemblies will remain in the pool beyond that time. Because the agency has not even attempted to make such a showing, we can only conclude that the approval of VEPCO\u2019s amendment violated NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">This court addressed a similar problem in <em>Concerned About Trident v. </em>Rumsfeld.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In that case, the Navy had assessed the environmental effects of a proposed submarine base for only the first seven years after construction began. Because the Navy had not shown that all significant environmental effects would cease after seven years, the court found the abbreviated environmental assessment wholly inadequate. As we stated in that case, such short-sightedness \u201cfails to ensure that the environment will be preserved and enhanced for the present generation, much less our descendants.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">The fact that the spent fuel at issue in this case may not \u2014 or even, probably will not \u2014 remain in the North Anna storage pool beyond 2011 does not allow the NRC to ignore any reasonably foreseeable possibility that it will. It is well recognized that a lack of certainty concerning prospective environmental impacts cannot relieve an agency of responsibility for considering reasonably foreseeable contingencies that could lead to environmental damage.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Many ultimate impacts on the environment are the result of prospectively uncertain, unlikely, contingent events, and while an agency cannot be asked to engage in a \u201ccrystal ball\u201d inquiry or to \u201cforesee the unforeseeable,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> neither can it be allowed to abjure \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>formed prediction\u201d of possibilities.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> When confronting a set of uncertain environmental effects, an agency\u2019s goal must be to trace each reasonably foreseeable contingency and determine, first, the likelihood of its occurring, and second, the environmental damage that would result should it occur. Of course, precision in this context can only be the ideal, and where an agency\u2019s analysis is constrained by the availability of information or by technical feasibility, NEPA requires only that the agency disclose that which is unknown.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> At the threshold stage of the NEPA inquiry, however, an agency must determine, to the extent feasible, whether the sum of all reasonably foreseeable effects, discounted by the probability of their occurrence, represents a \u201csignificant\u201d effect on the environment. If it does, then the agency must issue an EIS analyzing the probabilistic facets of the prospective environmental impact.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">C. <em>Minnesota v. NRC</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIgS\">The NRC argues that <em>Minnesota </em>eliminated any obligation it may have had under NEPA to consider the possibility that nuclear waste will remain in a spent-fuel pool beyond the point at which a nuclear plant is expected to shut down. <em>Minnesota v. </em>NRC<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> involved two consolidated license amendments similar to the one at issue here.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As in this case, the NRC had limited its environmental review to the period covering the operating lives of the plants. In contrast to the present case, however, the licensing boards and the Appeal Board in <em>Minnesota, </em>explicitly found that the spent-fuel pools would not be used beyond the time that the plants were expected to shut down. On the basis of that finding, the Appeal Board ruled that the NRC staff was correct in limiting its environmental assessment to the period over which the plant would remain in operation. In reviewing the Appeal Board\u2019s decision for compliance with both NEPA and the Atomic Energy Act, this court focused upon the Board\u2019s conclusion that no spent fuel assemblies would remain in the spent-fuel pool beyond the time at which the plant would shut down. The court found that this forecast was based solely on a prior Commission decision denying a petition for a rulemaking to determine whether nuclear waste can be stored and disposed of without undue risk to the public health and safety.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In that decision, the Commission had asserted its \u201creasonable confidence that the wastes can and will in due course be disposed of safely.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Because that \u201cconfidence,\u201d however, was not the product of a rulemaking record,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the court remanded the case to the NRC for further consideration. In doing so, the court directed the Commission to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>In the course of its decision, the <em>Minnesota </em>court noted that the NRC was in the process of conducting a generic proceeding in which the issue of long-term waste storage was of central concern. The court stated that the Commission could carry out its responsibilities on remand within the context of the ongoing proceeding, in a separate generic proceeding, or in any other manner it deemed appropriate.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> However, despite its implicit conclusion that the NRC had approved the license amendments without complying with either NEPA or the Atomic Energy Act,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> the <em>Minnesota </em>court declined to vacate or stay the license amendment.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>the specific problem isolated by petitioners \u2014 determining whether there is reasonable assurance that an off-site storage solution will be available by the years 2007-09, the expiration of the plants\u2019 operating licenses, and if not, whether there is reasonable assurance that the fuel can be stored safely at the sites beyond those dates.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>The Commission points out that in response to this court\u2019s remand in <em>Minnesota, </em>it began a rulemaking to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJL\">assess generically the degree of assurance now available that radioactive waste can be safely disposed of, to determine when such disposal or off-site storage will be available, and to determine whether radioactive wastes can be safely stored on-site past the expiration of existing facility licenses until off-site disposal or storage is available.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">That rulemaking, referred to as the \u201cWaste Confidence\u201d proceeding, is still in progress, and the Commission has given little indication of when it will come to a conclusion.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Commission, nevertheless, argues that as long as the proceeding is under way, it may continue to approve the expansion of spent-fuel pools\u2019 capacity without considering either the prospect of developing off-site waste-management facilities or the environmental consequences of using on-site storage pools as long-term repositories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">The essential problem with the NRC\u2019s argument is its limitlessness. Certainly, the NRC cannot contend that <em>Minnesota </em>afforded it an unbounded time period in which to hold generic proceedings, and to continue to authorize the expansion of on-site storage pools without considering the long-term environmental consequences of such expansions. There is nothing in <em>Minnesota </em>to support such a position. The <em>Minnesota </em>court found that the NRC had approved license amendments for two plants in violation of NEPA and the Atomic Energy Act, but, as a matter of equity, the court chose not to order the shut-down of the plants pending the Commission\u2019s compliance. Although the balance of equities in a similar situation arising within a reasonable amount of time after <em>Minnesota </em>would continue to weigh against forcing a plant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>shut down, that balance can change as time goes on and as the particular circumstances of different cases vary.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This court has determined that, as of now, the balance of equities still weighs against enjoining VEP-CO from storing additional waste in the North Anna spent-fuel pool. The court has also determined, however, that after June 30, 1983, the balance of equities in a case like the present one may well shift. After that point, the mandate of <em>Minnesota </em>will no longer stand as blanket authority for the NRC to avoid considering the long term impact of license amendments like the one at issue in this case.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">. A fuel assembly is a bundle of approximately 200 long thin fuel rods containing the enriched uranium pellets that fuel the fission reaction. A typical reactor core is comprised of about 157 assemblies. When the fuel elements of the core have expended much of their available energy content, they cannot maintain an efficient chain reaction. Therefore, they must be removed from the reactor and replaced with new assemblies. At the time the spent fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor, they are intensely radioactive and physically hot. To allow for radioactive decay as well as physical cooling, the assemblies are placed in a \u201cspent-fuel pool\u201d adjacent to the reactor. The spent-fuel pool is a deep reinforced concrete basin that is lined with stainless steel and filled with water. At the bottom of the pool, there are long stainless steel sleeve-like racks that hold the assemblies vertically under the water. The water serves both to cool the assemblies and to absorb the radiation that they emit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">.

As initially constructed, however, the racks in the pool would only accommodate 400 assemblies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1086-19\">. This new-found role of the spent-fuel pool is not unique to the North Anna plant. Nuclear facilities throughout the country have come to depend on their on-site spent-fuel pools as <em>de facto </em>repositories due to the absence of off-site waste-management facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1086-20\">. The NRC granted VEPCO an operating license for Unit No. 1 of the North Anna plant on November 26, 1977, and it granted VEPCO an operating license for Unit No. 2 on August 21, 1980. The spent-fuel pool is used for both units.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">. According to the NRC, 59 license amendments have been granted to expand on-site storage capacity at 62 power plants. 52 of those amendments predated this court\u2019s decision in <em>Minnesota v. NRC, </em>602 F.2d 412 (D.C.Cir.1979). <em>See </em>section II-C <em>infra. </em>In addition there are currently nine applications pending to expand spent-fuel pools, not including the one at issue in this case. See NRC brief at 4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">. The original racks held spent fuel assemblies 21 inches apart, while the new racks would hold the assemblies 14 inches apart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">. VEPCO brief at 10. VEPCO predicts that if it could only store 416 spent fuel assemblies in the North Anna spent-fuel pool, Unit No. 2 would be able to continue full-power operation until November 1984 and Unit No. 1 would be able to continue until May 1985. After May 1983, however, 416 fuel assemblies will be in the spent-fuel pool, which would mean that the fuel in the reactors would have to remain there until alternative storage facilities become available. VEPCO states that this would not present any safety problems, but that it would make repairs and maintenance more difficult. Ideally, space is left open in the spent-fuel pool so that fuel assemblies can be removed temporarily to facilitate maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"AhiL\">VEPCO applied for the license amendment far in advance in order to replace the storage racks before any spent fuel assemblies were placed in the pool and thereby avoid radiological risks that otherwise would threaten the workers replacing the racks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">.

Radioactive wastes that are generated by a nuclear power plant, like smoke that is produced by a coal-fired plant, are inextricable byproducts of the plant\u2019s operation. As such, the environmental effects of storing or disposing of those wastes must be considered before a plant may be licensed to produce them. In concluding that the NRC must consider the environmental effects of waste management prior to licensing a nuclear power plant, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[i]t is hard to argue that [nuclear] wastes do not constitute \u2018adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,\u2019 or that by operating nuclear power plants we are not making \u2018irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. </em>v. <em>NRC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 539, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1209, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">. Technically, the amendment changed the license in two respects: It decreased the minimum distance between stored fuel assemblies; and it increased the maximum number of assemblies allowed to be stored in the pool.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1089-16\">. Intervenor VEPCO claims that the license amendment \u201cdoes not extend the time that fuel assemblies may be stored at the site by a single day.\u201d VEPCO brief at 3. What VEPCO apparently means is that a new license amendment would be needed in the year 2011 if the spent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>fuel pool were to continue being used as a waste repository. In the context of a NEPA review, however, this claim is somewhat disingenuous; for if no satisfactory off-site facilities are available in 2011, there will be little choice but to leave the spent fuel assemblies in the pool. As far as 550 of those assemblies are concerned, therefore, the decision to leave them in the pool beyond 2011 would have been effectively made when the present license amendment was approved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(iv) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(b)(1) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">. 555 F.2d 817 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">. 555 F.2d at 830.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">. <em>See, e.g., Izaak Walton League of America </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>655 F.2d 346, 377 (D.C.Cir.1981); Al<em>aska v.

In addition, if the Commission determines it is not reasonably probable that an offsite waste disposal solution will be available when the licenses of the plants in question expire, it then must determine whether it is reasonably probable that the spent fuel can be stored safely onsite for an indefinite period.

In response to a post-argument inquiry of this court, the NRC stated that \u201c[t]he earliest that the proceeding might conclude and a decision issue would be about six months after the January 1982 oral presentations, but it is possible that a year or more might pass before a final Commission decision could be reached.\u201d NRC Response to Request Concerning Status of Waste-Confidence Proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">. In addition, the <em>Minnesota </em>court concentrated primarily on the public health and safety standard of the Atomic Energy Act, and not on the procedural requirements of NEPA, which it characterized as less rigorous \u201cin certain aspects.\u201d 602 F.2d at 418 n.8. This court expresses no view on the mandate of the Atomic Energy Act. To the extent that the requirements of that act differ from those of NEPA, however, it may be that the Commission can reasonably be expected to comply with NEPA \u2014 either generically or on a case-by-case basis \u2014 in a shorter period of time than it must take to comply with the Atomic Energy Act. As stated above, NEPA requires informed prediction where feasible, but where the information needed for such prediction cannot be uncovered, an agency\u2019s candid description of what remains unknown will usually suffice. See p. 1036 &amp; note 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">.

As of now, there is no need for this court to take any action to alter VEPCO\u2019s license amendment. The North Anna plant will not need the extra storage space that the amendment authorizes for at least two and a half years. During that time, a variety of events could occur that would alter the balance of equities involved in enjoining the storage of more than 416 spent fuel assemblies at North Anna. I would have preferred, therefore, to defer decision as to the proper remedy until VEPCO needs the extra storage space. At that time, if the NRC were still out of compliance with NEPA, I would strongly consider enjoining additional storage of spent fuel in the North Anna pool.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
