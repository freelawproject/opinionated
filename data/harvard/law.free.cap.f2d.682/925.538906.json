There being no factual dispute, the court is asked to determine whether prevailing rate wage employees who were promoted to General Schedule supervisory positions before June 26, 1974, are entitled to a further increase in wages under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333 and/or 5334 and their implementing regulations. To the extent that this question has not been reached by the recent Supreme Court decision of <em>United States v. Clark, </em>454 U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 805, 70 L.Ed.2d 768 (1982), we hold that these federal employees are not entitled to a further increase in wages under either statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">The case at bar involves two totally separate federal pay systems, namely the prevailing rate wage (WS) and General Schedule (GS) systems. An understanding of the interplay between these two systems is necessary before plaintiffs\u2019 claim for increased wages can be reviewed. The GS system, governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5331 <em>et seq., </em>is a nationwide pay system divided into numbered grades and applicable to federal \u201cwhite collar\u201d employees. <em>See United States v. Clark, supra. </em>The numbered grades are further divided into \u201csteps\u201d up which the employee travels with longevity on the job. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332. \u201cThe salary for each step of each grade in the GS is uniform nationwide.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">On the other hand, pay rates for comparable work under the WS system may vary nationwide. This is so because the WS, which applies generally to \u201cblue collar\u201d employees, provides that employees are to be paid at the <em>local </em>prevailing rate for comparable work. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5343. As prices in different geographic areas vary, so, too, do pay rates for comparable work. In some areas, the prevailing rate is so high that WS employees may earn more than the GS employees who supervise them, creating what is known as a \u201cpay inversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">In Title 5, Congress took steps to lessen the impact of \u201cpay inversion\u201d on GS employees. Section 5334, which applies to the initial setting of pay for GS employees whose positions have been changed in some manner, specifies the appropriate methods for calculation of the new wage rates. Section 5334 applies to all GS employees regardless of whether they serve in a supervisory capacity. Subsection 5334(a), through its implementing regulations, authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>calculation of wages in accordance with the \u201chighest previous rate\u201d rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Section 5334 applies to all GS employees, but subsection 5333(b) <em>only </em>applies to GS employees who occupy some supervisory role over WS subordinates. Subsection 5333(b) provides further salary relief for some GS supervisors whose WS subordinates receive higher wages than they do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, if the reader has followed us so far, a former WS employee promoted to a GS supervisory position over his previous posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>tion, as here, has two sets of entitlements by statute: to maintenance of his basic pay at his highest previous rate (section 5334(a) and regulations) and also to basic pay above his new subordinate\u2019s pay (section 5333(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">In addition to the relief afforded under \u00a7\u00a7 5333 and 5334, all GS employees, who are employed in certain areas outside the continental United States, are entitled to receive cost-of-living allowances (COLA) on top of their regular salaries. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941. WS employees are not, as their prevailing wage is based on the cost-of-living.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The instant case requires a determination of the proper treatment of COLA in relation to the calculations made under \u00a7\u00a7 5333 and 5334. Briefly stated, before June 26, 1974, the impact of COLA was considered by the Navy in all comparisons made under \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a). After June 26, 1974, COLA was excluded from comparisons made under \u00a7 5334(a) but maintained for those comparisons performed under \u00a7 5333(b). This distinction is critical and its importance will become evident in parts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Plaintiffs, in this case, are or were civilian employees at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Hawaii. Plaintiffs were either promoted or transferred from WS positions to GS supervisory positions. Plaintiffs were, therefore, entitled to salary relief under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334 solely by virtue of their transfer into the GS system. Because they were appointed to GS supervisory positions, plaintiffs were also entitled to have their pay adjusted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b). Furthermore, GS employees in Hawaii receive COLA in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941. When the promotions and/or transfers occurred before June 26, 1974, the Navy, in complying with its then current interpretation of both the pertinent statutes and regulations, took COLA into account in deciding whether plaintiffs were entitled to an increase in pay. The net effect of the Navy\u2019s actions was to award plaintiffs a lower salary than they would have otherwise received after June 26,1974, when COLA was not taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Plaintiffs expressed their dissatisfaction with the pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation and application of the pertinent statutes and regulations to Naval authorities. Plaintiffs also filed a group grievance with the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and sought the aid of their elected representatives to Congress. Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts came to naught and, on May 25, 1979, plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Upon plaintiffs\u2019 motion to transfer the suit to the Court of Claims with respect to five of the eight plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s concurrence therewith, this case was transferred to this court on August 1, 1979, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Plaintiffs filed their petition in this court on September 25, 1979, alleging that defendant\u2019s inclusion of COLA in the calculation violated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a) and had deprived plaintiffs of their constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The parties moved for summary judgment and oral argument was heard on January 13, 1981. By this time, plaintiffs\u2019 claims had expanded to. include an alleged violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an issue, if resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, could conceivably have rendered plaintiffs\u2019 other claims moot. This court had recently addressed this same issue in <em>Clark v. United States, </em>220 Ct.Cl. 278, 599 F.2d 411 (1979), and had held that \u201cthe two-step increase\u201d rule of \u00a7 5334(b) applied to all WS employees transferring to GS positions. On notice that the Supreme Court had granted certio-rari to hear argument in <em>United States v. Clark, </em>we stayed our decision in the present case pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. On January 12, 1982, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Clark </em>and held that \u201cthe statute [\u00a7 5334(b)] and the accompa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>nying regulations reveal a congressional intent to apply the two-step increase provision of \u00a7 5334(b) only to promotions or transfers of employees already within the GS system.\u201d 454 U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 809-10. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for relief under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(b) must be denied. Plaintiffs\u2019 other claims must now be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">At the outset, it must be noted that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a) are not alternative grounds for recovery but are, in fact, separate and distinct legal entitlements for which plaintiffs could recover under either, all, or none of these theories. Accordingly, claims under \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a) will be dealt with separately. For the following reasons, we determine that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover under either \u00a7 5333(b) or 5334(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In applying the highest previous rate rule of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a) and its implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Navy initially compared the employee\u2019s highest previous rate earned in the WS system with the rate established for the GS position, plus the COLA to which that employee would be entitled. If the employee\u2019s highest previous rate exceeded the total of the GS salary plus COLA, the Navy would then raise the employee\u2019s rate of basic pay to a corresponding step at which level the GS salary plus COLA would exceed the employee\u2019s highest previous rate. At no time, however, did the Navy raise the employee\u2019s rate of basic pay to a level that would place him in a higher grade. After June 26,1974, the Navy changed its interpretation of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c) and excluded the impact of COLA from its comparison. It is important to note that the Navy did not amend \u00a7 531.203(c), as of course it could not, but merely changed its interpretation of the pertinent section. This change in interpretation had the net effect of awarding higher overall wages to those WS employees who were promoted to GS positions after June 26, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The following example graphically portrays the effect of the Navy\u2019s change in interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-10\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"195\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"574\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Under the pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation, the GS employee would not be entitled to a higher starting pay rate because his or her GS basic pay plus COLA exceeded the employee\u2019s highest previous rate received under WS. After June 26, 1974, the Navy excluded COLA from the comparison under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a). Referring to our example, the GS basic pay rate was less than the employee\u2019s highest previous rate under WS; an upward adjustment in basic pay would then be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">In their submissions to this court, neither party has devoted much attention to arguments involving 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a). Both parties have, instead, argued that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b) is the controlling statute and have addressed \u00a7 5334(a) as a peripheral matter. The court finds the lack of discussion concerning \u00a7 5334(a) to be curious considering the Navy\u2019s change in interpretation <em>only </em>involved the setting of pay rates under \u00a7 5334(a). The court, therefore, believes that a thorough discussion of \u00a7 5334(a) is essential to a final decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">Plaintiffs argue that the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation violates both the plain meaning of \u00a7 5334 and its implementing regulations. Plaintiffs also contend that the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation contradicts congressional intent in enacting \u00a7 5334(a). Finally, plaintiffs argue that the pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation violates plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to equal protection as guaranteed by the fifth amendment. Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional argument is based upon the difference in treatment that occurred with respect to those WS employees promoted to GS posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>tions before June 26, 1974, such as plaintiffs, and those similarly situated employees promoted after June 26, 1974. Plaintiffs also add that they have been treated differently from those WS employees who were employed in non-COLA areas and promoted to GS positions. Plaintiffs state that the difference in treatment is evident not only in salaries, but also in retirement benefits and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Defendant argues that the Navy\u2019s change in interpretation should be applied only prospectively, citing <em>Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp. v. United States, </em>152 Ct.Cl. 352, 285 F.2d 131 (1961); <em>A. J. Myers v. United States, </em>180 Ct.Cl. 521, 378 F.2d 696 (1967). Defendant further argues that because CSC had impliedly ruled that the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c) was accurate, the change in interpretation should not be given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In subsection 5334(a), Congress gave broad authority to the CSC to prescribe regulations governing the appropriate rate of basic pay to which a GS employee would be entitled upon his or her promotion or transfer. In accordance with Congress\u2019 directive, the CSC promulgated the \u201chighest previous rate\u201d rule of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c). Neither the statute nor the regulation refer to the matter at issue here, whether COLA is to be included in the calculation performed under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c). It is solely the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation which would include COLA in the calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Great weight is to be given to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation even though the agency conclusion is not the only reasonable one or even one the court would have reached if the question had arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Nabisco, Inc. v. United States, </em>220 Ct.Cl. 332, 340, 599 F.2d 415, 419 (1979); <em>Saracena v. United States, </em>206 Ct.Cl. 90, 95, 508 F.2d 1333, 1336 (1975); <em>Port Authority of Saint Paul v. United States, </em>193 Ct.Cl. 108, 120, 432 F.2d 455, 461 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">In <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>the Supreme Court went on further to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-8\">Since this [case] involves an interpretation of an administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative consideration of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt. * * * [T]he ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. [380 U.S. at 16-17, 85 S.Ct. at 801 (citing <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">In the instant case, the Navy\u2019s interpretation of the regulation to include COLA in the calculation performed under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c) is clearly neither erroneous nor in conflict with the regulation or statute. The statute, \u00a7 5334(a), refers to the setting of initial rate of basic pay. \u201cRate of basic pay,\u201d a technical term, is defined, by regulation, as \u201cthe rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.202(i). By definition \u201crate of basic pay\u201d excludes COLA, as COLA is defined as an allowance under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.201(e). By referring to \u201crate of basic pay\u201d in \u00a7 5334(a), Congress obviously intended to use the term to establish wages in accordance with the GS rates set by statute. Nothing, however, in \u00a7 5334(a), and this is where plaintiffs\u2019 theory fails, dictates that COLA cannot be used to compute or establish the rate of basic pay to which a GS employee would be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Similarly, \u00a7 5334(a)\u2019s implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c), does not prohibit COLA from consideration. Section 531.203(c) refers to pay at rate of grade. While rate of grade is not defined, it can be safely assumed to mean a range of pay rates that correspond to a GS grade. The regulation, however, speaks to establishment of a pay rate and not to whether COLA is to be included or excluded in performing the mechanics of the comparison. Because neither the statute nor the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>tion prohibits or requires the inclusion of COLA in setting the GS employee\u2019s rate of basic pay, the agency\u2019s interpretation prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Further support for the reasonableness of the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation can be found when one considers what pay rates are being compared. WS pay rates are based upon the prevailing rate in a specific geographic area. By operation, WS pay rates necessarily include a cost-of-living allowance. GS basic pay rates do not include COLA. Therefore, by adding COLA to the GS pay rates and then comparing the total to the WS pay rate, the Navy is comparing equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Nor does the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation violate the guiding principle of \u201cequal pay for substantially equal work\u201d as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301. The Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation supplements the mandates of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.203(c) which merely provide that an employee transferred or promoted to one GS system will earn an equivalent or increased salary. If the GS position requires a greater degree or amount of work, this fact will then be reflected in the GS grade and rate of pay assigned to that position. If the position requires only equal work, the GS grade and rate of pay assigned to that position will reflect this fact. The Navy\u2019s pre-June 26,1974 interpretation does not affect the assignment of grade and rate of pay to a position. It merely provides the means of ensuring that an employee will not be harmed in transferring from the WS pay scale to the GS pay scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Plaintiffs argue that because the Navy has effectively recognized the alleged error of its ways and corrected its interpretation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a), the new interpretation should be given retroactive effect and applied to them. Defendant counters that the general rule that statutes are to be given prospective application unless otherwise stated should be analogized to the instant case. While we refuse to go as far as defendant would have us do, we agree that the post-June 26, 1974 interpretation should not be given retroactive effect. Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the validity of the Navy\u2019s post-June 26, 1974 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">What the post-June 26, 1974 interpretation effectively did was to overrule the Navy\u2019s earlier interpretation. This fact is of utmost importance in determining retroactive application of regulations and agency interpretations of them. <em>See Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 972, 981-84 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 2845, 56 L.Ed.2d 785 (1978). Ordinarily, if a new regulation or interpretation merely recites settled prior law or policy, then retroactive application of the regulation or interpretation is proper. If, however, the new regulation or interpretation overrules prior law or policy, the new regulation or interpretation will not, depending on various factors, be given retroactive effect. This distinction is obviously grounded upon notions of fairness to the involved parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">In the instant case, the Navy\u2019s post-June 26, 1974 interpretation did not recite settled prior law or policy. It effectively overruled prior policy. Thus, it should not be given retroactive effect. If the new interpretation would somehow have caused injury to plaintiffs if applied retroactively, plaintiffs would have undoubtedly argued against retroactive application. Merely because the new interpretation would benefit plaintiffs should not, in itself, supply the grounds for retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Now we turn to subsection 5333(b) and its implementing regulations which are expressly limited to GS supervisors whose WS subordinates earn more than they do. Because plaintiffs were promoted to GS positions supervising WS subordinates, subsection 5333(b) applies to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">In applying \u00a7 5333(b) and its implementing regulations, the Navy has consistently compared the rate of pay received by the highest paid subordinate with the <em>total </em>remuneration received by the GS supervisor, <em>i.e., </em>basic pay plus COLA. No change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>interpretation with respect to \u00a7 5333(b) and its implementing regulations occurred on June 26, 1974. Throughout the relevant time period, the Navy\u2019s manner of performing the comparison has not wavered. The Navy\u2019s change in interpretation with respect to \u00a7 5334(a) has, of course, had an impact on the supervisor\u2019s rate of basic pay even without a change under \u00a7 5333(b). Because the supervisor\u2019s pay rate is now theoretically set at a higher rate initially under \u00a7 5334(a) than before, the supervisor may now receive a higher pay rate (assuming his highest paid subordinate earns more than he) than plaintiffs who were promoted to supervisory positions before June 26, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The following table depicts the effect the Navy\u2019s change in interpretation with respect \u00a7 5334(a) has on \u00a7 5333(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-6\">Pre-June 26, 1974\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\"

New total pay rate would be $12.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">While it is true that some of the language used in the regulations, particularly language referring to rate of basic pay, would appear to support plaintiffs\u2019 theory, we believe plaintiffs\u2019 approach is a narrow one. It must be remembered that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.305(a)(2) was a subsequent addition to the regulations. Before \u00a7 531.305(a)(2) was added in 1967, the regulations did not refer to whether COLA was to be used in computing any adjustment to a supervisor\u2019s salary. The regulations merely contemplated adjustments to supervisor\u2019s salaries in those areas where GS personnel did not receive COLA. In 1967, provision was made, by way of \u00a7 531.305(a)(2), to include the cost of COLA in those areas where GS employees received the allowance. Hence, the language of the regulations must be read in this light.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-22\">In addition, it should be noted that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.303 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> refers to the equities of the situation between supervisors and wage board subordinates. The equities are not met if a comparison of only GS basic pay rates with wage board salaries is performed. Wage board salaries inherently reflect a cost-of-living allowance. Equivalents must be compared and to do so, COLA must be added to the basic GS salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-23\">Equities would also not be met if plaintiffs\u2019 theory was to be adopted. Under plaintiffs\u2019 theory, the cost of COLA is included in the calculation twice. No authority exists in either the regulations or the statute for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-24\">Finally, CSC, the agency responsible for drafting 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 531.304, 531.305, approved the Navy\u2019s interpretation of these same regulations. As we have said before, an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is to be given great weight unless the questioned interpretation is clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or statute. <em>Udall v. Tallman, supra; Nabisco, Inc. v. United States, supra; Saracena v. United States, supra; Port Authority of Saint Paul v. United States, supra. </em>In light of the Navy\u2019s consistent interpretation of \u00a7 5333(b) and its implementing regulations, with CSC approval, the inclusion of COLA in the comparison performed under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.305(a)(2) is clearly neither erroneous nor inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-25\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b988-26\">Plaintiffs also challenge the Navy\u2019s pre- and post-June 26, 1974 interpretations in that different classes of similarly situated persons were treated differently as viola-tive of the fifth amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection. Defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear claims based upon the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment because this constitutional provision does not obligate the Federal Government to pay money damages, cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>ing <em>Carruth v. United States, </em>224 Ct.Cl. 422, 627 F.2d 1068, 1081 (1980). Defendant further argues that even if this court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim, plaintiffs\u2019 claimed constitutional violation does not survive constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">This court does have jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for money damages is based upon 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a). Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection challenge is based upon the Navy\u2019s interpretation of these statutes. Or put another way, plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the subject statutes, if correctly construed according to the fifth amendment, require this court to award money damages. This is precisely the type of claim over which this court has jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>Gentry v. United States, </em>212 Ct.Cl. 1, 7, 546 F.2d 343, 346 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim is based upon two situations in which similarly situated persons are being treated differently. The first situation involves the different treatment afforded to those WS employees promoted to GS supervisory positions prior to June 26, 1974, and those similarly situated persons promoted after June 26, 1974. Plaintiffs are, obviously, members of the former class. Plaintiffs also argue that WS employees promoted to GS supervisory positions prior to June 26, 1974, in COLA areas are being treated differently than similarly situated persons employed in non-COLA areas. Plaintiffs argue that these two situations in which different treatment is afforded to the classes violates equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">With regard to plaintiffs\u2019 first attempt to invoke the protection of the equal protection clause, plaintiffs have failed to articulate a constitutional argument. Plaintiffs claim that by changing its interpretation of the pertinent statute and regulations, the Navy has treated similarly situated persons differently, <em>i.e., </em>persons promoted before and after June 26, 1974. Plaintiffs have not cited this court to any case in which any changes m interpretation or amendment of statutes or regulations gives rise to an equal protection challenge. Under plaintiffs\u2019 theory, any change, such as amendments to the minimum wage laws or amendments effecting decreases or increases in government entitlement benefits, would be subject to an equal protection challenge. This result is clearly absurd and would, if given support, effectively inhibit any legislative or other governmental body from amending its statutes or regulations. Our laws would become written in stone, thereby failing to account for changing times and changing demands of our citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second equal protection claim is based upon the different treatment afforded two classes of similarly situated persons. One class is comprised of persons, such as plaintiffs, who were promoted to GS supervisory positions and had COLA included in the calculations made under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a). The other class includes those persons promoted to GS supervisory positions who, because they lived in non-COLA areas, did not have COLA included in the calculations. When a class is neither suspect nor semi-suspect or the right allegedly infringed upon is neither fundamental nor quasi-fundamental, a \u201cminimum rationality standard is appropriate.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 312-13, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2566-67, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976); <em>See McDonald v. Board of Election, </em>394 U.S. 802, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969); <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Persons promoted to GS supervisory positions in COLA areas do not constitute a suspect or semi-suspect class. Nor is the right to employment and wages a fundamental or quasi-fundamental right. <em>See Massachusetts Board of Retirement, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 313, 96 S.Ct. at 2566-67. Thus, the minimum rationality test is the appropriate one to apply in this case. Under minimum rationality \u201c[i]f the classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u201d <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) (citing from <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Under this' standard, it is clear that the inclusion of COLA, where applicable, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) and 5334(a) is reasonable and, hence, constitutionally valid. Cost-of-living allowances are designed to offset the expense incurred by GS employees in living and working in high cost areas. WS pay rates, by their nature, reflect the cost-of-living. The Navy\u2019s inclusion of COLA in the calculation was reasonably designed to compare equivalents. Given the policy pronouncements of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.303, this purpose is both reasonable and rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Moreover, in non-COLA areas, GS employees receive only their basic pay rate, while WS employees receive the prevailing rate. If an adjustment to a GS employee\u2019s salary is made under either 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5333(b) or 5334(a), a comparison will be made of GS pay rates and WS pay rates. Because the cost-of-living is presumed to be significantly less in non-COLA areas, WS pay rates will reflect this fact and will be commensurately lower than their counterparts in COLA areas.

Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a), an employee transferred to the GS pay system from the prevailing rate wage system (WS) may have his initial GS salary adjusted upwards if his \u201crate of basic pay\u201d would not otherwise exceed his former WS wages. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b), a GS supervisor\u2019s salary may be adjusted if the supervisor\u2019s \u201crate of basic pay\u201d does not exceed the wages of the WS employees he supervises.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">\u201cRate of basic pay\u201d is defined as follows for purposes of both statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-12\">* * * \u201cRate of basic pay\u201d means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions and <em>exclusive of additional pay of any kind. </em>[5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.202(i) (1974) (defining the phrase for 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a) purposes); emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-13\"><em>Accord: 5 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 531.302(b) (defining the phrase for 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b) purposes). The rate of basic pay of plaintiff GS supervisors, as \u201cfixed by law,\u201d is found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332, which is entitled \u201cThe General Schedule\u201d and fixes by law the rate of basic pay of <em>all </em>GS employees. COLA is not included in the basic rate of pay \u201cfixed\u201d by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332 and would therefore be a \u201ckind\u201d of \u201cadditional pay,\u201d not to be taken into account for either statutory adjustment. This conclusion seemingly is obvious, but there are several additional reasons why COLA is not a part of a GS employee\u2019s \u201crate of basic pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">First, all GS employees in the 48 contiguous states, none of whom receives COLA, have basic rates of pay set by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332. It is absurd to argue that plaintiffs somehow have a different rate of basic pay than all these other GS employees, for plaintiffs\u2019 compensation is governed by the same basic pay statute as all other GS employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Second, COLA is not and was never intended to be basic pay. The very nomenclature, \u201callowance,\u201d belies the argument that COLA is basic pay. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941, COLA is clearly an allowance in <em>addition </em>to rates of basic pay fixed by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-5\">SUBCHAPTER IV. \u2014 MISCELLANEOUS ALLOWANCES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agx-dedup-0\">\u00a7 5941. <em>Allowances based on living costs and conditions of environment; employees stationed outside continental United States or in Alaska.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-6\">(a) Appropriations or funds available to an Executive agency, except a Government controlled corporation, for pay of employees stationed outside the continental United States or in Alaska whose <em>rates of basic pay </em>are fixed by statute, are available for allowances to these employees. The allowance is based on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-7\">(1) living costs substantially higher than in the District of Columbia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-8\">(2) conditions of environment which differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant an allowance as a recruitment incentive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">(3) both of these factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">The allowance may not exceed 25 percent of the <em>rate of basic pay. </em>Except as otherwise specifically authorized by statute, the allowance is paid only in accordance with regulations prescribed by the President establishing the rates and defining the area, groups of positions, and classes of employees to which each rate applies. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Although ignored by the majority, the case law interpreting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941 and predecessor provisions has long recognized COLA as an allowance <em>additional to </em>the GS rate of basic pay. <em>E.g., Shadduck v. United States, </em>142 Ct.Cl. 516, 517 (1958); <em>Kalv v. United States, </em>128 Ct.Cl. 207, 124 F.Supp. 654 <em>passim </em>(1954); <em>Curlott v. Campbell, </em>598 F.2d 1175, 1177 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>modifying Curlott v. Hampton, </em>438 F.Supp. 505 (D.Alas.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Third, the COLA percentage can be adjusted up or down based on regulations prescribed by the President with respect to living costs substantially higher than those in the District of Columbia and as a recruitment incentive allowance. By its very nature, then, COLA is geared to factors which have nothing to do with basic compensation for work performed, duties, and qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Fourth, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) long has <em>specifically excluded </em>COLA from the definition of \u201crate of basic pay.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>FPM 591(1) (1963); FPM 591(l)a(9) (1969) (currently in effect). Moreover, the FPM long has <em>specifically directed </em>that COLA is not to be included in the base used to determine \u201cany additional pay.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>FPM 591(4-1)d(1) (1963); FPM 591(4-1)d(1) (1969) (currently in effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Fifth, COLA received by Hawaii federal employees is subject to fundamentally different federal income tax treatment than is GS pay. GS compensation is fully includible as income and is thus fully <em>taxed; </em>under 26 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended) \u00a7 912(2), COLA paid to Hawaii federal employees is excluded from gross income and is fully <em>exempt from tax. </em>This, in my view, underscores the Congressional determination that there is a critical distinction between GS pay and COLA amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Sixth, defendant itself, has admitted COLA is not a part of the rate of basic pay by its reversal of policy in Civilian Manpower Management Instruction 531(S2-4)b(2), effective June 26, 1974. Under that Instruction, defendant has eliminated consideration of Hawaii COLA in determining, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a), the initial rate at which a GS employee who has moved from a WS position should be paid. Defendant, however, continues to maintain Hawaii COLA can be properly considered (1) in pre-June 26, 1974, initial rate calculations and (2) in portions of the comparative test under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b) for both pre- and post-June 26, 1974, periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">There are, of course, additional reasons for not considering COLA as part of the basic rate of pay. I have merely underscored the more obvious reasons for rejecting the continued consideration of COLA as basic pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>The majority repeatedly asserts that only by including COLA can a GS salary truly be compared with WS compensation. For example, the majority says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-4\">Further support for the reasonableness of the Navy\u2019s pre-June 26, 1974 interpretation can be found when one considers what pay rates are being compared. WS pay rates are based upon the prevailing rate in a specific geographic area. <em>By operation, WS pay rates necessarily include a cost-of-living allowance. </em>GS basic pay rates do not include COLA. Therefore, by adding COLA to the GS pay rates and then comparing the total to the WS pay rate, the Navy is comparing equivalents. [At p. 9, emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acf-dedup-0\">The majority\u2019s reasoning, obviously, assumes Hawaii COLA only reflects the higher cost of living in the Islands. But 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941 is clear that COLA may be based on either or both of <em>two </em>factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-5\">(1) higher living costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-6\">(2) an allowance as a recruitment incentive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">We simply do not know on this record whether Hawaii COLA or WS wages paid in Hawaii reflect any added costs of recruitment. It may well be (so far as we <em>really </em>know) that a recruitment allowance is present in Hawaii COLA to attract white collar workers to Hawaii, but no such recruitment factor is reflected in WS wages paid in Hawaii because of an abundance of local blue collar workers. We simply do not know, and I therefore find no support for the majority\u2019s bald assertion that by including COLA, the Navy is comparing equivalents. Further, even if we assume Hawaii COLA reflects only the higher cost of living there, it still does not follow that by including COLA the Navy is comparing equivalents. The majority\u2019s assumption that WS employees\u2019 pay in general contains the higher cost-of-living factor is nothing more than a guess. If a WS employee\u2019s wage does contain this factor, what percent of his pay covers this factor? Is it 25 percent or 5 percent? If the coverage is only 5 percent, it is grossly erroneous to assume 5 percent is equivalent to 15 percent, the stipulated COLA rate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Moreover, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the substantial constitutional issues herein. In my view, defendant\u2019s COLA policies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b) have irrationally created two sets or classifications of similarly situated but differently treated groups. The first such set consists of (1) those non-COLA, GS supervisors who are paid more than their subordinates and (2) those COLA, GS supervisors who are or were at times paid less than their subordinates. The second set of unequally and irrationally treated federal employees, created solely by defendant\u2019s policy and its refusal to apply the June 26, 1974, revision to plaintiffs, consists of (1) those COLA, GS supervisors who were promoted from WS to GS positions after June 26, 1974, and are therefore entitled to be paid more than their counterparts and (2) those COLA, GS supervisors who were promoted from WS to GS positions prior to June 26, 1974, and are therefore paid less than their counterparts even though they may have greater seniority. In each of the foregoing groups of supervisors, the former group is the arbitrarily favored class.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">As the majority points out, the critical test is whether there was a \u201crational basis\u201d for the creation of these distinctions between similarly situated groups. I perceive no need to repeat the authorities which the majority cites to establish that proposition. Applying this rational basis test to the instant case, it is clear defendant\u2019s policy of considering COLA in determining plaintiffs\u2019 rate of basic pay is unlawful. With respect to the first set of unequally treated supervisors, there is certainly no defensible rationale for defendant\u2019s penalizing COLA, GS supervisors as against non-COLA, GS supervisors. A non-COLA supervisor\u2019s base rate clearly is his rate fixed by the GS schedule. So is that of the COLA, GS supervisor. But solely because Hawaii supervisors receive COLA, they have been denied an increase of their base rate (with all the benefits incident thereto) over their subordinates under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b), while non-COLA supervisors with exactly the same base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>rates fixed by the GS schedule received these increases. The majority\u2019s argument that this distinction is rational is bottomed on the assumptions that \u201cWS pay rates, by their nature, reflect the cost-of-living\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Navy\u2019s inclusion of COLA in the calculation was reasonably designed to compare equivalents.\u201d As pointed out above, neither assumption is supported by this record. Simply put, COLA and WS wages cannot be presumed equivalent and the majority\u2019s assumption therefore can provide no basis for the distinctions wherein some supervisors receive an increase in their base rate while some do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">With respect to the second set of unequally treated COLA, GS supervisors, plaintiffs have been arbitrarily and wrongfully penalized a second time. Although COLA, GS supervisors promoted to GS from WS positions after June 26, 1974, have enjoyed significant pay increases and incidental employment benefits caused thereby, plaintiffs, who were promoted prior to June 26, 1974, have been denied equal treatment even though their circumstances are identical. Defendant concedes that the effect of not applying the June 26, 1974, reversal in policy to plaintiffs has been an anomalous and inequitable pay situation where plaintiffs are discriminated against <em>vis-a-vis </em>later-promoted supervisors and plaintiffs\u2019 subordinates. There is no rational basis for this discrimination. Defendant\u2019s reasons for arbitrarily denying the increases to plaintiffs are apparently that there are not very many plaintiffs and that they will be replaced through attrition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">Because the problem exists for only a limited number of employees, however, and since it will exist only until the current General Schedule supervisors are replaced, through attrition and refilling of the positions, it is not considered appropriate to request the Civil Service Commission to revise [the methods for computing these employees\u2019 pay]. [Letter from the Director, Office of Civilian Manpower Management, United States Navy, to the Regional Director, Office of Civilian Manpower Management, United States Navy (December 19, 1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">I know of no authority which allows unconstitutional treatment merely because the impacted class is numerically small. Wisely, the majority does not justify the distinction on this basis. Instead, the majority asserts that recognition of this equal protection claim would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-8\">* * * inhibit any legislative or other governmental body from amending its statutes or regulations. Our laws would become written in stone, thereby failing to account for changing times and changing demands of our citizens. [At p. 935.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The point of constitutional significance, however, is not whether an agency may change its interpretation of the controlling law. Obviously, the agency may. The constitutionally relevant point is whether, in implementing that change, the agency has acted in a manner creating arbitrary and unreasonable distinctions. Put another way, an agency may act, but must always act constitutionally. I cannot say the distinction drawn in supervisors\u2019 pay solely on the basis of when each was promoted is constitutionally permissible. In conclusion, I note the Supreme Court has long recognized construction of a statute (and presumably supporting regulations) should \u201c \u2018go in the direction of constitutional policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 134, 95 S.Ct. 335, 354, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974), <em>citing United States v. Johnson, </em>323 U.S. 273, 276, 65 S.Ct. 249, 251, 89 L.Ed. 236 (1944). An agency, it seems to me, has an obligation to avoid implementing policies which raise even a colorable constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">It follows from the foregoing that (1) the Navy improperly considered COLA in its 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(a) calculations for pre-1974 periods and (2) the Navy improperly considered COLA in its 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b) calculations for all periods. I would allow the plaintiffs recovery, the amount of which would be determined under Rule 131(c). To repeat, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
