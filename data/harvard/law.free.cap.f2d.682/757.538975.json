Both parties have indicated to this court that a remand is necessary for the purpose of allowing the district court to consider this case in light of <em>Rose v. Lundy. </em>We, therefore, order such a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">We believe the petitioner should make the choice whether to amend his petition and delete the unexhausted claims or to proceed in state court on the unexhausted claims. We believe this choice should be made in the first instance, because of the possible ramifications of such a choice under Rule 9(b) of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as addressed in the plurality\u2019s opinion in <em>Rose v. Lundy. </em>If petitioner does choose to amend his petition to delete the unexhausted claims, then, as requested by the state, we will allow this case to proceed upon appeal on the present record and briefs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
