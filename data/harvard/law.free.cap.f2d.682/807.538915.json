The trustees seek contributions from the appellee, Swanson Painting Company, which was signatory to an industry collective bargaining agreement and which subcontracted work to a nonsignato-ry contractor in violation of the subcontractor provisions of those agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action was filed under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">The district court granted summary judgment for Swanson, holding that because Swanson had already paid directly to the non-union employees amounts equivalent to the trust fund contributions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> payments to the funds would constitute a \u201cpenalty\u201d for dealing with non-union contractors and would violate the secondary activities provisions of \u00a7 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of the district court\u2019s judgment, appellees rely upon <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local No. 100, </em>421 U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975), and urge that the clause requiring payment of the contributions violates the antitrust laws. We reverse in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. </em>NLRB, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), <em>aff\u2019g Pacific Northwest Chapter of Associated Builders </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>&amp; Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>654 F.2d 1301 (9th Cir. 1981) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">There is no dispute in this appeal as to the meaning of the subcontractor clauses in the agreements or their legality under \u00a7 302(a)(1) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(a)(1), which forbids payments by employers to employee representatives.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties agree that the subcontractor clauses, even though they do not so state in literal language, mean as a practical matter that if the subcontractor does not make contributions into the funds, the signatory contractor (Swanson) is liable for such contributions. <em>Seymour v. Hull &amp; Moreland Engineering, </em>605 F.2d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 1979). <em>See Trustees of Teamsters Local 13 v. Hawg N Action, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 1384, 1387 (10th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, - </em>U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1433-34, 71 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). Furthermore, the contract may be enforced by the trust funds themselves. <em>Audit Services, Inc. v. Rolfson, </em>641 F.2d 757, 760 (9th Cir. 1981) (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Because of the proscription of \u00a7 302, the parties also agree that the contributions cannot be \u201con behalf of\u201d the subcontractor\u2019s employees, but must be \u201cmeasured by\u201d the number of hours worked by such employees. The contributions would then be valid and enforceable under \u00a7 302 as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Schlecht, </em>429 U.S. 401, 97 S.Ct. 679, 50 L.Ed.2d 641 (1977). Although the factual situation in <em>Walsh </em>is similar to that presented here, and although the Court in <em>Walsh </em>held the contributions valid, the Court there did not concern itself with the fact that the contractor had already paid the non-union employees an amount equivalent to the disputed contributions. The appellees here focus on these prior payments, and would have us characterize the payments to the funds now sought by the trustees as a \u201cwindfall\u201d to the trusts and a \u201cpenalty\u201d to themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">The contractor\u2019s cash payment of equivalent benefits to non-union employees does not, however, in itself, excuse the contractor\u2019s obligation to contribute to the trust funds. The courts have rejected the contractor\u2019s view, finding that the employer\u2019s obligation to pay into the trusts is \u201cexactly what it contracted to do.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Kaiser Steel Corp., </em>642 F.2d 1302, 1310-11 n.8 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 851, 70 L.Ed.2d 833 (1982). As this court stated in <em>Audit Services, Inc. v. Rolfson, </em>641 F.2d 757, 761 (9th Cir. 1981) (as amended),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-13\">[t]he payment of cash to nonunion employees, however well-intentioned such payment may have been, does not excuse the obligation to make contributions to the funds. The contract sued upon is between the union and the trustees on the one hand, and the employer on the other. The funds are established for the benefit of all employees covered by their language and are depleted by the amount which the [employer has] refused to contribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">If the court did not require the employer to make trust fund payments upon the subcontractor\u2019s default, the trustees \u201cwould have no remedy for defendant\u2019s undisputed breach of contract.\u201d <em>Hawg N Action, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 1387. <em>Accord, Seymour v. Hull &amp; Moreland Engineering, </em>605 F.2d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>In re Swanson-Dean Corp., </em>61 L.A. 682, 686-87 (1977), <em>enforced, </em>646 F.2d 376 (9th Cir. 1981) (\u201cThe [subcontracting] language accepted by the employer is analogous to that used in guarantor agreements, or agreements of indemnification, and it is our conclusion that the parties intended that the employer would pay if the subcontractor did not\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">Swanson nevertheless argues further that enforcement of a clause aimed at preventing a contractor from dealing with non-union subcontractors is outside the ambit of protected secondary activity sanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>tioned by the construction industry proviso to \u00a7 8(e), and violative of the antitrust laws. Prior to the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 851, 70 L.Ed.2d 833 (1982), we would have held that the district court could not in the first instance determine whether contributions would be an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(e). We would have held that the district court was without jurisdiction to resolve the question in the absence of a determination by the National Labor Relations Board. <em>Castaneda v. Dura-Vent Corp., </em>648 F.2d 612, 616 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Waggoner v. Northwest Excavating, Inc., </em>642 F.2d 333, 338 n.2 (9th Cir. 1981), vacated, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1417, 71 L.Ed.2d 640 (1982) (in light of <em>Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins); Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48 v. Maloney Specialties, Inc., </em>639 F.2d 487, 491 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Waggoner v. R. McGray, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 1229, 1235 (9th Cir. 1979). In <em>Kaiser, </em>however, the Supreme Court held that a federal court should not yield to the jurisdiction of the NLRB when, as here, the court is asked to determine whether the contract violates federal law before enforcing it under \u00a7 301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">Here a court must decide whether the [contract clause in question] violates \u00a7 8(e) in order to determine whether to enforce the clause.... Therefore, where a \u00a7 8(e) defense is raised by a party which \u00a7 8(e) was designed to protect, and where the defense is not directed to a collateral matter but to the portion of the contract for which enforcement is sought, a court must entertain the defense. While only the Board may provide affirmative remedies for unfair labor practices, a court may not enforce a contract provision which violates \u00a7 8(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">102 S.Ct. at 860 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">We therefore must determine whether this subcontractor clause is in violation of \u00a7 8(e) and the antitrust laws. Swanson relies upon <em>Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local No. 100, </em>421 U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975), which held that an agreement, \u201coutside the context of a collective-bargaining relationship,\u201d which obligated a contractor to subcontract work only to firms that had a contract with the union, could be \u201cthe basis of a federal antitrust suit ... .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 95 S.Ct. at 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\"><em>Connell </em>has been the subject of much debate and litigation concerning the extent to which it materially alters or creates new complexities in the relationship between the antitrust and labor relations laws. <em>See, e.g., Donald Schriver, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>635 F.2d 859 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 976, 101 S.Ct. 2058, 68 L.Ed.2d 357 (1981); <em>Granddad Bread, Inc. v. Continental Baking Co., </em>612 F.2d 1105 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1076,101 S.Ct. 854, 66 L.Ed.2d 798 (1981); <em>California Dump Truck Owners Association, Inc. v. Associated General Contractors, </em>562 F.2d 607 (9th Cir. 1977); Handler &amp; Zifchak, <em>Collective Bargaining and the Antitrust Laws: The Emasculation of the Labor Exemption, </em>81 Colum.L.Rev. 459 (1981); St. Antoine, <em>Connell: Antitrust Law at the Expense of Labor Law, </em>62 Va.L.Rev. 603 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"AEni\">That controversy has now been resolved, at least to the extent necessary to decide this case, by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), which affirmed in part and vacated in part this court\u2019s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Pacific Northwest Chapter of Associated Builders &amp; Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>654 F.2d 1301 (9th Cir. 1981). The Court in <em>Woelke &amp; Romero </em>held that the construction industry proviso to \u00a7 8(e) shelters union signatory subcontracting clauses that are sought or negotiated in the context of a collective bargaining relationship. Examination of the statutory language and legislative history of \u00a7 8(e) led the Court to the conclusion that the subcontracting clause\u2019s creation of \u201ctop-down\u201d pressure for unionization was acceptable so long as the clause was the product of collective bargaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-17\">Congress endorsed subcontracting agreements obtained in the context of a collective-bargaining relationship \u2014 and decided to accept whatever top-down pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>such clauses might entail. Congress concluded that the community of interests on the construction jobsite justified the top-down organizational consequences that might attend the protection of legitimate collective-bargaining objectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">102 S.Ct. at 2081-82 (footnote omitted). The Court distinguished <em>Connell </em>on the ground that in that case no subcontracting clause had been negotiated through collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The holding of <em>Woelke &amp; Romero </em>is clear and controls this case. The subcontracting clause here at issue was \u201csought or negotiated\u201d in the context of a collective bargaining relationship. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further consideration of the trustees\u2019 claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\">. Work by the non-union contractor in fact spanned a period covered by two different collective bargaining agreements: the 1968-71 agreement and the 1971-74 agreement. The relevant clauses in each agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">\n<em>1968-1971 Agreement</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">The employer agrees that in the subcontracting of any of the work of this bargaining unit, to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting or repair of a building, structure, or other work, the employer will do business only with the subcontractor who is bound, or who agrees to be bound, in writing, by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement including the payment of all wages, and contributions to the Trusts. (Page 25, 1968 Western Washington Area Agreement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-13\">\n<em>1971-1974 Agreement</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-14\">An employer who is party to this Agreement shall not subcontract any work covered by this Agreement to be done at a construction job site to any employer unless such employer is a party to a collective bargaining Agreement with the Union. (1971-1974 Western Washington Area Agreement, Page 9)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-15\">. Payments were apparently prompted by the fact that the job in question was covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 276a <em>et seq., </em>requiring a payment of \u201cthe prevailing wage.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Walsh v. Schlecht, </em>429 U.S. 401, 411, 97 S.Ct. 679, 686, 50 L.Ed.2d 641 (1977), disposes of any contention that operation of the subcontractor clause cannot require payment by the contractor above the floor established by Davis-Bacon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-21\">. Section 8(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-22\">It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforceable and void: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work.. ..</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. Section 302(a)(1) of the LMRA prohibits payments by employers to \u201cany representative of any of his employees . ... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(a)(1). Sections 302(c)(5) and (6), however, make exceptions for payments, under written agreement, to trust funds created \u201cfor the sole and exclusive benefit\u201d of employees and their families. <em>See Music v.
