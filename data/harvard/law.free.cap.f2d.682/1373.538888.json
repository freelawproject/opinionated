Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-27\">Petitioner, Elijah \u201cTootie Pie\u201d Cosby, is presently serving a 20-year sentence under a 1979 Georgia burglary conviction. He challenges this conviction on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to constitutionally support the conviction, under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-28\">An apartment in Carrollton, Georgia was burglarized December 10, 1978. Cosby lived in the same apartment complex as the victim. A camera and zoom lens, and a stereo, were taken. Some time between December 11 and 13 (inclusive) Cosby pawned the camera and lens.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cosby was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>arrested. He told a Carrollton police detective that he bought the camera and lens for $40 from a Bobby Williamson. There is conflicting evidence as to two details of this alleged transaction. First, the police detective testified that Cosby told him the purchase was made in Villa Rica,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whereas Cosby testified that he bought the camera from Williamson in Carrollton and that he told the detective only that Williamson lived in Villa Rica. Second, based on the pawnbroker\u2019s uncertain testimony as to when the camera might have been pawned, see note 1 <em>supra, </em>the asserted purchase could have been made on December 11, but Cosby testified he bought the camera December 12 and pawned it a day or two later. Also, the detective made a limited but unsuccessful search for Williamson in Villa Rica, and Cosby did not procure Williamson\u2019s appearance at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Otherwise Cosby\u2019s testimony was uncon-tradicted and in fact was corroborated. Cosby testified that Williamson and a companion, both black males, drove up to the King Street Pool Room in Carrollton where Cosby was standing outside. Williamson called Cosby over to the car and offered to sell him the camera for $40. Cosby had only a $50 bill and Williamson had no change, so Cosby got change from an acquaintance, Charlie Hammett, who lives next door to the pool room, and then Cosby bought the camera. Charlie Hammett testified that some time before Christmas while he was talking with Cosby outside of the pool room, a car with two black men drove up and the driver motioned for Cosby. Cosby went over and spoke with them briefly and returned to ask Hammett to change a $50 bill. Hammett gave him two $20 bills and a ten, and Cosby went back to the car and then walked away with what appeared to be a camera resembling the one stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">Cosby also presented at trial an alibi that he was at a party in Rome, Georgia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the day of the robbery and that he did not return to Carrollton until December 11 or 12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Several witnesses corroborated this alibi, but their testimony was inconsistent as to the number - and identity of persons at the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">Cosby moved for a directed verdict on the ground that, in the light of his uncontra-dicted version of how he obtained the camera, the circumstantial evidence of recent possession of the camera after the burglary was not sufficient to carry the state\u2019s burden of proof. The court denied this motion. In its instruction to the jury the court charged that, if a burglary has been committed, Georgia law permits the inference that a person in recent, unexplained possession of the goods stolen is the one who committed the burglary. <em>See Williamson v. State, </em>248 Ga. 47, 281 S.E.2d 512 (1981). The court told the jury that recent possession is one circumstance along with all the other evidence in the case from which the jury may infer guilt if it should see fit, but that the inference is not a conclusive one and that the jury may choose to believe the defendant\u2019s explanation for possession of the goods.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>The jury convicted Cosby and he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">II. Exhaustion</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">Cosby appealed his conviction to the Georgia Court of Appeals, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court rejected this challenge, <em>Cosby v. State, </em>151 Ga.App. 676, 261 S.E.2d 424, 425 (1979), and the state concedes that Cosby\u2019s sufficiency argument has been exhausted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">The state contends, however, that Cosby has raised a second claim, not exhausted, concerning the constitutionality of the inference of burglary that Georgia allows from recent possession of stolen goods, and therefore this case must be dismissed under <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), which holds that habeas petitions stating mixed exhausted and unexhausted claims cannot be considered by the district court but must be dismissed to allow the petitioner to either exhaust all claims or to bring only exhausted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">To address the <em>Rose v. Lundy </em>contention we must make some prefatory explanation of the law of the constitutionality of presumptions and inferences. In <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979), the Supreme Court explained that there are two broad classes of inferences or presumptions, permissive and mandatory. Permissive inferences, as the one here appears to be, <em>see </em>note 5 <em>supra; Williamson v. State, supra, </em>281 S.E.2d at 514, 521,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> serve the purpose of directing the jury\u2019s attention to inferences that it might draw and thus tend to encourage particular conclusions. <em>Ulster, supra, </em>442 U.S. at 170, 99 S.Ct. at 2231, 60 L.Ed.2d at 800 (Powell, J., dissenting); Allen, <em>Structuring Jury Decisionmaking in Criminal Cases: A Unified Constitutional Approach to Evidentiary Devices, </em>94 Harv.L.Rev. 321, 330-31 (1980). Therefore, the Supreme Court requires that in order for a permissive inference instruction to be valid there must be a rational connection between the circumstance giving rise to the suggested inference and the conclusion drawn. The specific test is whether the ultimate fact is \u201cmore likely than not to flow from\u201d the basic fact. <em>Ulster, </em>442 U.S. at 165, 99 S.Ct. at 2228. This test is less stringent than the <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>test for sufficiency of the evidence, that a rational trier of fact could find the ultimate fact beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ulster, supra, </em>at 165, 99 S.Ct. at 2228. The rationality of the inference under an <em>Ulster </em>analysis is judged not in the abstract but in the light of the circumstances giving rise to the inference in a particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 99 S.Ct. at 2227-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-15\">The <em>Ulster </em>analysis of the validity of a permissible inference instruction is independent from a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence, for the former tests whether it is rational to infer an element of the crime from a specific fact and related circumstances, while the latter tests whether such an inference is supported by the record as a whole. Thus a permissive inference might be invalid even though there is sufficient evidence other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>wise to uphold the verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The independence of the <em>Ulster </em>analysis and a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>analysis is clear from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ulster. </em>The Court explained that a permissive inference need not meet the more stringent <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>standard for the very reason that such an inference is only \u201cone ... part\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s case, and that \u201cthe prosecution may rely on <em>all of the evidence </em>in the record to meet the reasonable-doubt standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 99 S.Ct. at 2229-30 (original emphasis). Moreover, in its last paragraph the Court was careful to observe that, in addition to the permissive inference being valid, the record as a whole had been found sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 99 S.Ct. at 2230.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, determining that a permissive inference instruction is valid does not settle whether the verdict is supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">The preceding discussion of <em>Ulster </em>illustrates that, although the validity of a permissive inference instruction and the sufficiency of the evidence in theory are distinct issues, in practice, where the primary evidence of guilt is the same as the evidence that gives rise to a permissive inference-instruction, it is difficult to separate an <em>Ulster </em>analysis from a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State, supra, </em>281 S.E.2d at 512-20 (raising a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>issue but analyzing it under Ulster). In the present case we recognized that the inference of burglary from recent possession of the stolen goods is central to our consideration, and we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the validity of this inference. We did not frame our request in pure sufficiency terms but asked to be briefed on whether the inference \u201crelieves the state of its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense.\u201d This burden-shifting tenor of the request prompted the parties to focus on <em>Ulster </em>and its progeny <em>(e.g., Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979)), and it was then that the state contended that two claims were present in this case and therefore <em>Rose v. Lundy, supra, </em>required dismissal. We hold that <em>Rose </em>does not apply because Cosby raised only a sufficiency issue in the district court, and therefore any subsequent raising of an <em>Ulster </em>issue in the court of appeals, whether by the petitioner or by the court, does not present grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-9\">In <em>Rose v. Lundy </em>the Supreme Court announced its \u201crigorously enforced total exhaustion rule,\u201d - U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 1203, 71 L.Ed.2d at 388, under which a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims rather than simply dismissing the unexhausted claims. One month later the Court clarified that even though the total exhaustion rule is to have \u201cstrict enforcement,\u201d <em>id. </em>- U.S. at-, 102 S.Ct. at 1204, 71 L.Ed.2d at 389, the federal courts are to be \u201creluctant to interpolate an unexhausted claim not directly presented by the petition.\u201d <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1563, 71 L.Ed.2d 783, 798 n.5 (1982). The majority explained that, although an unexhausted claim appeared in Isaac\u2019s case at the court of appeals level, the claim \u201cformed no part of Isaac\u2019s original habeas petition,\u201d and therefore <em>Rose v. Lundy </em>did not apply. The court warned against a \u201ccreative appellate judge . . . distill[ing] from [a \u201cconfused petition\u201d] an unexhausted ... claim.\u201d From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number><em>Engle v. Isaac </em>the rule is clear, then, that in applying the total exhaustion rule of <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>we look to the original habeas petition presented in the district court, not to the contentions made on appeal, and we do not construe ambiguous petitions as raising unexhausted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">In his original habeas petition Cosby claimed that he \u201cwas convicted based on evidence which was insufficient to justify a rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and he cited <em>Jackson v. Virginia. </em>The Georgia rule of inference of guilt from recent possession was mentioned only by way of contending that this was the only evidence to support the verdict, and that such evidence was not sufficient. Nowhere in Cosby\u2019s initial petition does he cite <em>Ulster </em>and other presumption cases or contend that the jury was improperly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">The case was initially referred to a United States magistrate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) for his recommendation. In the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the writ should be denied, which was accepted by the district judge, the magistrate mentioned the inference allowed by Georgia law, but he also spoke entirely in terms of sufficiency of the evidence. He did not mention the permissive inference instruction given the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">Cosby first began to speak to the district court in terms of an unconstitutional presumption in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not read his argument as departing from a simple sufficiency claim, however. In essence Cosby argued that if the verdict is allowed to stand on the evidence presented, which he contended consisted only of the presumption and his unrebutted explanation of possession, this \u201cin effect\u201d shifted the burden to the defendant of proving his innocence. This said no more than the obvious proposition that in any case where the prosecution has not proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt it has not met its burden of proof, and therefore to let the verdict stand is to \u201cin effect\u201d shift the burden of proof. Cosby did not mention or challenge the instruction given the jury. His only contention to the district court was that the magistrate improperly relied on the inference as sufficient evidence. The heart of Cosby\u2019s argument was that because there \u201cwas no rebuttal of petitioner\u2019s explanation [of possession] . . . the standard under <em>Jackson v. Virginia . . . </em>was not met.\u201d Any discussion of presumptions or burden shifting was but an inartful way of rephrasing this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-10\">Were there any $oubt concerning this question, under <em>Engle v. Isaac, supra, </em>it would be resolved in favor of Cosby. Moreover, the state in response to the identical arguments made in Cosby\u2019s original brief to this court viewed the issue as only one of sufficiency and did not raise any exhaustion contention. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-11\">Finally, the district judge, in his issuance of a certificate of probable cause, also considered the case as presenting a single claim, sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\">In sum, the inference of burglary from recent possession, allowed under Georgia law, was unavoidably discussed in the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>trict court, for the principal evidence against defendant was his recent possession. Nowhere, however, is this inference challenged as an unconstitutional permissible inference <em>instruction </em>to the jury. It was not until this court requested the parties to focus on the inference as relieving the state of its burden of proof that the <em>Ulster </em>analysis was developed fully enough to be termed a second issue. Thus, even if the <em>Ulster </em>issue could be a separate \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cground\u201d under <em>Rose v. Lundy,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was not properly raised by petitioner at the district court level and thus presents no ground for dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">III. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">Turning to the merits, Cosby contends that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. The state relies primarily on the inference to be drawn from recent, unexplained possession of goods taken during a burglary that the one in possession committed the burglary. Cosby responds that he presented an unimpeached and reasonable explanation of possession inconsistent with burglary and therefore the inference cannot be drawn unless the state were to rebut his explanation. The state replies that Cosby\u2019s explanation is an issue of fact that the jury is entitled to disbelieve, as it obviously did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">The standard for weighing the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence is set forth in <em>Jackson v. Virginia :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-8\">[T]he applicant is entitled to habeas corpus relief if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-10\">443 U.S. at 324, 99 S.Ct. at 2791.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are to \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d and \u201call of the evidence is to be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 99, S.Ct. at 2789. The Supreme Court has further explained that the <em>Jackson </em>standard is a \u201cmore stringent test\u201d than a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard. <em>Ulster, supra, </em>442 U.S. at 166, 99 S.Ct. at 2229. How much more stringent is uncertain, but it is at least clear that if the reviewing court is convinced by the evidence <em>only </em>that the defendant is more likely than not guilty then the evidence is not sufficient for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-11\">The inference of burglary from recent possession of stolen goods on which the state relies is of ancient vintage and has widespread acceptance. <em>See generally, U. S. v. Jones, </em>418 F.2d 818, 821-22; 9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 2513 (Chadbourn ed. 1981); cases collected in <em>West\u2019s Federal Practice Digest </em>at Burglary # 42, Larceny # 64, and Robbery # 24.1(5). We note particularly the Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance of this inference. In <em>Dunlop v. United States, </em>165 U.S. 486, 502, 17 S.Ct. 375, 330, 41 L.Ed. 799 (1897), the Court stated broadly in dictum that \u201cif property recently stolen be found in the possession of a certain person, it may be presumed that he stole it, and such presumption is sufficient to authorize the jury to convict, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence.\u201d In <em>McNamara v. Henkel, </em>226 U.S. 520, 524-25, 33 S.Ct. 146, 147, 57 L.Ed. 330 (1913), where the issue was whether there was any com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>petent evidence to support an arrest for burglary, the Court held that \u201c[possession [of \u201cthe fruits of the burglarious entry\u201d] in the[] circumstances [of this case] tended to show guilty participation in the burglary.\u201d Finally, in <em>Wilson v. U. S., </em>162 U.S. 613, 619-20, 16 S.Ct. 895, 898, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896), a murder case, the Court stated generally that \u201c[p]ossession of the fruits of crime recently after its commission justifies the inference that the possession is guilty possession.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Despite the apparent breadth of these statements in distant Supreme Court precedents, we hold that recent possession of stolen goods will not automatically support a guilty verdict for theft or burglary under the <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>standard in every case. Instead, recent possession is to be viewed as probative evidence of the crime, <em>see </em>1 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 152 (3d ed. 1940), and reviewed along with the other evidence in the case to determine whether any rational juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus the inference of participation in the crime drawn from possession of fruits of the crime is to be judged like any other inference, that is, on the strength of that inference in the light of the facts of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">Support for this treatment of the inference is found first in the fact that the Supreme Court has never squarely held that the inference standing alone will support a guilty verdict without the existence of corroborating evidence or circumstances. The Court\u2019s statement in <em>Dunlop, supra, </em>was broad dictum, used simply as one example of the many inferences traditionally drawn from circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>McNamara, supra, </em>the Court stated no more than that the inference was probative evidence; it gave no indication that the inference was sufficient to sustain a verdict. In <em>Wilson, </em>the only case where the Court has squarely upheld a verdict based on this inference, there, was a tremendous amount of additional corroborating evidence and very little exculpatory evidence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and thus the Court did not hold that the inference alone was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-9\">Second, many courts, including the former Fifth Circuit, have reversed convictions in the face of this inference (or similar inferences). <em>See, e.g., U. S. v. Mann, </em>557 F.2d 1211, 1217 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>U. S. v. Jones, </em>418 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1969); <em>see generally </em>cases collected in <em>U. S. v. Burns, </em>597 F.2d 939, 944 n.7 (1979), and in <em>Barfield v. U. S., </em>229 F.2d 936, 944 n.6 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">Third, there is widespread agreement that the bare inference of theft from possession is insufficient for conviction without corroborating circumstances or evidence. The early English and American sources for this common law inference \u201creflect guarded circumspection in the use of the doctrine,\u201d and generally evince the view that \u201c \u2018the presumption arising from this fact of pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>session, standing by itself, ... is too slender to support a conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>the thorough analysis contained in <em>U. S. v. Jones, </em>418 F.2d 818, 822-25 (8th Cir. 1969) (quoting a 19th Century edition of Wharton\u2019s Am.Crim.Law). At least two circuits have held that corroboration is necessary in order for this inference to be sufficient evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 823; <em>Torres v. U. S., </em>270 F.2d 252, 258-59 (9th Cir. 1959). <em>See also U. S. v. Bamberger, </em>456 F.2d 1119, 1134 (3d Cir. 1972) (dictum) (\u201cthe inference of guilt is justified only in the presence of factors which suggest the probability that the person could not have obtained possession in any way other than by theft\u201d). Even where there is no explicit holding to this effect the case law supports this proposition by implication, for all cases applying this inference do so where circumstances have \u201csuch force and bearing as to justify the jury[\u2019s] finding,\u201d quoting <em>Barnes v. U. S., </em>341 F.2d 189, 192 (5th Cir. 1965), or where there is other corroborating evidence. <em>See Barfield v. U. S., </em>229 F.2d 936, 941-44 &amp; nn. 1, 6 (5th Cir. 1956) (Brown, J., specially concurring) (collecting cases) (\u201cthe total circumstances must furnish a legitimate basis for such an inference\u201d; all cases sustaining the verdict \u201cshow on careful examination some additional circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Careful distinction must be drawn between the inference proffered by the state in this case \u2014 that the possessor of stolen goods actually <em>committed </em>the burglary\u2014 and the inference from possession of stolen goods that the possessor has <em>knowledge of their stolen quality. Accord, U. S. v. Jones, supra, </em>418 F.2d at 824-25. The latter inference is much more widely accepted without qualification or corroborating evidence. <em>E.g., Barnes v. U. S, </em>412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973); <em>U. S. v. Strauss, </em>678 F.2d 886, 893 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>597 F.2d 939, 942-43 (5th Cir. 1979). This is true because the inference of mere knowledge is a much more likely one. Inferring that one in possession of the goods stolen actually entered the victim\u2019s dwelling place and stole the goods is a great deal more specific than inferring that one in possession of stolen goods is aware of their stolen quality. <em>Cf. Ulster, supra, </em>442 U.S. at 158 n.16, 99 S.Ct. at 2226 n.16 (from the evidence of presence at the site of a still, there is a \u201cmuch higher probability\u201d of association with operation of the still than there is of being in possession of the still; the former inference is valid; the latter is not).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">To summarize, cases approving the inference of guilt from possession of recently stolen goods fall into four categories: (1) those where knowledge of the theft is sufficient to convict, <em>e.g., Barnes v. U. S., </em>412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973); (2) those that hold only that possession constitutes probative evidence, <em>e.g., McNamara v. Henkel, </em>262 U.S. 520, 33 S.Ct. 146, 57 L.Ed. 330 (1913); (3) those that only approve an <em>instruction </em>on the inference, <em>e.g., Dunlop v. U. S, </em>165 U.S. 486, 501-502, 17 S.Ct. 375, 380-381, 41 L.Ed. 799 (1897); and (4) those that apply the inference where there are corroborating circumstances or other evidence, <em>e.g., Wilson v. U. S., </em>162 U.S. 613, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896). We have found no case in Fifth Circuit, Eleventh Circuit or Supreme Court jurisprudence, or elsewhere, sustaining the sufficiency of the evidence to convict for actual commission of theft, burglary or robbery where the prosecution\u2019s case rested on the bare inference of guilt from possession. If such a case exists, the great weight of authority is still clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">Looking then to the facts of this case, the state relies almost exclusively on the fact that Cosby pawned the camera and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>lens stolen during the burglary within a few days of the burglary. Cosby\u2019s principal contention is that his explanation of possession, which is consistent with innocence, is forceful enough that the jury cannot be allowed to discredit it without some rebuttal by the government. Cosby\u2019s testimony that he purchased the camera for $40 from a black man outside of the King Street Pool Room in Carrollton, Georgia is corroborated in detail by eyewitness testimony and is not seriously contradicted by any evidence proffered by the state.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Also, Cosby points to his alibi, corroborated by several eyewitnesses, that he was out of town the weekend of the burglary. <em>Jackson v. </em>Virginia\u2019s requirement that the evidence be viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, however, commands that we assume that the jury in its assessment of credibility did not believe this exculpatory testimony, and we must defer to the jury\u2019s prerogative in this area. <em>Glasser v. U. S., </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (\u201cIt is not for us ... to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>U. S. v. Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1381 (5th Cir. 1975) (\u201cthe jurors are entitled to give [defendant\u2019s explanation] whatever weight they feel it deserves\u201d); <em>U. S. v. Gianni, </em>678 F.2d 956, 958, (11th Cir. 1982) (we make \u201call credibility choices in support of the jury verdict\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Although in testing the sufficiency of the evidence we are required to disbelieve all of the defense testimony, the guilty verdict may not stand unless the state has proven its case with sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable juror to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that the state has not done so. The inference of possession of stolen goods is too weak in the circumstances of this case to justify the verdict. First, although Cosby\u2019s possession of the camera was fairly recent to the burglary, it was not so recent that it is unlikely that he could have purchased it. <em>Compare, U. S. v. Wilson, supra, </em>(defendant found with stolen car 40 feet from garage in early morning hours trying to crank start it); <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>281 S.E.2d at 520 (possession within a few hours of burglary). Second, Cosby did not possess a large number of stolen items or a large majority of the items stolen. A camera and lens and a stereo were taken; Cosby had only the camera and lens. <em>Compare, Williamson, supra </em>(in possession of stereo, television, clock radio, and checks, all of the items stolen). Third, Cosby did not try to conceal the camera or otherwise act in a suspicious manner concerning his possession of it. To the contrary, he openly pawned the camera in his real name despite the obvious fact that serial number identification of it could easily be made. <em>Compare, Rugendorf v. U. S., </em>376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964) (defendant stored 81 stolen furs in basement closet); <em>Crone v. U. S., </em>411 F.2d 251 (5th Cir. 1969) (defendant used fictitious name, tried to flee); <em>U. S. v. Williams, </em>405 F.2d 14 (4th Cir. 1968) (defendant arrested attempting to throw away stolen wallet). Fourth, although the jury was not required to believe Cosby\u2019s explanation of possession, still the inference of theft is at its strongest when the defendant wholly fails to make a credible explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>tion or makes a demonstrably false explanation. <em>Compare, U. S. v. Williams, supra </em>(defendant\u2019s only explanation where caught throwing away stolen wallet was that he didn\u2019t know anything about it); <em>Wilson v. U. S., supra, </em>162 U.S. at 620, 16 S.Ct. at 898 (defendants falsely stated that victim was their uncle). Finally, there is no other corroborating evidence of significance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">In sum, the state relies on an inference that does not have great strength even in the best of circumstances, and the best of circumstances were not present here. Absent some type of corroborating evidence or circumstances, the most that we can say from the bare fact of possession and pawning of the stolen camera a day or two after the burglary is that it gives equal support to an inference of burglary and an inference that Cosby was fencing stolen goods.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is not enough to support a burglary conviction. As discussed above, the Court\u2019s <em>Ulster </em>case clarifies that if the reviewing court can only say that the ultimate fact is more likely than not, then the <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>standard has not been met. See text following note 12 <em>supra. </em>This is because <em>Jackson </em>requires that a reasonable juror be able to find the defendant guilty <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>and if the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged, then a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt. <em>Accord, U. S. v. Jones, supra, </em>418 F.2d at 824-26. This is not to say that whenever the evidence supports a reasonable inference consistent with innocence the jury must acquit, for the Supreme Court has rejected the \u201ctheory that the prosecution [must] rule out every hypothesis except that of guilt,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793, as have we <em>U. S. v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 550 (5th Cir. 1982) (Unit B en banc). It is only where, after viewing the evidence in its most favorable light and making all credibility decisions in favor of the state the evidence still fails to at least preponderate in favor of the state, that we become concerned with conflicting inferences.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of appropriate relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">.

For example, possession of stolen goods two months after a burglary might be an insufficient circumstance to permit a permissive inference instruction, but coupled with an eyewitness testifying to the defendant\u2019s climbing out of the victim\u2019s window the night of the burglary, which is evidence apart from the possession of the goods and related circumstances, there might be sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1431-15\">. The issue of sufficiency was not addressed in the Court\u2019s review, but rather the Court noted that the New York Court of Appeals had found the evidence sufficient.

There was no rebuttal of petitioner\u2019s explanation and therefore the standard under <em>Jackson v. Virginia . . . </em>was not met.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1433-9\">. We note that although the <em>Ulster </em>analysis is distinct from a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>analysis, it is not certain whether <em>Ulster </em>is a separate \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of habeas exhaustion. The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe ultimate question for disposition . . . [may] be the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support,\u201d if the issue presented in federal court is the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of the issue presented in state court. <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 277-78, 92 S.Ct. 509, 513, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). Elsewhere the Court has stated the test is whether the question presented in federal court \u201cis so clearly distinct from the claims . . . presented to the state courts that it may fairly be said that the state courts have had no opportunity to pass on the claim.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. Cady, </em>405 U.S. 504, 516 n.18, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1055 n.18, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972). Because we find that the <em>Ulster issue </em>was not raised in federal court, we need not decide whether this issue is so \u201cclearly distinct\u201d from a <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>sufficiency issue as to constitute a separate <em>claim.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1433-13\">. The <em>Jackson </em>standard is given retroactive effect. <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>632 F.2d 605, 637-39 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1028, 101 S.Ct. 3019, 69 L.Ed.2d 398 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">. The inference of theft or burglary from recent possession of stolen goods has found support in former Fifth Circuit cases as well. <em>E.g., Smith v. U. S., </em>413 F.2d 1121, 1125 (1969); <em>Thurmond v. U. S., </em>377 F.2d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 1967). Georgia has also long applied this rule. <em>See Williamson v. State, supra, </em>281 S.E.2d at 514.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">. It is important to note that the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dunlop </em>had nothing to do with the sufficiency issue we face here. The Court considered a challenge to jury instructions which told the jury that they might presume that items delivered to a mail box by mailmen were in fact mailed. Defendant argued that the instructions failed to inform the jury that the presumption of innocence is a stronger presumption than the presumption that items delivered by mailmen have been mailed. The Court held that there was no need to instruct on the relative weight of these presumptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1434-12\">. In this murder case defendants\u2019 possession of the victim\u2019s property was upheld as supporting the finding that defendants committed the murder. Defendants possessed virtually all of the victim\u2019s property, down to his bloody bedsheets. Defendants had camped near the victim\u2019s home the night of the murder, and charred articles similar to items owned by the victim and missing from his home were found at the campsite. Footprints similar to the defendants\u2019 were found at the murder site. The defendants gave contradictory and demonstrably false accounts of where they obtained the goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">. Indeed, as the court in <em>U. S. v. Jones, supra, </em>explains, the apparent uniform acceptance of the inference of theft from possession of the goods stolen may have resulted historically from the fact that in many jurisdictions there is no difference in the substantive crimes of larceny and knowing receipt of stolen property. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Kemp, </em>678 F.2d 929 (11th Cir. 1982) (Georgia prosecution for theft by receipt of stolen property). Thus, there is no need to infer the specific commission of the theft. Where the charge is robbery or burglary, however, and therefore knowledge of the stolen quality of goods possessed is not sufficient to convict, much more caution in the application of the inference is warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">. The state attempts to discredit Cosby\u2019s explanation by pointing to some inconsistencies in his testimony. They are few and minor, however, and do not affect the substance of Cosby\u2019s explanation. Cosby was uncertain whether the purchase was made on the 11th or 12th of December. Also, a detective testified that Cosby told him the purchase was made in Villa Rica, Georgia; Cosby testified that he told the officer only that the person who sold him the camera lived in Villa Rica. Finally, the state speculates that Cosby would not have had $50 to purchase the camera if he was so pressed for cash a day or two later that he had to pawn the camera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"acg-dedup-1\">. Although the cited cases are direct criminal appeals, they apply in this habeas context as well. In requiring that we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>was employing an often used directive whose well known meaning is to allow the jury to make all credibility decisions. See, <em>e.g., Glasser, supra. </em>We find no indication in <em>Jackson </em>or cases decided under it that we are to depart from this body of precedent by giving greater scrutiny to credibility in habeas cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">. The state points to the fact that Cosby lived in the same apartment complex as the victim, although in a different building. This is of only marginal probative value. The state also points to the inconsistencies in Cosby\u2019s explanation of possession. <em>See </em>note 17 <em>supra. </em>His testimony was not so implausible or demonstrably false as to give rise to positive evidence in favor of the government. <em>Accord, Holloway v. McElroy, supra, </em>632 F.2d at 641 (inconsistencies in defendant\u2019s story do not support government\u2019s case but only discredit the specific points in defendant\u2019s testimony). <em>Compare, U. S. v. Contreras, </em>667 F.2d 976, 980 (11th Cir. 1982) (\u201cwholly incredible\u201d evidence bolsters government\u2019s case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">. It is of course also possible that his possession was entirely innocent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">. With this caveat in mind, our holding is consistent with <em>Jackson </em>where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-9\">[A] federal habeas corpus court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume . . . the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Bf\">443 U.S. at 326. The Court of course does not mean that whenever the record supports conflicting inferences, no matter how weak, the prosecution wins, for not only would this be no more stringent than the standard of review in a civil case but also the prosecution would only fail in its proof where there was a total absence of probative evidence, which is the \u201cno evidence\u201d standard rejected in <em>Jackson. </em>If <em>Jackson </em>\u2019s beyond a reasonable doubt standard is to have any meaning, we must assume that when the choice between guilt and innocence from \u201chistorical\u201d or undisputed facts reaches a certain degree of conjecture and speculation, then the defendant must be acquitted. <em>Ulster </em>clarifies that this degree of inferential attenuation is reached at the least when the undisputed facts give equal support to inconsistent inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-2\">In short, we read the quoted passage from <em>Jackson </em>to mean that the simple fact that the evidence gives some support to the defendant does not demand acquittal. However, if the evidence fails to give support to the prosecution sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a verdict must be directed despite the existence of conflicting inferences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
