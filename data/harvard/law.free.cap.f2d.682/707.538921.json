We reverse and hold that Tennant is entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-29\">Tennant filed an application for disability benefits on January 26, 1979, alleging a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>disability onset date of August 26, 1976. A hearing on the application was held before an administrative law judge on October 16, 1979. The ALJ concluded that Tennant was not disabled. Tennant filed a request for review, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Social Security Administration remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings. The ALJ, without taking further evidence, again found that Tennant was not disabled and, therefore, is not entitled to benefits. The ALJ\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Appeals Council. Ten-nant then filed this action to review the Secretary\u2019s decision. The district court entered a judgment for the Secretary on the pleadings, and Tennant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The administrative law judge found that Tennant suffers from three impairments: (1) a personality disorder termed \u201cinadequate personality;\u201d (2) corns and calluses on his feet; and (3) nystagmus of the eye. The ALJ further found that as a result of these impairments, Tennant is unable to perform his previous work. The ALJ concluded, however, that Tennant has the residual functional capacity for light work and is, therefore, not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The ALJ was clearly correct in finding that Tennant suffers from the impairments noted above. Although there is evidence that Tennant does have eye and feet problems, his personality disorder is the more serious impairment and is the primary basis for his disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>published by the American Psychiatric Association defines \u201cinadequate personality\u201d as a \u201cbehavior pattern characterized by ineffectual responses to emotional, social, intellectual and physical demands.\u201d A person with this disorder may seem \u201cneither physically nor mentally deficient,\u201d but will \u201cmanifest inadaptibility, ineptness, poor judgment, social instability, and a lack of physical and emotional stamina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Tennant has been repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from this personality disorder. Dr. David R. Franks, a psychiatrist at the Creighton University School of Medicine, examined Tennant on February 7, 1979. He concluded that Tennant \u201ccan appropriately be described as an inadequate personality with limited intellectual and physical resources which renders him pretty inept at dealing with everyday things both interpersonally, socially and vocationally. This is compounded by a chronic anxiety which impairs him further.\u201d He reiterated this diagnosis in a later report, dated April 7, 1980, adding that, \u201cI do not see how it can be argued that a personality disorder such as this is not seriously and permanently disabling.\u201d Dr. Charles Landgraf, a psychiatrist who examined Tennant on three occasions \u2014 June 21, 1977, July 7, 1978 and February 23, 1979 \u2014 similarily concluded that Tennant suffers from an \u201cinadequate personality.\u201d Landgraf also noted that Tennant\u2019s \u201cpersonal habits have always apparently been rather primitive\u201d and \u201c[h]is ability to relate appropriately to co-workers and supervisors of course is not up to usual * * *<em>.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Other psychiatrists who examined Ten-nant recognized the dysfunctional nature of his personality, but were reluctant to neatly \u201cpigeonhole\u201d the disorder. Dr. James R. Dunlap conducted a psychiatric examination of Tennant on February 5, 1979, and concluded that the claimant \u201cis low average to borderline intelligence, comes from a very deprived background and has functioned on an inconsistent, unstable basis most of his life. I feel that he is suffering from a personality disorder with perhaps both asocial and inadequate characteristics.\u201d Another extremely comprehensive psychiatric evaluation was provided by Dr. Beverley Mead, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Psychiatry at Creighton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>University School of Medicine. Dr. Mead concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">Mr. Tennant presents the interesting problem of multiple minor impairments. I do no[t] see a single psychiatric diagnosis as being particularly significant <em>although he could be considered an inadequate personality </em>and judging by his history, at one time might have been an antisocial personality. * * * [T]here is no single impairment significant enough in itself to be disabling. I feel however, that it is very important to note the tremendous number of complex contributing impairments. He is of short stature, probably less than average strength for a man his age, he has a bad eye, slight speech impairment, poor coordination, he has emotional lability with a low threshold for anxiety, less than average IQ., limited general knowledge, no identifiable skill, <em>inadequate personality, </em>reformatory record, failure to benefit from repeated training programs, and possible paranoid tendencies. Collectively, all these factors could be considered as very significant. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The regulatory scheme contemplates that claimants suffering from disabling personality disorders may be entitled to Social Security benefits. The \u201cListing of Impairments\u201d that the Secretary has \u201cconsidered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(a) (1981), include \u201cFunctional nonpsychotic disorders (psychophysiologic, neurotic, and <em>personality disorders; </em>addictive dependence on alcohol or drugs). \u00a7 12.04, Appendix I to Subpart P, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1501, <em>et seq. </em>(1981) (emphasis added). <em>See Stone v. Harris, </em>657 F.2d 210, 212 (8th Cir. 1981) (remanding case to the Secretary to consider effect of claimant\u2019s personality disorder).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Although the ALJ found that Tennant has a personality disorder, and noted that \u201c[a]n inadequate personality may be disabling,\u201d he concluded that Tennant is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The ALJ reached this conclusion on the basis of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines set out in Appendix 2 to Subpart P of Part 404 of the Secretary\u2019s regulations. The ALJ made the requisite underlying factual findings: that Tennant is a \u201cyounger individual\u201d with \u201climited education,\u201d whose previous work experience was \u201cunskilled,\u201d and that he has the physical capacity to perform light work. The ALJ stated that based on these findings, the medical-vocational \u201cgrid,\u201d specifically Rule 202.17, \u201cdirects a conclusion [that claimant] * * * be found \u2018not disabled.\u2019 \u201d The ALJ found that the result would be the same whether the claimant\u2019s exertional limitations alone or his exertional and nonexertional limitations in combination were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">The ALJ erred in relying on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines to reach his determination that Tennant is not disabled. His first finding \u2014 that Tennant\u2019s physical ability to perform light work renders him \u201cnot disabled\u201d under the grid \u2014 is irrelevant as Tennant\u2019s exertional abilities were not seriously at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">The ALJ\u2019s alternative finding \u2014 that Tennant\u2019s exertional and nonexertional limitations considered together lead to the same result under the grid \u2014 also misses the mark. There is no question that Tennant\u2019s primary impairment, and the one on which he has at all times based his claim, is his personality disorder \u2014 a nonexertional impairment. <em>See McCoy v. Schweiker, </em>683 F.2d 1138, at 1148 (8th Cir. 1982). The introduction to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines states that \u201c[t]he rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not disabled for individuals with solely nonexertional types of impairments.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, \u00a7 200.00(e)(1). The grid may be used as a \u201cframework\u201d for determining claims based on a combination of strength and nonexertional limitations. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 200.00(e)(2). In a case such as this, however, where the evidence of exertional limitations is extremely limited,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>pute focuses on whether the claimant has the emotional capacity to engage in sustained employment, resort to the grid is inappropriate. <em>See McCoy v. Schweiker, supra, </em>at 1148; <em>Torres v. Secretary of HHS, </em>668 F.2d 67, 69 (1st Cir. 1981). And we <em>agree </em>that \u201c[i]n a decision by an ALJ leaning on the \u2018Guidelines\u2019 in some measure for its ultimate conclusion it would be difficult, if not impossible, to be certain that the \u2018Guidelines\u2019 had not unduly influenced the overall decision by tainting an area in which they should not have been considered at all.\u201d <em>Torres v. Secretary of HHS, supra, </em>668 F.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The ALJ\u2019s erroneous reliance on the. Medical-Vocational Guidelines would, therefore, at least necessitate a remand for a redetermination of Tennant\u2019s disability claim. \u201cWhere, however, a rehearing would simply delay receipt of benefits, reversal is appropriate.\u201d <em>Lewin v. Schwieker, </em>654 F.2d 631, 635 (9th Cir. 1981). Reversal is appropriate in this case because a remand would serve no purpose. The record has been fully developed, and the overwhelming weight of the evidence supports Tennant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">As we have noted, the medical evidence unequivocally shows that Tennant suffers from a personality disorder. This evidence led the ALJ to conclude that Tennant cannot engage in his previous work. The burden, therefore, shifted to the Secretary to show that there is other substantial gainful activity that Tennant can perform. <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>666 F.2d 1153, 1155 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Stone v. Harris, </em>657 F.2d 210, 211 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Beasley v. Califano, </em>608 F.2d 1162, 1166 (8th Cir. 1979). The Secretary did not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The most compelling evidence relates to Tennant\u2019s work history. Tennant has held <em>forty-six </em>jobs in his twelve years of employment. His longest tenure at any job was six months. It appears that he has been fired from most of these jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Tennant has consistently demonstrated a desire to be gainfully employed, but has met with little success. He has been through a number of job training programs, but has never progressed in them to the satisfaction of his supervisors. His experience in the \u201creal world\u201d has been no better. An affidavit filed by Tennant\u2019s former supervisor at Great Plains Container Company is illustrative. The supervisor agreed that \u201cregardless of what job was assigned to [Tennant] * * * he show[ed] a lack of capacity to improve upon his initial performance with any job and meet the minimum standards required to maintain his employment.\u201d The employer noted that Tennant made an effort to do the jobs assigned to him, and indicated a desire to retain any job they would give him, \u201cbut [he] seemed to foul up everything he tried to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Tennant was discharged from his last job in September, 1978. In the three months following, he unsuccessfully applied for unskilled labor jobs with at least five businesses. Tennant has also sought help from the state employment agency in Hastings, Nebraska, but, according to his testimony, they refused to refer him out on jobs because \u201cyou give us a bad reputation.\u201d His attempts at self-employment, such as cutting lawns, have been similarly doomed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">There is virtually no evidence in the record to support a finding that Tennant can engage in substantial gainful employment. The ALJ noted the report of Dr. Landgraf stating that Tennant \u201ccan easily be expected to sustain work and adequate attendance, and to meet production norms.\u201d Ten-nant\u2019s twenty-two year employment history belies this conclusion. Dr. Landgraf acknowledged that Tennant\u2019s personality disorder was medically indicated, but obviously did not have knowledge of how the disorder has actually affected claimant\u2019s performance in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">The expert vocational testimony offered at the hearing can similarly be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>little, if any, weight. The vocational expert, Dr. Roger H. Livingston, testified that Tennant could return to his former work or perform other jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. He so testified in response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions, which asked the expert to \u201cassume the nature and severity of the claimant\u2019s impairments as you know them to be\u201d and \u201cto assume the medical evidence that you\u2019ve examined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">This Court has repeatedly warned that hypothetical questions posed to vocational experts in such circumstances should precisely set out the claimant\u2019s particular physical and mental impairments. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Harris, </em>666 F.2d 1153, 1155 n.1 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Gilliam v. Califano, </em>620 F.2d 691, 693-694 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Stephens v. Secretary of HEW, </em>603 F.2d 36, 41 (8th Cir. 1979). A more carefully worded hypothetical might have elicited probative vocational testimony in this case. As it is, however, the vocational expert exhibited no comprehension of the limits imposed by Tennant\u2019s impairment. Dr. Livingston addressed himself to the exertional and skill requirements of various jobs that he thought Tennant could perform. He concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate that [claimant] has any <em>physical </em>limitations that would prevent him from performing the normal routine duties of a job.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Dr. Livingston never mentioned any of the manifestations of Tennant\u2019s personality disorder, such as his anxiety, emotional instability and general ineptness, nor did he indicate how the disorder might affect Tennant\u2019s vocational potential. His testimony, therefore, does not support a conclusion that there is work that Tennant can perform for a sustained period.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">For the reasons stated above, we find that Wayne Tennant is disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court affirming the decision of the Secretary. We remand to the district court with directions to enter judgment for Tennant, awarding him benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 as of August 26,1976, and any Supplemental Security Income benefits to which he also may be entitled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">.
