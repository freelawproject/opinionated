(Mobilfone) appeals from an order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granting a permit for the construction of a new transmitter to intervenor Commonwealth Telephone Co. (Commonwealth). Mobilfone contends that the FCC erred in failing to designate for an eviden-tiary hearing Mobilfone\u2019s petition to deny Commonwealth\u2019s application. We affirm on the basis of two of the three grounds stated by the FCC for denying Mobilfone\u2019s petition, and express no view as to the soundness of the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Mobilfone and Commonwealth are competing suppliers of radio-telephone paging services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the area around Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Because paging services use radio signals, they must be licensed by the FCC. In Pennsylvania, paging services are also subject to regulation by the state\u2019s Public Utilities Commission (PUC). <em>See </em>66 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 1102(17)(f) (Purdon 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Commonwealth is the nation\u2019s tenth largest independent telephone company, and in 1981 had total assets of nearly $150 million and net income of more than $6 million. Mobilfone, whose assets and income are measured in the thousands rather than in millions, tried unsuccessfully to block Commonwealth\u2019s entry into the paging market in 1976. The FCC dismissed as premature Mobilfone\u2019s claim that Commonwealth proposed to charge anticompetitive rates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\">Whatever rates are finally filed in tariff form will be considered in the first instance by the Pennsylvania PUC which must make a determination as to their reasonableness. If, after that time, petitioner or anyone else can allege with some specificity that Commonwealth\u2019s rates are indeed anticompetitive, such an issue will be a proper subject for our consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Commonwealth Telephone Co., </em>61 F.C.C.2d 246, 255 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Mobilfone then brought an antitrust action against Commonwealth in June 1976, but lost on Commonwealth\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Mobilfone of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Telephone Co., </em>428 F.Supp. 131 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>571 F.2d 141, 147 (3d Cir. 1978) (antitrust immunity because \u201cthe state supervision of the challenged activity is comprehensive and active\u201d). In November 1978, Mobilfone filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania PUC alleging that Commonwealth\u2019s rates were unreasonable because Commonwealth cross-subsidized its paging services with receipts from its monopoly telephone services. The PUC administrative law judge recommended in August 1981 that Mobilfone\u2019s complaint be dismissed, and the PUC issued a final decision in May 1982 finding Commonwealth\u2019s paging rates \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and fully compensatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">In December 1978, while Mobilfone\u2019s complaint before the FCC was still pending, Commonwealth began the instant proceeding by applying for a new, \u201cfill-in\u201d transmitter to improve the technical quality of its paging signal in the mountainous area around Scranton. Mobilfone asked the FCC to deny the application, but the FCC refused on three grounds. Memorandum Order, December 23, 1981 (Order), Joint Appendix (J.A.) 231. First, \u201cMobilfone has failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing\u201d of Commonwealth\u2019s anticompetitive rates and practices. <em>Id. </em>at 3, J.A. 233. Second, \u201cthe subject application merely requests a fill-in facility,\u201d and \u201cis essentially a modification of Commonwealth\u2019s original proposal which is designed to improve the quality of service currently being offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, J.A. 234. Any relief would therefore be incomplete, because \u201cthis proposal only concerns a portion of Commonwealth\u2019s system, while Mo-bilfone\u2019s allegations concern the whole of Commonwealth\u2019s system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, J.A. 235. Finally, the FCC elected to defer consideration of Mobilfone\u2019s allegations \u201cuntil the State concludes its proceedings\u201d because \u201cto decide otherwise would be a waste of administrative resources.\u201d <em>Id., </em>J.A. 235.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Z\">This approach is not only consistent with Commission case precedent and policy but is also consistent with Section 309(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the Act because we are not refusing to consider the allegations of anticompeti-tive rates or practices, but rather deferring our consideration to a more appropriate time and forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Id., </em>J.A. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In its petition seeking rejection of Commonwealth\u2019s application, Mobilfone made detailed allegations that Commonwealth has engaged in anticompetitive practices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mobilfone now contends that these allegations are factually supported and uncontroverted, and that the FCC was required to designate Commonwealth\u2019s application for an evidentiary hearing to resolve material questions of fact under section 309 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a) (1976). This section requires the FCC to designate an application for a hearing when \u201ca substantial and material question of fact is presented,\u201d or if, for any other reason, the Commission is unable to determine whether granting the application would be consistent with the public interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 309(a), (d)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In light of the limited purpose of Commonwealth\u2019s application and the then-pending state PUC proceedings, we affirm the FCC\u2019s actions in this case. The Commission has broad discretion to make determinations of law and policy without holding a hearing, and it may decide that certain unresolved questions of fact are not material to a finding of what is in the public interest. <em>See United States v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d 72, 90-92 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc); <em>Marsh v. FCC, </em>436 F.2d 132, 135-36 (D.C.Cir.1970). As the FCC noted, the specific application that Mobilfone challenged involves neither expansion nor initiation of Commonwealth\u2019s paging services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission is entitled to control over its procedures and to conclude that Commonwealth\u2019s application to improve the technical quality of its signal in an area it was already licensed to serve was an inappropriate vehicle for resolving larger and unrelated questions of predatory pricing. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s policy of deferring consideration of certain issues until the completion of related state regulatory proceedings, <em>see, e.g., NR Recording and Communications, Inc., </em>87 F.C.C.2d 469 (1981), does seem a sound attempt in appropriate circumstances to avoid \u201ca waste of administrative resources.\u201d In this case, for example, the Pennsylvania PUC has made findings that are clearly relevant to any future proceedings before the FCC.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>determine the relative strength of these two grounds for denying Mobilfone\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, because taken in conjunction they fully support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Commonwealth\u2019s petition did not raise \u201ca substantial and material question of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">We therefore express no views about the third ground stated by the FCC, that Mobilfone had not made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Commonwealth has engaged in anti-competitive practices. It has long been settled that antitrust considerations are material to the public interest as defined by section 309. <em>See National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 190, 222-24, 63 S.Ct. 997, 1011-13, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943). This court has held that the FCC must \u201cseriously consider[] the antitrust consequences of a proposal and weigh[] those consequences with other public interest factors\u201d before approving an application filed under section 309. <em>United States v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d at 88. In addition, section 11 of the Clayton Act specifically gives the FCC jurisdiction to enforce the Clayton Act\u2019s prescription against predatory pricing. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), 21 (1976). The Commission itself has recognized the need for vigilance against predatory practices when telephone companies compete directly with smaller independent companies in the provision of paging services. <em>Guardband Proceeding, </em>12 F.C.C.2d 841, <em>recon. denied, </em>14 F.C.C.2d 269, 271 (1968), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Radio Relay Corp. v. FCC, </em>409 F.2d 322, 328 (2d Cir. 1969). In the past, the FCC has designated antitrust issues for a hearing when petitioners raised objections much like those that Mobilfone makes here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we agree with Mobilfone that the Pennsylvania PUC and the FCC jurisdictions involve rate questions that may differ to some extent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>also illustrates the serious questions that might arise if the FCC were always to defer consideration of important issues simply on the basis of a pending proceeding before a state regulatory commission. These questions are not before us, however. The Pennsylvania PUC proceedings have been concluded, and the FCC notes that the way remains open for Mobilfone to challenge the renewal of Commonwealth\u2019s license or petition to revoke that license. It was not error for the FCC to conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that consideration of Mobilfone\u2019s allegations, even if those allegations are sufficient to constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case, could be deferred to \u201ca more appropriate time and forum.\u201d Order at 5, J.A. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">. Paging services permit those trying to contact a subscriber to telephone the service, which transmits a radio signal to the small, portable receiver carried by the subscriber. These receivers are sometimes called \u201cbeepers,\u201d although they can also receive or transmit voice messages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-11\">. <em>Mobilfone of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Inc., </em>No. C-22065 (Pa. PUC May 7, 1982). For procedural reasons, the PUC also ordered Commonwealth to refile a tariff for proposed \u201csimultaneous activation services,\u201d which allow customers to reach two or more paging receivers by dialing a single telephone number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. Mobilfone first alleged that Commonwealth\u2019s rates, which are slightly lower than Mobilfone\u2019s for equivalent services, do not cover Commonwealth\u2019s costs and are therefore predatory. For example, Mobilfone contended that Commonwealth\u2019s paging revenues do not pay for its extensive advertising of paging services in the telephone company\u2019s yellow pages, and that Commonwealth offers a \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d discount that reduces the subscriber\u2019s charge per page by $9 a month even though Commonwealth\u2019s costs per page fall only 33 cents a month. Mobilfone also alleged that Commonwealth has engaged in such anticompetitive practices as enclosing paging advertisements in the telephone bills mailed to businesses. The FCC responded that these practices were not improper per se, but only if Commonwealth\u2019s paging revenues failed to cover their costs. Order at 3, J.A. 233.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">. Although Commonwealth submitted an application that was subject to a full Section 309 review, it might conceivably have chosen to proceed under regulations governing \u201cminor\u201d applications, and its proposal would not then have been subject to challenge by Mobilfone. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(c)(2)(A); 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 22.-27(c)(1), 22.30(b)(2). In order to proceed under these regulations, an applicant must make an engineering showing that any increase in the reliable service contours is less than 10% or one mile. Order at 4 n. 10, J.A. 234 n. 10. Commonwealth did not make such a showing, and we note that Section 309(d) gives interested third parties the right to petition the FCC to deny any non-minor applications whether or not the applications involve the whole system of the applicant. <em>See, e.g., Wometco Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>314 F.2d 266 (D.C.Cir.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\">. The Pennsylvania ALJ\u2019s decision was made on the basis of nine days of hearings and a record in excess of 600 pages, and much of the proceeding involved disputes over the accuracy of Commonwealth\u2019s cost of service studies. The ALJ concluded that Commonwealth earned a 10.9% rate of return on its paging facilities, \u201cwhich far exceeds the rate of return it earns on its investment in its landline telephone plant.\u201d ALJ Recommended Decision, August 24, 1981, at 27, Supplemental Appendix at 27. Mobilfone emphasizes, however, that the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>opinion did not resolve its challenges to Commonwealth\u2019s cost accounting practices. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Petitioner Mobilfone at 14 n.38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Bonduel Telephone Co., </em>68 F.C.C.2d 497 (1978) (FCC designated hearing on basis of showing that telephone company\u2019s paging rates possibly did not cover its expenses in providing, administering, and promoting those services); <em>Illinois Bell Telephone Co., </em>69 F.C.C.2d 1199, 1206 (1978) (hearing designated because \u201cIllinois Bell includes information about paging in its information packets that describe business telephone services\u201d); <em>United Telephone of Ohio, </em>26 F.C.C.2d 417 (1970) (company\u2019s paging service costs were considerably higher than its paging revenues). See <em>generally Guardband Proceeding, </em>12 F.C.C.2d at 841 (establishing Commission policy against cross-subsidization of paging services from telephone company wireline revenues).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. The Pennsylvania PUC has stated that its application of \u201cantitrust principles ... would, in our opinion, undermine the rationale for public utility regulation.... [PJrinciples of the free competitive market, which underlie antitrust legislation, do not apply to industries regulated by the Commission.\u201d <em>Airsignal International of Pittsburgh, </em>No. A.00101365, at 31 (Pa. PUC Jan. 14, 1980). Mobilfone\u2019s PUC complaint alleged that Commonwealth\u2019s rates granted \u201can unreasonable preference or advantage\u201d to some persons and subjected others to \u201can unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage,\u201d Brief for Petitioner Mobilfone at 8, and not that these rates were predatory. The FCC has acknowledged that its scrutiny of anticompetitive allegations \u201cin no sense imping[es] on the regulatory ambit of a state commission; our concern is not with the level of rates; our concern is that there may be unfair or illegal competitive practices.... \u201d <em>United Telephone of Ohio, </em>12 F.C.C.2d at 419. Even more recently, the FCC found no conflict with state regulation in its imposition of competitive restrictions on wireline carriers that offer paging services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">We note that in imposing this requirement we are establishing standards to deter unfair competitive practices and to foster competitive equality between wireline carriers and [radio common carriers]. We are in no way addressing the level of the charges, prescribing any particular level or pattern of rates or otherwise participating in the rate-making process, which is the function of the authorities in the particular jurisdiction where the services are provided. Our goal is to avoid potential \u201cprice squeeze\u201d effects, <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, </em>148 F.2d 416 (1945), consistent with our mandate to consider and protect the public interest. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-12\"><em>Final Report and Order, </em>Docket No. 80-183, May 14, 1982, at 10 n.17. Although we note the distinction between a state\u2019s determination that a utility\u2019s rates are not \u201cunreasonably\u201d high and the FCC\u2019s concern for whether rates are predatorily low, the Pennsylvania PUC in this case specifically found that Commonwealth\u2019s rates \u201cwere just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory <em>and fully compensatory.\u201d Mobil-fone of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Inc., </em>No. C-22065, at 2 (Pa. PUC May 7, 1982) (emphasis added). If and when Mobilfone presents' its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>allegations to the FCC in an appropriate procedural posture, the FCC may determine what weight it should give the PUC\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
