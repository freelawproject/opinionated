The court has accorded the petitions full consideration and has determined that abbreviat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ed disposition is appropriate. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir.R. 13(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">As further detailed in the accompanying memorandum, the petitions raise questions the Commission is now proceeding to consider and resolve, hence court review would be premature. It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that, the Commission having reached no final decisions as to the issues on which the petitioners seek review concerning the lawfulness of the current WATS tariff, the petitions for review are denied; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED, pursuant to this court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction in <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>627 F.2d 322 (D.C.Cir.1980), that the Commission file with the court, within 60 days, an estimated time schedule for final resolution of the pending WATS investigation and quarterly reports thereafter on progress toward such resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Petitioners Southern Pacific Communications Co. (SPCC) and Aerospace Industries Association of America, Inc. challenge particular provisions of American Telephone and Telegraph Company\u2019s (AT&amp;T) WATS tariff, now under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC), and effective by operation of law on an interim basis. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a). We find both petitions premature. The Commission elected to proceed with its investigation of the lawfulness of the current tariff in two phases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the initial phase, the Commission took only one final action: it prescribed, generically, time-of-day sensitive pricing for any WATS tariff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second stage of the investigation is now underway. In an opinion and order released April 16, 1982,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commission set out and scheduled for comment a range of issues, including those raised by the petitioners. Therefore the petitions do not present to this court final Commission decisions ripe for judicial review. The matters currently before the Commission are complex and important; they should be resolved expeditiously, but not in advance of an opportunity for expression of views by all interested parties and reasoned consideration by the Commission in light of those views.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">Nor can we conclude, at this juncture, that the course the Commission is pursuing violates this court\u2019s mandate in <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, </em>627 F.2d 322, 345 (D.C.Cir.1980). In <em>MCI, </em>the court required the FCC to adopt and follow a schedule for \u201cfinal determination of a just and reasonable WATS tariff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since the <em>MCI </em>decision, the FCC has prescribed resale and sharing of WATS and MTS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and has established interim cost allocation guidelines for AT&amp;T\u2019s interstate offerings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In January 1981, the Commission reported to the <em>MCI </em>panel its plan to bifurcate the investigation of the tariff now in place.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>No party then raised an objection and the panel took no action in response to the FCC\u2019s report. We further appreciate that this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ad Hoc Telecommunications Users Committee v. FCC, </em>680 F.2d 790 (D.C.Cir.1982), vacating the Commission\u2019s <em>Like Services </em>decision,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will require adjustment of the second phase of the WATS tariff investigation. Indeed, petitioner SPCC faulted the Commission, particularly, for failure to implement that now vacated decision and represented to this court: \u201cHad the Commission applied [its <em>Like </em>Services] decision ... to its evaluation of the current WATS tariff, much of the reason underlying SPCC\u2019s filing of its pe'tition for review would have been obviated.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Commission has stated its intention to proceed expeditiously with the second stage of the WATS investigation. To assure that the Commission does not lose sight of this court\u2019s instruction in <em>MCI, </em>and consistent with the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction in that proceeding, we instruct the Commission to file with this court, within 60 days, an estimated time schedule, in view of developments subsequent to the <em>MCI </em>decision, for final resolution of the pending WATS investigation, and, thereafter, to report quarterly to the court on progress toward such resolution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. <em>See </em>American Tel. &amp; Tel.
