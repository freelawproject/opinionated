Green, </em>the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could make a prima facie claim of employment discrimination by showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(i) that he belongs to a racial minority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (footnote omitted). Appellants argue that appellee has not and cannot establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge from employment because \u201celement (iv) [of the <em>McDonnell </em>model for proving a prima facie case] necessitates a showing that a plaintiff\u2019s position was filled by a person not a member of the protected minority.... [And since] the evidence established that [appellee, a black man] was permanently replaced by a member of a protected class [a female], the burden of going forward did not pass to Appellants.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [Appellants\u2019 <em>Brief </em>at 6-7]. The dissenting opinion, in support of appellants\u2019 argument, also sees the fact that appellants sought minority applicants as foreclosing the finding that appellants have engaged in discriminatory conduct towards this appellee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">That reasoning would foreclose a plaintiff from proving a prima facie case unless an employer discriminated not only against plaintiff but also against every so-called protected minority by hiring a so-called \u201cnon-protected\u201d person to fill the position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 argument defies the logic, purpose and language of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The reference to an employer seeking applicants from persons of \u201ccomplainant\u2019s qualifications\u201d in the (iv) element of the <em>McDonnell </em>model for establishment of a prima facie case, does not refer to the complainant\u2019s racial, ethnic, gender, religious, or national origin background. Title VII does not establish a class of protected minorities and non-protected others. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 259, 101 S.Ct. at 1097. \u201cIt is clear beyond cavil that the obligation imposed by Title VII is to provide an equal opportunity for each applicant regardless of race, without regard to whether members of the applicant\u2019s race are already proportionately represented in the work force.\u201d <em>Furnco Const. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. at 579, 98 S.Ct. at 2951. We hold that the reference to \u201ccomplainant\u2019s qualifications\u201d in the <em>McDonnell </em>model refers to a complainant\u2019s pertinent skills, talents, learning, training, and experience. The central focus of the inquiry in a Title VII case such as this is whether the employer is treating a plaintiff less favorably than others because of his race, color, religion, sex or national origin. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 98 S.Ct. at 2949. \u201c[T]he Act does not command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member of a minority group. Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification... . Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.... Congress has not commanded that the less qualified be preferred over the better qualified simply because of minority origin. Far from disparaging job qualifications as such, Congress has made such qualifications the controlling factor, so that race, religion, nationality, and sex become irrelevant.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 430, 431, 432, 436, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 854, 856, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The fact that appellants have hired a female to replace appellee does not therefore preclude appellee from proving a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge from employment. \u201cA racially balanced work force cannot immunize an employer from liability for specific acts of discrimination .... \u2018The company\u2019s later changes in its hiring and promotion policies could be of little comfort to the victims of the earlier post-Act discrimination, and could not erase its previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford relief to those who suffered because of it.\u2019\u201d <em>Furnco Const. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. at 579, 98 S.Ct. at 2950-51, <em>citing, Teamsters v.

Consequently, we may make an independent examination of the ultimate fact of discrimination, though we are still bound by findings of subsidiary facts which are not clearly erroneous. <em>Stewart v. General Motors Corp., </em>542 F.2d 445, 449 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 919, 97 S.Ct. 2995, 53 L.Ed.2d 1105 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Plaintiff-appellee established a prima facie case of employment discrimination by proving that: he is a black man who was qualified for his position as chief dietician at the State Hospital having been trained in dietetics, receiving a bachelor of science degree from New York University and a master of science degree from Columbia University;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> despite his satisfactory work performance he was discharged from his position;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the position was filled temporarily by an individual who appellants admit was not qualified for the job, and later the position was filled by an individual of complainant\u2019s qualifications. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Weidner, </em>596 F.2d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Defendants-appellants then met their burden of rebutting appellee\u2019s prima facie case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for appellee\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 only articulated reason was that appellee was discharged for \u201cConduct Unbecoming a State Employee, in that while [he was] <em>claiming to be ill </em>after surgery <em>and unable to perform </em>[his] <em>duties </em>as a Dietician III for the State of Indiana and this Training Center, [he] worked as a consulting dietician for the Glen Oaks Nursing Home in Auburn, Indiana on the following dates [five specified dates].\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s <em>Exhibit </em>1 \u2014 State Hospital\u2019s official notice of suspension pending dismissal) (emphasis added). The record is devoid of any facts in support of the dissent\u2019s view that appellants\u2019 articulated reason was based on a claim of a state policy forbidding an employee from engaging in any other kind of employment while on sick leave. The dissent ignores that appellants\u2019 articulated reason merely sought to utilize appellee\u2019s performance of consulting work as proof of the lack of truth and veracity in appellee\u2019s claim to be ill and unable to perform his duties at the State Hospital. <em>(Transcript </em>at 119-20, 131).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Direct showing of the discriminatory reasons that more likely motivated an employer in the decision to discharge an employee is not the only method of proving intentional discrimination. Intentional discrimination may also be proven \u201cindirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095; <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </em>411 U.S. at 806-807, 93 S.Ct. at 1826-27. We hold that the evidence establishes that the appellee proved that appellants\u2019 proffered reason was not the true reason for his discharge and that he was the victim of intentional discrimination. The primary facts proved at the trial were that while plaintiff was working at the State Hospital, before he went on sick leave, he was informed by a State Hospital social worker that there was a need at the Glen Oaks Nursing Home for a consulting dietician in order for the nurs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ing home to meet medical standards, cause the State Hospital housed some forty patients at the nursing home, there was some concern that the home might be forced to close if medicare standards were not met and that the State Hospital would then be required to find alternative housing for the patients. Following the lead provided by the social worker at the State Hospital and pursuing the need recognized by the social worker, plaintiff agreed, prior to going on sick leave, to serve as a consultant to the nursing home. This was not shown to be contrary to law or State Hospital policy. On April 16, 1974, plaintiff began an extended period of sick leave. Dr. Reed notified the State Hospital that plaintiff would be entering Parkview Hospital, but that it was not possible at that time to determine how long plaintiff would be unable to work. On April 24, plaintiff underwent an especially complicated hemorrhoid-ectomy surgery. On June 7, Dr. Towles notified the State Hospital by letter that plaintiff would not be able to return to work until approximately July 8. On July 1, Dr. Towles again saw plaintiff and found that plaintiff was still having difficulty from the surgery. Dr. Towles so informed the State Hospital by a letter dated July 3, which also requested a leave of absence until July 29. Dr. Towles closed the letter by stating that \u201cif additional information is needed please do not hesitate to call this office.\u201d Be-</p>\n<p id=\"b189-2\">The facts further prove that when plaintiff discussed returning to his job at the State Hospital, Dr. Towles \u201cobjected violently,\u201d since plaintiff\u2019s post-surgery restrictions included sitting and lifting and plaintiff\u2019s duties at the State Hospital required a great deal of sitting and some occasional lifting. Most importantly, State Hospital policies required that a person returning from sick leave return with no restrictions. Thus, plaintiff was still unable to return to the State Hospital because he could not do so free of the restrictions placed on him by the attending surgeon. However, plaintiff\u2019s restrictions did not preclude him from engaging in part-time consulting work at the nursing home. His work there required neither sitting nor lifting. Further, plaintiff intended to make only approximately five consulting trips during the four-month period of his convalescence. Dr. Towles expressly approved plaintiff\u2019s limited number of consulting trips on the condition that plaintiff follow specified precautions, but he did not approve plaintiff\u2019s return to work at the State Hospital because of the difference in job requirements between the nursing home and State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Dr. Ackerman, a doctor of education who is Superintendent of the State Hospital, learned of plaintiff\u2019s consulting work at the nursing home. Dr. Ackerman made a visit to the nursing home to see State Hospital patients and to personally investigate whether plaintiff was consulting there. However, Dr. Ackerman did not inquire as to the nature or extent of plaintiff\u2019s duties at the nursing home, nor did he inquire of plaintiff or of Dr. Towles as to plaintiffs duties or whether plaintiff had his doctor\u2019s permission to perform the consulting duties. The district court found that this latter course of conduct by Dr. Ackerman was in stark contrast to his personal investigation at the nursing home to verify that plaintiff had done some part-time consulting there.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Although Dr. Ackerman would not have allowed plaintiff to return to work until plaintiff could perform his full duties at the State Hospital, Dr. Ackerman determined that plaintiff\u2019s engaging in part-time consulting work while drawing sick pay from the State of Indiana constituted \u201cconduct unbecoming a state employee,\u201d and terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment at the State Hospital, despite the fact that the part-time work was undertaken to meet the Hospital\u2019s need as recognized by its social worker. Dr. Ackerman did not discuss the termination with the plaintiff nor with Dr. Towles before suspending plaintiff effective July 16, pending termination as of August 15, even though Dr. Towles had invited such inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The following evidence was proved, establishing that defendants\u2019 proffered reason for discharging plaintiff was a pretext: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>On July 11, Dr. Towles spoke to Dr. Sirlin, Medical Director of the State Hospital in 1974, and told Dr. Sirlin that he thought plaintiff would be able to return to work shortly and that Dr. Towles would communicate with Dr. Sirlin after again examining plaintiff. However, the decision to dismiss plaintiff was made on or before July 16, 1974, before Dr. Towles could report to Dr. Sirlin. Even though defendants were expecting a further report from plaintiffs surgeon, plaintiff was suspended pending dismissal before that report could be sent. The action was taken prior to any investigation of whether plaintiff had the consent of his surgeon to continue doing permissible part-time work at the nursing home, work he had agreed to do, upon arrangement by the Hospital\u2019s social worker, prior to his sick leave, and the decision to suspend plaintiff was taken prior to any investigation as to whether the nature of plaintiff\u2019s work at the nursing home differed significantly from the nature of his work at the State Hospital. After plaintiff\u2019s suspension and pending dismissal, Dr. Sirlin received a strongly worded letter from Dr. Towles, dated July 19, protesting plaintiff\u2019s dismissal and expressing surprise and indignation at defendants\u2019 apparent disregard for his recommendations. Dr. Towles\u2019 letter discussed the post-surgical complications still being experienced by plaintiff and expressly stated that he had given plaintiff permission to make five or six trips to the Glen Oaks Nursing Home in Auburn, Indiana. Dr. Towles stated in the letter that \u201cbecause he made these trips, did not qualify him for a return to his usual occupation, and this I shall maintain.\u201d Dr. Towles concluded his letter to Dr. Sirlin by stating that \u201cI was very surprised at your course of action since I had talked with you, given you his true state of affairs, and had informed you I would contact you after I had seen him. I must assume that you consider me either incompetent or lying, or both. Would be most happy to talk to you over the telephone or give you additional information by letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pA_q\">Only after receiving Dr. Towles\u2019 strongly worded letter did Dr. Sirlin call Dr. Towles on July 22. What the district court found as most probative of the fact that appellants\u2019 proffered reason was a pretext, was a memorandum prepared by Dr. Sirlin to Dr. Ackerman which purports to convey the July 22 conversation between Doctors Towles and Sirlin, but which in no way accurately reflects the conversation. Dr. Sirlin\u2019s memo stated that Dr. Towles \u201cfeels he has been misled by [appellee]\u201d. However, the district court found that Dr. Towles\u2019 July 19 letter to Dr. Sirlin and Dr. Towles\u2019 court testimony thoroughly discredit this conclusion, which was the superior\u2019s basis for appellants\u2019 articulated reason for discharging appellee. Appellants\u2019 records and the court testimony indicate appellants\u2019 fabrication of the facts and the utter disregard of information at their disposal relevant to appellee\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In summary, the appellants\u2019 articulated reason of \u201cconduct unbecoming a state employee\u201d was a conclusory reason which might have been a legitimate reason for discharging the appellee if he had not been able to prove employer\u2019s intentional discrimination by showing that the articulated reason was a mere pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. Appellant cites <em>Markey v. Tenneco Oil Co., </em>439 F.Supp. 219, 223 (D.C.La., 1977) <em>aff\u2019d </em>in part and <em>rev\u2019d </em>in part, 635 F.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1981). However, it appears that appellant is relying on the holding at 224 where the court stated: \u201cIt is questionable in this case whether Markey has even gone so far as to present a prima facie case of discrimination. A plaintiffs mere suspicion that he has been discriminated against, is not sufficient evidence to support an individual charge under Title VII. <em>Mar-key did not demonstrate that the position he vacated was filled by a white person. In fact, Paul Floth testified that Markey had been replaced by a black.\u201d </em>(footnote omitted) (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">As will be clear from our analysis, we disagree with the language of the <em>Markey </em>court that appears to require for proof of a prima facie case of a Title VII discrimination that the person discharged be replaced by a \u201cnon-minority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-12\">. \u201cThe ultimate fact is that State authorities are branded as having engaged in discriminatory conduct in violation of a federal statute, notwithstanding, as the majority opinion observed, \u2018the appellants did in fact seek minority applicants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Infra </em>at 138 (Pell, J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\">. Establishment of a prima facie case under the <em>McDonnell </em>model \u201ccreates a presumption [a legally mandatory inference] that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee\u201d. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254-255, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). It does not constitute an ultimate finding of fact as to discriminatory discharge from employment under Title VII. <em>Furnco Const. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 576, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1981). \u201cThe ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant unintentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093. After a plaintiff proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge or failure to hire, the \u201cburden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s rejection [or employee\u2019s discharge].\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. If such reason is articulated by the employer, the focus returns to the plaintiff so that he can be afforded a fair opportunity to show that [the employer\u2019s] stated reason for [the employee\u2019s] rejection [or discharge] was in fact pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825; <em>Davis v.

Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellants\u2019 interpretation of the (iv) element in <em>McDonnell </em>was correct, their argument is nonsensical. The facts in the instant case clearly show that appellants did in fact seek \u201cminority\u201d applicants. Therefore even if as appellants contend, \u201ccomplainant\u2019s qualifications\u201d in <em>McDonnell </em>refers to a complainant\u2019s \u201cminority\u201d status, which, as we made clear, it does not, plaintiff has satisfied the requirement of showing that the employer sought applicants of complainant\u2019s qualification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">. The district court found that \u201c[t]here was absolutely no evidence to indicate that plaintiff was not qualified for his position as chief dietician . ..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. A showing of satisfactory performance is necessary to raise an inference of discrimination in a discharge from employment. Plaintiff met this requirement by showing that employer accepted his work without express reservation. <em>Flowers v. Crouch-Walker, </em>552 F.2d 1277, 1281-1283 (7th Cir. 1977). Plaintiff contends that he experienced no problems in his employment until the defendant, Dr. Ackerman, was appointed as superintendent of the hospital. Upon said appointment, plaintiff contends he became a victim of a pattern of discrimination by the defendant; as an example, it is alleged that Dr. Ackerman had previously held a hearing without giving plaintiff notice or the right to have an attorney and demoted plaintiff, appointing a lesser qualified white person to plaintiffs job.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">. \u201cThe defendant[s] need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant[s\u2019] evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254-255, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95 (citations omitted); <em>see </em>note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b188-13\">. \u201cA satisfactory explanation by the defendant destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination arising from the plaintiff\u2019s initial evidence.

The dissent mischaracterizes these findings as the majority\u2019s \u201ccredibility determination\u201d, and proceeds to make its own findings as to credibility. However the credibility determinations were made by the district court in its province of judging the credibility of the evidence and determining the facts. Unlike the dissent, we do think it was proper for the district court to consider whether actions which have occurred subsequent to the appellants\u2019 determination to discharge the appellee were probative of the actual motives for appel-Iants\u2019 determination. On review we do not find the credibility determinations and the findings of fact clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b190-13\">. The district court held that \u201cdefendants did not meet their burden of establishing sufficient non-discriminatory reasons for terminating plaintiff\u2019s employment,\u201d but the court continued its analysis and held that \u201c[i]t can only be concluded from the evidence in this case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defendants\u2019 stated reason for the termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment was pretext.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">We hold that the district court\u2019s initial holding that defendants did not establish sufficient non-discriminatory reasons for terminating plaintiff\u2019s employment was non-reversible error. We believe that defendants met their burden of articulating a legitimate reason for plaintiffs discharge in that the articulated reason was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether defendants discriminated against the plaintiff, and it sufficiently met plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, while framing the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that plaintiff was required to demonstrate pretext. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254, 255, 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. Nevertheless, the error is not grounds for reversal in this case, because our independent examination of</p>\n<p id=\"A4R\">the ultimate fact of discrimination leads us to agree with the district court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had met the burden of showing that defendant\u2019s articulated reason was a pretext.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b190-14\">.

Appellee is directed to file with the district court, within thirty days, a complete breakdown of the requested fees and such other material supporting the request, within the guidelines set forth in <em>Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works, </em>502 F.2d 1309 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. <em>denied, </em>425 U.S. 997, 96 S.Ct. 2214, 48 L.Ed.2d 823 (1976). The district court shall determine the required procedure and issue an order disposing of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>PELL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In this case, the majority opinion upholds a judgment to the effect that the state authorities had discriminatorily discharged the plaintiff in violation of Title VII. This means in this case, in the words of the majority opinion, that the record established that the employer had treated the plaintiff less favorably than others because of his race. The plain and simple fact is that the plaintiff was engaging in part-time consulting work for pay while drawing sick pay from the public treasury and this was the reason Dr. Ackerman articulated for the discharge, i.e., that this was conduct unbecoming a state employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">I can think of no way of characterizing the being on the public payroll because of sick leave while not working but nevertheless performing compensated work in the private sector other than that of \u201cunbecoming conduct.\u201d It takes no hyperactive imagination to realize what an embarrassing position the hiring authorities would have been placed in if this had come to the attention of the media. It appears to me that the appearance of unbecoming conduct on the part of a public employee is almost as damaging to the image of good government as would be the actual fact of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">I regard it as immaterial that the type of work at the nursing home may have been of a less demanding nature than the employment at the state hospital. The state may have had no policy against \u201cmoonlighting;\u201d I cannot tell from the record. It certainly, in any event, is an entirely different situation than the present one if a public employee has the capability of performing a second job and is being paid for both. Here he was not performing a second job but only a first job although being paid by the public while not working for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">I fail to follow the logic of the majority opinion in its holding that the discharge was pretextual. The record is silent as to any discriminatory practices on the part of the appellants toward any employees because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The finding of pretext dangles on the weak thread of the plaintiff\u2019s not being well enough to return to his state job and contradictory testimony as to what one doctor said to another. Apparently, the majority makes the credibility determination as to the accurate reflection of this conversation. Elsewhere, however, in the majority opinion it is clear that the memorandum from Dr. Sirlin to Dr. Ackerman was subsequent to the determination already made, and properly so, that the discharge was justified by conduct unbecoming to a state employee. I see nothing conclusory or pretextual about guarding the public coffers from unwarranted criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In short, the majority\u2019s syllogism seems to be that plaintiff was a member of a protected minority class, that he was a competent employee with acceptable qualifications, that he was discharged because he was working on another job while on sick leave, <em>ergo, </em>the reason given for his dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>charge was pretextual. The process ignores the fact that there was a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. What. Title VII is all about is to put a stop to discriminatory treatment of employees. The essential element of discrimination is missing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The plaintiff may well have been well qualified and when he was on the job he may have been an effective employee. The ultimate fact is that state authorities are branded as having engaged in discriminatory conduct in violation of a federal statute, notwithstanding, as the majority opinion observed, \u201cthe appellants did in fact seek \u2018minority\u2019 applicants.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">This record does not justify that stigma. The appellants did what public officials properly should have under the circumstances here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">With all due respect to the majority opinion, and to the then district court judge, I would reverse with direction to enter judgment for the defendants. For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-16\"> I note the comments in the majority opinion regarding my dissent. Of course, the seeking of minority applicants will not preclude the existence of discriminatory treatment of a single individual. It is, however, a significant factor in a record which is devoid of evidence of racial discrimination. I do not regard a questionable finding that a post hoc exchange of correspondence really was only verisimilar on the part of Dr. Ackerman as a sufficient basis for saying that the discharge resulted from racial discrimination. An employer accused unjustly of discrimination unfortunately may tend to resort to unnecessary rationalization. This is an infirm basis for saying that there was indeed discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
