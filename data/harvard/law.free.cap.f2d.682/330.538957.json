Leval, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Plaintiff Alden Auto Parts Warehouse, Inc. (\u201cAlden\u201d), appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, George C. Pratt, <em>Judge, </em>following the granting of summary judgment ruling that neither Alden nor defendant Dolphin Equipment Leasing Corp. (\u201cDolphin\u201d) was entitled to recover damages from the other. For the reasons below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The present action was commenced by Alden in district court, with jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, to recover moneys it had paid to an assignee of Dolphin as a result of the fraud of a third person not party to this lawsuit, Intertel Communications Corporation (\u201cIntertel\u201d); the parties agree that both Alden and Dolphin were victims of Intertel\u2019s fraud. In 1975 Alden leased, for a five-year period, certain telephone equipment from Intertel; Intertel immediately sold its reversionary interest in the equipment to Wornat Leasing Corporation (\u201cWornat\u201d) and so informed Alden. Alden was instructed to, and did for the next three years, make its rental payments to Wornat. In 1978, at Intertel\u2019s behest, Alden signed a new lease agreement for the same equipment, and Intertel then delivered this lease to Dolphin and purported to sell its reversionary interest in the equipment (long-since sold to Wornat) to Dolphin; Dolphin gave Alden an option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease period. Alden was instructed by Intertel to make lease payments thereafter to an assignee of Dolphin. Alden made the payments to Dolphin\u2019s assign-ee for some ten months, ignoring notices from Wornat that lease payments due Wor-nat were late. Eventually Alden was sued by both Wornat and Dolphin\u2019s assignee, ended up paying both, and then sued Dolphin to recover the amount paid to Dolphin\u2019s assignee. Dolphin counterclaimed against Alden, apparently seeking recovery of either the equipment or its fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">On the basis of these facts, which were not in dispute, the district court found that both parties had been negligent in their dealings with Intertel and ruled that neither should recover from the other. This decision seems soundly based in New York law. To begin with, we note that although Alden seems to assume that its action against Dolphin sounds in tort and seeks to have the parties\u2019 losses apportioned according to principles of comparative negligence, Alden has no claim against Dolphin for tort. The closest Alden came to asserting a claim in tort was in the fourth count of its complaint, which alleged that the fraudulent representations by Intertel were made on behalf of Dolphin. However, Alden has since conceded that Dolphin had no involvement in the fraud and was instead, like Alden, a victim of it. The district court found that \u201cthere is no question of Dolphin\u2019s subjective good faith . .. . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Rather, Alden\u2019s claim is best characterized as one for rescission of the 1978 lease based on mistake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is important to recognize, however, that while the fraud of Intertel led Alden to execute the second lease on the basis of a mistake of fact, this was not an instance of <em>mutual </em>mistake on the part of Alden and Dolphin. It is true that both were deceived, but each was in error as to a different fact. Alden, which knew that Intertel had sold the equipment to Wornat, mistakenly believed that Wornat had sold the equipment to Dolphin. Dolphin, however, did not know of the earlier sale to Wornat and was unaware of Alden\u2019s mistaken belief; Dolphin\u2019s mistake of fact was its belief that at the time of the second lease Intertel was the supplier of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>telephone equipment leased by Alden \u2014 a belief supported by Alden\u2019s execution of the new lease showing Intertel as the supplier of the equipment. Thus, although each party was mistaken, Alden\u2019s mistake was not a mutual mistake. <em>See </em>Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 12 comment b (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Although a contract entered into because of a <em>mutual </em>mistake of material fact will generally be avoidable, 37 N.Y. Jur. <em>Mistake, Accident, or Surprise </em>\u00a7 5 (1964), a unilateral mistake standing alone usually does not justify equitable relief, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7; Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12 (\u201cA person who confers a benefit upon another, manifesting that he does so as an offer of a bargain which the other accepts or as the acceptance of an offer which the other has made, is not entitled to restitution because of a mistake which the other does not share and the existence of which the other does not know or suspect.\u201d). The fact that Alden was led into its mistake by Intertel\u2019s fraud does not give Alden a right to rescission against Dolphin since the latter was in no way a party to the fraud. <em>See </em>Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28. Even focusing solely on Alden\u2019s 1978 dealings with Intertel and accepting Alden\u2019s assertion that it believed it was merely signing a document designed to assist Inter-tel in obtaining new financing, Alden would have no right to restitution against Dolphin, since \u201crecovery is ordinarily denied as against a third person who, as a result of a mistake in a transaction between two other persons, receives a payment from one of them in good faith in the ordinary course of business and for a valuable consideration.\u201d 50 N.Y.Jur. <em>Restitution and Implied Contracts </em>\u00a7 22 (1966); Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14 &amp; comment d. Valuable consideration, of course, may consist of the third party\u2019s payment to either party to the contract at issue. <em>See id. </em>illustration 9 (\u201cBy fraud A obtains an I.O.U. from B. A sells this to C who pays value and has no reason to know of the fraud. Without further information, C presents the I.O.U. to B who pays. B is not entitled to restitution from C.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">A request for rescission and restitution is addressed to the equity powers of the court, <em>e.g., Abner M. Harper, Inc. v. City of Newburgh, </em>159 A.D. 695, 699-700, 145 N.Y.S. 59, 63-64 (2d Dep\u2019t 1913), and if that request is premised on a unilateral mistake such relief will normally not be granted if the defendant, by reason of changed circumstances or otherwise, will be prejudiced thereby, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 697, 145 N.Y.S. at 62; <em>Harding v. Knapp, </em>8 N.Y.S.2d 224, 227 (City Ct.Roch.1938); Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 69, 142. There is no dispute that in the present case there has been a change of circumstances since the new lease in 1978, in connection with which Dolphin paid moneys to Inter-tel: Alden acknowledges that Intertel has since gone out of business. In all the circumstances, therefore, the district court\u2019s decision, on the basis of the undisputed facts, that each party should bear its own losses and that neither Alden nor Dolphin is entitled to recover from the other, was well within the court\u2019s discretion in the exercise of its equity powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Alden\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the district court granted Alden summary judgment on the issue of Dolphin\u2019s liability to it and either erred in ruling that Alden\u2019s recovery was barred by its negligence, or erred in deciding factual questions as to Alden\u2019s damages. We disagree with Alden\u2019s premise and find no merit in either claim of error. Although both parties assume that Judge Pratt granted partial summary judgment to Alden on the liability issues of its claim against Dolphin, we do not construe the opinion in this way. The sole portion of Judge Pratt\u2019s opinion pointed to by the parties in this regard is a paragraph that reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">For these reasons, defendant Dolphin by the lease that was fraudulently executed by Intertel never obtained title to the goods in question and cannot recover on the lease contract. Alden\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue is, therefore, granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We see no basis in this paragraph for any inference that Judge Pratt ruled in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Alden on any part of its claim against Dolphin. Rather, the paragraph speaks only of <em>Dolphin\u2019s </em>claim of title, states that <em>Dolphin </em>cannot recover on the lease contract, and grants summary judgment to Alden \u201con this issue.\u201d And this paragraph of the opinion is followed immediately by a paragraph that begins \u201cThere <em>remains </em>the issue of whether <em>Alden </em>can recover from <em>Dolphin </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added). The conclusion reached in the court\u2019s discussion of \u201cthe issue of whether Alden can recover\u201d is that Alden should not recover. Thus, although the opinion ends by stating that \u201cwhile plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, the court finds that neither party can recover damages,\u201d we find no indication in the opinion that Alden was granted summary judgment as to any issue but its own liability to Dolphin.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Finally, the court\u2019s discussion leading to the denial of recovery to Alden does not purport to decide questions as to damages; it is unrelated to any assessment or computation of the amount of Alden\u2019s loss. Rather, it can sensibly be construed only as a decision of the court, in the exercise of its equity power, that Alden\u2019s unilateral mistake in entering into the second lease, which resulted from its own negligence rather than from any misrepresentation on the part of Dolphin, did not entitle Alden to recover against Dolphin. Alden\u2019s reliance on the principle that a claimant\u2019s carelessness in executing an agreement does not bar recovery is misplaced. Such negligence may not be a defense to a right to recovery if such a right is prima facie established, Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 59; but the possible unavailability of carelessness as a defense does not cure Alden\u2019s failure to establish a prima facie right to rescission or restitution on the basis of the unilateral mistake Alden made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\">. A party may not maintain an action for <em>damages </em>on the basis of mistake unless the mistake was induced by the defendant\u2019s fraudulent or reckless misrepresentation. <em>Wood v. Dudley, </em>188 A.D. 136, 140, 176 N.Y.S. 494, 497 (1st Dep\u2019t 1919).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b388-6\">LEVAL, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALE\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Under the law of New York, where a party has culpably or negligently asserted a fact and by such assertion has intentionally induced a change of position by another in reasonable reliance upon the asserted fact, that party will be estopped from subsequently denying the fact if such denial will cause injury to the party which so relied. <em>Brookhaven </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>118 N.Y. 634, 23 N.E. 1002, 7 L.R.A. 755 (1890) (plaintiff estopped from denying defendants\u2019 title to land); <em>see Plumb v. Cattaraugus Co. Mutual Insurance Co., </em>18 N.Y. 392 (1858) (contract action: facts support inference of negligence by both parties); <em>see also Romano </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>271 N.Y. 288, 2 N.E.2d 661 (1936) (rule applied even to faultless misleading); <em>cf. Moore v. Metropolitan National Bank, </em>55 N.Y. 41, 47 (1873); 21 N.YJur., <em>Estoppel, Ratification and Waiver </em>\u00a7 50-52 (1961). Judge Pratt found (and it is unquestionably true) that Alden was negligent in entering into new financing agreements without obtaining any documentation terminating the prior inconsistent agreements. The chief executive of Alden signed documents without even reading them, which documents permitted Intertel to accomplish the fraud. Alden therefore came within the principle cited above which justifies affirmance of Judge Pratt\u2019s denial of relief to Alden.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We need not consider the denial of relief to Dolphin since Dolphin has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Accordingly, I concur in affirming Judge Pratt\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
