(\u201cNetworks\u201d) seek review of an order of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>86 F.C.C.2d 956 (1981) (hereinafter <em>\u201cSpecial Permission Order\u201d), </em>granting American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company\u2019s (\u201cAT&amp;T\u201d) special permission request to allow tariff revisions to take effect early and declining to reject or to suspend and investigate AT&amp;T\u2019s tariff filing. The Networks contend that the FCC violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) in granting AT&amp;T\u2019s special permission request and violated sections 201(b) and 204(a) of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b), 204(a), in refusing to undertake pre-effectiveness review of the proposed tariffs. We lack jurisdiction to review the FCC\u2019s decision to forego pre-effectiveness review. <em>ABC, Inc. v. FCC, </em>662 F.2d 155 (2d Cir. 1981) (hereinafter <em>\u201cABC I </em>\u201d). Further, we find no violation of the APA in the FCC\u2019s grant of AT&amp;T\u2019s special permission request. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">AT&amp;T, a telecommunications common carrier that offers private line services, Message Telecommunications Services (MTS) and Wide Area Telecommunications Services (WATS), is subject to FCC regulation under the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>The actual setting of carrier rates has often involved a two-step process: first, the FCC approves the carrier\u2019s overall rate of return; and second, the carrier files a tariff revision designed to produce the approved rate of return. <em>See generally ABC I, </em>662 F.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">On April 6, 1981, after almost two years of hearings, the FCC approved an increase in AT&amp;T\u2019s overall rate of return to 12.75 percent. <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>86 F.C.C.2d 221 (1981) (hereinafter <em>\u201cRate of Return Decision\u201d), appeal filed, United States v. FCC, </em>No. 81-1751 (D.C.Cir. filed July 6, 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FCC announced the new rate of return in a news release on April 6, 1981 and issued the text of the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>to the public on May 7. The <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>appeared in the Federal Register on June 11. 46 Fed.Reg. 30,818 (1981). In discussing the rate of return increase the FCC noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">The recent record in this Docket has demonstrated the volatile economic and financial conditions which have occurred during the course of this proceeding .... After considering the substantial increases which have occurred in A. T. &amp; T.\u2019s costs of common stock equity and embedded debt, and the volatility of current economic and financial conditions, we believe that it is imperative that A. T. &amp; T. be permitted to realize the new rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>return <em>as soon as possible. </em>Accordingly, as in our prior decision in Docket No. 20876, 57 F.C.C.2d at 973, we shall permit A. T. &amp; T. to effect tariff revisions which are designed to produce revenues necessary to earn the new rate of return on not less than thirty days notice from the filing of its tariffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><em>Rate of Return Decision, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 250 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On April 10,1981, AT&amp;T filed tariff revisions designed to produce the 12.75 percent rate of return. AT&amp;T Transmittal Nos. 13703-13708. AT&amp;T proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>a sixteen percent increase for its private line services,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> submitted twenty-six volumes of supporting data pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.38 and, in compliance with 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.58, notified customers of the proposed rate changes. AT&amp;T concurrently requested special permission to make the rates effective five days after the effective date of the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>instead of on ninety days notice as provided by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On April 23, the Acting Chief of the FCC\u2019s Common Carrier Bureau granted AT&amp;T\u2019s special permission request for private line and WATS services, allowing the rate increases to take effect on thirty days notice, or five days after release of the text of the <em>Rate of Return Decision, </em>whichever occurred later. The rationale for granting the request was the inadequacy of AT&amp;T\u2019s earnings level and its urgent need for rate relief. J.App. at 113-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In response, the Networks filed an \u201cEmergency Application for Review.\u201d On May 5, the FCC upheld the Bureau Chief\u2019s decision. <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>FCC 81-214 (adopted May 5, 1981). J.App. at 234-40. The FCC noted that members of the public who objected to the tariffs could seek post-effectiveness review under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206-209. <em>Id. </em>at 4; J.App. at 237. The FCC also observed that while \u201c[t]he statutory scheme affords those who object to a tariff as unlawful ample remedies to seek refunds or damages, ... the carrier can never recoup revenues lost because of delays attributable to the agency or protesting parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1; J.App. at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">On May 13, a day before the tariffs were due to take effect, the Bureau Chief, noting the need to clarify some aspects of the AT&amp;T\u2019s filing, deferred the effective date of the tariffs until July 9, pending receipt of the appropriate cost information from AT&amp;T. He indicated, however, that upon receipt of the data and completion of the staff\u2019s analysis, the Bureau would \u201cconsider allowing advancement of the effective date [of the tariff filings].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273. Following its filing of tariff revisions and submission of data, AT&amp;T renewed its request for special permission to advance the effective date of the tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">On June 25, the FCC adopted and released the order under review. <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>86 F.C.C.2d 956 (1981). Reiterating its opinion that \u201c \u2018[i]t is imperative that AT&amp;T be permitted to realize the new rate of return <em>as soon as possible,\u2019 \u201d id. </em>at 961, the FCC decided that the most appropriate procedure was to suspend the tariff revisions for one day, institute an investigation into the \u201cdiscrete problems\u201d it perceived in the filing and impose \u201can accounting order on all rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>increases to facilitate possible refunds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 965. The FCC maintained that this procedure would protect ratepayers if the rate increases were later determined to be excessive and would, at the same time, enable AT&amp;T to realize revenues at the level which the FCC had determined to be necessary and appropriate in the <em>Rate of Return Decision. </em>Finally, the FCC granted AT&amp;T special permission to make the tariff revisions effective by June 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In the <em>Special Permission Order, </em>the FCC addressed a number of claims presented by the Networks. The Commission first rejected a procedural argument raised by the Networks that section 553(d) of the APA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> barred the general rate increase from taking effect until thirty days after publication of the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>in the Federal Register. The FCC found the thirty-day requirement inapplicable holding that publication in the Federal Register was not mandatory. The FCC noted that \u201cwhatever impact the requirements of the APA may have on the effectiveness of Commission orders, they do not govern carrier-initiated tariff filings, which become effective of their own accord absent rejection or suspension by the Commission.\u201d 86 F.C.C.2d at 960-61. Moreover, the FCC pointed out that, in any event, because \u201c[i]t is clear beyond doubt that the Networks have had actual notice of the Rate of Return decision,\u201d section 552(a)(1) of the APA precluded them from \u201crais[ing] the nonpublication of the Rate of Return decision as a bar to the effectiveness of rates filed in response to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961 n.14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">Further, as in <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>86 F.C.C.2d 689 (1981), <em>petition dismissed sub nom. ABC, Inc. v. FCC, </em>662 F.2d 155 (2d Cir. 1981), the FCC declined to undertake pre-effectiveness review of the tariffs on a service-by-service basis, deciding to \u201crely[ ] instead on ongoing proceedings, to ultimately determine the lawfulness of service-by-service rates ... as well as [on] investigations of individual tariff filings ... and finally, [on] the complaint provisions of the Act. <em>See, </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206-209.\u201d 86 F.C.C.2d at 962.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The FCC also summarily rejected a claim raised by the Networks that because AT&amp;T failed to submit cost data in support of the tariff filings on a service-by-service basis the tariff filings were defective and in violation of section 201(b) of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">AT&amp;T refiled its tariff revisions on June 26,1981. The Networks then filed a motion seeking an emergency stay of the <em>Special Permission Order. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>FCC 81-288 (adopted June 29, 1981). J.App. at 484. In denying the motion, the FCC once again addressed and rejected the various arguments raised by the Networks in their earlier pleadings. The Commission did \u201cnot find it patently unlawful for a carrier to file tariffs antici-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>paring a newly prescribed rate of return where the decision to raise the prescribed rate ha[d] been made and publicly announced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. The FCC also dismissed the argument that the APA required Federal Register publication before the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>could become effective, noting that even if the APA did apply, \u201cthe 30 day notice period mentioned in Section 553(d) is not mandatory, but may be abbreviated \u2018for good cause shown and published with the rule.\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The FCC pointed out that the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>had made this \u201cgood cause\u201d finding by recognizing \u201cthe need for expedition of this case and [by] staffing] that the new rate of return should become effective <em>\u2018as soon as possible.\u201d\u2019 Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The Networks then filed an emergency motion for a stay in this Court, which was denied. The tariffs took effect on June 28, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In their petition for review, the Networks present two claims rejected by the FCC in the <em>Special Permission Order: </em>(1) that the FCC was required under sections 201(b) and 204(a) of the Communications Act to undertake pre-effectiveness review of AT&amp;T\u2019s tariff filing; and (2) that sections 552(a)(1)(D) and 553(d) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(1)(D) &amp; 553(d), prevented the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>from taking effect until thirty days after publication in the Federal Register, and therefore the FCC was without discretion to allow early effectiveness of the tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">A. <em>Pre-effectiveness Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-d\">The Networks contend that the FCC violated sections 201(b) and 204(a) of the Communications Act by failing to undertake pre-effectiveness review of AT&amp;T\u2019s tariff filing. We dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 the jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals is limited to review of final decisions of the FCC.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we recently held in <em>ABC I, </em>662 F.2d at 159, \u201cthis court lacks jurisdiction to review an FCC order refusing to reject or to suspend and investigate a tariff filing.\u201d A decision by the FCC to forego pre-effectiveness review is not an adjudication as to the lawfulness of tariff rates, but rather constitutes an exercise of the FCC\u2019s discretionary authority under section 204(a) of the Communications Act to allow tariffs to take effect without suspension and investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThat exercise constitutes a preliminary decision within the Commission\u2019s exclusive discretion. It does not result in a final order reviewable in this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157. <em>See Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v. FCC, </em>642 F.2d 1221, 1234-35 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 920, 101 S.Ct. 1998, 68 L.Ed.2d 311 (1981); <em>Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>628 F.2d 235, 239-40 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1061, 101 S.Ct. 784, 66 L.Ed.2d 604 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">We reject the Networks\u2019 claim that the FCC\u2019s refusal to conduct pre-effectiveness review falls within the so-called <em>\u201cTAPS </em>exception\u201d to the nonreviewability rule. <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>436 U.S. 631, 638-39 n.17, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 2058-59 n.17, 56 L.Ed.2d 591 (1976) (hereinafter <em>\u201cTAPS\u2019); see Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>671 F.2d 587, 595 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>ABC I, </em>662 F.2d at 159. In <em>TAPS, </em>436 U.S. at 638-39 n.17, 98 S.Ct. at 2058-59 n.17, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>nonreviewability of nonfinal agency action. The exception was narrowly confined to claims that \u201cthe Commission has overstepped the bounds of its [statutory] authority.\u201d <em>See Delmarva, </em>671 F.2d at 595; <em>ABC </em>I, 662 F.2d at 159. In <em>ABC I, </em>we held that in refusing to undertake pre-effectiveness review, the \u201cFCC order neither construed nor applied \u00a7 201(b) ... [but] was merely an exercise of the FCC\u2019s discretionary authority to allow the rates to become effective.\u201d 662 F.2d at 159. In this case, the Networks seek to distinguish <em>ABC I </em>by asserting that the agency has interpreted section 204(a) of the Communications Act. This case is indistinguishable from <em>ABC I </em>for purposes of our analysis. Here, as in <em>ABC I, </em>the Networks petitioned the Commission to reject, or to suspend and investigate the tariff revisions because AT&amp;T failed to provide cost data on a service-by-service basis. Further, in both cases the FCC refused to undertake pre-effectiveness review and thereby allowed the tariffs to take effect. As we stated unequivocally in <em>ABC </em>X no issue of statutory interpretation is presented by the FCC\u2019s exercise of its discretionary authority under section 204(a) of the Communications Act to forego pre-effectiveness review. 662 F.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Alternatively, the Networks as well as respondent United States contend that the FCC\u2019s refusal to conduct pre-effectiveness review amounts to implied rulemaking and as such is subject to review. Their position, in short, is that by declining both in this case and in <em>ABC I </em>to undertake such review, the FCC has impliedly promulgated a rule that it will <em>never </em>review tariffs prior to implementation. We disagree. We cannot conclude from these two instances that the FCC has even expressed a policy that it will forego pre-effectiveness review. Certainly, we cannot say that the FCC has promulgated a formal rule to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">B. <em>AT&amp;T's Special Permission Request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The Networks argue that under sections 552(a)(1)(D) and 553 of the APA the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>could not have become effective until thirty days following publication in the Federal Register and, therefore, that AT&amp;T\u2019s tariffs, which were filed prior to that date, were facially invalid. The Networks conclude that the FCC was obligated to reject the tariffs and was without discretion under section 203(b)(2) of the Communications Act to shorten the ninety-day notice period of section 203(b)(1). The Networks assert in the alternative that even if the FCC was not obliged to reject the premature tariffs as facially invalid, it abused its discretion by shortening the notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Again, before addressing the merits, we must determine whether this claim is reviewable. In essence, the Networks contend that the FCC exceeded its statutory authority by accepting tariff filings prior to thirty days following publication of the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>in the Federal Register. This claim, which challenges the FCC\u2019s statutory authority falls within the <em>TAPS </em>exception and is therefore reviewable. <em>See TAPS, </em>436 U.S. at 638-39 n.17, 98 S.Ct. at 2058-59 n.17; <em>Delmarva, </em>671 F.2d at 595; <em>Papago, </em>628 F.2d at 243-44 n.20. However, because we find that the APA did not <em>require </em>publication of the <em>Rate of Return Decision </em>in the Federal Register, the Networks\u2019 claim must necessarily fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The APA distinguishes between rules of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d and rules of \u201cparticular applicability.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4). Under the APA, \u201csubstantive rules of general applicability\u201d are required to be published in the Federal Register. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D). Further, section 553(d) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he required publication ... of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days before its effective date.\u201d The APA, however, makes no provision for publication of rules of particular applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The legislative history of the APA confirms that decisions in agency ratemaking proceedings such as the establishment of a utility\u2019s allowable rate of return are rules of particular applicability and as such are free from the publication requirement. Section 3(a)(3) of the APA, the predecessor of section 552, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(3) (1964),</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>required every agency to publish in the Federal Register \u201csubstantive rules adopted as authorized by law and statements of general policy or interpretations formulated and adopted by the agency for the guidance of the public, but not rules addressed to and served upon named persons in accordance with law.\u201d Thus, as recognized in the <em>Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act </em>at 22 (1947), section 3(a)(3) was not intended to apply to \u201cparticularized rulemaking\u201d such as ratemaking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJO\">This exemption for \u201crules addressed to and served upon named persons in accordance with law\u201d is designed to avoid filling the Federal Register with a great mass of particularized rule making, such as schedules of rates, which have always been satisfactorily handled without general publication in the Federal Register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">The phrase \u201csubstantive rules adopted as authorized by law\u201d refers, of course, to rules issued by an agency to implement statutory policy. Examples are the Federal Power Commission\u2019s rules prescribing uniform systems of accounts and proxy rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">This section of the APA was subsequently amended to its present form as part of the Freedom of Information Act. Pub.L. No.89-487, 80 Stat. 250 (1966). The proviso \u201cbut not rules addressed to and served upon named persons\u201d was deleted from the statute. However, the legislative history indicates that the amendment was intended merely to clarify, rather than change, which rules were required to be published in the Federal Register. United States Department of Justice, <em>Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum on the Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act </em>10 (1967); H.R.Rep.No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1965). The Senate committee that formulated section 552 of the APA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avu\">In section 2 of the Administrative Procedure Act, rules are defined in such a way that there is no distinction between <em>those of particular applicability (such as rates) </em>and those of general applicability. It is believed that only rules, statements of policy, and interpretations of general applicability should be published in the Federal Register; <em>those of particular applicability [are] legion in number and have no place in the Federal Register </em>and are presently excepted but by more cumbersome language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">S.Rep.No.1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1964) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>The Judicial Role in Defining Procedural Requirements for Agency Rulemaking, </em>87 Harv.L. Rev. 782, 788-89 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Thus, ratesetting, including the setting of a rate of return percentage, is a rule of particular applicability. Such a pronouncement, although it impacts upon the public, does not \u201cso directly affect[] pre-existing legal rights or obligations,\u201d <em>Appalachian Power Co. v. Train, </em>566 F.2d 451, 455 (4th Cir. 1977), as to require publication in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Finally, the Networks contend that the FCC abused its discretion in expediting the tariffs\u2019 effective date. This claim, however, is no more reviewable than the challenge to the FCC\u2019s decision to forego pre-effectiveness review. The FCC\u2019s exercise of its discretion under section 203(b)(2) of the Communications Act to shorten section 203(bXl)\u2019s ninety-day notice period constitutes a preliminary decision concerning the timing of tariff rates. It does not constitute a final determination as to the lawfulness of the rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Petition dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">(b) All charges, practices, classifications, and regulations for and in connection with such conununication service, shall be just and reasonable, and any such charge, practice, classification, or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be unlawful ---- The Commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) provides, <em>inter alia:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">(a) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the.

The previous ceiling, approved in 1976, was 9.5 to 10 percent. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>57 F.C.C.2d 960 (1976). During the pendency of the lengthy rate increase proceedings which followed, the FCC authorized an interim increase in the rate of return to 10.5 percent. <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>78 F.C.C.2d 661 (1980). The Networks petitioned this Court seeking review of the FCC\u2019s decision to forego pre-effectiveness review of AT&amp;T\u2019s tariff revisions filed pursuant to the 10.5 percent interim rate.
