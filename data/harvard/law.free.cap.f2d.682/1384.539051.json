In the alternative, the government requested that appellee be required to give bond for the payment of the fine, submit to an examination of his assets, or that appel-lee be made the subject of an order to prevent him from dissipating assets during the appeal. It was pointed out, in brief, that it is often difficult to collect fines during the service of a custodial sentence and that the government\u2019s chances of collecting the fine may be lessened because of the appeal and because of the considerable period of custody expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-23\">After giving this motion and the appellant\u2019s response (a copy being attached as Appendix A) considerable attention, we issued an order requiring the government to advise us, in general, of the efforts it had made and was making to avoid the position of jeopardy in which it contended it found itself. We have now received and reviewed that response. A copy is attached as Appendix B to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-24\">We come to the conclusion that government counsel misapprehends the functions of the two branches \u2014 Executive and Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>cial \u2014 in cases of this sort. In our system of government, the Executive, as prosecutor, seeks the conviction and punishment of the defendant. The Judicial branch stands between the Executive and the defendant to see that the defendant be not convicted or punished save by due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">The Executive now states to the court that, on account of its \u201cpolicy\u201d or for other reasons, it has made no effort to protect itself from the dissipation of appellee\u2019s assets pending appeal or during custody. It has not moved the district court for any protection. It has gathered no evidence touching upon the ability of the appellee to pay or deposit the fine or post a bond. \u201cThe United States has as a policy declined to pursue execution pending appeal of those portions of sentences which impose fines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">The effect of the motion, reduced to its essentials, is that the court, which is not the prosecutor, contravene the policy of the Executive and, by its own order, see to the execution of the portion of this sentence which imposes this fine. We are not advised of the reasons for the policy which causes the Executive to stay its hand. It may be well considered or it may be unwise. At all events, it would be appropriate for the prosecutor to exhaust such remedies as are given to it by the sentence before moving this court to do that which the Executive, for its own reasons, declines to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">If it be the policy of the Executive to seek this sort of relief, it should be sought in the district court where evidentiary hearing may be had to determine the need for the relief sought and the ability of the appellee to respond to such order as may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">This court does not denigrate the importance of the recovery, by the Executive, of fines imposed in criminal cases. However, under the circumstances disclosed by the government\u2019s response in this case, we conclude that the motion filed in this court does not represent a serious undertaking on the part of the Executive to deal with the problem but is merely a gesture for the file. Accordingly, the same is</p>\n<p id=\"a1x-dedup-0\">DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"aoh-dedup-1\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS ELEVENTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">SAM WARD, Appellant, v.

See Title 18, United States Code Section 3565. Unless a defendant voluntarily pays a fine imposed upon him or has assets which can be attached to enforce collection, generally it is not possible to collect the fine while the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>in prison. Collection after release from a lengthy prison term is difficult because defendants often lack attachable assets, are not steadily employed, and may be difficult to locate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">With regard to the instant case, the defendant is 34 years of age. In view of the length of the prison sentence imposed upon the defendant and the age which he may be when released from prison, it is highly unlikely that the fine imposed by the Court ever will be collected, unless immediate steps are taken to insure payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">The Court should not be rendered powerless to enforce its decree should the judgment appealed from be affirmed. <em>Stern v. United States, </em>249 F.2d 720 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">In order to protect the Court\u2019s judgment herein pending appeal and to insure collection if the conviction is affirmed, the defendant should be required to deposit the amount of his fine in the Registry of the Court, or to give bond for the payment therefore, or to submit to an examination of assets in accordance with the provisions of Rule 38(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the United States of America respectfully requests that this motion be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">HINTON R.

To condition his appeal upon deposit of the fine or the posting of the bond will, in effect, be a denial of his right to appeal because of his indigency. That cannot be done. See <em>Griffin v. Iilinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. [585] 12, 100 L.Ed.2d 891 (1956). He is not required to prepay fees and costs or security therefor or to file the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. 1915(a). 18 U.S.C. 3006A[(d)](6). He is entitled to and has appointed counsel on the appeal. See U.S.C. 3006A(c). Rule 38(a)(3) to negate the constitutional and statutory guarantees relative to his appeal would be the height of oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-18\">Respectfully submitted,</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-19\">ORION L.

The United States has as a policy declined to pursue execution pending appeal of those portions of sentences which impose fines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-15\">2. Rule 38(a)(3) allows the relief sought in the district court or the Court of Appeals. No motion was filed in the district court in this case, although it will be the policy of this office to file such motions in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-16\">3. Without further civil discovery, the United States cannot controvert the allegations of insolvency by either Appellant. It is the United States\u2019 belief that Appellant Graziano is able to comply with this Rule 38(a)(3) request based upon testimony given at the April 7, 1981, bond hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-17\">4. The United States is not requesting that this Court condition the appeal upon compliance with any Rule 38(a)(3) order. The manner of enforcement of any such order would be within the Court\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-18\">5. The record on appeal in this case has been filed with this Court and the United States does not have access to a complete record of the proceedings below. Thus, we are unable to state whether a motion to stay execution was filed below. However, as noted above, it is our policy to defer execution of sentence pending appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-19\">6. It is believed that it is in the best interest of the United States to seek this relief in order to avoid dissipation of assets pending further civil discovery and resolution of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-20\">For the above and foregoing reasons the United States respectfully requests that its motion be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-21\">Respectfully submitted,</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-22\">HINTON R.
