Bradshaw, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment by the District Court of the Virgin Islands. Bradshaw was confined initially to the Adult Correctional Facility at Golden Grove, Virgin Islands, but pursuant to a request from the Director of the Bureau of Corrections of the Virgin Islands (\u201cDirector\u201d), he was transferred to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons. Appellant was then committed to the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia; subsequently he was transferred to the federal facility in Leavenworth, Kansas, and later to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania where he is currently confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>in the district court, Bradshaw argued that: (1) the transfers violated due process because he was not afforded notice, or a hearing, or a statement of reasons for the transfers; (2) his life was in constant danger in the federal facilities; (3) the transfer to the mainland prevented his family from visiting him; (4) he should not have been transferred in the absence of a showing that he posed a security risk in the Virgin Islands prisons, and (5) there was no statutory basis for the transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The district court referred appellant\u2019s petition to a magistrate, who, in a report of June 20,1979, refused appellees\u2019 request to dismiss for failure to exhaust administra-five remedies, because it would be futile to require exhaustion when the substantive claims clearly lacked merit. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976), the magistrate concluded that there could be no due process bar to transferring an inmate from the Virgin Islands to the federal prison system in the absence of \u201csome right or justifiable expectation\u201d grounded in the local law making transfer dependent upon a showing of special need. <em>Montanye, </em>427 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2547.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate held that 1A V.I.Code tit. 5, \u00a7 4501 (Supp.1976) granted broad discretion to the Director of the Bureau of Corrections to transfer inmates to federal prison facilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also found that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5003 (1976) empowered the federal officials to assume custody of territorial prisoners.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, he recommended that appellant\u2019s petition be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">Bradshaw filed exceptions to the magistrate\u2019s report on July 6, 1979. While continuing to press his claims concerning personal safety and hardship to his family, appellant elaborated upon his statutory claim. He argued that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5003 (1976) authorized the transfer of only those state and territorial prisoners requiring special treatment not available in local facilities. He also argued that 1A V.I.Code Ann. tit. 5, \u00a7 4501 did not authorize the Director to transfer inmates to the federal prison system without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>The district court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. It held that \u201cBradshaw\u2019s claims relating to his personal safety, hardship on himself, and his family, and his late claim based on the general condition of his health must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Carlson, </em>No. 79-545, order at 2 (M.D.Pa. August 2, 1979). Appellant\u2019s section 5003 claim was also dismissed on exhaustion grounds. In reaching this result, the district court observed that if it were to rely on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States ex rel. Marrero v. Warden, Lewisburg Penitentiary, </em>483 F.2d 656, 659 (3d Cir. 1973), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>417 U.S. 653, 94 S.Ct. 2532, 41 L.Ed.2d 383 (1974), then \u201cthere would be no need for Bradshaw to exhaust administrative remedies because the only issue involved is the proper construction of \u00a7 5003.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>No. 79-545, order at 3. The court refused to follow <em>Marrero, </em>reasoning that the Bureau of Prisons should be given an opportunity to construe the statute in administrative proceedings prior to any judicial action. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">A federal prisoner ordinarily may not seek habeas corpus relief until he has exhausted all available administrative remedies. <em>Arias v. United States Parole Commission, </em>648 F.2d 196 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>United States ex rel. Sanders </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>535 F.2d 848, 850 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Soyka v. Alldredge, </em>481 F.2d 303 (3d Cir. 1973). We have adhered to the exhaustion doctrine for several reasons;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-5\">(1) judicial review may be facilitated by allowing the appropriate agency to develop a factual record and apply its expertise, (2) judicial time may be conserved because the agency might grant the relief sought, and (3) administrative autonomy requires that an agency be given an opportunity to correct its own errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\"><em>Marrero, </em>483 F.2d at 659. <em>See also Sanders, </em>535 F.2d at 853 (Adams, J., dissenting). Bradshaw admits that he has not attempted to exhaust administrative remedies. Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed appellant\u2019s claims with respect to his personal safety, hardship on himself and his family, and his health. These claims are particularly ill-suited for judicial review without th\u00e9 prior development of a factual record by administrative authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">The exhaustion doctrine will not be applied, however, when \u201cnone of the basic goals [of the doctrine] would be served.\u201d <em>Marrero, </em>483 F.2d at 659. <em>See also Sanders, </em>535 F.2d at 851-55 (Adams, J., dissenting). Thus, we held in <em>Marrero </em>that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required when the issue \u201cinvolves only statutory construction,\u201d because there is no need for the administrative agency to develop a factual record or apply its expertise. <em>Marrero, </em>483 F.2d at 659. Such a situation involving only statutory construction is presented in the instant case. In addition, the second and third premises of the exhaustion doctrine set forth in <em>Marrero </em>are inapplicable because of the appellees\u2019 consistent opposition to Bradshaw\u2019s contention that section 5003 prevented his transfer in the absence of a showing of need for special treatment. It is unlikely that appellees will change their position and afford Bradshaw the relief he seeks. <em>See </em>Answer or Response to Rule to Show Cause, <em>Bradshaw v. Carlson, </em>No. 79-545 (M.D.Pa. May 29, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">In holding appellant\u2019s section 5003 claim to be barred by the exhaustion doctrine, the district court concluded that the statutory construction exception created by <em>Marrero </em>had been implicitly overruled by this court\u2019s more recent decision in <em>Sanders. </em>We disagree; <em>Sanders </em>merely restated the general principle that a federal prisoner ordinarily may not seek habeas corpus relief until he has exhausted administrative remedies. That case did not purport to hold that exhaustion is required when the issue \u201cin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>volves only statutory construction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Marrero, </em>483 F.2d at 659. Thus, Marrero continues to be the law of this circuit and the district court should not have dismissed appellant\u2019s section 5003 claim for failure to exhaust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">Although disposing of appellant\u2019s petition on exhaustion grounds, the district court nonetheless addressed the merits of his section 5003 claim. The court concluded that the statute does not require a showing of a need for specialized treatment or the availability of specialized treatment facilities before a state or territorial prisoner may be transferred to the federal prison system. This is consistent with the construction given to section 5003 by Judge Adams\u2019 recent decision in <em>Beshaw v. Fenton, </em>635 F.2d 239, 242-45 (3d Cir. 1980). <em>See also Howe v. Smith, </em>452 U.S. 473, 101 S.Ct. 2468, 69 L.Ed.2d 171 (1981) (affirming Second Circuit\u2019s holding that transfer under section 5003 does not require a showing of a need for treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">Finally, the district court observed that even if section 5003 did not provide Bradshaw with a right or justifiable expectation that he would not be transferred from the Virgin Islands absent a showing of a need for special treatment, local law may provide such a right. <em>Montanye, </em>427 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2547. The court concluded, however, that 1A V.I.Code tit. 5, \u00a7 4501 (Supp. 1976) did not provide such a right, and that the statute in no way limited the discretion of the Director to transfer prisoners to federal facilities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">Although the district court concluded correctly that section 4501 did not prevent the transfer of a Virgin Islands prisoner to the federal prison system, <em>see Ali v. Gibson, </em>631 F.2d 1126, 1132-34 (3d Cir. 1980), that statute was no longer in force at the time of Bradshaw\u2019s transfer. Section 4501 had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>been repealed effective January 1, 1978; the Director had requested appellant\u2019s transfer on February 14, 1978, and he had been accepted for custody by federal authorities on April 20, 1978.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">In October, 1977, the Legislature of the Virgin Islands established a Bureau of Corrections, and transferred the penal authority from the Department of Public Safety to the newly established Bureau. <em>See </em>1A V.I. Code tit. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 4501-09 (Supp.1979). Under the new legislation, effective January 1, 1978, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-5\">authorized to use the facilities of the United States Bureau of Prisons in accordance with agreement between the Virgin Islands and the United States Department of Justice when the Commissioner determines that detention and/or correctional facilities within the Virgin Islands are inadequate to serve the best interests of the inmate or the general welfare of the Territory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">1A V.I.Code tit. 5, \u00a7 4503(g) (repealed 1978). Section 4503(g) was amended on January 26, 1978 by substitution of the words \u201csentencing authority\u201d for \u201cCommissioner.\u201d Act No. 4087, 1978 V.I. Laws 10. Thus, section 4503(g), as it read at the time of Bradshaw\u2019s transfer, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-7\">The Director is authorized to use the facilities of the United States Bureau of Prisons in accordance with agreement between the Virgin Islands and the United States Department of Justice when the <em>sentencing authority </em>determines that detention and/or correctional facilities within the Virgin Islands are inadequate to serve the best interests of the inmate or the general welfare of the Territory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">1A V.I.Code tit. 5, \u00a7 4503(g) (Supp.1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">The potential significance of the January 26, 1978 amendment to section 4503(g) is provided by Chief Judge Christian\u2019s opinion in <em>Ali v. Gibson, </em>483 F.Supp. 1102 (D.V.I.1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>631 F.2d 1126 (3d Cir. 1980). Commenting on the amendment, he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-13\">Thus as matters now stand and as they have stood since January 26, 1978, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections has lost the power to transfer a prisoner from a Virgin Islands institution to a federal facility. He may do so only when the <em>sentencing judge </em>makes the determination of what will best serve the interests of the inmate or the general welfare of the territory. Consequently, any person transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons since January of 1978 solely on the Order of the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, has been unlawfully transferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">483 F.Supp. at 1113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">Although this court reversed Judge Christian, we did not then reach the question of transfers under amended section 4503(g). <em>See Ali, </em>631 F.2d at 1131-32 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">After examining the relevant statutory language, our reading of amended section 4503(g) corresponds with that of Judge Christian in <em>Ali: </em>at the time of Bradshaw\u2019s transfer, the sentencing judge, not the Director, possessed the authority to transfer prisoners from the Virgin Islands to federal facilities. On January 16, 1980, however, the statute was amended once again, substituting the word \u201cDirector\u201d for \u201csentencing authority.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, as a result of somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>circuitous and convoluted legislative action, the power to transfer prisoners has been restored to the Director. In light of this latest amendment of section 4503(g), it would be purposeless to grant appellant\u2019s petition because, notwithstanding any order of this court, the Director now has the power to order Bradshaw\u2019s immediate transfer back to the federal prison system. Of course, it is also within the Director\u2019s power to transfer Bradshaw back to the Virgin Islands if he determines that Bradshaw\u2019s continued confinement in the federal system is not in \u201cthe best interests of the inmate or the general welfare of the territory.\u201d 1A V.I.Code tit. 5, \u00a7 4503(g) (amended January 16, 1980). There is no meaningful relief that this court can grant to appellant; any recourse that he might have lies in the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court, dismissing appellant\u2019s petition without prejudice, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">. In <em>Montanye </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-9\">that no Due Process Clause liberty interest of a duly convicted prison inmate is infringed when he is transferred from one prison to another within the State, whether with or without a hearing, absent some right or justifiable expectation rooted in state law that he will not be transferred except for misbehavior or upon the occurrence of other specified events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">427 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2547. <em>See also Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2538, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">. Although <em>Montanye </em>addressed the due process question in the context of intrastate transfers, the magistrate concluded that the holding of the case could be applied with equal force to transfers from territorial to federal prisons. <em>See Sisbarro v. Warden, </em>Mass. State Penitentiary, 592 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 849, 100 S.Ct. 99, 62 L.Ed.2d 64 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1105-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5003 (1976) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-17\">(a) The Attorney General, when the Director shall certify that proper and adequate treatment facilities and personnel are available, is hereby authorized to contract with the proper officials of a State or Territory for the custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and training of persons convicted of criminal offenses in the courts of such State or Territory: <em>Provided, </em>That any such contract shall provide for reimbursing the United States in full for all costs or other expenses involved.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">. Bradshaw moved for, and was granted, leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 24(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">. <em>Sanders </em>presented two difficult legal questions: (1) whether a sentencing judge has the power to require the Parole Board to run a subsequently imposed parole violator\u2019s term concurrently with the sentence imposed by the judge, and (2) whether the Parole Board\u2019s revocation of parole on a prior crime after paroling a prisoner from an intervening sentence amounts to arbitrary and capricious conduct violative of due process. <em>Sanders, </em>535 F.2d at 850. This was not a case involving only a simple question of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Even if <em>Sanders </em>is indistinguishable from <em>Marrero </em>\u2014 -which we believe it is not \u2014 the <em>Sanders </em>panel lacked the power to overrule a prior panel decision. This court\u2019s Internal Operating Procedures clearly state: \u201cIt is the tradition of this court that reported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels. Thus no subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel. Court in banc consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of this court.\u201d United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Internal Operating Procedure VIII(C). <em>See Hamilton v. Roth, </em>624 F.2d 1204, 1209 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Sikora v. American Can Co., </em>622 F.2d 1116, 1124 (3d Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">. <em>Cf. McKart v.

The resolution of that issue does not require any particular expertise on the part of the [agency]; the proper interpretation is certainly not a matter of discretion . ..
