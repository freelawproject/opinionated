J., which denied Joseph Palmieri\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction pursuant to the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2801 <em>et seq. </em>On February 9, 1982, we stayed Judge Clarie\u2019s order pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Palmieri operates a retail gasoline station in Southington, Connecticut. On November 30, 1981 Palmieri\u2019s latest franchise agreement with Mobil Oil Corporation expired. Mobil offered to renew the franchise under an agreement containing a new formula which would substantially increase Palmieri\u2019s monthly rent. When Palmieri refused to accept the proposed agreement, Mobil notified him that his franchise would not be renewed. Palmieri responded by bringing suit alleging that Mobil\u2019s failure to renew his franchise was arbitrary, discriminatory and in violation of the PMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">We agree with Judge Clarie\u2019s ruling that Palmieri failed to present evidence raising sufficiently serious questions with respect to Mobil\u2019s good faith and lack of discriminatory motive to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805. Section 2805(b)(2) provides in clear language that the franchisee bears the burden of showing that there exist \u201csufficiently serious questions going to the merits\u201d to warrant the equitable relief of a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record fully supports Judge Clarie\u2019s ruling that Palmieri failed to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">We also agree with Judge Clarie that the PMPA does not require a franchisor to use objectively reasonable and economically realistic criteria in determining the amount of rent to be charged for a retail gasoline franchise; it merely prohibits a franchisor from applying a rental formula in a discriminatory manner in order to drive a franchisee out of the franchise relationship. Chief Judge Clarie thoroughly and correctly addressed this issue, and we affirm on the basis of his opinion, reported at 529 F.Supp. 506 (D.Conn.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Palmieri\u2019s remaining claims do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">Affirmed. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\">. Palmieri argues that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(c), which sets forth the burdens relating to a final determination on the merits of a franchisee\u2019s PMPA action, places the burden on Mobil to prove that it acted in good faith in notifying Palmieri that his franchise would be terminated. However, because the issues in this case relate to the propriety of granting a preliminary injunction, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(b)(2) provides the appropriate burdens. Therefore, Palmieri\u2019s argument is inapposite. We express no opinion on the validity of Palmieri\u2019s interpretation of section 2805(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
