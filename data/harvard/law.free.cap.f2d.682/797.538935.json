We vacate the summary judgment and remand with instructions to transfer the action to the District of Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-25\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b851-26\">The Alaska Marine Highway System, which is owned and operated by the State of Alaska, operates ferries between Seattle, Washington and Alaska, as well as between Alaskan ports. Many of the System\u2019s employees live in Washington, the System has a terminal in Seattle, and much of the System\u2019s maintenance is performed in Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-27\">In 1977 Alaska enacted a statute providing, in part, that \u201c[n]o employee of the Alaska Marine Highway System may be relieved at a duty station or port which is outside the state.\u201d Alaska Stat. \u00a7 19.65.-010. The National Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, a union representing System employees, sued the state and state officials (\u201cdefendants\u201d) in the Western District of Washington, contending that the statute was unconstitutional and seeking a permanent injunction against its enforcement. A similar suit was brought by 29 deck officers and pilots licensed by the Coast Guard. The two suits were consolidated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that the statute violated both the commerce and the privileges and immunities clauses. On appeal, defendants raise five issues. They argue that the district court erred: (1) in denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for improper venue; (2) in denying defendants\u2019 motion to transfer the suit to the District of Alaska; (3) in permitting plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add the individual defendants; (4) in declining to abstain; and (5) in finding the statute unconstitutional. Because we vacate the summary judgment on the first of these grounds, we do not address the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The venue statute applicable in this case provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201cA civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). The magistrate found that the claim in this case arose in the Western District of Washington under either a \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d standard, <em>see Commercial Lighting Products, Inc. v. United States District Court, </em>537 F.2d 1078 (9th Cir. 1976), or a more lenient standard applicable to cases involving challenges to statutes. The magistrate did not reach plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the defendants \u201creside\u201d in Washington. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The place where \u201cthe claim arose\u201d for purposes of venue is governed by federal law. <em>Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., </em>443 U.S. 173, 183 n. 15, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 2716 n. 15, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979); <em>Sutain v. Shapiro &amp; Lieberman, </em>678 F.2d 115, 117 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">In <em>Leroy, </em>a would-be tender offeror with headquarters in Texas sued, in the district court in Texas, Idaho state officials responsible for enforcing the Idaho Corporate Takeover Act, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court acknowledged that, under the broadest plausible reading of section 1391(b), a claim may arise in two or more districts only in the unusual case in which the districts may, with approximately equal plausibility in terms of the availability of witnesses, the accessibility of other relevant evidence, and the convenience of the defendant (but not of the plaintiff), be called the locus of the claim. In such a case, the plaintiff may select the forum from among those districts. The Court held, however, that <em>Leroy </em>was not the unusual case and that the claim in that case arose in Idaho, not Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">First, the Court noted that all of the defendants\u2019 acts were, and their enforcement of the statute would be, in Idaho. For that reason, most of the relevant evidence and witnesses, besides employees of the plaintiff and securities experts, were in Idaho. Second, in deciding the constitutionality of an Idaho statute, federal judges in Idaho are better qualified to construe the statute and to assess the character of Idaho\u2019s enforcement than judges elsewhere. The Court rejected the argument that venue lay in Texas because that was where the tender offeror suffered harm, noting those contacts with Texas fell \u201cfar short\u201d of the contacts with Idaho and that such reasoning would subject the Idaho officials to suit in many different districts. 443 U.S. at 186, 99 S.Ct. at 2718.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The analysis in <em>Leroy </em>indicates that venue in this case lies only in Alaska. First, because the enactment of the \u201cChange Port\u201d statute was, and any enforcement will be, in Alaska, most of the evidence and witnesses are there. Second, it would be preferable for a federal judge in Alaska to decide these claims rather than for one in Washington to do so. Although the statute in this case does not seem on its face susceptible of narrowing interpretations, we cannot say that the Alaska courts, or a district judge in Alaska, could not read the statute narrowly so as to save it from possible constitutional infirmity. Thus, even though Alaska appears to have been able to defend the statute\u2019s constitutionali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ty in Seattle, the State of Washington cannot be called the locus of these claims as plausibly as Alaska.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Since <em>Leroy, </em>several courts have held, in cases involving challenges to the constitutionality or application of state statutes, that venue was proper where the effects of the statutes were felt as well as where they were enacted and administered. <em>See Florida Nursing Home Ass\u2019n v. Page, </em>616 F.2d 1355 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 872, 101 S.Ct. 211, 66 L.Ed.2d 92 (1980), <em>reversed on other grounds sub nom. Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitation Services v. Florida Nursing Home Ass\u2019n, </em>450 U.S. 147, 101 S.Ct. 1032, 67 L.Ed.2d 132 (1981); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Pingree, </em>494 F.Supp. 68 (S.D.Fla.1980); <em>Cheeseman </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>485 F.Supp. 203 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>remanded with instructions to dismiss on other grounds, </em>623 F.2d 1387 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>Glendale Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Fox, </em>481 F.Supp. 616 (C.D.Cal.1979); <em>see also Sheffield v. State of Texas, </em>411 F.Supp. 709 (N.D.Tex.1976). Each of these cases, however, involved districts in only one state. Thus, the concern in <em>Leroy </em>that federal judges in a state are better suited to rule on that state\u2019s statutes than are judges elsewhere was inapplicable. Moreover, some of the cases failed to discuss <em>Leroy. See Florida Nursing Home, </em>616 F.2d at 1360-61; <em>Glendale Federal Savings and Loan, </em>481 F.Supp. at 623-24. To the extent that these cases are inconsistent with <em>Leroy, </em>we decline to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">This court has stated that a claim arises \u201cin any district in which a substantial part of the act, events, or omissions occurred that gave rise to the claim for relief.\u201d <em>Su-tain, </em>at 117 (quoting <em>Commercial Lighting Products, </em>537 F.2d at 1080). This \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d test suggests that a claim may sometimes arise in more than one district. <em>Leroy </em>did not indicate what constitutes the unusual case in which a claim may do so. <em>See </em>15 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction, \u00a7 3806 at 7 (1981 Supp.); <em>Pfeiffer v. International Academy of Biomagnetic Medicine, </em>521 F.Supp. 1331, 1343 (W.D.Mo.1981); <em>Cheeseman, </em>485 F.Supp. at 212-13. Thus, it is unclear what effect <em>Leroy </em>had on the \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d test. However, we need not decide that question in this case. We merely hold that, under the analysis of <em>Leroy, </em>venue in this case, involving a constitutional challenge to an Alaska statute, lies only in Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Because the district court erred in concluding that this case arose in Washington, the judgment is vacated and the action remanded with instructions to transfer the action to the District of Alaska.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-19\">. Alaska has voluntarily suspended enforcement of the statute pending the resolution of its constitutionality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-7\">. We note that the Supreme Court\u2019s concern that state officials not face suits in many different districts does not seem applicable in this case. The only non-Alaskan plaintiffs here appear to be Washington residents. However, the inapplicability of that factor does not make venue proper in Washington. The other factors discussed in the text still make Alaska a more plausible locus of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\">. A case in which venue is improper may be transferred, rather than dismissed, if transfer is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). Although this court can transfer a case itself, <em>see Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation, Inc. v. Calif ano, </em>571 F.2d 328 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 893, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978), in this case we merely remand with instructions to transfer. We conclude that transfer is warranted to expedite the consideration in the District of Alaska of the constitutional challenges to Alaska\u2019s statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
