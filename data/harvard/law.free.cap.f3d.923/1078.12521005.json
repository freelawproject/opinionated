Over the years, we have filled hundreds of pages in the Federal Reporter explaining the first and third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework. This case compels us to bring into focus an issue on which we rarely pause: what we require at the second step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until 2009, Richard Figueroa worked as a foreign service officer in the United States Department of State (Department). He presses two claims in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   lawsuit against the Secretary of State (Secretary). First, he contends that one aspect of the Department's promotion process has had a disparate impact on Hispanic and Latino candidates who applied for the position he sought. Second, he alleges that the Secretary in 2008 denied him a promotion because of his Hispanic ethnicity. After discovery, both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court sided with the Secretary, and Figueroa seeks our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We now affirm the judgment in part because the disparate impact claim lacks merit. But as to the second claim, the District Court misapplied the second step of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework. We reverse the grant of the Secretary's motion in part, vacate the denial of Figueroa's cross-motion in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.

(We also see no issue with the District Court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   invocation of race discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Figueroa v.

Supp. 3d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219-20 (D.D.C. 2018).) Figueroa joined the Department's Foreign Service in 1986. The Foreign Service employs officers who \"advocate American foreign policy, protect American citizens, and promote American interests throughout the world.\"\n   <em>\n    Shea v. Kerry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767866,6771645\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/42/\">\n    796 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3273124,3454508\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/898/\">\n    451 F.3d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900 (D.C. Cir. 2006) ). Figueroa started at a mid-level pay grade-FS-05-and served in the political division of the Foreign Service, also known as the political \"cone.\" The highest FS pay grade is FS-01, and the Secretary promoted him up the ranks to the FS-02 level in 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officers become eligible for promotion after they work a minimum number of years at their current FS pay grade. Every year, an office in the Department determines the number of promotion slots. The Secretary divvies them up between two six-member selection boards. The boards select candidates in turn. The first board reviews all employees across a salary level-all FS-02 officers, for instance. The second board then reviews the candidates whom the Secretary did not promote from the first board's recommendations. The second board considers employees in a particular cone-all political-cone officers, as an example.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The boards employ a similar evaluative approach, with differences not relevant to\n   this appeal. The Department instructs board members to base their decisions on the candidate files they receive. The members of a board independently will determine whether each candidate should be placed on a list of finalists. A candidate generally needs one member's recommendation to become a finalist. Once they have determined the list, the members individually review each finalist's file again, this time giving it an overall score of one to ten. The scores are totaled and help the group decide how to rank the finalists. The Secretary promotes the highest ranked according to the number of open slots afforded to the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The candidates who fail to become finalists are classified as low- or mid-ranked. The boards do not issue scores to those candidates. The low-ranked are deemed to have performed the worst in the applicant pool, and the ranking indicates that the candidate is deficient in some relevant skill. The rest are mid-ranked. Each year, the boards engage in a fresh look at each candidate, regardless of her ranking in prior years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The board members evaluate the files based on substantive criteria called \"core precepts.\" They consist of six performance areas: leadership skills, managerial skills, interpersonal skills, communication and foreign language skills, intellectual skills, and substantive knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Department and labor union representing foreign service officers like Figueroa created an eight-page chart describing the precepts in place from 2005 to 2008. Some precepts are purely subjective. According to the chart, an evaluator assessing leadership skills must assess the officer's innovation, decisionmaking, teamwork, openness to dissent, community service, and institution building. Others appear more objective. As an example, the evaluator considering substantive knowledge will observe the officer's application of job knowledge, institutional knowledge, technical skills, professional expertise, and knowledge of foreign cultures. But the chart reveals that even the more objective precepts involve purely subjective determinations. For each precept, the chart identifies skills that evaluators expect an officer to have at certain stages in her tenure. Under substantive knowledge, the evaluator expects a senior-level officer, among other things, to create supportive work environments. In total, the evaluator looks for 89 specific skills in a junior officer, 94 in a more experienced officer, and 86 in a senior-level officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Figueroa first became eligible for promotion to the FS-01 pay grade in 2000, and he applied every year until his retirement in 2009. The boards classified him as low-ranked in 2000 and 2001 and as mid-ranked in 2002 and 2003. He made it to the lower end of the ranked finalist lists in 2004 and 2005, but he again was deemed mid-ranked from 2006 to 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 20, 2008, after the 2008 promotion cycle, Figueroa sent an email to the Department's Office of Civil Rights, seeking an investigation into alleged discrimination against him because of his Hispanic ethnicity. He filed a formal complaint on November 26, 2008. After years of investigation, the Department issued a Final Agency Decision on August 15, 2013. The Department concluded that Figueroa failed to make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of disparate impact. As for disparate treatment, the Department found that he made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing, but that he failed to prove that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason for his denial of promotion-application of the core precepts-was pretextual. Figueroa appealed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which affirmed on March 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Within ninety days of receiving notice that the EEOC has acted on an appeal, an\n   \"aggrieved\" employee \"may file a civil action\" in federal court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). On April 6, 2016, Figueroa filed his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   action against the Secretary, asserting disparate impact and disparate treatment. After discovery had concluded, the parties filed motions for summary judgment as to both claims. The District Court granted the Secretary's motion in full, denied Figueroa's in full, and entered judgment on January 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Figueroa now seeks our review. On September 11, 2018, we denied the Secretary's motion for summary affirmance and appointed James Rosenthal as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   supporting Figueroa. Amelia Frenkel, who appeared as Rosenthal's co-counsel, presented Figueroa's case at oral argument.

The evidence must suffice to raise a triable issue of fact as to intentional discrimination and to provide the employee with a full and fair opportunity for rebuttal. When the reason involves subjective criteria, the evidence must provide fair notice as to how the employer applied the standards to the employee's own circumstances.

None of the presented evidence sheds light on how the selection boards applied the core precepts to Figueroa's case. All we know is that the board determined Figueroa to be mid-ranked-which at most says he was not deficient in any relevant skill. But that fact does not explain why the boards deemed him less qualified than the highest-ranked candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We see a close analogy between this case and a context familiar to us and employment discrimination lawyers: grading in a law school exam. The grading criteria are clear and unsurprising: writing style, quality of the case citations, and sophistication of the legal and factual analysis. But an eager law student who receives a B under the rubric needs more to understand, and perhaps challenge, her grade. Law students ordinarily are evaluated on a curve. The professor may believe a B student to be proficient, even excellent, on all three fronts yet, for some reason, not to be among the top of the pack. Perhaps the reason is benign; the curve was just too tight. But perhaps the professor had indigestion while reading her exam answers. The student is left only to speculate on whether her subjectively determined grade was reasonable or unfair. Unless provided with additional information (such as a model answer) that shows what differentiates her from the best, the student is unable to understand her professor's reasoning and muster a persuasive case for raising her mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Likewise here, unless the Secretary provides Figueroa with some evidence explaining how Figueroa compared to the top-ranked finalists, Figueroa is deprived of a full and fair opportunity to make his case. The problem is worse for Figueroa than for the law student in our analogy, because he must address dozens of criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Secretary also proffered declarations made by seven of the twelve board members during the EEOC proceedings. Figueroa does not challenge their admissibility. Four stated that they considered the core precepts. But none of the declarants explained what differentiated the best candidates from the rest, nor did they recall anything about why Figueroa's application was middling under the criteria. Figueroa, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , has largely no idea how he did relative to the promoted applicants. Lacking sufficient details, the declarations fail to provide a clear and reasonably specific explanation under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   And it is of no moment that Figueroa had access to records in the candidate file reviewed by the selection boards. \"The introduction of 'personnel records which\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have indicated that the employer based its decisions on one or more of the possible valid grounds' will not suffice to meet the\" employer's burden of production,\n   <em>\n    Steger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9342144\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/1066/#p1076\">\n    318 F.3d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    IMPACT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651375\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/1189/#p1194\">\n    893 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194 ), because the evidence encourages the employee and factfinder to guess at reasons-which muddles, not sharpens, the issues and thus contravenes the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IMPACT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651375\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/1189/#p1194\">\n    893 F.2d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The evaluators essentially are grading candidates on absolute terms and against one another along a curve, and they therefore should be able to explain why one candidate's grade is lower than others. Just as a law professor can give a student a model answer and an annotated exam to differentiate the student's exam from the best, so too can the Secretary's graders explain to Figueroa how he fared against the highest-rated candidates.

We acknowledge that Figueroa's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   discovery strategy is less than ideal. Even so, we find the Secretary's point unpersuasive. Discovery blunders may prevent a plaintiff from succeeding at the first or third prong. But we see little connection between the second step and discovery. The prong demands nothing of the employee, and the employer will always have the relevant records in its possession. Moreover, even if an employee executes the perfect discovery strategy, a vague and slippery explanation may still confuse the issues and prevent the employee from presenting a clean case at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Flasher Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"662107\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/1312/#p1318\">\n    986 F.2d 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318 (10th Cir. 1992) (noting that when employers fail to give a proper explanation \"at the outset,\" litigations become \"needlessly confused and delayed\"). The rules we articulate today help to prevent such mischief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the Secretary has failed to meet his burden of production under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, we revive the disparate treatment claim. The Secretary's summary judgment arguments below all relied on a successful showing of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Indeed, the government conceded the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for the purpose of the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment at 19 n.3,\n   <em>\n    Figueroa v. Pompeo\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-649 (CRC) (D.D.C. filed May 25, 2017), ECF No. 20. The Secretary having failed to meet his burden, the District Court was required to deny the motion as to the disparate treatment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in part. We express no opinion as to whether the District Court correctly analyzed Figueroa's claim at the third prong. We do not decide, among other issues, whether the District Court properly weighed an EEO report proffered as evidence supporting not only the Secretary's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization of the non-promotion but also his spoliation of material records. To defeat the disparate treatment claim, the Secretary must wait until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But the District Court may not proceed immediately to\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , because it must revisit Figueroa's summary judgment cross-motion. Under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, an employee who proves her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case is entitled to a presumption that the employer discriminatorily mistreated her. The presumption dissipates only if the employer meets its burden of production. Here, the District Court did not determine whether Figueroa made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Consequently, we vacate in part the District Court's denial of Figueroa's cross-motion, and we remand for further proceedings. The District Court should decide the merits of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case in the first instance, considering the arguments in Figueroa's cross-motion and assessing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary. Although the government failed to contest the first prong below, the \"burden is always on [Figueroa] to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted,\" and the District Court \"must always determine for itself whether the record and any undisputed material facts justify granting summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston &amp; Strawn, LLP v.
