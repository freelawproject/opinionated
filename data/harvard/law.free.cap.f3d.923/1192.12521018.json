Following\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   , Defendant-Appellant Mario Fultz filed a second or successive motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fultz argues that his sentence was improperly enhanced under \u00a7 924(c)(1). First, he argues that, because the underlying offense, robbery, was not a \"crime of violence\" under the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), his sentence was enhanced pursuant to the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Second, he argues that his sentence enhancement under the residual clause is unconstitutional after\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   . The district court denied Fultz's \u00a7 2255 motion but issued a certificate of appealability, allowing Fultz to appeal its denial order.

In August 1992 and January 1993, Defendant-Appellant Mario Fultz robbed an exchange on Camp Pendleton Military Base, near San Diego, California. Mr. Fultz was charged with two counts of Robbery on a Government Reservation, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and two counts of Using and Carrying a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). In total, Fultz stole approximately $ 123,500. In 1994, after a jury trial, he was convicted on all four counts. During the robberies, Fultz carried, but did not fire, a pistol. He was sentenced to consecutive mandatory minimum of 60 months' custody for the first firearm violation, and a consecutive mandatory minimum of twenty years' custody for the second firearm violation. Although Fultz had no prior criminal history, he was\n   sentenced to more than thirty years for the two robbery offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fultz appealed both his conviction and his sentence, but this court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Ninth Circuit concluded that, as to the robbery of the tobacco, the government lacked evidence that either defendant had the specific intent to aid and abet the robbery because they did not have advance knowledge that the robbery was going to take place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055038\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/763/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055038\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/763/\">\n    at 768-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The federal government failed to show that the defendants \"had drawn up plans or had discussions prior to the taking.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055038\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/763/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055038\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/763/\">\n    at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction on the second count for attempted robbery of the wallet because attempted robbery also required specific intent, which the government was unable to prove.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 770.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But the crux of\n   <em>\n    Goldtooth\n   </em>\n   , according to Fultz, is what the Ninth Circuit does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say. Although the panel reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of acquittal on both counts, it did so on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the specific intent elements of the crimes-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   because \u00a7 2111 Robbery could not be accomplished by a mere \"snatch\" or with such\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   use of force. Fultz urges this panel to follow\n   <em>\n    Goldtooth\n   </em>\n   's assumption that such minimal force can accomplish a \u00a7 2111 Robbery. If this were the rule, then there would be evidence that \u00a7 2111 Robbery and \u00a7 2119 Carjacking are interpreted differently by courts. This would also support the conclusion that \u00a7 2111 Robbery would not be a \"crime of violence\" under the elements clause because\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases indicate that a \"snatch\" is insufficient to qualify as \"violent physical force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This reading of\n   <em>\n    Goldtooth\n   </em>\n   is precluded by\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   . Fultz is correct that the\n   <em>\n    Goldtooth\n   </em>\n   court did not say it was vacating the convictions because the \"snatching\" was insufficient to sustain \u00a7 2111 Robbery. But we cannot infer a conclusion one way or the other from the silence in\n   <em>\n    Goldtooth\n   </em>\n   when\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   are on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At oral argument, Fultz made a further argument in an attempt to distinguish the language of \u00a7 2119 Carjacking and \u00a7 2111 Robbery. Fultz noted that \u00a7 2119 Carjacking has an intent element-\"whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\"-that \u00a7 2111 Robbery does not. This observation is correct, but does not persuade us that the force clauses in these statutes have different meanings. Section 2113 Bank Robbery, discussed in\n   <em>\n    Selfa\n   </em>\n   , lacks a specified intent \"to cause death or serious bodily harm,\" and thus resembles Section 2111 Robbery. Although\n   <em>\n    Selfa\n   </em>\n   was decided before\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   court relied on both\n   <em>\n    Selfa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   when it held that \u00a7 2119 Carjacking is a crime of violence. Relying on the manner of execution and not any specified intent, it explained that \"[b]ank robbery by intimidation thus requires at least an implicit threat to use the type of violent physical force necessary to meet the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   standard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267070\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1254/#p1257\">\n    876 F.3d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   illustrates that we consider\n   <em>\n    Selfa\n   </em>\n   to be consistent with\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   and have continued to interpret the force clause in the same way. And in\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , decided after\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   , we also dismissed an argument that bank robbery by intimidation lacks the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   to meet the threshold set forth in\n   <em>\n    Leocal v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p9\">\n    543 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p9\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p9\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/\">\n    881 F.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   held that, because \u00a7 2113 Bank Robbery by intimidation cannot be done by mere negligence, it does meet the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   threshold.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the language difference in these statutes does not affect our understanding of the force clause of \u00a7 2111 Robbery, which we find meets the\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   standard to be an elements clause \"crime of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With this precedent, we decline to change course today. There is not a compelling reason at this time to read \"by force and violence or by intimidation\" differently in \u00a7 2111 Robbery and in \u00a7 2119 Carjacking. Because \u00a7 2119 Carjacking and \u00a7 2113 Bank Robbery, by means of \"intimidation,\" qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the elements clause after\n   <em>\n    Johnson I\n   </em>\n   , so too does \u00a7 2111 Robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is a \"crime of violence\" under the elements clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).

Stokeling was convicted of robbery in Florida and argued that the Florida robbery statute did not qualify as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) -the elements clause at issue in\n    <em>\n     Johnson I\n    </em>\n    . The relevant Florida robbery statute criminalizes \"the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\" Slip op. at 2.

Although\n    <em>\n     Stokeling\n    </em>\n    involves Florida robbery and not \u00a7 2111 Robbery, the language defining the offense is similar. The Supreme Court's conclusion first reaffirms that the categorical approach is the correct one, slip op. at 3, and reaffirms that the level of force defined by Florida robbery qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the ACCA elements clause at \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
