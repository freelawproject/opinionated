In 2016, Charles Taylor Muhs (\"Appellant\") filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and attempted to discharge a judgment in excess of $ 20 million entered by an Alaska district court against him and in favor of TKC Aerospace, Inc. (\"TKCA\"). TKCA, however, claims that the judgment is nondischargeable because the damages award was based on Appellant's willful and malicious misappropriation of TKCA's trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The bankruptcy court, applying collateral estoppel principles, concluded that Alaska's award of damages to TKCA necessarily meant that Appellant willfully and maliciously injured TKCA for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(6), granted summary judgment in favor of TKCA, and determined that the entire judgment award was nondischargeable. The district court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse. The Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 523(a)(6) requires \"a deliberate or intentional\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   , not merely a deliberate or intentional\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   that leads to injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Kawaauhau v.

Likewise, this court has held that a creditor challenging dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6) must prove that the debtor had an \"inten[t] to injure.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Duncan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046684\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/725/#p730\">\n    448 F.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (4th Cir. 2006). Because neither the Alaska district court, nor the bankruptcy court, determined the precise issue of whether Appellant intended to injure TKCA, collateral estoppel and summary judgment were inappropriate. Therefore, we remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2007, Appellant became Vice President of Business Development for TKCA, an Alaska corporation specializing in aircraft procurement, logistics, and support. In that capacity, Appellant had access to TKCA's proprietary information, and his contract with TKCA prohibited him from disclosing confidential information to any third party or competing with TKCA for six months after his employment terminated. From 2009 to 2011, TKCA competed for and won Department of State (\"DOS\") contracts for Bombardier Dash 8 aircrafts, modified to meet DOS needs. As part of this process, TKCA would -- with the help of Appellant -- submit proposals to DOS describing how it would perform such modifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 28, 2011, Appellant left his position with TKCA to accept a position with Knowledge International in Alexandria, Virginia, although he continued to work for TKCA on a part-time basis. Appellant also began to work closely with Phoenix Heliparts, Inc. (\"PHP\"), an Arizona corporation and (at the time) a competitor of TKCA, to secure aircraft and develop bids for possible DOS solicitation. On August 5, 2011, DOS issued a solicitation for up to two more Dash 8 aircrafts, and PHP submitted a proposal. DOS awarded the contract to PHP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Alaska and Arizona Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Parallel Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 26, 2011, TKCA filed a lawsuit in the District of Alaska against Appellant, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, tortious interference with prospective business, fraud, and violation of the Alaska Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the \"Alaska Action\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    TKC Aerospace, Inc. v. Muhs\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:11-cv-189 (D. Alaska filed Sept. 26, 2011), ECF No. 1, at 12-17. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Appellant \"stole a corporate business opportunity from TKCA and delivered it to a competitor, using TKCA proprietary information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 20, 2011, TKCA filed a parallel suit against PHP in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets under the Arizona Uniform Trade Secrets Act, intentional interference with business expectancy, unfair competition, and conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TKC Aerospace, Inc. v. Phoenix Heliparts, Inc\n   </em>\n   ., No. CV2011-128889 (Ariz. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 20, 2011) (the \"Arizona Action\"). Although he was a witness in the Arizona Action, Appellant was not named as a party. The Alaska Action and the Arizona Action carried on simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 21, 2012, Appellant filed a motion to stay the Alaska Action. In support of the motion, Appellant's counsel -- the same counsel representing PHP in the Arizona Action -- stated that the Arizona Action \"involv[ed] the same plaintiff ... and same factual and legal issues as those in the Alaska Action,\" and \"[t]he underlying factual allegations in [both complaints] are virtually verbatim, the gravamen of the claims are identical, and the relief requested is virtually identical.\" J.A. 193.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The request for stay also stated, \"this pending action is ... substantially similar to and significantly parallels the Arizona Action,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 199, and \"[i]f TKCA prevails in the Arizona Action, ... then [Appellant] would be collaterally estopped from arguing differently in this Court,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 214 n.3 (alterations omitted). The Alaska court denied the motion to stay. After granting summary judgment on some claims, however, on March 8, 2013, the Alaska court deferred further scheduling until the Arizona Action was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    The Arizona Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Meanwhile, from March 2012 to October 2013, the Arizona state court conducted a bench trial for over 40 days on the issue of PHP's liability regarding TKCA's trade secrets and PHP's misconduct. Ultimately, on January 30, 2015, the Arizona state court entered judgment in favor of TKCA and against PHP on the Arizona Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim, the tortious interference claim, and the common law unfair competition claim, in the total amount of $ 20,295,782.58. This amount was broken down as follows: $ 2,883,055.86 in lost profits; $ 3,882,205 in research and development costs; and $ 13,530,521.72 in exemplary damages. As to the latter, the Arizona state court stated, \"PHP [must] pay exemplary damages pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 44-403(B)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   in an amount double awarded\n   to TKCA for its lost profit and research and development costs.\" J.A. 105. The Arizona court found that PHP engaged in \"willful and malicious misconduct,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 59, and \"PHP willfully and maliciously misappropriated TKCA's trade secrets,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 66. It also found that \"PHP formed an agency relationship with [Appellant],\" and \"[b]ecause of th[is relationship], this court will attribute [Appellant's] acts to PHP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 74, 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But even though the Arizona state court attributed Appellant's actions to PHP, the Arizona Action was not based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the actions of Appellant. Indeed, the Arizona court also found the following regarding Tina Cannon, president of PHP at the relevant time, and her husband Darrin Cannon, who was vice-president:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"[T]he Cannons wiped their computers after receiving a litigation hold letter and after trial started. The court has rarely, if ever in a civil matter, witnessed a party engage in such flagrant misconduct and act with such disregard for the truth and such profound disrespect for the law.\" J.A. 60;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"This court finds that Darrin Cannon installed and ran CCleaner with the intent to delete any evidence that PHP had misappropriated TKCA's trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information and also to conceal PHP's efforts to delete relevant and material evidence of its misconduct.\" J.A. 60-61;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 \"During trial, Tina Cannon and [Appellant] provided improbable explanations when confronted with overwhelming evidence of PHP's efforts to secure the award of the D[O]S contract.\" J.A. 65; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Tina Cannon \"induced [Appellant] to violate his non-compete agreement with TKCA and disclose TKCA trade secrets in further breach of his employment contract.\" J.A. 80.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, when assessing whether exemplary damages were appropriate pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 44-403(B) for willful and malicious misappropriation, the Arizona court stated the following, inter alia:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Attempts to conceal wrongful conduct with respect to trade secrets provide evidence of willful and malicious misappropriation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]he following are just a few examples that establish PHP willfully and maliciously engaged in misconduct. Despite knowing [Appellant's] contract with TKCA had a non-compete clause, the Cannons induced [Appellant] to misappropriate TKCA's trade secrets in order to compete directly with TKCA. [Appellant], on behalf of PHP, withheld vital information from TKCA so that PHP could establish a material and temporal advantage in preparing a successful proposal in response to the D[O]S solicitation. Tina Cannon knew that [Appellant] had uploaded TKCA proprietary documents to PHP's servers and PHP knowingly used the uploaded documents to prepare its bid. PHP further knew that using the uploaded documents would harm TKCA....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   PHP intentionally wip[ed] company servers after learning of a subpoena, erasing company laptops in the evening and early morning hours before court-ordered forensic imaging started....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   J.A. 87. After awarding exemplary damages, the Arizona court noted that TKCA also satisfied its burden of proof on punitive damages, explaining, \"This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n   <em>\n    PHP\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   engaged in outrageous conduct and\n   <em>\n    acted with an evil mind intending to injure\n   </em>\n   TKCA by intentionally interfering with TKCA's contracts and opportunities and then using TKCA's proprietary information to misappropriate those opportunities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 88-89 (emphases supplied). The court made no specific finding, however, that Appellant (who, again, was not a party to the Arizona Action) intended to injure TKCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    The Alaska Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the Arizona judgment, on June 12, 2015, TKCA filed a motion for summary judgment in the Alaska Action. Without holding a hearing, the Alaska court granted the motion on October 22, 2015. It reasoned that, even though Appellant was not a party to the Arizona Action, the Arizona court's conclusion and award of damages were based on \"findings that [Appellant] worked with PHP to compete for the D[O]S contract, that [Appellant] provided TKCA documents to PHP, and that [Appellant] worked on PHP's D[O]S Dash 8 proposal.\" J.A. 30-31. Then the Alaska court applied principles of equitable estoppel and quasi-estoppel to reach the conclusion that \"[Appellant] agreed to be bound by the decision in the Arizona Action and thus he was in privity with PHP. Because [Appellant] was in privity with PHP, [he] is collaterally estopped from relitigating TKCA's claims against him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, the Alaska court held that TKCA was entitled to judgment against Appellant for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with prospective economic benefit, and violation of the Alaska Trade Secrets Act. Per the Alaska court, TKCA was entitled to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   a. Lost Profits: $ 2,883,055.86\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   b. Research and Development: $ 3,882,205.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   c. Exemplary Damages: $ 13,530,521.72.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   J.A. 42. Thus, Appellant was liable for $ 20,295,782.58, the same amount imposed on PHP in the Arizona Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As noted above under \"c.,\" the Alaska court awarded exemplary damages in the amount of $ 13,530,521.72 to TKCA. In awarding these damages, the Alaska court dropped a footnote that stated, \"Per AS 45.50.915(b),\" with no further analysis. J.A. 42 n.37. Section 45.50.915(b) is part of the Alaska Uniform Trade Secrets Act and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (a) In addition to or in lieu of injunctive relief, a complainant may recover damages for the actual loss caused by misappropriation. A complainant also may recover for the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing damages for actual loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    If wilful and malicious misappropriation exists\n   </em>\n   , the court may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice the damages awarded under (a) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   AS \u00a7 45.50.915 (emphasis supplied). Like the Arizona court, the Alaska court made no specific finding that Appellant intended to injure TKCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Federal Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On July 1, 2016, Appellant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and sought to discharge the Alaska judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition,\n   <em>\n    In re Muhs\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-12288 (Bankr.

It refers to an Alaska Supreme Court decision stating, \"[a]n act is willful if it is done intentionally and purposefully, rather than accidentally or inadvertently.\"\n   <em>\n    Walt's Sheet Metal v.

Rather, a bankruptcy court must specifically find a deliberate and intentional\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, even if TKCA is correct that the Alaska court decided Appellant intentionally and purposefully misappropriated TKCA's trade secrets, that is still not enough.

The Alaska court never decided whether Appellant intended to injure TKCA, as required by\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the only critical determination the Alaska court made was that Appellant was in privity with PHP based on equitable and quasi-estoppel, and therefore, he was collaterally\n   estopped from \"relitigating TKCA's claims against him\" in Alaska. J.A. 38. TKCA maintains that the Alaska court necessarily made a determination of willfulness and maliciousness in its award of exemplary damages, indicated in a footnote with no analysis. But as mentioned above, the Alaska court made no decision whatsoever that it based those damages on a finding that Appellant intended to injure TKCA. Indeed, the district court's decision on appeal here recognizes this fact. It states that the Alaska judgment awarded exemplary damages for violation of Alaska's UTSA, which can \"only [be awarded] for willful and malicious\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 310 (emphasis supplied). As explained above, Appellant's conduct is not the issue; rather, it is his intent to injure that matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   TKCA also points to a portion of the Arizona court's decision regarding the award of punitive damages, which states, \"This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that PHP engaged in outrageous conduct and acted with an evil mind\n   <em>\n    intending to injure\n   </em>\n   TKCA by intentionally interfering with TKCA's contracts and opportunities and then using TKCA's proprietary information to misappropriate those opportunities.\" J.A. 88-89 (emphasis supplied). Then, TKCA contends that although Appellant was not a party to the Arizona Action, this \"evil mind\" is attributable solely to Appellant because in the Alaska Action, Appellant's counsel acknowledged \"TKCA's claims of wrongdoing by PHP are entirely based on the alleged wrongdoing of [Appellant].\" Appellee's Br. 16 n.2 (quoting J.A. 200 (motion to stay Alaska Action)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But crucially, the Alaska court did not take the additional step of finding that Appellant had the requisite intent to injure (or was estopped from arguing to the contrary)\n   <em>\n    in the Alaska Action\n   </em>\n   . Nor would such a finding have been essential to the Alaska court's decision that Appellant was in privity with PHP and thus, he was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues determined in the Arizona Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Therefore, whether Appellant specifically had the requisite intent to injure TKCA was neither actually decided in, nor essential to, the Alaska Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For these reasons, collateral estoppel was inappropriate in this case.
