Tesla moved to compel arbitration, and the district court granted the motion. Lambert appealed, arguing that \u00a7 1981 claims cannot be subjected to compulsory arbitration.

His employment contract included an arbitration provision that \"purport[ed] to require the parties to arbitrate disputes arising between them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   During his employment, Lambert, an African American, claimed that \"the other employees consistently harassed him\" due to his race. This abuse took various forms, from petty and puerile harassment (employees would stick Lambert's tools to a table with adhesive tape and take photos with his phone without permission) to vicious and vituperative comments. Lambert's appeals to Tesla's human resources department were unavailing, and he further alleged that the company \"discriminated against and retaliated against\" him and \"refus[ed] to promote [him] because of his race.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lambert filed suit against Tesla in the district court, alleging violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He also sought a declaration that his \u00a7 1981 claim was nonarbitrable. Tesla moved the district court to either dismiss Lambert's action or compel arbitration. The court concluded that our precedent permitted the arbitrability of \u00a7 1981 claims, and granted Tesla's motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.

Although he marshals an impressive array of primary and secondary sources in support of his investigation, the exercise itself is fundamentally flawed.

As did the\n   <em>\n    Luce, Forward\n   </em>\n   dissenters, I recognize that Congress \"plainly thought that the [1991] Act did not allow employers to force their workers to sign compulsory arbitration clauses forfeiting their right to trial by jury in Title VII cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9089577\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9089577\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/742/\">\n    at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Reinhardt, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Viewed in this light, compelling arbitration in Section 1981 actions more acutely defies Congress's intent than does compelling arbitration in Title VII actions. As the majority in\n   <em>\n    Luce, Forward\n   </em>\n   noted, the EEOC may pursue Title VII claims in a judicial forum on behalf of individuals, even if the individual agreed to mandatory arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9089577\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9089577\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/742/\">\n    at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, those bringing claims under Title VII retain some ability to choose the judicial forum in which their claims will be heard. The same is not true for Section 1981 claims, which must be brought by private litigants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of our holding, an individual who signs an arbitration clause will be stripped of any ability to pursue a racial discrimination claim under Section 1981 in a court of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our decision today signifies a further departure from the increased choice of fora Congress intended to bring about in the 1991 Act. However, bound by\n   <em>\n    Luce, Forward\n   </em>\n   , we are left with no option to hold otherwise. Therefore, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    What is more, an individual has good reason to bring an action for racial discrimination under Section 1981 as opposed to Title VII since the statute of limitations for bringing a Section 1981 claim is longer than for a Title VII claims.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jones v.
