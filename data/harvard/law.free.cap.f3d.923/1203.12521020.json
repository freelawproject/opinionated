Prado claims this conviction is no longer a predicate to removal because it was recalled and reclassified as a misdemeanor under California's Proposition 64. Because valid state convictions retain their immigration consequences even when modified or expunged for reasons of state public policy, we deny her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Born in Mexico, Prado entered the United States with her parents in 1972, when she was approximately six months old. She became a lawful permanent resident on December 29, 1980. Thereafter, she resided in the United States but never became a United States citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 28, 2014, Prado pled guilty to one felony count of Possession of Marijuana for Sale, in violation of California Health and Safety Code (\"CHSC\") Section 11359. The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, placed her on probation for three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two years later, the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") encountered Prado at the Orange County Jail, where she was serving time on a subsequent drug conviction. DHS charged Prado with two violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), both arising from her conviction under CHSC \u00a7 11359, and either of which would render her removable: (1) committing an offense \"relating to a controlled substance,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) ; and (2) committing an aggravated felony, illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While her removal charges were pending, Prado applied to the Superior Court of California to have her conviction reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor under California's Proposition 64, the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (the \"Act\"). The Act permits individuals who have completed their sentences under various statutes, including CHSC \u00a7 11359, to have their felony convictions \"redesignated\" as misdemeanors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CHSC \u00a7\u00a7 11359(b), 11361.8(e). The court granted Prado's application in an order stating, \"The following felony conviction(s) is/are recalled and reclassified as misdemeanor conviction(s) and any enhancements are dismissed by operation of law: 11359.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Prado applied for asylum, withholding of removal, cancellation of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. After several hearings, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") denied all of these applications and found Prado removable as charged. The IJ noted that, although Prado's conviction was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, \"the conviction remains a conviction for [i]mmigration purposes,\" and \"[t]he fact that it has been reduced to a misdemeanor does not change the fact that it is a controlled substance related offense and that it still contains the trafficking element.\" The IJ concluded, \"The Court does believe that at this point the respondent's conviction remains both a controlled substances offense and an aggravated felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prado timely appealed the IJ's determinations that she was removable and ineligible for asylum. In her pro se brief to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), Prado argued her conviction did not constitute an \"aggravated felony\" or an offense \"relating to a controlled substance\" because it was recalled and reclassified under the Act. In support of this argument, she submitted a report by the Immigration Legal Resource Center on Proposition 64, which noted that the Act could reduce the immigration consequences of certain marijuana offenses but acknowledged that a\n   marijuana conviction redesignated for rehabilitative purposes \"remains a conviction for immigration purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The BIA dismissed Prado's appeal. In response to Prado's argument that California recalled and reclassified her conviction as a misdemeanor, thereby eliminating its immigration consequences, the BIA observed that Prado failed to identify any authority in support of her position. Instead, the BIA held that Prado's appeal was foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Roman-Suaste v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201465\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1035/\">\n    766 F.3d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014), which held that a \"conviction under CHSC \u00a7 11359 categorically qualifies as an aggravated felony, namely 'illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201465\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1035/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201465\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1035/\">\n    at 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B) ). The BIA also dismissed Prado's appeal of the IJ's finding that she was convicted of an offense \"relating to a controlled substance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prado does not contest that a conviction under CHSC \u00a7 11359, as it stood on the day of her guilty plea, would be grounds for removal. Instead, Prado argues that the reclassification of her conviction under the Act means she is no longer removable. First, she argues that the Act's reclassification of her initial conviction eliminated its immigration consequences. Second, she argues that she was re-convicted under the modified terms of CHSC \u00a7 11359, and that her new conviction is neither an \"aggravated felony\" nor an \"offense relating to a controlled substance,\" because the Act's definition of \"marijuana\" is broader than the definition used in the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    569 U.S. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190-91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (a state offense must be a \"categorical match\" to the offense listed in the INA in order to serve as a predicate for removal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prado's argument fails because federal immigration law does not recognize a state's policy decision to expunge (or recall or reclassify) a valid state conviction. \"A conviction vacated for reasons 'unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings' may be used as a conviction in removal proceedings whereas a conviction vacated because of a procedural or substantive defect in the criminal proceedings may not.\"\n   <em>\n    Poblete Mendoza v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680087\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/1137/#p1141\">\n    606 F.3d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nath v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805407\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1185/#p1189\">\n    467 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1189 (9th Cir. 2006) ). Thus, an individual remains removable based on a conviction that was vacated \"for equitable, rehabilitation, or immigration hardship reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805407\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/1185/#p1189\">\n    467 F.3d at 1188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is because \"Congress intended to establish a uniform federal rule that precluded the recognition of subsequent state rehabilitative expungements of convictions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murillo-Espinoza v.

A \"rehabilitative\" law \"reduce[s] the long-term impact of criminal convictions on individuals who subsequently demonstrate a period of good behavior\" such as by \"serv[ing] a period of probation or imprisonment,\" after which the \"conviction is ordered dismissed by the judge.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Altamirano v.

The Act permits individuals\n   who have completed their sentences under statutes criminalizing the sale, possession, production, or transportation of marijuana to have their convictions reclassified and reduced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CHSC \u00a7 11361.8(e).

For instance, Prado cites the Official Voter Information Guide's statement that \"Prop. 64 will stop ruining people's lives for marijuana,\" as well as then-Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom's statement that \"the true promise of Proposition 64 [is] providing new hope and opportunities to Californians, primarily people of color, whose lives were long ago derailed by a costly, broken and racially discriminatory system of marijuana criminalization.\" Considering these statements and the structure of the Act, it seems the Act's reclassification of Prado's conviction was intended to reduce the ongoing negative effects of her conviction for rehabilitative purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We are not persuaded by Prado's attempt to characterize California's decision that its marijuana policy was flawed as proof of a \"substantive\" flaw in her conviction. Prado explains that California voters passed Proposition 64 because they believed California's marijuana laws were unjust, and claims that California's \"enforcement of its old laws presents constitutional and legal defects in Ms. Prado's initial conviction.\" However, Prado merely asserts that California's pre-Act drug enforcement policies were illegal or unconstitutional, without attempting to show how the proceedings against her were defective in any way. Because Prado does not challenge the validity of her conviction, it retains its immigration consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, Prado's argument fails because the Act merely reclassified her sentence as a matter of California law, rather than fully expunging it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Castro v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   , even \"assuming that some state expungement statutes could eliminate completely the immigration consequences of a state conviction,\" a statute that \"provides only a limited expungement even under state law\" is not such a statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442328\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/1172/#p1175\">\n    287 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (9th Cir. 2002). The Act did not completely eliminate the consequences of Prado's conviction under CHSC \u00a7 11359 even as a matter of state law; rather, it reclassified that conviction to a misdemeanor, under the modified terms of CHSC \u00a7 11359.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CHSC \u00a7 11361.8(e) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.
