Plaintiffs (collectively, \"Sweda\") alleged that Defendants (collectively, \"Penn\"), among other things, failed to use prudent and loyal decision making processes regarding investments and administration, overpaid certain fees by up to 600%, and failed to remove underperforming options from the retirement plan's offerings. The District Court dismissed Sweda's complaint in its entirety. We will reverse the District Court's dismissal of the breach of fiduciary duty claims at Counts III and V only and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sweda and her fellow Plaintiffs-Appellants are current and former Penn employees who participate, or participated, in Penn's retirement plan (the \"Plan\"). They sought to represent the proposed class of Plan participants, 20,000 current and former Penn employees who had participated in the Plan since August 10, 2010. The Defendants are the University of Pennsylvania, its Investment Committee, and Jack Heuer, the University's Vice President of Human Resources. The Plan is a defined contribution plan under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (34), tax qualified under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20403\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The University matches employees' contributions up to 5% of compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As a 403(b), the Plan offers mutual funds and annuities: the former through TIAA-CREF and Vanguard Group, Inc. and the latter through TIAA-CREF. Since 2010, the Plan has offered as many as 118 investment options. As of December 2014, the Plan offered 78 options: 48 Vanguard mutual funds, and 30 TIAA-CREF options including mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, and an insurance company separate account. Effective October 19, 2012, Penn organized its investment fund lineup into four tiers. The TIAA-CREF and Vanguard options under Tier 1 consisted of lifecycle or target-date funds for the \"Do-it-for-me\" investor. Certain core funds were designated Tier 2, designed for the \"Help-me-do-it\" investor looking to be involved in his or her investment choices without having to decide among too many options. Under Tier 3, the Plan offered an \"expanded menu of funds\" for \"the more advanced 'mix-my-own' investor,\" and under Tier 4, the Plan offered the option of a brokerage account window for the \"self-directed\" investor looking for additional options, subject to additional fees. Plan participants thereafter could \"select a combination of funds from any or all of the investment tiers.\" At the end of 2014, the Plan had $ 3.8 billion in assets: $ 2.5 billion invested in TIAA-CREF options, and $ 1.3 billion invested in Vanguard options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   TIAA-CREF and Vanguard charge investment and administrative (recordkeeping) fees. Mutual fund investment fees are charged as a percentage of a fund's managed assets, known as the expense ratio, and the rate can differ by share class. The mutual funds in which the Plan invests have two share classes: retail and institutional. Retail class shares generally have higher investment fees than institutional class shares. There are also two common\n   recordkeeping fee models. In a flat fee model, recordkeeping fees are a set amount per participant, whereas in a revenue sharing model, part of an option's expense ratio is diverted to administrative service providers. TIAA-CREF and Vanguard charged the Plan under the revenue sharing model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sweda alleged numerous breaches of fiduciary duty and prohibited transactions. She brought six counts against all Defendants, and one count against the University. The first six counts alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (Counts I, III, and V) and prohibited transactions in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (Counts II, IV, and VI). Sweda also alleged that the University failed to adequately monitor its appointed fiduciaries in Count VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Penn moved to dismiss the complaint, and the District Court granted the motion.

That is why, in exercising our plenary review, we apply the same standard as the district court and construe the complaint \"in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    Santomenno ex rel.

The element of intent to benefit a party in interest effects the purpose of \u00a7 1106(a)(1), which is to rout out transactions that benefit such parties at the expense of participants. Section 1106(a)(1) is not meant to impede necessary service transactions, but rather transactions that present legitimate risks to participants and beneficiaries such as \"securities purchases or sales by a plan to manipulate the price of the security to the advantage of a party-in-interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Leigh v.

We therefore hold that absent factual allegations that support an element of intent to benefit a party in interest, a plaintiff does not plausibly allege that a \"transaction that constitutes a direct or indirect ... furnishing of goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest\" prohibited by \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(C) has occurred. Requiring plaintiffs to allege facts supporting this element avoids absurdity in interpreting the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Conclusory and well-pleaded factual allegations of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    prohibited transactions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The factual allegations that Sweda included in her complaint to support her claims for prohibited transactions overlap with the allegations supporting her fiduciary breach claims. Besides the allegations recounted above, Sweda alleged that revenue sharing was \"kicked back\" to TIAA-CREF for recordkeeping associated with TIAA-CREF options. Am. Compl. \u00b6109. She alleged that Penn \"allowed TIAA's financial interest to dictate the Plan's investment selections and recordkeeping arrangement.\" Am. Compl. \u00b687. She also alleged that Penn failed to act in the exclusive interest of participants, instead \"serv[ing] TIAA-CREF's and Vanguard's financial interests\" with decisions such as \"allowing TIAA-CREF and Vanguard to put their proprietary investments in the Plan without scrutinizing those providers' financial interest.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6112, 200. These general allegations about kickbacks and prioritizing TIAA-CREF and Vanguard's financial interests over the participant and beneficiaries' financial interests are largely conclusory, but we also consider well-pleaded factual allegations summarized at \u00a7 III.B.3 that are relevant to Sweda's prohibited transaction claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Sweda failed to plausibly state a claim under Counts II, IV, and VI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Looking at the totality of the allegations in the complaint, taken as true,\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058329\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/780/#p787\">\n    809 F.3d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Sweda failed to state a plausible claim for prohibited transactions in Counts II, IV, and VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   a. Count II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Count II, Sweda alleged that a prohibited transaction occurred when Penn allowed TIAA-CREF to require inclusion of CREF Stock and Money Market accounts among the Plan's investment options and agreed to TIAA-CREF recordkeeping services, pursuant to a \"lock-in\" agreement. Am. Compl. \u00b6193. Two of Sweda's prohibited transaction claims emanate\n   from this agreement: (1) that a prohibited transaction occurred at the time of the initial agreement, and (2) that a prohibited transaction occurred every time fees were later paid pursuant to the agreement. As to the initial agreement, Sweda did not sufficiently allege that TIAA-CREF was a party in interest at that time: she included no allegation that TIAA-CREF was \"providing services to [the] plan,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14)(B). Because Sweda failed to allege that TIAA-CREF was a party in interest at the time of the \"lock-in,\" that element is factually unsupported, and she failed to state a claim for the first alleged prohibited transaction in Count II. Sweda's second claim in Count II that prohibited transactions occurred every time property was exchanged or services were rendered pursuant to the \"lock-in\" agreement is so closely related to Count IV (payment of recordkeeping fees) that we will address these claims together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   b. Counts II and IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In Counts II and IV, Sweda alleged that Penn caused the Plan to enter prohibited transactions when it caused the Plan to pay administrative fees to TIAA-CREF and Vanguard. Sweda plausibly alleged that TIAA-CREF and Vanguard were parties in interest under \u00a7 1002(14)(B) because they provided services to the plan at the time fees were paid, and Penn's own Plan materials identify TIAA-CREF and Vanguard as parties in interest. At the pleadings stage, we must assume that this well-pleaded fact is true. Next we look to whether Penn caused the Plan to enter a prohibited transaction with TIAA-CREF or Vanguard for administrative fees. Sweda alleged that the administrative fee payments constituted prohibited transactions under \u00a7 1106(a)(1) in three ways: (1) they were prohibited transfers of property under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(A), (2) they were transfers of assets under subsection (D), and (3) they constituted furnishing of services under subsection (C). We first address whether Sweda plausibly alleged that administrative fee payment by revenue sharing constituted a transfer of property under (A) or Plan assets under (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Sweda alleged that administrative fees were paid by revenue sharing. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 110 (Vanguard is \"compensated for recordkeeping services based on internal revenue sharing it receives from the Vanguard Investor share class mutual funds.\"). She also alleged that investment fees were drawn from mutual fund assets. Am. Compl. \u00b644. (\"Mutual fund fees are usually expressed as a percentage of assets under management ... [t]he fees deducted from a mutual fund's assets ...\"). Mutual fund assets are distinct from Plan assets, because, under the statute, assets of \"a plan which invests in any security issued by an investment company\" do not \"include any assets of such investment company.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hecker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329886\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/575/\">\n    556 F.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (With support from the Department of Labor, defendants demonstrated that revenue sharing fees did not impinge plan assets because they were drawn from the assets of mutual funds). Therefore, Sweda did not plausibly allege that revenue sharing involved a transfer of Plan property or assets under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(A) or (D), and furthermore, Sweda did not plausibly allege that Penn had subjective intent to benefit a TIAA-CREF or Vanguard by a use or transfer of Plan assets, which, under our precedent, is required to state a claim under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(D).\n   <em>\n    Reich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411038\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/270/#p278\">\n    57 F.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, we must address whether a prohibited transaction occurred under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(C), the prohibition of \"furnishing of goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest.\" As we explained above, it is possible to read subsection\n   (C) to create a per se prohibited transaction rule forbidding service arrangements between a plan and a party rendering services to the plan. However, because reading \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(C) to that end would be absurd, Sweda must plead an element of intent to benefit the party in interest. After striking conclusory allegations, such as \"Defendants served TIAA-CREF's and Vanguard's financial interests\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6112) from the complaint, we do not find that Sweda alleged facts showing that Penn intended to benefit TIAA-CREF or Vanguard. We will affirm the dismissal of Sweda's claims for prohibited transactions under Counts II and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   c. Count VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At Count VI, Sweda alleged that Penn caused the Plan to engage in prohibited transactions when it caused the Plan to pay investment fees to TIAA-CREF and Vanguard. For similar reasons that Sweda did not plausibly allege prohibited transactions in Counts II and IV, she also failed to plausibly allege prohibited transactions in Count VI. First, Sweda did not plausibly allege that payment of investment fees constituted a prohibited transaction under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(A), because Sweda alleged that investment fees were drawn from mutual fund assets, not Plan assets. Second, for the same reason, investment fees were not plausibly alleged to be a transfer of assets of the Plan under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(D). Third, Sweda did not allege that Penn intended to benefit TIAA-CREF or Vanguard under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(D), as required by our precedent.\n   <em>\n    Reich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411038\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/270/#p278\">\n    57 F.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, as we explained above in our discussion of Counts II and IV, in order to state a claim for prohibited transactions under \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(C), \"furnishing goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest,\" a plaintiff must allege intent to benefit a party in interest. Sweda failed to do so.

In the dissent's view, plaintiffs' failure to include that information constitutes a failure to allege an injury in fact.

Thus, if a service provider has no prior relationship with a plan before entering a service agreement, the service provider is not a party in interest at the time of the agreement.

Between 2009 and 2014, the plan's assets increased in value by $ 1.6 billion, a 73% return on investment. Despite this increase, plaintiffs have filed a putative class action, claiming that the plan's fiduciaries have imprudently managed it and seeking tens of millions of dollars of damages. Having convinced this Court to reverse in part the District Court's dismissal of the action, the plaintiffs will continue to pursue their remaining claims, which will be litigated extensively, at large cost to the university. As a result, the university is in an unenviable position, in which it has every incentive to settle quickly to avoid (1) expensive discovery and further motion practice, (2) potential individual liability for named fiduciaries,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the prospect of damages\n   calculations, after lengthy litigation, with interest-inflated liability totals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This pressure to settle increases with the size of the plan, regardless of the merits of the case. Alleged mismanagement of a $ 400,000 plan will expose fiduciaries to less liability than mismanagement of a $ 4 billion plan. Thus, notwithstanding the strength of the claims, a plaintiff's attorney, seeking a large fee, will target a plan that holds abundant assets. I am concerned that this is the case both here and in numerous other lawsuits that have targeted large corporations and universities that administer some of the largest retirement plans in the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This strategy has substantial consequences for fiduciaries of these plans, particularly at universities. While the fiduciaries for large corporations may have experience in dealing with potential liabilities, fiduciaries at universities are often staff members who volunteer to serve in these roles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though indemnification agreements exist for these individual members, as long as they are party to the suit they will be required to disclose this litigation in personal financial transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, universities, which unlike large corporations are not typically in the business of profitmaking, must keep in mind, when determining how best to proceed in litigation, that the university will be responsible for any damages award. This reality demands that cases such as this one be carefully scrutinized in order not to permit implausible allegations to result in a large settlement, under which a substantial portion of the funds that are to be reimbursed to retirement plans are instead diverted to attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ultimately, this case presents a question virtually identical to the one addressed by this Court seven years ago, in\n   <em>\n    Renfro v. Unisys Corp.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   : Does an ERISA plan fiduciary acting in good faith, under the prudent person standard, have a duty to do more than provide a wide, reasonable, and low-cost variety of investment options for individual plan beneficiaries who want to have control over their own investment portfolio? Plaintiffs contend that because the pleadings have identified specific problematic funds in the mix and range offered by defendants, the answer should be yes. The majority agrees, holding that the administrators of a pension plan must ensure that sophisticated investors receive the best version of each plan available. This departs from the core principles in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   , set out above, which the District Court followed faithfully. For these reasons, I would affirm in full the District\n   Court's dismissal of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Plan, as explained by the District Court, is a defined-contribution plan that offers its beneficiaries four levels of involvement in their investments. The first tier is a \"do-it-for-me\" tier, where investors have their choice between a TIAA target fund and a Vanguard target fund, which funds automatically adjust their investment strategy with no input from the beneficiary, based on an expected retirement date. Tier 2 is a \"help-me-do-it\" tier, which allows a beneficiary to select from a group of eight options and weigh them as preferred. The third tier is a \"mix-my-own\" tier, which provides a few options for each of nine types of funds. And finally, Tier 4 is a \"self-directed\" tier, which provides access to the full panoply of 78 funds offered by defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Of these 78 investment options, virtually all are mutual funds. Over the course of the class period, the proportion of retail-class mutual funds, as opposed to cheaper institutional-class mutual funds, has varied. Appellants have specifically challenged 58 of these retail-class funds as having had cheaper but otherwise identical institutional-class analogues at some point during the class period (Count V). Defendants note in this connection that dozens of funds have been switched to institutional classes over time. Plaintiffs also challenge the method in which fees are calculated (Count III), stating that an asset-based calculation has overcompensated the record keepers and that a failure to negotiate rebates constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At argument, when asked about the four separate tiers of beneficiary involvement, plaintiffs stated that the funds being challenged were largely related to Tiers 3 and 4, and in a follow-up response, specifically excluded Tier 1 from the scope of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It is well established that ERISA was intended to be a \"comprehensive and reticulated\" statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   enacted after \"a decade of congressional study of the Nation's private employee benefit system.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ERISA \"resolved innumerable disputes between powerful competing interests-a balance between encouraging the creation of plans and ensuring enforcement of rights under a plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress intended to create a system \"that is [not] so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first place.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, ERISA's purpose is, in part, to \"assur[e] a predictable set of liabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders\n   and awards when a violation has occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel, \"one of the few firms handling ERISA class actions such as this,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   have brought numerous ERISA suits across the country. While these cases were at first limited to corporate retirement plans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   they have expanded to include several suits against university retirement plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These cases typically are not litigated to conclusion, either terminating through settlement or a judicial finding against the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Given that these cases are brought as putative class actions, counsel is able to petition the court for fees after a successful settlement. In cases of successful settlements, counsel, upon petition, are often awarded one third of the settlement amount, plus expenses, from the settlement fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   While benefits to the plan may result from the settlement, they are substantially diluted by the fees' calculation, even before considering the litigation costs that the universities shoulder through the motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, while there is no comprehensive listing of \"jumbo plans\" maintained in this country, this pattern of bringing class actions against large funds seems to have sustained itself and could continue as long as more plans can be identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Such a result would be the opposite of \"assuring a predictable set of liabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it would not only discourage the offering of these plans, but it would also discourage \"individuals from serving as fiduciaries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, in enforcing the pleading standards under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , courts must take great care to allow only plausible, rather than possible, claims to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the majority takes\n   great care to lay out the pleading standards that govern this dispute, for the reasons stated below, I disagree that those standards have been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The majority cites\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support discarding any concern of encouraging attorney-driven litigation, despite its \"appreciation of Penn and amici's fear of frivolous litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   But\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third\n   </em>\n   concerned an employee stock ownership plan, under which employees invested primarily in the stock of their employer, a plan that the majority points out is subject to distinct duties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants in that case were arguing for a special presumption that investments in the employer's stock would be prudent unless the employer was in dire financial straits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   No such presumption is necessary here to determine under\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   that plaintiffs' claims were properly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the above reasons, I conclude that the District Court's analysis of this case, following\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   , was the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Turning then to a more pragmatic concern with the pleading here, ERISA states that a civil action may be brought \"by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statutory edict, however, does not override the constitutional requirements for standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order for a plaintiff to carry her burden of establishing constitutional standing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   three elements must be met: (1) an injury in fact \"that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical\", (2) a causal connection between that injury and the conduct so that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's action, and (3) \"it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have held that \"an ERISA beneficiary suffers an injury-in-fact ... when a defendant allegedly breaches its fiduciary duty, profits from the breach, and the beneficiary, as opposed to the plan, has an\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   right to the profit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Plan's use of the 58 retail-class funds that had cheaper institutional-class analogues caused an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing for Count V. They do not, however, automatically have an individual right to the alleged lost profits simply because they are participants in the Plan broadly. At argument, plaintiffs specifically conceded that Tier 1 did not include any of the 58 funds challenged in Count V; plaintiffs limited\n   their focus in Count V to Tiers 3 and 4. Therefore, in order for plaintiffs to carry the burden of proof that they were injured by the selection of the 58 retail-class funds, they must plead that they were participants in Tier 3 or Tier 4. They have not done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The amended complaint does not contain facts that link any of the named plaintiffs to any tier at any point during the class period. While a paragraph in the complaint is devoted to each of the six plaintiffs, each of those paragraphs consists of three sentences. The first lists the plaintiff's name and residence, the second states the plaintiff's job title, and the third sentence is as follows, with changes only for gender: \"She is a participant in the Plan under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) because she and her beneficiaries are or may become eligible to receive benefits under the Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This averment indicates merely that plaintiffs are participants under the definition of \u00a7 1132(a)(2). It provides no information as to which tier, or tiers, any individual plaintiff chose for investment. Indeed, the entire record contains no direct information on this point. Plaintiffs conceded this at oral argument. The \"standing\" portion of the amended complaint does imply that plaintiffs invested in ways consistent with being in a more active investment tier, but it does so by alleging generally that \"the named Plaintiffs and all participants in the Plan suffered financial harm\" as a result of defendants conduct alleged in Count V.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   This cannot be sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This language in the amended complaint appears to mirror its citation to\n   <em>\n    LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   to support standing here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   does not save plaintiffs. The two situations in\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   that the Supreme Court held to constitute cognizable claims under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) were instances when \"a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to\n   <em>\n    all participants and beneficiaries\n   </em>\n   , or ... to persons tied to particular individual accounts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The latter justification is identical to our test above, and as counsel conceded at argument, the plan's system of tiers included at least one tier, Tier 1, that was not alleged to have been affected by retail-class investments, rendering the former justification inapplicable. As a result, I would affirm the District Court's dismissal of Count V.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   If this were the only deficiency in plaintiffs' amended complaint, the appropriate remedy would be to dismiss Count V without prejudice to allow plaintiffs an opportunity to allege sufficient facts regarding the tiers they invested in. However, for the reasons below, I believe that dismissing Count V without prejudice would be futile because plaintiffs have otherwise failed to\n   plead a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Renfro v. Unisys Corp.\n   </em>\n   , we evaluated a similar complaint at the same stage in litigation, and determined that the mix and range of investment options in the retirement plan provided by Unisys was sufficient to demonstrate that the defendants' fiduciary duty had been met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite a greater mix and range of options in the instant case, the majority believes that the standards that foreclosed the plaintiffs' arguments in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   do not do so here. However, a close look at the facts indicates that plaintiffs' arguments under both Counts III and V are the same as, if not in fact weaker than, in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   I will turn to Count V first. Three fact patterns were presented in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   : the facts surrounding the Unisys plan as well as facts from two cases we considered from other circuits with opposite outcomes. In\n   <em>\n    Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss, as the plan at issue contained only thirteen investment options and was alleged to be part of a kickback scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Hecker v. Deere &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a complaint against a plan with twenty-three mutual fund options and a third-party service that provided beneficiaries access to hundreds more.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Seventh Circuit reasoned that it was implausible that this structure did not grant beneficiaries sufficient investment choices, as the fees on each of these options ranged from 0.07% to 1% across all funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   , the Unisys plan included 73 distinct investment options,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   71 of which were specifically named in the operative complaint as having excessive fees. Fees among the investment options in the Unisys plan ranged from 0.1% to 1.21%. We held that since the allegations solely contested the fees charged in the Unisys plan, we could not \"infer from what is alleged that the process was flawed,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we affirmed the dismissal of the excessive investment fees claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In the instant case, the Plan has had a minimum of 78 investment options during the class period, 58 of which are specifically contested in the amended complaint. Fees among these options in the Plan range from 0.04% to 0.87%. Despite plaintiffs' claims that these fees are excessive, their attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   boil down to the level of detail in the complaint rather than, for example, any change in market circumstances that might render this 0.04% to 0.87% range excessively high today. While the question of fiduciary breach does not boil down to a numerical calculation, plaintiffs do not contest that the Plan has a greater number of investment\n   options than the Unisys plan and that the highest and lowest fees charged by Plan funds are both lower than in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   . It is therefore difficult to see, in the absence of additional allegations regarding market circumstances or fiduciary misconduct, how this claim could be plausible if the claims in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The majority believes that endorsing this reasoning would allow a fiduciary to \"avoid liability by stocking a plan with hundreds of options, even if the majority were overpriced or underperforming.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   This oversimplifies the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   , which afforded substantial weight in its discussion of\n   <em>\n    Braden\n   </em>\n   to allegations of a kickback scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   If coupled with other allegations of mismanagement, a plan flooded with hundreds of options might itself be evidence of an imprudently clumsy attempt at fiduciary compliance or a distraction from bad-faith dealings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In the instant case, plaintiffs do not allege any such schemes. Even their prohibited transaction claims, which the majority properly dismissed, derive from an \"extremely broad\" reading of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   rather than any self-interest on the part of the fiduciaries. Without more, the Count V challenge to the Plan is neatly circumscribed by\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   , regardless of the level of specificity devoted to the pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Moreover, plaintiffs' admission that the challenged funds are primarily offered to Tiers 3 and 4 compels this outcome. If the challenged funds were being provided in Tier 1-that is, to investors who wished to have their investments managed for them-the selection of more expensive share classes in a large portion of the fund would be concerning. However, since Tiers 3 and 4 attract investors who have a more sophisticated understanding of investment options and, inversely, are unlikely to attract investors who might be easily confused by the available investments, the overall mix and range of options is not disturbed by the fact that only the retail-class option was available for a proportion of the funds in these tiers. The majority stresses the importance of \"Penn's 'conduct in arriving at an investment decision' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   but fails to mention that twenty funds were switched from retail-class shares to institutional-class shares between 2011 and 2016, a shift that demonstrates that defendants, in choosing investment options, were not deliberately ignoring the benefits of institutional-class shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The majority alternatively suggests that this analysis is too singularly focused on numerical performance or on allegations of misconduct. But both cannot be true simultaneously. A plausible allegation of either kind at the pleading stage would be sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss, but plaintiffs here have not plausibly alleged either. I would therefore affirm the District Court's dismissal of Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The plain text of\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   also mandates that plaintiffs' Count III claim regarding the method of calculating fees must fail. In rejecting a similar, albeit less thoroughly pled, excessive fees claim, we stated that the\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' \"allegations concerning\n   fees are directed exclusively to the fee structure and are limited to contentions that Unisys should have paid per-participant fees rather than fees based on a percentage of assets in the plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is an exact description of Count III, and the parallel logic is apparent between the two complaints, even if the amended complaint here is supplemented with more concrete numbers than the\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   complaint. The allegations that failed in\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   must fail here also.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The majority relies solely on\n   <em>\n    Tussey v. ABB, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   to demonstrate that claims involving excessive recordkeeping fees can survive a motion to dismiss. This reliance is improper. The Eighth Circuit noted that \"unlike\" cases like\n   <em>\n    Renfro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tussey\n   </em>\n   \"involve[d] significant allegations of wrongdoing, including allegations that ABB used revenue sharing to benefit ABB and Fidelity at the Plan's expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs had proven, during a bench trial, that ABB had been explicitly warned about the excessiveness of their revenue sharing agreement and had failed to act in any way upon that warning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   No such facts are alleged here, and as such, plaintiffs' Count III claim must fail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the District Court's dismissal of all counts of the amended complaint. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to reverse the District Court's dismissal of Counts III and V of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <em>\n     Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Labor v.
