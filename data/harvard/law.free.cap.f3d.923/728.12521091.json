Specifically, it held that \"that a priority use provision, an affirmative obligation to maintain and repair, and the ability to lease the property to others together create sufficient control of the property such that a landowner who leases the property is held liable as a premises owner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575058\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/522/#p528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575058\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/522/#p528\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
