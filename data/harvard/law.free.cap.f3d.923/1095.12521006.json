On August 7, 1998, truck bombs exploded outside the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing more than two hundred and injuring more than a thousand. These two bombings were the work of al Qaeda. In the decades since, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been linked to all four bombings, while the Republic of Sudan's support for al Qaeda has implicated it in the 1998 attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Foreign sovereigns are generally immune from suit in U.S. courts. However, district courts in this Circuit have found Iran and Sudan liable for the attacks in numerous suits filed by victims and their families under the terrorism exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), the statute governing the amenability of foreign nations to lawsuits in the United States. The FSIA's terrorism exception was first enacted in 1996 but was replaced in 2008 with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a more expansive provision allowing for suits by non-U.S. nationals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this consolidated opinion, we address six cases arising from the Beirut, Nairobi, and Dar es Salaam attacks. Plaintiffs in three of the suits are family members or estates of victims of the 1998 bombings. The plaintiffs in these cases named Sudan and Iran as defendants. The remaining three actions seek damages from Iran for deaths and injuries resulting from the 1983 and 1984 attacks. The first five suits were assigned to the same District Court Judge, including all of the complaints against Sudan, which successfully moved to dismiss the claims against it as untimely. Iran, in contrast, failed to appear to defend the complaints raised against it. The plaintiffs moved for default judgment against Iran. The District Court, however, acted\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to consider whether the complaints against Iran were timely. After briefing\n   from the parties, the District Court ruled that the claims against Iran were untimely, denied the motions for default judgment, and dismissed plaintiffs' actions. The District Court Judge assigned to the sixth case followed suit on the same grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All plaintiffs now appeal the dismissals of their claims against Iran, contending that the District Courts erred in raising the statute of limitations\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and in dismissing their complaints as untimely. One group of plaintiffs also challenges the denial of motions for relief from judgment that they filed after their claims were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We do not reach the statute of limitations issue or the post-judgment motions. Rather, we conclude that the District Court lacks authority to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise a forfeited statute of limitations defense in an FSIA terrorism exception case, at least where the defendant sovereign fails to appear. We therefore reverse the judgments of the District Courts, vacate the dismissals of the complaints, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

After several courts adopted narrow interpretations of the exception, including that it did not create a cause of action against foreign states, Congress enacted \u00a7 1083 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (the NDAA), which repealed \u00a7 1605(a)(7) and replaced it with the current terrorism exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A.

That determination was simply an application of the basic principles articulated above: When a party fails to raise an affirmative defense in responding to a pleading, as Sudan did by defaulting, the defense is forfeited. The same reasoning applies to Iran's absence in the cases now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Iran has failed to enter an appearance or submit a filing at any stage of these cases, let alone timely raise the terrorism exception's statute of limitations. We therefore conclude that it has forfeited the defense. We disagree with assertions and insinuations by appellants and amici supporting them that Iran has\n   <em>\n    waived\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    forfeited\n   </em>\n   a statute of limitations defense by engaging in a purportedly willful default. Appellants and amici contend that because Iran participates in other litigation in the United States, it has made a deliberate choice in not appearing and asserting any affirmative defenses here. But whatever Iran's decisions with respect to other litigation, we agree with the Appointed Amicus that Iran's complete absence here deprives us of any record or basis upon which to reliably determine that it has intentionally relinquished or abandoned a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We are puzzled, however, by the District Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   that, in cases of default, \"the affirmative defense at issue has not actually been waived, and the normal adversarial model upon which the concept of affirmative defenses is based has broken down.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525021\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/46/#p55\">\n    308 F.

We agree that Iran has not \"waived\" any affirmative defenses.

Sua Sponte\n   <em>\n    Action on Affirmative Defenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Having found that Iran forfeited a statute of limitations defense in each of these cases by failing to assert it in response to the pleadings in the District Court, the issue we must address is whether, and under what circumstances, a court may nonetheless raise a forfeited affirmative defense on behalf of an absent defendant. Specifically, does the District Court have authority to raise\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the FSIA terrorism exception's statute of limitations when it has been forfeited by a defendant who is entirely absent from the proceedings? We conclude that the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is well established that a statute of limitations, like other affirmative defenses, generally may not be invoked by the court on its own motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court has approved the\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   consideration of forfeited, nonjurisdictional affirmative defenses in a small number of narrow, carefully defined contexts. However, these cabined\n   and rare exceptions to both the party presentation principle and the rules governing forfeiture of affirmative defenses - which otherwise foreclose\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   action - share a common, defining feature. In each of the cases in which the Court has sanctioned\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   action by a court to raise a forfeited affirmative defense, the Court has made clear that the circumstances of a case must squarely implicate the institutional interests of the judiciary for such action to be permissible. And in none of these situations was the defendant on whose behalf the court acted entirely absent from the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Review of the decisions establishing these principles reveals both their narrowness and the common feature that explains the findings made by the Court. We begin with\n   <em>\n    Day v. McDonough\n   </em>\n   . In addition to discussing the principles concerning affirmative defenses noted above, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   considered whether a District Court had properly dismissed as untimely a state prisoner's federal habeas corpus petition, even though the respondent state had both answered the petition without raising a statute of limitations defense and had conceded the petition's timeliness.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275706\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/198/#p202\">\n    547 U.S. at 201-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275706,3276114\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/126/1675/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding that the concession was due to the state's inadvertent miscalculation of the filing period, the Court concluded that in these circumstances, the District Court \"had discretion to correct the State's error and, accordingly, to dismiss the petition as untimely under AEDPA's one-year limitation,\" despite the state's forfeiture of the defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275706,3276114\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/126/1675/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike in the AEDPA context or in the case of a\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   defense, no institutional interests of the judiciary are implicated when a \u00a7 1605A claim against an absent defendant proceeds to a default judgment, regardless of who the defendant is or how much time has passed since the terrorist act giving rise to the action took place.

The provision \"leaves it to the court to determine precisely how much and what kinds of evidence the plaintiff must provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Han Kim v.

Cir. 2014). It imposes no obligation on plaintiffs to rebut a hypothetical statute of limitations defense, which, as we have explained, is the defendant's responsibility to raise or risk forfeiting. Moreover, an issue regarding a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations has no connection to the quantum or quality of the evidence supporting a plaintiff's \"claim or right to relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Indeed, as a general matter, a plaintiff whose claims are perhaps untimely but otherwise meritorious is not barred from obtaining a judgment in her favor if a defendant fails to assert the applicable statute of limitations. Why? Because a\n   <em>\n    forfeited\n   </em>\n   affirmative defense cannot affect the court's consideration of the merits of a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Nor are there any institutional interests of the judiciary implicated by the obligations that \u00a7 1608(e) places on district courts. While the statute directs district courts to perform a screening function to evaluate the merits of a case before issuing a default judgment, this certainly does not justify the\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   invocation of a statute of limitations defense. An argument that institutional interests are implicated\n   merely because \u00a7 1608(e) requires the district courts to assess the merits of a claim before granting default judgment rings hollow. Such a conclusion would permit the \"institutional interest\" exception to completely swallow the party presentation principle and rules of forfeiture. In addition, given the complexity of the relevant statute of limitations provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b) and \u00a7 1083(c)(3) of the NDAA, it is far from clear that resolving claims on limitations grounds is easier than assessing the merits. Furthermore, in assessing the merits of a claim under \u00a7 1608(e), the courts are granted broad discretion to determine what degree and kind of evidence is satisfactory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Han Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n    774 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1047 ;\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p763\">\n    864 F.3d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the burden imposed on district courts is moderated. Moreover, case law shows that District Courts in this circuit routinely perform their \u00a7 1608(e) duties in terrorism exception cases with great effectiveness, even in cases concerning attacks that took place overseas decades ago.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Akins v.

Neither the District Courts nor the Appointed Amicus suggest that Rule 55(d) creates institutional interests justifying\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   action on affirmative defenses, and we see no reason why the Rule's statutory counterpart for foreign sovereign defendants would either. The Appointed Amicus attempts to draw a distinction by arguing that \u00a7 1608(e) imposes a greater responsibility on courts than Rule 55(d) because of the \"comity considerations\" present in FSIA cases. Appointed Amicus Br. at 30. But, as noted above, international comity concerns do not justify district courts'\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   actions raising forfeited defenses on behalf of defendants who fail to appear in FSIA cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Appointed Amicus also expresses concern that district courts \"bear the brunt of the institutional burden when an untimely claim proceeds to the special procedures for default judgment under Section 1608(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. We disagree with the assumption that underlies this argument,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that a purportedly untimely \u00a7 1605A claim necessarily imposes a greater burden on courts than a timely claim. As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , the significant evidentiary challenge in FSIA terrorism cases with a defaulting defendant is that \"firsthand evidence and eyewitness testimony is difficult or impossible to obtain from an absent and likely hostile sovereign.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p763\">\n    864 F.3d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This poses a greater problem for plaintiffs who must gather the evidence than for the courts that must assess it, regardless of how long ago the attack at issue occurred. We fail to see how the expiration of the nonjurisdictional statutory filing period makes any significant difference in a district court's ability to assess the evidence offered by a plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, the Appointed Amicus claims that allowing untimely claims to proceed will reduce the payments from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020144\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , made to judgment holders who filed timely complaints. We decline to reach this issue, or to assess the\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   appellants' contrary arguments, because the Fund was not addressed by the District Courts. We therefore have no record on which to assess the accuracy or import of the parties' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the reasons indicated above, we hold that the District Courts here lacked authority or discretion to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise the terrorism exception's statute\n   of limitations to dismiss the six cases before us. As the\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   appellants cogently observe, approving the approach taken by the District Courts and defended by the Appointed Amicus would be tantamount to giving the courts \"\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   to depart from the principle of party presentation basic to our adversary system,\" a result that the Supreme Court explicitly warned against in\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189545\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/463/#p470\">\n    566 U.S. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189545\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/463/#p470\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore conclude that when an entirely absent defendant has forfeited the FSIA terrorism exception's statute of limitations, the defense is excluded from the case and may not be raised by the court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . No viable institutional interests have been presented in these cases to justify the actions of the District Courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Remaining Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Because we find that the District Courts had no authority to act\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in these cases, we have no need to reach the parties' arguments concerning the courts' exercise of the discretion that they claimed, the timeliness of the complaints, or the denial of the\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' post-judgment motions. We also take no position on the merits of the six cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In addition, we need not address whether a district court would lack authority to raise a statute of limitations defense in an FSIA case in which the United States participates in the proceedings and asks the court to rule in favor of an absent foreign sovereign on statute of limitations grounds. Nor do we address whether the correct interpretation of the terrorism exception's timeliness provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b) and \u00a7 1083(c)(3) of the NDAA, is in fact as straightforward as the District Courts assumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgments of the District Courts, vacate the dismissals of the complaints, and remand the cases for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
