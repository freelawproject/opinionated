(\"CJ\") at gunpoint in his native Honduras and threatened to kill his family after he rejected recruitment attempts. CJ and his mother Maria then fled their homeland and sought asylum in the United States. Although finding CJ credible, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") denied his request for asylum and ordered him removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed CJ's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   CJ petitions for review, arguing, among other things, that the IJ erred by failing to recognize he was an at-risk child potentially eligible for relief as a Special Immigrant Juvenile (\"SIJ\") and to so advise him. Because we conclude that the IJ erroneously failed to advise CJ about his eligibility for SIJ status, we grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In June 2014, CJ and Maria were apprehended in Texas after entering the country without inspection. Because Maria was the subject of a prior removal order, separate removal proceedings were instituted against CJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At his initial hearing before an IJ in November 2014, CJ appeared with Maria but without counsel. When the IJ informed them that she would \"not appoint an attorney for [CJ]\" but that they had \"the right to find an attorney ... at [their] own expense,\" Maria said she did not \"have money to pay for an attorney\" but requested time to find one. Maria was unable to find counsel despite several continuances, and ultimately agreed to represent CJ herself. When Maria explained that CJ feared returning to Honduras \"because of the gangs,\" the IJ gave her an asylum application and questioned her about her son. In response to one question, Maria stated that CJ's father had left her long ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2015, Maria filed the asylum application on CJ's behalf. She also sought withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ accepted the application and set CJ's case for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At that hearing, CJ testified that gang members threatened to kill him and other family members on three occasions after he rejected recruitment attempts. On the third occasion, CJ was held at gunpoint and given one day to decide whether to join the gang; he and Maria then fled Honduras. CJ testified that it had been \"many years\" since he had any contact with his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The IJ expressly found CJ credible but denied his applications for relief from removal. On appeal to the BIA, now represented by counsel, CJ contended that the IJ had erred by failing to appoint counsel or advise him about SIJ status. The BIA dismissed the appeal, concluding that, although the IJ must \"inform the respondent of any apparent forms of relief from removal,\" CJ had not established eligibility for SIJ status. The BIA also found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider whether CJ had a constitutional right to appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A three-judge panel denied CJ's petition for review.\n   <em>\n    C.J.L.G. v.

Rather, it contends that SIJ status is not a form of relief from removal covered by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). That argument fails. A successful SIJ application plainly can lead to relief from removal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   6 USCIS Policy Manual, pt.

To adopt the government's position here would require a minor to complete all but the final step for SIJ status-seeking adjustment of status from the IJ-before triggering the IJ's duty to advise him of SIJ eligibility. This is a nonsensical approach. It would eviscerate the utility of advice by the IJ and substantially undermine the core purpose of the IJ's duty to advise-to inform a minor of rights and avenues of relief\n   <em>\n    of which he may not yet be aware\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To be sure, CJ's eventual ability to obtain SIJ status depended on future decisions by a state court and USCIS.

I would reach the fundamental question raised in this proceeding: whether the Fifth Amendment's guaranty of due process entitles children to appointed counsel in immigration proceedings.

Notably, the government already chooses to spend money on attorneys to prosecute children in removal proceedings. An attorney representing the government was present at all five of CJ's hearings in immigration court-and an earlier hearing for which the IJ had not provided CJ notice. At each hearing, there was a different government attorney. In other words, the government has chosen to spend money on multiple attorneys learning the case file of and prosecuting one immigrant child. Further still, the government continued to pour resources into arguing that CJ has no right to counsel in a BIA appeal, argument before a three-judge panel of this court, and argument before this en banc court, which, at the end of the day, corrects a due process violation that may have been prevented had CJ been provided counsel in immigration court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Providing counsel would be costly to the government, but the government already chooses to undertake similar costs here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would also lead to fairer, more accurate decisions-decisions that a broader public might view as more legitimate. The third factor in the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test therefore points both directions.

In CJ's case, for example, his physical liberty is at risk-not because of incarceration-but because of the death threat and other threats of violence made against him.

First, the statute requires that the petitioner \"\n   <em>\n    has been declared dependent on a juvenile court\n   </em>\n   located in the United States or whom\n   <em>\n    such a court\n   </em>\n   has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court located in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078794\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/894/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Here, at the time of his immigration hearing, CJ had not been declared a dependent by any court in the United States or placed in custody by any court. Indeed, he had not even commenced any such proceeding in any court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, the statute, requires that the juvenile's \"reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant's parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J)(i). If this statute is read to require a showing that reunification with neither parent is viable, then there was no possibility of CJ meeting the requirement. He has always been in his mother's custody and care. If the statute is read to require only a showing that reunification with one of two parents is not viable, then CJ could meet this requirement. However, he still could not have shown that any court had declared him a dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Third, the statute requires that \"the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to the grant of special immigrant juvenile status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(J). Although neither the statute nor the regulations provides much guidance on what is required for consent, the USCIS has promulgated a policy manual, which provides that before consenting, USCIS must review the juvenile court order to conclude that the request for SIJ classification is bona fide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIS Policy Manual, vol. 6, pt. J, ch. 2, D.5. (May 23, 2018);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054978\">\n    76 Fed. Reg. 54978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54985 (Sept. 6, 2011). The USCIS will not give its consent if the juvenile court order was sought primarily or solely to obtain an immigration benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIS Policy Manual, vol. 6, pt. J, ch. 2, D.5. Here, the record indicates that the alien's mother would seek to have CJ placed under her custody solely for the purpose of seeking SIJ status and adjustment of status to avoid deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The majority's application of the reasonable or plausible standard overlooks the statute's three requirements. First, the majority overlooks the requirement that to be eligible for SIJ status, a state court must have declared the applicant a dependent, and thus imposes an unreasonable burden on IJs. The majority tasks the IJ with predicting not whether it is plausible that were CJ to apply to a state court he might obtain relief, but whether it was \"reasonably possible at the time of CJ's hearing that he could obtain SIJ status.\" Maj. Op. at 627. But this would require that IJs have an intimate knowledge of state law. Moreover, in CJ's case-aside from immigration proceedings-there was no apparent need or reason for CJ to invoke any state's dependency proceedings as he was at all times in his mother's custody and care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Indeed, at the time of CJ's hearing before the IJ it was not clear whether California courts would consider a child's request for SIJ findings. It was not until\n   2018 that the California Supreme Court clarified that \"a conclusion that a proceeding is primarily motivated by a desire to secure SIJ findings is not a ground for declining to issue the findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Bianka M. v.

The state court's dependency determination is not controlling. Even after obtaining such an order, the alien must file a petition with the USCIS, and the Secretary of Homeland Security must consent to the grant of special immigrant juvenile status. As noted above, it is far from clear that the Secretary would give such consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the majority overlooks the fact that even after obtaining such consent, the alien must then seek relief from removal by applying for adjustment of status.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The alien is not eligible for such relief unless \"an immigrant visa is immediately available to [the petitioner] at the time his application is filed.\" The record does not show that an immigrant visa is available to CJ. And even then, the IJ must determine whether to grant relief as a matter of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In sum, the IJ was required to inform CJ only of his \"apparent eligibility to apply for any benefits enumerated in this chapter,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), \"at the time of the hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Velasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078794\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/894/#p895\">\n    629 F.3d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming that SIJ status is a \"benefit\" contemplated by this regulation, there was no such \"apparent eligibility\" at the time of the hearing here. CJ had not commenced any proceeding in a juvenile court, nor demonstrated any need or reason to do so. Nor was there any evidence indicating whether the Secretary of Homeland Security would consent to an application by CJ, or that a visa was immediately available. In sum, at the time of the hearing, CJ had no apparent eligibility for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The majority's empathy for CJ is understandable, but does not, in my mind, justify defining \"apparent eligibility\" so broadly as to require IJs to advise petitioners of potential avenues of relief for which they are not yet (and may never be) statutorily eligible.
