When jurisdiction was returned to the District Court in 2015 after an appeal to this Court and the United States Supreme Court, Hildebrand's sole remaining claim stagnated for three years. The docket idled until 2018, shortly after the death of Hildebrand's former supervisor, a key witness. At that point, the employer filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the suit. We will vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his complaint, Hildebrand alleges that the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office (the \"DA's Office\") had an established practice of targeting older detectives to force them out of their jobs. He avers that Chief Detective Dennis Logan, Assistant Chief Richard Ealing, and Director of Administration Dawn Botsford\n   engaged in purposeful, discriminatory behavior in the form of disparate treatment, retaliation, and \"trumped-up\" reasons to fire older detectives. Hildebrand's amended complaint details paragraph after paragraph of alleged insults. For the purposes of this appeal, we need only summarize these copious allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hildebrand was hired by the DA's Office in 2005, after fifteen years as an undercover narcotics detective with the City of Pittsburgh Police Department. He performed his job responsibilities satisfactorily and without incident for roughly four years. In 2009, Ealing was assigned as his new supervisor. From that time until his termination in February 2011, Hildebrand alleges he was subject to several forms of age-based discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, Hildebrand alleges that his supervisors and peers derided him with age-related insults. Among many other taunts, they called him \"an 'old man' who would never learn how to use a computer because of his age,\" App. 26, and stated that he had \"Alzheimer's and was too old to comprehend\" his orders, App. 27. Ealing either was the source of these insults or failed to stop them, including when Hildebrand submitted complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, Hildebrand alleges that his workload changed for the worse due to his age. He alleges that Ealing divided his responsibilities among younger investigators and assigned Hildebrand meaningless busywork that his younger peers did not have to perform. He further claims that he was deprived of overtime hours, counter to a tradition of assigning those hours to detectives with seniority, like Hildebrand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Third, Hildebrand claims that his supervisors subjected his work to heightened scrutiny, questioning him extensively about his cases in a way that the younger detectives were not questioned, and trumping up false disciplinary charges that were meant to create a paper trail to support his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eventually, Hildebrand was demoted from a narcotics-division detective to general investigations and was relocated to a space with no desk, no working computer, and no phone. When Hildebrand asked why, Ealing became combative and countered that neither he nor Chief Detective Logan had to answer any of the \"old son of a bitches [sic]\" questions. App. 34-35. Hildebrand alleges that Ealing told him that he had gotten rid of old detectives previously and he was doing the same to Hildebrand. Hildebrand further asserts that Ealing and Logan obstructed him from filing a grievance regarding his demotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2011, Hildebrand was suspended for five days without pay when Ealing and Logan accused him of committing several violations, including using a DA's Office vehicle for personal use without permission-something that younger detectives regularly did without repercussions. Hildebrand alleges that several of the other supposed violations \"never occurred.\" App. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hildebrand appealed his suspension to the Director of Administration, Dawn Botsford, who met with him for twenty minutes and did not allow him to present any evidence. A union meeting was held to vote on whether to grieve Hildebrand's suspension. Logan appeared at the meeting-allegedly only the second time in his career that he attended such a meeting-for the alleged purpose of \"intimidat[ing] any union members who supported Hildebrand.\" App. 44. The union voted not to appeal Hildebrand's suspension. Hildebrand was terminated in February 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hildebrand alleges the negative treatment continued after termination. He applied for payment for his unused sick days,\n   \"which was the practice of the [DA's Office],\" but was denied. App. 44. Hildebrand also alleges that Ealing tried to obstruct his application for a private investigator license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hildebrand filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC sent him a Determination and Right to Sue Notice. He then filed a complaint in the District Court against Allegheny County and the DA's Office, alleging violations of the ADEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , constitutional violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and several state law claims. The Defendants moved to dismiss Hildebrand's ADEA claim for timeliness and his constitutional and state law claims for inadequate pleading. The District Court granted the motion, Hildebrand appealed, and this Court affirmed the dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims and reversed as to the ADEA claim.\n   <em>\n    Hildebrand v.

Hildebrand filed a motion to stay the motion to dismiss \"until appellate proceedings [were] concluded,\" which was granted. App. 118.

Hildebrand did not follow up by filing a motion or making any other contact with the District Court. The DA's Office also did not follow up on its pending motion to dismiss. Only after the death of one of its key witnesses, Ealing, did the DA's Office file a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).

The District Court conjectured that, because Hildebrand was unemployed, it was \"implausible that [he] would not have at least inquired of his counsel over the last three years ... as to why his ADEA claim was not moving forward.\" App. 10. Hildebrand's unemployment and his likely desire to have his case resolved do not automatically indicate that he and his counsel discussed why his case had not proceeded. It is entirely possible that Hildebrand, a non-lawyer, was patiently awaiting the resolution of what he assumed were lengthy appeals. The court did not base its conclusion that Hildebrand knew about his counsel's delay on record evidence,\n   and instead, it resolved doubts about Hildebrand's personal involvement against a decision on the merits. Without record evidence supporting the notion that Hildebrand was personally responsible for the delay, the District Court should not have weighed this factor in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prejudice to the adversary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The District Court appropriately concluded that Ealing's death, which occurred near the end of the three-year hiatus, prejudiced the DA's Office.

Hildebrand's own allegations make it clear that Ealing was a key witness. Hildebrand argues that the contention that Ealing was at the center of his claims against the DA's Office is not supported by the pleadings. He points to several sources of evidence that he believes would enable the DA's Office to \"fully defend\" itself without Ealing's testimony: the testimony of Botsford and Logan, who were involved in Hildebrand's termination and allegedly worked with Ealing to force out older employees; witnesses who heard Ealing's alleged public insults; and written documentation from and testimony of witnesses to official meetings where Hildebrand attempted to file grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, even assuming all of that evidence exists and is available, several of Hildebrand's allegations involve interactions with Ealing alone. These include several instances where Ealing allegedly made age-based insults, reassigned Hildebrand's work responsibilities, and informed Hildebrand he was on a path toward termination due to his age. Ealing's death amounts to an irremediable loss of evidence. While other evidence may be available to the DA's Office, that evidence cannot replace Ealing for the purposes of preparing a full and complete trial strategy. The witnesses whom the parties rely on to fill the gaps will inevitably have dimmed memories from the delay. And, as the District Court points out, Ealing's death undermines the jury's opportunity to weigh the credibility of Hildebrand's accusations versus Ealing's demeanor and responses in open court. This prejudice to the DA's Office bears substantial weight in favor of dismissal, but it is not dispositive of the appropriateness of imposing the harshest sanction available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    History of dilatoriness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The District Court did not act outside its discretion in determining that the timeline-a\n   three-year hiatus in five and a half years of litigation-weighs in favor of dismissal.
