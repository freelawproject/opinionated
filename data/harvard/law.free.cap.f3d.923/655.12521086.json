We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Kaibab National Forest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Kaibab National Forest encompasses approximately 1.6 million acres of public land in northern Arizona, including Grand Canyon National Park. It is comprised of three noncontiguous Ranger Districts: the Williams Ranger District, the Tusayan Ranger District, and the North Kaibab Ranger District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Williams Ranger District is the southernmost, covering 560,305 acres approximately thirty-five miles west of Flagstaff and sixty miles south of Grand Canyon National Park. It includes the Kendrick Mountain Wilderness, which extends into Coconino National Forest and features a diverse array of vegetation including Douglas firs, white firs, ponderosa pines, and aspens. The Williams Ranger District also serves as a habitat for a number of endangered species, including the Mexican spotted owl, the California condor, and the black-footed ferret. It contains six areas where spotted owls are known to live and breed, and three spotted owl critical habitats overlap the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tusayan Ranger District, located just south of Grand Canyon National Park's south rim, encompasses 331,427 acres. It features varied terrain, from ponderosa pine forests to grasslands, and is home to a number of sensitive species, including bald eagles, goshawks, peregrine falcons, burrowing owls, bats, and voles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The North Kaibab Ranger District covers 655,078 acres immediately north of Grand Canyon National Park. Like the Williams and Tusayan Ranger Districts,\n   the North Kaibab Ranger District boasts diverse terrain and vegetation, as well as sensitive animal species. Two federally listed endangered species-the Mexican spotted owl and California condor-live in the District, which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated as critical habitat for the spotted owl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Travel Management Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2005, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgated a Travel Management Rule to \"provide[ ] for a system of National Forest System roads, National Forest System trails, and areas on National Forest System lands that are designated for motor vehicle use.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.50\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of this system, \"[d]esignated roads, trails, and areas [are] identified on a motor vehicle map,\" which also \"specif[ies] the classes of vehicles\" and \"the times of year for which use is designated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 212.56. Motor vehicle use is prohibited on roads not so designated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 212.50(a). The regulations include a specific provision concerning the use of motor vehicles for dispersed camping and big game retrieval, which allows that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   in designating routes, the responsible official may include in the designation the limited use of motor vehicles within a specified distance of certain forest roads or trails where motor vehicle use is allowed, and if appropriate within specified time periods, solely for the purposes of dispersed camping or retrieval of a downed big game animal by an individual who has legally taken that animal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 212.51(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Forest Service's Southwestern Regional Office issued guidelines for implementation of the Travel Management Rule, including its motorized big game retrieval provision. The guidelines noted that \"National Forests in the Southwestern Region provide hunting opportunities that are important to the public,\" and directed forests to identify designated routes for game retrieval \"in close collaboration with the responsible State agency.\" They also suggested, pursuant to discussions with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, that motorized big game retrieval be allowed \"up to three miles from a designated route\" for bison and \"up to one mile from a designated route\" for elk and mule deer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Forest Service crafted travel management plans for each of the three Ranger Districts in the Kaibab National Forest. It also prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for each plan to ascertain its environmental impact, but did not undertake a more rigorous Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Williams Ranger District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In July 2010, the Forest Service released the EA for the Williams Ranger District's travel management plan, and subsequently issued a Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact (DN/FONSI). The DN/FONSI generally \"prohibit[s] motorized travel off of designated routes on the Williams Ranger District,\" but permits \"the limited use of motor vehicles within one mile of all designated system roads (except where prohibited) to retrieve a legally hunted and tagged elk during all elk hunting seasons.\" It allows motorized big game retrieval of elk (but not bison) up to one mile off all designated open roads, so long as hunters make only \"[o]ne trip that uses [the] most direct route and\n   least ground disturbing.\" The designated open road system consists of 1,114 miles of roadway, a reduction from previous motor vehicle activity, when 1,460 miles of roads and 95 percent of the District were open to motor vehicle use. Several miles of the open roads pass through the spotted owl critical habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Tusayan Ranger District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Previously, the Tusayan Ranger District contained more than 700 miles of roads open to motor vehicles, and a vast majority of the District was open to cross-country motor vehicle travel. The Forest Service's final DN/FONSI for the District\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   designated 566 miles of road open to motor vehicles. The decision permits \"[l]egally harvested elk [to] be retrieved during all legal elk hunting seasons\" by motor vehicles within one mile of designated roads. Motorized retrieval of bison is not permitted, and the DN/FONSI limits use of motor vehicles when \"conditions are such that travel would cause damage to natural and/or cultural resources,\" and mandated that \"[m]otorized vehicles would not be permitted to cross riparian areas, streams and rivers except at hardened crossings or crossings with existing culverts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The North Kaibab Ranger District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to implementation of a new travel management plan, 1,852 miles of road in the North Kaibab Ranger District were open to motor vehicle use, with 83 percent of the District open to cross-county travel. In September 2012, the Forest Service released an EA analyzing the District's new plan. Among other data, the EA noted that while \"[c]ross-country motorized travel, whether to retrieve game or for other purposes, can adversely affect cultural resource sites if a vehicle is driven across a site,\" only thirty-eight bison and no elk were taken from the District in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Forest Service issued a DN/FONSI that designated 1,476 miles of open roads for motorized travel, including an additional 16 miles of unauthorized, user-created roads. Motor vehicles can be used to retrieve elk or bison during hunting seasons, under certain limiting conditions. Notably, the plan prohibits motorized retrieval of mule deer; the data indicated that far more mule deer-1,020-were harvested in the District in 2009 than bison or elk. The DN/FONSI also included guidance for monitoring and mitigation, as well as practices to limit the spread of invasive exotic weeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Districts' travel management plans-their motorized big game retrieval provisions in particular-were administratively appealed, and the Regional Forester upheld them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court. They challenged the travel management plans for each of the three Ranger Districts, alleging violations of the Travel Management Rule, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), NEPA, and the NHPA. After the parties filed and briefed cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted the Forest Service's motion and denied Plaintiffs' motion. It further denied the motions for summary judgment filed by Intervenors-Defendants-Appellees State of Arizona (the State) and\n   Safari Club International (Safari Club) as moot. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review de novo a district court's order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Churchill County v.

As part of this designation process, the Forest Service must consider various criteria, including \"public safety,\" \"conflicts among uses of National Forest System lands,\" and \"the need for maintenance and administration.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.55\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Forest Service violated the Travel Management Rule by permitting off-road motorized vehicle use to collect downed game within one mile of every open road in the Districts, in purported violation of the Rule's mandate that such activity be \"limited\" and only on \"certain\" roads. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Limited\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue that \"designating cross-country off-road motor vehicle use for one mile off both sides of every single open road on each Ranger District is not a 'limited' designation as contemplated by the Travel Management Rule.\" They note that the Forest Service's own regional office acknowledged as much when reviewing the North Kaibab Ranger District's plan proposal; the office commented, \"Motorized [big game retrieval] is being proposed on all system routes which is not consistent with rule for 'limited use.' \" The assistant NEPA coordinator of that District also questioned the scope of the plan, noting, \"What I don't see is how this got you to your proposed actions, particularly the [motorized big game retrieval] on ALL roads with 1 mile corridor .... that's huge.\" In their brief, Plaintiffs include maps prepared by the Forest Service, which illustrate the extent of areas (in light blue) where motorized big game retrieval is allowed in the Tusayan and Williams Ranger Districts. These maps indicate, as Plaintiffs argue, that the plans permit motorized big game retrieval across a vast swath of the Districts' lands:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As the district court correctly noted, however, Plaintiffs' focus on only the\n   <em>\n    spatial\n   </em>\n   limitation of the Districts' plans ignores the other restrictions on motorized big game retrieval. The North Kaibab Ranger District plan illustrates some of these additional limitations: restricting retrieval to legally hunted elk and bison\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; permitting only one vehicle per harvested animal; requiring hunters to \"use the most direct and least ground disturbing route in and out of the area to accomplish the retrieval\"; and limiting the temporal period to the \"appropriate season as designated by the [State], and for 24 hours following each season.\" The Williams and Tusayan Ranger Districts further exclude the retrieval of bison and require motor vehicles to cross streams and rivers only at designated crossings. We agree with the district court that \"these limitations are a significant departure from the previous\n   policy which did not limit the number of trips ..., did not limit the type of species which could be retrieved by motor vehicle, did not limit the distance traveled from system roads, and had no restrictions on seasons or weather conditions and no requirement for use of a direct route.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"the nearly unlimited spatial allowance ... in and of itself[ ] violates the plain terms of the Travel Management Rule,\" but provide no authority for that proposition. Because we find no support for it in either case law or the applicable regulations, we conclude that the Forest Service did not abuse its discretion when it authorized plans that limit motorized big game retrieval based on factors other than geography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As for the regional office's skepticism regarding the scope of retrieval permitted under the plans, \"the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious,\" as agencies are \"fully entitled\" to \"change[ ] their minds ... as long as the proper procedures were followed.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v.

The Districts' plans limit motorized big game retrieval as to timing, qualified species, and number of vehicles, which is a reasonable interpretation of the Rule. Given that much of the Districts' land was open to cross-country motorized travel prior to implementation of the plans, we conclude that the new restrictions constitute a \"limited\" use of motorized vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Certain\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Next, the Rule allows motorized retrieval on \"certain forest roads.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.51\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Plaintiffs argue that the word \"certain\" requires that it only be allowed on \"some, but not all\" roads. Because the plans permit retrieval within one mile of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   designated roads, Plaintiffs conclude that they are unlawful. The Forest Service, however, correctly notes that while the word \"certain\" can mean \"some, but not all,\" the more common definition of the term is \"definite\" or \"fixed.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   367 (2002) (listing the primary definitions of \"certain\" as \"fixed, settled, stated\" and \"exact, precise\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because the Forest Service limited motor vehicle use to a defined set of roads in each District, it complied with the Rule. Even if the proper interpretation of the word \"certain\" were ambiguous, the Forest Service's definition of \"fixed\" or \"definite\" is permissible, consistent with the text of the Rule, and entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p659\">\n    551 U.S. at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p659\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An agency's interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference 'unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Auer v.

They argue that \"allowing motorized big game retrieval off of every single open road is not using [the Forest Service's] authority sparingly,\" and that the Forest Service erroneously concluded that the plans were sparing and limited because they permitted less motorized retrieval than under the prior policies that imposed no restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. First, the word \"sparingly\" does not appear in the Rule, but instead in its preamble. We look to a preamble only when the regulation itself is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    El Comit\u00e9 Para El Bienestar de Earlimart v.

Accordingly, as the Forest Service correctly asserts, the preamble does not \"impose a duty above and beyond the actual terms of the regulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' argument fails for much the same reason as their \"limited\" argument above: it relies on a strictly spatial conception of \"sparingly,\" while ignoring the other restrictions that the plans impose on motorized big game retrieval. Absent authority requiring a strictly geographic interpretation of the words \"limited\" and \"sparingly,\" we conclude that the Forest Service did not violate the plain terms of the Travel Management Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It observes that Plaintiffs' \"standing declarant, Kim Crumbo, revealed that his own activities in the forests cause the very same impact that [they] seek to attribute to motorized big game retrieval,\" since Crumbo recounted \"incidents during which he, on his bicycle, interfered with young goshawk and a goshawk pursuing its prey.\" Accordingly, Safari Club suggests that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the redressability requirement for standing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salmon Spawning &amp; Recovery All. v.

This result would not only be absurd, but also contrary to our prior precedent, for we have held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   the mere existence of multiple causes of an injury does not defeat redressability, particularly for a procedural injury.

Asserting that Plaintiffs' \"goal in bringing this action was to use NEPA and the NHPA to force [the Forest Service] to reverse [its] authorization of motorized big game retrieval,\" it contends that \"NEPA does not provide a cause of action\" and that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing.

Those EAs noted that \"[t]he scientific literature documents a variety of negative effects of roads and motorized travel on wildlife,\" with\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [p]otential direct and indirect effects of roads and motorized travel on wildlife includ[ing] habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation caused by roads and\n   cross country motorized travel; roads can create barriers to movements of certain species; animals can be killed or injured as a result of being hit or run over by motor vehicles; human disturbance or harassment of animals caused by or facilitated by motorized travel; [and] shooting or harvest of animals facilitated by motor vehicle access to wildlife habitats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Williams Ranger District EA further indicated that off-road vehicle use \"in areas with sensitive or moist soils can create tracks, ruts and new user routes that may crush, displace, and/or destroy cultural materials (i.e. artifacts, features, traditionally used plants), and damage significant information that may contribute to our understanding of history.\" A particularly vexatious problem related to motorized vehicle use is the spread of invasive weeds. Each of the three EAs noted that vehicles are a common cause of weed introduction and spread, with the North Kaibab Ranger District EA reporting that \"[t]he authorization of motorized big game retrieval will have an increased threat of invasive species spread as every vehicle that travels cross-country has the ability to serve as a vector and create disturbance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We do not disagree with Plaintiffs' assertion that motorized big game retrieval can have a negative effect on the environment. But we nevertheless conclude that the environmental impacts discussed in the EAs did not raise substantial concerns that necessitated the preparation of EISs. Plaintiffs might disagree with the Forest Service's\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   conclusions, but we see no indication that the agency failed to satisfy NEPA's\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   requirements-a crucial distinction that is lost in Plaintiffs' formulation of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs' treatment of the spread of invasive weeds is illustrative. They tie the problem of weeds to another enumerated NEPA consideration that implicates \"[u]nique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1508.27(b)(3). They note that \"both the North Kaibab and Tusayan Ranger Districts immediately abut Grand Canyon National Park.\" The EAs agreed: they described Grand Canyon National Park as \"internationally important,\" and noted the Tusayan Ranger District's \"unique location\" as \"a gateway to one of the most famous national parks in the country.\" In that District's EA, the Forest Service acknowledged that recreation and hunting-activities facilitated by the travel management plan-\"have the potential to introduce exotic plants\" that \"may then spread to adjoining lands, including the Grand Canyon National Park.\" The National Park Service, in a letter from the Acting Park Superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park, advised the Forest Service to \"institute a buffer zone of 1-mile along the park boundary for any purpose including big-game retrieval, fuel-wood gathering, cross-county travel, etc.,\" due to \"increased pressure from motorized vehicles at or near the southern park boundary over the past several years\"-a recommendation that was not adopted in the Tusayan Ranger District DN/FONSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Clearly, the EAs demonstrated that motorized big game retrieval risks the spread of invasive weeds, an undeniable environmental impact. In response, the Forest Service relies in part on questionable reasoning by focusing on the fact that the\n   plans\n   <em>\n    reduced\n   </em>\n   negative impacts when compared with pre-plan activity. It notes that the plan eventually selected for the Tusayan Ranger District opted to limit the number of roads open to the public, which, the EA noted, \"reduces the number of opportunities for noxious and invasive exotic weeds to be introduced and spread.\" \"Thus,\" the Forest Service concludes, \"contrary to [Plaintiffs'] argument, the Tusayan EA confirms that the Forest Service considered the issue and reasonably concluded that the decision will reduce, not increase, the spread of exotic plants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, a conclusion, even a correct one, that a given action might reduce a potential impact does not alone indicate that the impact would not be significant. We have noted that the use of baselines is a helpful, and perhaps inevitable, tool in conducting environmental surveys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Or. Nat. Desert Ass'n v.

But we have also determined that \"simply because the Final Rule may be an improvement over the [previous] standard does not necessarily mean that it will not have a 'significant effect' on the environment\" where the agency \"has not explained\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   its rule will not have a significant effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

The plans chosen by the Forest Service might reduce (even substantially reduce) the spread of noxious weeds in the Districts, but that alone does not address whether that\n   <em>\n    reduced impact itself\n   </em>\n   has a significant impact on the environment generally and Grand Canyon National Park in particular. Therefore, the Forest Service cannot rely solely on the reduction of adverse impacts to demonstrate that those impacts are not significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But that the Forest Service occasionally conflates\n   <em>\n    reduction\n   </em>\n   with\n   <em>\n    insignificance\n   </em>\n   does not necessarily mean that it violated NEPA. To demonstrate, we once again go into the weeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Forest Service acknowledged that the North Kaibab Ranger District contained \"several species of invasive weeds,\" which \"are spread [ ] via roads and forest visitors.\" The plan that was eventually selected \"reduce[d] the number of roads that can be traveled on by 376 miles,\" which, the EA found, would \"lower the amount of invasive species seed introduced or spread.\" But notably, the EA continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The authorization of motorized big game retrieval will have an increased threat of invasive species spread as every vehicle that travels cross-country has the ability to serve as a vector and create disturbance. Alternative 2 [the selected plan] authorizes motorized big game retrieval for only elk and mule deer. This is expected to lead to only a small increase in the potential for invasive species spread and disturbance when compared to Alternative 3 and should not generate any realistic impacts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This passage demonstrates that the Forest Service did not merely rely on the possibility of reduction, but also concluded that the plan would \"not generate any realistic impacts\"; in other words, that the effects would not be significant. Furthermore, as the district court noted, the EA mentioned that the North Kaibab Ranger District featured \"projects focus[ed] on treating known infestations across the District, prioritizing the species and locations that pose the greatest threats,\" methods that had \"proven successful in eradicating or reducing potentially serious noxious species\n   threats.\" This language indicates that the Forest Service acknowledged a potential environmental impact, and then determined that, due to features of the travel management plan and other remediation efforts, it was unlikely to be significant. Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, the Forest Service did not merely determine that the problem would be reduced; it also concluded that the impact would not be significant. Plaintiffs disagree with the EA's conclusion, but this is \"a classic example of a factual dispute the resolution of which implicates substantial agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   , 490 U.S. at 376,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605417\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/360/#p371\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the district court: \"Plaintiffs' singular and conclusory statement that exotic plants might spread ... does not raise substantial questions that would trigger the need for an EIS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Similarly, although the Forest Service did not follow all of the recommendations made by Grand Canyon National Park's Acting Park Superintendent, this fact does not mean that it ignored a significant environmental impact.

Here, the record indicates that the Forest Service explained why a buffer would not be employed (\"We don't expect to use a buffer zone as many management actions will need to extend to the Forest Service-National Park boundary\"), and further articulated means of remedying the risk of illegal motor vehicle use (such as \"limit[ing] motorized big game retrieval during all elk seasons\" and \"work[ing] closely with Arizona Game and Fish Department to monitor and enforce illegal cross-country travel associated with hunting activities\"). We find no indication in the record that the Forest Service did not adequately consider potential impacts, or that substantial questions remained that required the preparation of an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The same conclusion ultimately applies to all of the environmental impacts that Plaintiffs highlight in their briefs: although Plaintiffs disagree with the EAs' factual conclusions, the Forest Service nonetheless considered the issues, gave them the requisite \"hard look,\" and thus fulfilled their NEPA obligations.\n   <em>\n    Save the Yaak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546434\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/714/#p717\">\n    840 F.2d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There may have been opposition to the plans, but mere opposition alone is insufficient to support a finding of controversy.

Plaintiffs identity nothing in the record to suggest that the Forest Service's estimates were unduly speculative, or that it unreasonably relied upon these predictions. Plaintiffs also argue that there was \"uncertainty regarding whether or not hunters will actually remove gut piles\" when retrieving carcasses,\n   which they must do \"to protect California condors from lead poisoning.\" But although the Forest Service acknowledged that this issue might present a problem, the record also indicates that it considered the issue and reasonably concluded that it was unlikely to significantly impact the North Kaibab Ranger District's condors because the Arizona Game and Fish Department had provided to hunters, among other incentives, lead-free ammunition.

Threatened Species\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, there is the issue of the Mexican spotted owl, a threatened species found in the Williams and North Kaibab Ranger Districts. The Forest Service must consider \"[t]he degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9). Plaintiffs point to portions of the record that raise the specter of adverse effects-including consultation letters between the Williams and North Kaibab Ranger Districts and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the owls-but they again ignore the Forest Service's overall conclusions. For example, the Williams Ranger District EA reported that some roads would pass through Mexican spotted owl critical habitats, which might result in \"increased potential human disturbance.\" But the EA ultimately concluded that the selected plan would be \"primarily beneficial,\" and would \"not adversely affect Mexican spotted owl or Mexican spotted owl designated Critical Habitat.\" In a separate biological assessment, the Forest Service concluded that \"[t]he effects determination for Mexican spotted owl and Mexican spotted owl critical habitat is\n   <em>\n    may affect, not likely to adversely affect\n   </em>\n   ,\" based on the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   determination [ ] that potential effects of the proposed action on the Mexican spotted owl would be primarily beneficial. Closing roads and restricting motorized cross-country travel under the proposed action would result in reduced motorized access to spotted owl habitat compared to current management and thus reduced risk of human disturbance to spotted owls, reduced impacts to habitat of spotted owls and their small mammal prey species, and reduced impacts to designated critical habitat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Notably, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurred in this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In short, although the Forest Service did not definitively conclude that no Mexican spotted owls would be adversely affected by the Districts' travel management plans, the record indicates that they sufficiently considered the issue and arrived at a reasonable conclusion that the effects would not be significant, thus obviating the need for an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Summation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the end, we conclude that the Forest Service's determination that no EISs were needed as to the Districts' travel management plans was reasonable. The plans might have some precedential effect, there is a possibility that Mexican spotted owls might be affected, and exotic weeds might be spread by motorized big game retrieval, but the record ultimately supports the Forest Service's conclusion that these concerns do not rise to the level of significance that would require EISs. The Forest Service gave the requisite hard look and made determinations that were neither arbitrary nor capricious, and were consistent with the evidence before it.

The First Amended Programmatic Agreement Regarding Historic Property Protection and Responsibilities (Programmatic Agreement), which the parties agree provided the relevant guidelines, mandated that\n   \"[t]he level of need and extent of new field surveys or inspections will be proposed by a Professional Cultural Resource Specialist and approved by the Forest Archaeologist based on the guidelines provided in this section.\" Those guidelines included the use of \"relevant information to assess the potential to affect historic properties and the expected nature and distribution of heritage properties that may be affected\"; namely, \"[t]he expected nature and severity of all associated impacts\" and \"[t]he expected nature and distribution of heritage resources.\" Based on the results of this \"prefield research,\" the Resource Specialist and Forest Archeologist were directed to \"determine the relative level of field survey to be conducted.\" The Programmatic Agreement called for \"100% surveys\" where \"site density is expected to be high\" and where \"site densities are unknown and expected visitor use or impacts will be high.\" By contrast, \"areas may be surveyed at less than 100%\" where \"known site density is low.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Here, the record supports the Forest Service's conclusion that the Programmatic Agreement did not require 100 percent surveys. At the time the travel management plans were decided, the Forest Service had surveyed 42 percent of the Williams Ranger District, 23 percent of the Tusayan Ranger District, and 25 percent of the North Kaibab Ranger District. It concluded that no further surveying was required, based on the expected density of cultural resources and the nature and severity of impacts upon them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The record reinforces the determination that the expected impacts of the travel management plans would be low. After considering historic hunting data, the EAs concluded that less than 0.1 percent of each District's acreage would be impacted by motorized big game retrieval. However, the fact that \"[t]he expected nature and severity of all associated impacts\" might have been low does not necessarily mean that the Forest Service did not need to conduct 100 percent surveys, for the Programmatic Agreement required 100 percent surveys for high-density sites regardless of impact level. Accordingly, the Forest Service's obligation rested on \"[t]he expected nature and distribution of heritage resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The record is somewhat unclear as to the density of heritage resources in the areas open to motorized big game retrieval. Plaintiffs note that many of the Districts' cultural resources are close to the roads, but that does not necessarily speak to the\n   <em>\n    density\n   </em>\n   of resources because the Programmatic Agreement does not provide any benchmark or guidance as to what constitutes a high-density site. Ultimately, the lack of clarity weighs in the Forest Service's favor: it was not unreasonable for it to determine that the density was low or unknown, either of which would have excused 100 percent surveys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Forest Service followed a reasonable interpretation of the Programmatic Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exemption Q\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Programmatic Agreement's Exemption Q provided that \"[a]ctivities not involving ground or surface disturbance (e.g., timber stand improvement and precommercial thinning by hand)\" are \"exempt from further review and consultation.\" Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service arbitrarily relied on Exemption Q to\n   excuse review of motorized big game retrieval in the Williams and Tusayan Ranger Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Once again, however, the record does not support Plaintiffs' assertions. We agree with Plaintiffs that invoking Exemption Q would have been inappropriate here. It is clear, and the Forest Service does not dispute, that motorized travel causes surface disturbance. But although the Forest Service's correspondence with non-party Center for Biological Diversity\n   <em>\n    suggested\n   </em>\n   that it applied Exemption Q,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the record as a whole supports a contrary conclusion. The Forest Service consulted with both the Arizona SHPO and potentially affected tribes as to each District's travel management plan-consultations that would not have been required if Exemption Q had been applied. Moreover, the Forest Service made no other references to Exemption Q as part of the travel management plan decision process, which further supports the conclusion that it was not in fact invoked. Accordingly, the references to Exemption Q at most amounted to harmless error, as they had no effect on the NHPA consultation process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the court to take \"due account ... of the rule of prejudicial error\" when conducting APA review);\n   <em>\n    Tucson Herpetological Soc'y v.

But to buttress this assertion, Plaintiffs again cherry pick isolated segments from the record without considering their broader context. For example, the Cultural Resources Specialist Report prepared for the North Kaibab Ranger District noted that \"[c]ross country motorized travel, whether to retrieve game or for other purposes, can adversely affect cultural resource\n   sites if a vehicle is driven across a site,\" since \"[v]ehicles can [ ] crush or displace artifacts and features impacting the physical integrity of the site and impairing or destroying scientific information that may contribute to the understanding of the history and prehistory of an area.\" But that same report also concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Quantifying the potential for damage from big game retrieval is difficult. The results vary depending on the number of game retrieval trips annually, the location of those retrievals (high site probability areas versus low probability), site types found in the area, soil characteristics, routes used to access the game and weather conditions at the time of retrieval. However, the fewer number of motorized trips that occur, the lower the likelihood of encountering and impacting a site. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Limiting cross-country travel will have a beneficial effect on cultural resources by reducing the potential for sites to be damaged.\n   </em>\n   This alternative would restrict motorized big game retrieval to elk and bison. In 2009, 38 buffalo and no elk were taken .... While there is a possibility that cross-country game retrieval of either of these species could impact a cultural resource site, given the low number of takes each year, it is anticipated that the potential for adverse effects to a site would be negligible: 38 entries per year equates to less than .0099% of the acreage on the NKRD.\n   <em>\n    The odds of adversely affecting a cultural resource site under these conditions are extremely low.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   (emphases added). In light of this ultimate conclusion, as well as the implementation of the suggested mitigation measures, it was not arbitrary for the Forest Service to conclude, based on the evidence before it, that adverse effects were unlikely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Even if cultural resources might be harmed as a result of motorized big game retrieval, that fact alone does not indicate that the Forest Service violated the NHPA.

In crafting the plans, the Forest Service investigated potential impacts on both the environment and historic properties and reasonably determined that no further action was needed. Accordingly, we conclude that the Forest Service followed the Travel Management Rule and fulfilled its procedural obligations\n   under NEPA and the NHPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The Rule's antecedents include executive orders issued by Presidents Nixon and Carter that sought to limit the damage to federal public lands caused by off-road vehicles.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Utah Shared Access All. v.
