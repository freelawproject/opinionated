Because the FEC is comprised of three Democratic appointees and three Republican appointees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30106(a)(1), FECA thus requires that all actions by the Commission occur on a bipartisan basis. The statute does not instruct how to handle a \"deadlock vote,\" that is, a vote in which three members wish to proceed on a given enforcement action and three oppose such action. This situation, as one might expect, occurs with some frequency. We and the FEC have, however, provided guidance. The FEC has said that if \"the Commission lacks majority support for proceeding with a matter,\" \"the Commission will dismiss\" it as an \"exercise of its prosecutorial discretion.\" Statement of Policy Regarding Commission Action in Matters at the Initial Stage in the Enforcement Process,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C545\">\n    72 Fed. Reg. 12,545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,546 (Mar. 16, 2007). As for us, because the initial deadlock triggered this dismissal, we review-and treat as controlling-the rationale offered by the Commissioners who voted not to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Common Cause v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544001,4333797\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/842/436/\">\n    842 F.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The majority opinion here added one more parameter: deadlock votes premised on prosecutorial discretion are insulated from judicial review, with limited exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. FEC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517235\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/434/#p438\">\n    892 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438-42, 440 n.9, 441 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Given FECA's silence on deadlocks, it is no surprise that the statute also does not instruct how to differentiate between a deadlock vote that prompts a dismissal and a vote by four or more Commissioners to dismiss the action outright. Should we treat a deadlock-then-dismissal and an outright dismissal by four or more Commissioners differently, even when both rest on identical \"prosecutorial discretion\" grounds? The purposes underlying FECA would suggest as much, as the fourth vote-necessarily from a Commissioner who crossed party lines-makes us less worried about partisan gamesmanship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030106\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (c) ;\n   <em>\n    FEC v.

To that end, the majority's opinion, which indicates that when three Commissioners invoke \"prosecutorial discretion\" they foreclose both the FEC enforcement action and our review of the decision not to\n   proceed, certainly seems contrary to Congress's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Then again, nothing in FECA provides an easy way to distinguish these two types of dismissals. Maybe, in keeping with FECA's bipartisan emphasis and the FEC's guidance, only four or more Commissioners may invoke \"prosecutorial discretion\" to dismiss a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEC,\n   <em>\n    Guidebook for Complainants and Respondents on the FEC Enforcement Process\n   </em>\n   12 (May 2012), http://fec.gov/em/respondent_guide.pdf (\"Pursuant to an exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, the Commission may dismiss a matter when, in the opinion of\n   <em>\n    at least four Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , the matter does not merit further use of Commission resources.\" (emphasis added)). Or maybe any Commissioner can invoke this reasoning, but it is only unreviewable pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Heckler v. Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n    470 U.S. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), when articulated by four or more. But even assuming this kind of rationale is reviewable in some instances, the scope and content of that review remains unclear. Is it unlimited? Cabined to situations in which the Commissioners incorrectly interpret and apply FECA? Or perhaps this is just a hole in the statutory scheme that only Congress can fill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While these questions are important, this is not the case to decide them. There is a factual dispute over whether the three Commissioners who voted not to proceed even made a legal decision. Neither party argued before the panel that decisions rooted in prosecutorial discretion are insulated from our review; indeed, the FEC conceded that \"Commission decisions not to prosecute ... remain subject to judicial review.\" FEC Br. 27. Nor is it clear how a rule articulated in this context might play out elsewhere. What if the Commission split 3-3, refused to dismiss the case, and 120 days later, the petitioner brought suit in this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A). What standard applies? Or what if we are faced with a deadlock-then-dismissal and the three naysayers explain that because a violation occurred but the statute of limitations is about to expire, they exercised their prosecutorial discretion not to proceed. Can we review this exercise of prosecutorial discretion premised on a legal determination?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517235\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/434/#p438\">\n    892 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   441 n.11, 441-42 (leaving open the possibility that \"if the Commission declines to bring an enforcement action on the basis of its interpretation of FECA, the Commission's decision is subject to judicial review\" but noting that we may not \"carv[e] reviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-reviewable actions\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is unlikely that a future case will implicate-or answer-all of these concerns. But I hope that in the right case, with adequate briefing from interested parties, we can better grapple with these questions and the consequences of a potential holding. Perhaps at that time, we will need to reconsider the majority's holding en banc; perhaps not. For now, however, we have before us only these issues, briefs, and parties. And on this record, I do not think rehearing en banc is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pillard, Circuit Judge, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Who pays for the messages we hear about candidates for federal office? Federal election law gives the public a right to know. But today we let stand a divided panel decision that effectively scuttles that law. Congress established the Federal Election Commission at the front line of campaign finance law enforcement. To avoid agency capture, it made the Commission partisan balanced, allowing no more than three of the six Commissioners to belong to the same political party. That balance created a risk of partisan reluctance\n   to apply the law, so Congress provided for judicial review of non-enforcement, and citizen suits to press plausible claims the Commission abandons. But the decision we leave in place today eliminates those legal checks against enforcement-shirking. It empowers any partisan bloc of the Commission to cut off investigation and stymie review of even the most serious violations of federal campaign finance law by uttering \"magic words\" of enforcement discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The panel majority held that the Commission's refusal-by-deadlock to investigate a complaint against a claimed political committee, the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity (CHGO), was an exercise of \"unreviewable prosecutorial discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Washington v. FEC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517235\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/434/#p438\">\n    892 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 (D.C. Cir. 2018). That broad holding is sufficiently wrong and important that it warrants\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review. The majority opinion contravenes the statute and binding precedent, undercuts the design Congress devised to avoid both partisan domination and partisan deadlock in the Commission's enforcement process, and has already been applied by the Commission and district court to truncate other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) invites \"any person\" to file a complaint with the Commission (FEC or Commission), and provides that the Commission \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   make an investigation\" of any complaint supported by \"reason to believe\" that the statute is violated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (emphasis added). It further provides that \"any party aggrieved\" by an order dismissing a complaint, or by a failure of the Commission to act on a complaint within 120 days, \"may file a petition\" for judicial review by this court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(A). If the court holds that \"the dismissal of the complaint or the failure to act is contrary to law,\" the Commission has 30 days to conform, failing which the complainant may file a civil action to remedy the alleged violation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 30109(a)(8)(C). In\n   <em>\n    Orloski v. FEC\n   </em>\n   , we held that a \"decision is 'contrary to law' if (1) the FEC dismissed the complaint as a result of an impermissible interpretation of the Act, or (2) if the FEC's dismissal of the complaint, under a permissible interpretation of the statute, was arbitrary or capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596210,3609511\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/156/\">\n    795 F.2d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If a partisan bloc of the FEC can thwart a case like this one, FECA's controls on campaign money, including the political-committee registration and disclosure requirements here, are not worth much. CHGO sprang into existence in 2010 as the brainchild of political operatives. Internally and to potential donors it described its mission as collecting money to spend on federal campaigns while making sure that donor names would be kept secret. The group falsely claimed tax-exempt status, raised and spent millions of dollars to influence campaigns, and never registered as a political committee or reported its contributors or spending. When it learned of an FEC complaint by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), CHGO responded with evasion and dissimulation and, by early 2012, scurried to dissolve itself. The FEC's Office of General Counsel concluded that CHGO easily met the FECA threshold for political-committee status and recommended three times that the Commission find \"reason to believe\" that CHGO was an unregistered political committee-a preliminary finding that would have authorized a full investigation. The Commissioners persistently deadlocked. CREW filed in federal court claiming the blocking Commissioners' position was contrary to law. I believe the law entitled CREW to a judicial ruling on that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the panel majority's view, however, three out of six Commissioners have peremptory enforcement discretion to block investigation of a complaint and cut off judicial review, even where there may be ample \"reason to believe\" that FECA was violated. It held that the blocking Commissioners' mere assertion of discretion-invoking concerns like the best use of agency resources and an expiring statute of limitations-eliminates our review to determine whether the asserted discretion was itself \"contrary to law.\" And it treated an invocation of discretion as a shield against review of the blocking Commissioners'\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -discretionary errors as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under settled precedent, the Commission's enforcement discretion cannot block review of legal errors. That means that courts may review the kinds of errors CREW points to in the blocking Commissioners' conclusions about the statute of limitations and their own equitable enforcement powers against a dissolving CHGO, on which the blocking Commissioners purported to rest their discretion. Appellant's Br. 44-45. And courts may review errors CREW identifies in the grounds those Commissioners gave for refusing to investigate CHGO as a possible \"political committee\" in the face of direct admissions and circumstantial evidence of its \"major purpose\" to win Senate seats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. The panel majority's contrary holding conflicts with the statute's terms, structure, and purpose; with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    FEC v.

I would have done so here, despite some questions about the way the petition was framed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Concurring Op. 1144-45. The panel's significant disregard of circuit precedent calls for prompt correction. In the meantime, to the extent the majority opinion conflicts with earlier decisions, it is not binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Our district courts and future panels must continue to follow precedent the panel would sweep aside, including\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DCCC\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Orloski\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Given the contrary message of the panel majority, embraced by the blocking Commissioners and at least one district court, it is worth pinpointing how the majority errs. In brief, it defies settled law in two ways: First, it holds that dismissals based on the FEC's exercises of enforcement discretion are entirely beyond our review-a position contrary to FECA's express terms and judicial precedent. And, second, it deems any invocation of enforcement discretion, even when accompanied by reasons that are contrary to law, sufficient to shield those legal defects from review. Together, those holdings allow a non-majority of Commissioners to insulate any decision from the judicial review that FECA provides, just by invoking \"prosecutorial discretion.\" The majority errs in a third way by treating a deadlock in the statutorily required vote\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   as a vote of \"no reason to believe\" FECA was violated, subject to judicial review as such, but as an operative (and unreviewable, it says) exercise of enforcement discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the interest of clarity, let me spell out these three points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the majority held that the presumption in\n   <em>\n    Heckler v.

Likewise, however, if an agency justifies a reviewable action with a discretionary reason-as the blocking Commissioners purported to do here-the action itself does not thereby become unreviewable. \"[J]udicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs. v.

In the deadlock under review in\n   <em>\n    CREW/New Models\n   </em>\n   , the blocking Commissioners conducted extensive legal analysis explaining why they believed the group at issue was not a \"political committee,\" in part because they thought it lacked a \"major purpose\" of nominating or electing candidates for federal elections.

The district court read our opinion to mean that case \"beg[an] and end[ed] with the Controlling Commissioners' prosecutorial discretion,\" even though \"the Controlling Commissioners' decision at issue [t]here involved a robust interpretation of statutory text and case law, with a brief mention of prosecutorial discretion sprinkled in.\"\n   <em>\n    CREW/New Models\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ---- - ----.

Reh'g En Banc 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the majority made another significant misstep on a point our circuit has not yet squarely addressed, but which also warrants resolution: It treated a deadlock at the reason-to-believe stage as an exercise of enforcement discretion, while FECA requires at least four Commissioners to concur for their enforcement discretion to be operative as such. This matters because, as we have recognized, the Act contemplates some engagement with the merits of the questions on which the Commission votes. The statute forces that engagement by making the discretionary exit ramp accessible only to a bloc of at least four Commissioners. The majority requirement is in the Act, and its application to dismissing a case in an exercise of discretion at the reason-to-believe stage is spelled out in Commission guidance. The statute recognizes a \"vote to dismiss,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and says that \"[a]ll decisions of the Commission with respect to the exercise of its duties and powers under the provisions of this Act shall be made by a majority vote of the members of the Commission,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30106(c). When presented with a General Counsel recommendation, the Commissioners vote on whether there is or is not reason to believe that a violation may have occurred. Alternatively, \"[p]ursuant to an exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, the Commission may dismiss a matter,\" but only when, \"in the opinion of\n   <em>\n    at least four Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , the matter does not merit further use of Commission resources.\" FEC,\n   <em>\n    Guidebook for Complainants and Respondents on the FEC Enforcement Process\n   </em>\n   12 (May 2012) (emphasis added), https://transition.fec.gov/em/respondent_guide.pdf. If a complaint passes through all the prescribed checkpoints, from a reason-to-believe vote to a probable-cause vote, together with conciliation efforts at one or both stages, the statute only then confers discretion on fewer than four members to halt the case. It provides that \"the Commission\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , upon an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, institute a civil action for relief,\" meaning that three may decide not to move forward with a civil action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A) (emphasis added). As FECA frames it, if the Commission is evenly divided at\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   stage, there is no review. But this case stalled at the earlier, reason-to-believe stage, and only three voted \"no\" on that question, so that action was not operative as an exercise of the Commission's enforcement discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FECA's effectiveness depends on the FEC's duty to engage with complaints. Congress created the Commission to correct for underenforcement of campaign finance laws, even as it sought to curb potential partisan excesses by channeling citizen complaints to the FEC as the first arbiter. Several authorities have implicitly or expressly recognized that duty. The\n   Supreme Court has described the complaint system as \"ask[ing] the FEC to find [whether a respondent] ... had violated the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/\">\n    524 U.S. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, we said that \"it would be easy to establish\" that agency action refusing to process a potentially meritorious case \"was contrary to law; the Commission's refusal to enforce would be based not on a dispute over the meaning or applicability of the rule's clear terms, but on the Commission's unwillingness to enforce its own rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411234,5708707\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/69/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If three Commissioners could vote \"no\" at the reason-to-believe stage on grounds of prosecutorial discretion, there would be little to check \"the Commission's unwillingness to enforce its own rule,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., even if the panel decision's other errors were corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Giving a non-majority of Commissioners enforcement discretion removes an institutional check on political deadlock that Congress wrote into FECA. The power of a\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of Commissioners to dismiss a complaint at the reason-to-believe stage as an exercise of enforcement discretion does not implicate the same concern about partisan underenforcement. Requiring four Commissioners to agree to discretionary dismissals keeps complaints from being jettisoned by a partisan bloc: The Commission's structure means that a vote of four or more Commissioners is necessarily bipartisan; if a three-member \"no\" vote cannot be justified on the merits, a court can call on the Commission to either move forward with its investigation or cede enforcement to a private party. Non-majority discretion to block action is fatal to FECA if that enforcement discretion is-as the panel would have it-both judicially unreviewable, and effective in shielding all other grounds from review. I fear that FEC Chair (then-Vice Chair) Weintraub did not exaggerate when she described the panel decision as giving the Commission \"a superpower ... to kill any FEC enforcement matter, wholly immune from judicial review.\" FEC,\n   <em>\n    Statement of Vice Chair Ellen L. Weintraub on the D.C. Circuit's Decision in\n   </em>\n   CREW v. FEC 1 (June 22, 2018), https://go.usa.gov/xmWC2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    CREW/New Models\n   </em>\n   provides a stark illustration of that superpower. As Chair Weintraub said about that case, \"that 139th footnote was all that mattered. They literally could have skipped everything before and after it and the statement would be equally bulletproof under\" the majority opinion. FEC,\n   <em>\n    Statement of Chair Ellen L. Weintraub on the D.C. District Court Decision in\n   </em>\n   CREW v. FEC (New Models) 3 (Apr. 15, 2019), https://go.usa.gov/xmWC4. The district court itself described the law it applied as a \" 'magic words' standard,\" noting that it was \"sympathetic to Plaintiffs' concerns\" about such a standard.\n   <em>\n    CREW/New Models\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----. But it concluded that, per the panel decision in this case, \"because the Controlling Commissioners invoked prosecutorial discretion, the Court is also foreclosed from evaluating the Controlling Commissioners' otherwise reviewable interpretations of statutory text and case law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411234,5708707\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/69/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----. If such an invocation does bar evaluation of the Commissioners' legal conclusions, it guts the case-by-case approach the FEC has adopted for determining when groups qualify as \"political committees.\" The Commission has declined to define \"political committee\" by rule, choosing instead a \"fact-intensive\" inquiry into each group's \"overall conduct.\" Political Committee Status,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%205%2C595\">\n    72 Fed. Reg. 5,595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5,601 -02, 5,597 (Feb. 7, 2007). If it needs neither\n   promulgate rules nor adjudicate the merits of individual cases, any partisan, non-majority bloc of the Commission can indefinitely avoid developing law defining political committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   FECA cannot be interpreted to, in effect, invite any three-member bloc of the Commission to refuse to consider complaints, free from the judicial scrutiny Congress wrote into the statute. I understand my colleagues' hesitation to review this case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   given that some of the strongest arguments that the blocking Commissioners acted contrary to law did not appear in the briefs, and that CREW's panel briefs were not entirely consistent with its petition for rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. 26 (asserting that \"the FEC d[ id] not reach the merits but dismisse[d] based on its prosecutorial discretion\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pet. Reh'g En Banc 2-3 (describing the Commissioners as making a \"decision that there was no reason to believe CHGO violated the FECA ... based on their interpretation of the law\"). But other important issues at stake in this case were unbriefed simply because the parties could not anticipate that the majority would adopt a novel position that no party advanced. I would not wait for a perfect case to come along to correct the majority's interpretation.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
