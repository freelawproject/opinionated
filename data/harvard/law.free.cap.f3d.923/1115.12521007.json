The court believed that\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   's full import as a departure from laxer standards was \"appreciated\" only after\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   issued in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

On the one hand, in light of in-circuit cases elaborating on the \"at-home\" doctrine pre-\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   -and defense counsel's arguments on behalf of PA/PLO in other suits-there is some force to plaintiffs' argument that defendants' delay was unjustifiable. But a few points are dispositive in favor of defendants' view. First, as a general matter, a district court has leeway \"always\" to \"reconsider[ ]\" interlocutory orders not subject to the law of the case doctrine \"prior to final judgment.\" \"[S]o long as the court has jurisdiction over an action, it should have complete power over interlocutory orders made therein and should be able to revise them when it is consonant with equity to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Langevine v.

Second, the court properly gave weight to the uncertainty in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   , so clearly reflected in the passage quoted above from a leading treatise on procedure. Third, the court plausibly concluded that plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the timing of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To be sure, under some circumstances we would be swayed by plaintiffs' argument that they have been prejudiced by the delay in the defendants'\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   motion-coupled with their reasonable\n   reliance on the district court's finding of general personal jurisdiction and the closure of fact discovery. But here, as we'll develop later in this opinion, plaintiffs have been unable to make a showing that discovery on their specific jurisdiction theory could have yielded evidence to support a finding of specific jurisdiction, and there is no sign that the district court relied at all on the \"closure\" of discovery in deciding to deny plaintiffs' motion for further discovery to explore facts relevant to specific jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our approach is in keeping with\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v. Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173689\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/958/\">\n    843 F.3d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 963-65 (D.C. Cir. 2016). There we affirmed the district court's decision under Rule 12(h)(1) that the PA/PLO had waived a constitutional personal jurisdiction defense that had been \"available\" because they had altogether failed to raise it in their 2002 pre-answer motion. The delay argument pressed here is quite different from the 12(h)(1) issue in\n   <em>\n    Gilmore\n   </em>\n   ; defendants here asserted constitutional personal jurisdictional defenses in 2006 and 2007 on the basis of insufficient \"minimum contacts\" with the forum in advance of filing their answer in May 2008. See Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction 3 (May 30, 2006), ECF No. 55 ; see also Answer 2 (May 2, 2008), ECF No. 86 ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Klieman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775920\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/107/#p113\">\n    467 F.

So defendants essentially proceeded as\n   <em>\n    Gilmore\n   </em>\n   's holding would have envisaged-on the basis of defenses \"available\" at the time of their pre-answer filings. In\n   <em>\n    Gilmore\n   </em>\n   we didn't pass on the district court's alternative theory of forfeiture based on acquiescence in the court's jurisdiction.

They offered a hypothesis building on these elements: First, the PA/PLO supported acts of terrorism during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s, targeting Israelis and areas frequented by Americans. Second, they pursued this terrorist program in part with the goal of advancing their \"campaign in the United States to influence or affect United States foreign policy as it related to Israel and the Palestinian territories,\" Klieman Br. 32; see also\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 42, 43, carrying on the campaign through the use of U.S. offices, fundraising, lobbying, speaking engagements, as well as commercial dealings,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 32. Third, as an integral part of this blended strategy of terrorism and diplomacy, they facilitated the killing of Esther Klieman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The first two elements may at first blush seem counterintuitive, but their logic is basically that a spate of terrorism claiming American (and Israeli) lives could impel U.S. policymakers to urge their Israeli counterparts to make concessions to defendants in exchange for their exerting their influence to halt, or attenuate, the attacks. For example, they quote a PA/PLO representative explaining on U.S. national television in 2002 that-in order for Palestinian suicide bombings to abate-the U.S. Secretary of State should prevail on Israel's prime minister to reduce Israeli troop levels and settler presence in contested areas, for, \"if the occupation continues ... no one can stop the Palestinians.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 43; see also Reply Br. 22 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The basic theme here appears reasonable and seems to possess historical support.

Rather, our\n   focus is on the third element of plaintiffs' theory-the alleged link between the overall strategy and the killing of Esther Klieman. Plaintiffs have not alleged tangible facts as to how\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   attack was intended (or even used\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   ) to further defendants' political aims in the United States.

But the distinction doesn't help plaintiffs on the facts presented. After all, they have alleged no facts indicating that the attack on an Israeli bus in the West Bank was directed at locales with a strong presence of U.S. nationals-either in the form of high-level planning or the individual attackers' motives. To the extent the attackers had-unbeknownst to them-chosen as their target a bus traveling through such a locale, the resulting \"random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts\" with the forum are insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   .

We analyze the record on the factual predicates as an extension of plaintiffs' prima face case for personal jurisdiction, asking whether plaintiffs have put forward plausible allegations that meet any of the factual predicates for implied consent under \u00a7 4.

No. 1773566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs demur as to both subsections (A) and (B) of \u00a7 (e)(1). We ultimately find, in keeping with the view of the United States, that plaintiffs have failed to offer plausible allegations that any of the factual predicates of ATCA \u00a7 4 has been met or to offer credible grounds to support their requested remand for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Foreign assistance and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 4(e)(1)(A)\n   </em>\n   . The PA/PLO offered its December 26, 2018, letter to the State Department as conclusively rejecting aid covered by ATCA. Plaintiffs say that the letter \"merely expresses a 'wish' to no longer receive\" relevant forms of assistance. Klieman Supp. Br. 7 (Mar. 13, 2019), Dkt. No. 1777379. Hardly. The letter is quite emphatic: \"The Government of Palestine unambiguously makes the choice not to accept such assistance.\" U.S. Response,\n   Exhibit 1, Letter at 2. And the State Department and Department of Justice readily discerned its meaning. See U.S. Response 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs refer to certain \"debt relief grant agreements with the PA\" dating to 2015 and 2016, Klieman Supp. Br. 7-8, which were indeed provided under the Economic Support Fund covered by \u00a7 4(e)(1)(A)(i), see\n   <em>\n    Foreign Assistance: U.S. Assistance for the West Bank and Gaza, Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016\n   </em>\n   , Gov't Accountability Office (Aug. 2018), https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693823.pdf. But plaintiffs (1) fail to allege that any such forms of debt relief have persisted after January 31, 2019; and (2) do not grapple with the PA/PLO's renunciation of all relevant funding sources. Because we lack credible allegations that debt relief grants are currently being provided to PA/PLO, its instrumentalities, or creditors as of February 1, 2019-or that any of these \"accept\" such relief-plaintiffs' mere allusions to past examples and hypothesizing their continuation or renewal is not enough to warrant a remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The same goes for plaintiffs' references to funding for non-governmental organizations. See Klieman Supp. Br. 8. Plaintiffs rely on a Congressional Research Service report from 2011, which is unconvincing as to February 2019. Second, a gap remains in plaintiffs' analysis. Section 4(e)(1)(A) requires that defendants \"accept\" the relevant aid, yet plaintiffs allude only to payments to non-governmental organizations. Although such assistance might constitute a \"form of assistance, however provided\" to\n   <em>\n    PA/PLO\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs offer nothing to establish that link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, nothing in the papers before us suggests that if granted an opportunity for discovery on remand plaintiffs would be able, in spite of the government's denial, to unearth sources of funding that continue to flow to the PA/PLO post-January 31, 2019, and come within \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Benefiting from a waiver or suspension and maintaining or establishing an office, headquarters, etc.; \u00a7 4(e)(1)(B).\n   </em>\n   Subsection (B) sets out two necessary but individually insufficient conditions for deeming a defendant to have consented to personal jurisdiction. (1) The defendant must maintain or establish, etc., \"any office, headquarters, premises, or other facilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the United States.\" (2) The defendant must be \"benefiting from a waiver or suspension of section 1003.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the second requirement is dispositive against the plaintiffs we address the first requirement only enough to give an idea of the context within which the \"waiver\" is to be examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Activities allegedly triggering implied consent if defendant is \"benefiting from a waiver or suspension of section 1003.\"\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' strongest argument centers on activities carried out by defendants under the auspices of the U.N. Permanent Observer Mission in New York. They do not dispute the Second Circuit's holding that the ATA-and, accordingly, \u00a7 1003-do not apply to defendants' U.N. Mission as such. See\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer v. S.N.C, Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave Achille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521606\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/44/#p46\">\n    937 F.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (2d Cir. 1991). Rather, plaintiffs allege that various activities carried out by personnel of the Mission go beyond the legal shield afforded by the exclusion of the Mission itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   reasons that \"only those activities not conducted in furtherance of the PLO's observer status may properly be considered as a basis of jurisdiction,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521606\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/44/#p46\">\n    937 F.2d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and offers some examples. The court mentions \"proselytizing and fundraising activities,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 52, including those of the then-Permanent Representative\n   of the PLO Zuhdi Labib Terzi, who had \"spok[en] in public and to the media in New York in support of the PLO's cause\" \"[e]very month or two,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . (quoting district court opinion). On remand, the district court found various activities to exceed the shelter accorded the U.N. Mission, including Dr. Terzi's speeches and the Mission's generation of \"informational materials\" and distribution of them \"to those seeking information about the PLO.\"\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave Achille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405401\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/795/112/#p114\">\n    795 F. Supp. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). Plaintiffs here rely on rather similar promotional activities; for example, Dr. Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer for Palestine at the U.N., gave speeches well beyond New York itself, to wit, in Orlando, Florida. See Klieman Supp. Br. 7; see also\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Exhibit 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Even if we were to assume arguendo that the line drawn by the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   is correct and that the activities of the U.N. Mission in fact ranged beyond that line, plaintiffs have not (as discussed below) shown that defendants have been \"benefiting from a waiver or suspension,\" as required for an inference of consent to suit triggered by ATCA \u00a7 4(e)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    \"[B]enefiting from a waiver or suspension.\"\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs do not and cannot claim an\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   waiver or suspension. The PLO shuttered its D.C. office as of October 10, 2018, after the State Department declined to extend its \u00a7 1003 waiver. See U.S. Response 5-6; see also\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Exhibits 3-5. And the New York U.N. Mission operates without a waiver precisely because it isn't subject to the ATA. As the government has stated, \"[t]here is no waiver of section 1003 currently in effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In fact it appears correct to interpret the phrase \"waiver or suspension\" in (B) as referring solely to an express waiver under \u00a7 1003(3), as the government assumes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For legal authority to issue periodic waivers to the PLO, the State Department has relied on annual State Department appropriations bills. See U.S. Response, Exhibits 3-4. For example, the 2017 letter in Exhibit 3 invokes \u00a7 7041(j)(2)(B)(i) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%202242\">\n    129 Stat. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2780 (2015), which says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The President may waive the provisions of section 1003 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 ( Public Law 100-204 ) if the President determines and\n   <em>\n    certifies in writing\n   </em>\n   to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the appropriate congressional committees that the Palestinians have not, after the date of enactment of this Act [either (1) taken certain steps at the U.N. or (2) taken certain actions vis-\u00e0-vis the International Criminal Court] (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The natural reading then, of \"waiver or suspension\" in \u00a7 (e)(1)(B), is the sort of formal exercise of power plainly contemplated in this statute setting forth the waiver procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs point to nothing that could either qualify as or substitute for the formal waiver or suspension evidently required. They point instead, see Klieman Supp. Br. 3, to: (1) an agency's \"constructive\" waiver of a deadline by accepting payments after that deadline,\n   <em>\n    Morris Commc'ns, Inc. v.

The relevance of items (1)-(3) is remote at best. As to (4), plaintiffs' statement that \"Congress certainly knows how to specify 'written waivers' when it wishes, and\n   <em>\n    did not do so here\n   </em>\n   ,\" Klieman Supp. Br. 3 (emphasis added), appears to neglect the actual language of the legal authorization to issue waivers under \u00a7 1003, namely the one quoted above, which creates legal consequences when the President \"certifies in writing\" that a waiver is to be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs would equate government \"failure to prosecute\" allegedly excessive propaganda activities with provision of a waiver or suspension. Klieman Supp. Br. 5. But the statute permits no such equation. ATCA \u00a7 4 is triggered by a\n   <em>\n    waiver\n   </em>\n   of \u00a7 1003-not its\n   <em>\n    violation\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the predicate for making defendants' U.N. activities legally material under ATCA \u00a7 4 has not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We affirm the decision of the district court in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Citations to ECF Numbers are to the district court docket in\n    <em>\n     Estate of Klieman v.
