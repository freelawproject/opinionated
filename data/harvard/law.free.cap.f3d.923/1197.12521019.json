In that motion, Orona argued that his 2007 aggravated assault conviction no longer qualified as a violent felony under ACCA's residual clause, in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and could not qualify as a violent felony under ACCA's force clause, in light of\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   .

While one may, in theory, actively employ\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   in an accidental manner, it is much less natural say to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by accident. Thus, a person would \"use ... physical force against\" another when pushing him; however, we would not ordinarily say a person \"use[s] ... physical force against\" another by stumbling and falling into him. ... The key phrase in \u00a7 16(a) -the \"use ... of physical force against the person or property of another\"-most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p6\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p6\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal citations omitted).
