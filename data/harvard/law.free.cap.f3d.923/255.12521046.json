Luceus claimed that the Department's promotion practices have a disparate impact on minority employees, and that the Department has declined to promote her because she is black. The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants, from which Luceus appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any\n   material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Title VII bars the use of facially neutral \" 'employment practices that cause[ ] a disparate impact on the basis of race' unless those practices are justified by business necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309478\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/38/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k) ). Luceus alleges that the Department's use of \"three-day-rule assignments\" as a first step leading to promotion of lower-level employees at the call center has a disparate impact on minority employees. A three-day-rule assignment is a temporary appointment made by the Department to fill a vacant position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department, however, sometimes makes such appointments permanent. Luceus alleges that three-day-rule assignments are awarded more often to white employees than minority employees, and that white employees thus are more likely to receive permanent promotions. The record shows that between 2009 and September 2014 (when she first complained to the Department's human resources office), only one minority employee received a three-day-rule assignment, as compared with seven white employees. Luceus also provides affidavits from eight coworkers who attest that minority employees are less likely to receive three-day-rule assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This evidence, however, is not enough by itself to make a prima facie showing of disparate impact. Except in unusual cases of overwhelming evidence, intuition is not to be trusted, and in order to reach the required prima facie threshold a plaintiff ordinarily must demonstrate that there is \"a significant statistical disparity\" between the employment outcomes for white and non-white employees.\n   <em>\n    Ricci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeStefano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p587\">\n    557 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p587\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p587\">\n    174 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

Indeed, she has not even presented reliable data on which a statistical conclusion would rest, because she has not established the racial composition of the pools of employees eligible for three-day-rule assignments in the instances she cites. Hence, the District Court explained that\n   the record does not indicate \"the number of management-ready minority and white union members\" at the call center where Luceus works.\n   <em>\n    Luceus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201626263\">\n    2018 WL 1626263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D.R.I.

This \"fail[ure] to provide important information regarding the pool of applicants\" is a critical \"flaw[ ] in the statistical evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

Using the data she provided, they presented expert analysis demonstrating that there was \"no statistically significant evidence of a disparate impact\" stemming from the three-day-rule assignments that were the subject of Luceus's complaint. Affidavit of Dr. Craig Lawson Moore \u00b6\u00b6 47-49. Luceus offers no comparable rebuttal of this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In sum, based on the record, we conclude that this is not a case in which Luceus can show a disparate impact in the absence of statistical and statistically significant evidence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steamship Clerks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410203\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/594/#p606\">\n    48 F.3d at 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the outset, Luceus must establish a prima facie case by showing that (1) she is \"a member of a protected class\"; (2) she is \"qualified\" for the job she seeks; (3) she has \"suffer[ed] an adverse employment action at the hands of her employer\"; and (4) there is \"some evidence of a causal connection between her membership in a protected class and the adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bhatti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Trustees of Boston U.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049955\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/64/#p70\">\n    659 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (1st Cir. 2011).
