Although the documents from the 2015 removal proceedings identify the person removed as \"Mario Ruvalcaba-Garcia AKA Macias-Garcia, Juan,\" the documents are all signed with the name \"Juan Macias-Garcia\" or the initials \"JMG.\" Ruvalcaba's primary defense to the illegal-reentry charge was that the government could not prove that he was the person removed in 2015. Among the 2015 removal documents, however, was a Verification of Removal form that contained not only a signature but also a photograph and a fingerprint of the removed individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before trial, the government produced an expert report by David Beers, a fingerprint analyst, who would testify that the fingerprint on the 2015 Verification of Removal matched a fingerprint he had taken from Ruvalcaba. At a pretrial motions\n   hearing, Ruvalcaba requested an opportunity to challenge the admissibility of Beers's expert testimony. Although the district court had previously admitted Beers as an expert in several other cases, Ruvalcaba wanted to take \"a crack at it.\" The court agreed and explained that, after the government laid the foundation for Beers to testify as an expert, Ruvalcaba would be permitted to question him about \"the foundation of his expertise, before we get to his ultimate opinion, if we do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case proceeded to trial. The government introduced into evidence a copy of the 2015 Verification of Removal, but the quality of the copy was quite poor and the photograph and fingerprint were nearly indiscernible. The government then called Beers to testify about his fingerprint analysis. The parties questioned Beers about his qualifications and methodology, with Ruvalcaba noting at the outset that he was \"doing this with an eye towards Daubert.\" Beers testified that he had worked as an FBI fingerprint technician and instructor for 33 years, reviewing more than 300,000 fingerprints and testifying as an expert more than 200 times. He had never \"not been qualified [in any proceeding] as an expert in fingerprints.\" He uses \"the Henry system of classification and identification,\" which he described as the prevailing fingerprinting methodology that analyzes fingerprints according to unique points of identification. On cross-examination, Beers testified that he had not taken continuing education courses in fingerprint analysis, and he confirmed that was he not a member of the International Association for Identification (\"IAI\") or the Scientific Working Group on Friction Ridge Analysis, Study, and Technology (\"SWGFAST\"). He also acknowledged that he did not strictly follow the \"ACE-V\" method of fingerprint analysis, which is endorsed by SWGFAST and stands for analysis, comparison, evaluation, and verification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655409\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/480/#p484\">\n    704 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484-85 (7th Cir. 2013) (describing the ACE-V method). Although Beers followed the \"ACE\" part of the method, he did not have another fingerprint technician independently verify his conclusions. Nor did he know how many points of identification he used to match Ruvalcaba's fingerprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of his cross-examination, Ruvalcaba \"object[ed] to the admission of Mr. Beers as an expert in this case.\" After some additional questioning, the court overruled Ruvalcaba's objection, stating: \"I find that there's a basis for Mr. Beers to offer an opinion on the basis of his fingerprint comparison in this case.\" At the same time, the court instructed the jury that Beers's testimony should \"be judged like other testimony\" and given \"as much weight as you think it deserves, taking into consideration the witness' education, the witness' experience, the reasons given for the opinion and all of the other evidence in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beers went on to testify that, in his opinion, the fingerprint he took from Ruvalcaba matched the fingerprint on the 2015 Verification of Removal. He acknowledged, however, that the copy presented in court was \"so diminished\" that he \"wouldn't be able to make an identification off of that.\" The government also presented additional evidence from other witnesses but stressed during closing arguments that Beers was \"important because he tells you that ... the fingerprint on the document is the defendant's fingerprint.\" The jury was unable to reach a verdict, and the court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ruvalcaba was retried a week later. This time, Beers annotated the fingerprint on the 2015 Verification of Removal to identify six matching points of identification, and the government made an enlarged copy of the annotated fingerprint for Beers to use while he testified. As in the first trial, the government first questioned Beers about\n   his qualifications and methodology. After eliciting testimony that largely tracked that presented in the first trial, the government \"move[d] to have Mr. Beers qualified as an expert fingerprint technician.\" The court responded, \"That's a determination for the jury.\" Ruvalcaba then cross-examined Beers, again establishing that he was not a member of IAI or SWGFAST and that, although he followed the \"ACE\" part of the ACE-V method-which is simply \"a verbalization of what fingerprint technicians have been doing for over a hundred years\"-he did not have another analyst independently verify his conclusions. Once Ruvalcaba finished his cross-examination, the government again \"move[d] to qualify [Beers] as an expert,\" and the court responded, \"Again, that's an issue for the jury.\" Ruvalcaba then \"object[ed] to the qualifying\" of Beers \"as an expert.\" The court overruled the objection and instructed the jury: \"[I]t's up to you to decide whether the witness by virtue of his experience and training is qualified to give opinions and give his testimony whatever weight you think it deserves in light of that testimony, the reasons given for the opinion, all other evidence in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Beers then testified about his fingerprint analysis in this case, now with the help of the annotated and enlarged fingerprint from the 2015 Verification of Removal. After the government presented additional witnesses and evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The district court sentenced Ruvalcaba to five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Ruvalcaba challenges the admission of Beers's expert testimony, arguing that the district court impermissibly abdicated its \"gatekeeping\" role under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and Federal Rule of Evidence 702.

The only evidence presented by Ruvalcaba to undermine the reliability of Beers's testimony falls far short.
