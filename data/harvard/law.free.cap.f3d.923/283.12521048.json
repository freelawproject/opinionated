When the government has broad discretion to take a benefit away from its employees, that benefit is not a constitutionally protected property interest. New Jersey's Civil Service Commission offered Claudio Tundo and Ruben Gilgorri such a benefit. After they were laid off from their jobs as corrections officers, the Commission put them on its rehire lists so they could be considered for rehiring. But it had broad discretion to take them off those lists, and it later did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tundo and Gilgorri reasonably expected that they would stay on these lists forever. But the Commission has many ways to take anyone off its lists. And it neither promised that they would stay on the lists nor constrained its discretion to remove them. Because there was no mutually explicit understanding that they would stay on the lists, Tundo and Gilgorri had no protected property interest in doing so. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. New Jersey's civil-service regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The New Jersey Administrative Code sets the rules and procedures for rehiring former employees. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 4A:4-4.8 (2019). And the Code empowers the Commission to handle various civil-service employment matters. It lets the Commission set up different categories of rehire lists of former employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 4A:4-3.4(a)(4), 4A:4-5.5(b). Employees on the \"special\" rehire list get considered for employment ahead of those on other rehire lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 4A:4-3.7(a)(1), 4A:8-2.3(b)(1). And they \"shall be placed\" on\n   that list \"for an unlimited duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A:8-2.3(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   But the Commission can remove employees from all types of lists-special or not-for many reasons. These include the obvious reasons, like having a criminal record, refusing to accept reappointment, or not following the instructions for staying on the lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A:4-4.7(a)(3)-(4), (6). The Commission can also take employees off the lists for \"[l]ack[ing] the job requirements,\" being \"physically or psychologically unfit\" for the job, having bad employment history, or any \"[\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ther sufficient reasons\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A:4-6.1(a)(1), (3), (7), (9) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    accord id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A:4-4.7(a)(1). Finally, it can remove employees for \"[\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ther valid reasons\n   </em>\n   as determined by the [Commission].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A:4-4.7(a)(1), (11) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Passaic County Sheriff's Office hired Tundo and Gilgorri as corrections officers on a trial basis. But they were poor employees: they were often absent from work and were reprimanded many times for insubordination and incompetence. So they were fired as part of a mass layoff even before they had completed their twelve-month trial period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But that was not the end of their road. Less than six months later, Passaic County needed more employees. So it asked the Commission to create lists of former officers whom it might rehire. And the Commission included both Tundo and Gilgorri on the lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties dispute what type of list they were on: Tundo and Gilgorri claim that the Commission put them on \"special\" rehire lists. But Passaic County argues that the Commission labeled those lists as \"revived\" lists-not special lists. App. 925-26. New Jersey law supports Passaic County's reading: it allows only former \"permanent employee[s]\" to be on a special list. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 4A:8-2.3(a). The two were never permanent employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Either way, Passaic County and the Commission soon found themselves at odds. After the Commission issued its rehire lists, Passaic County tried to remove Tundo and Gilgorri from the lists based on their work and disciplinary history. But the Commission blocked this attempt and restored Tundo and Gilgorri to the eligible list. And it ordered Passaic County to place them in \"a new 12-month working test period.\" App. 952.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Passaic County then offered to rehire the two and asked them to complete a re-employment application. This application asked them to agree not to sue Passaic County. But they did not like this, so they refused to complete the application. The Commission then removed them from the list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   They responded with this lawsuit. The District Court eventually disposed of all their claims, including a Section 1983 procedural-due-process claim.\n   <em>\n    Tundo v. Passaic Cty.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-5062,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20734663\">\n    2018 WL 734663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 2018). They appeal the grant of summary judgment against them only on that claim, contesting the court's holding that they did not have a protected property interest in staying on the rehire list. So on appeal, just one issue remains: do former civil-service employees in New Jersey have a property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment in staying on rehire lists?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

TUNDO AND GILGORRI HAVE NO PROTECTED PROPERTY INTEREST IN STAYING ON THE REHIRE LISTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Tundo and Gilgorri argue that they had a protected property interest in staying on the rehire lists. But former employees have no constitutionally protected property interest in a benefit if the government has broad discretion to deny that benefit, unless it constrains that discretion. This is true even if the former employees had a reasonable expectation that the benefit would not disappear. Here, the Commission had significant discretion to take former employees off its rehire lists, and it never suggested that it would constrain itself. So it did not create a protected property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. A protected property interest requires a mutually explicit understanding, not just a reasonable expectation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment forbids deprivations of an individual's \"property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend.

We recognized the teacher's property interest in remaining on the list because her school district had an explicit policy of keeping teachers on the lists for two to four years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41753\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/122/#p126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41753\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/122/#p126\">\n    at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And a school official had told her that she would stay on the list for four years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41753\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/122/#p126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tundo and Gilgorri argue that this case is like\n   <em>\n    Stana\n   </em>\n   . They claim that, because they were on the special rehire lists, New Jersey promised to consider rehiring them \"for an unlimited duration.\" N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 4A:8-2.3(c). And they claim that this promise, like the school district's in\n   <em>\n    Stana\n   </em>\n   , created a protected interest in staying on the rehire lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But they miss the mark. Even if we assume that they were on the special rehire lists, the Commission could have removed them for the same reasons that it could have removed them from other lists. As mentioned, the Commission has broad discretion to remove anyone from its lists. The school district in\n   <em>\n    Stana\n   </em>\n   did not. The only way the school district could have removed Stana from its hire list was if she failed to provide information about her present status.\n   <em>\n    Stana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41753\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/122/#p126\">\n    775 F.2d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And unlike in\n   <em>\n    Stana\n   </em>\n   , the Commission made no representation to Tundo and Gilgorri that limited its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if Tundo's and Gilgorri's expectation of a property interest in the rehire lists were reasonable, it would have been unilateral. The Commission promised them no permanent placement on the rehire lists. And it retained broad discretion to remove them. A promise that can be revoked at any time for almost any reason is no promise at all. So they had no protected property interest in remaining on the rehire lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Absent a property interest, the other due-process considerations are irrelevant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Tundo and Gilgorri spill much ink complaining that they received no notice of removal or opportunity to be heard. But whether they received due process matters only if they had a constitutionally protected interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p332\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). We hold here that they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   And they explain at great length that their conduct did not meet any of the criteria for removal. But these considerations are also irrelevant. A plaintiff first has to show a protected interest before he can dispute the government's power to deny it. A protected interest could attach to a benefit no matter how improperly an employee behaved. But good behavior does not itself create a protected interest. Here, their conduct was relevant only to whether they met any of the valid criteria for removal under New Jersey's Code. That question is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There can be no mutually explicit understanding to create a protected property interest in a benefit if the government has broad discretion to deny that benefit. This is true even if an employee unilaterally and reasonably expects to keep this benefit indefinitely. There is no genuine dispute about whether Tundo and Gilgorri had a cognizable property interest in staying on the rehire list. They did not, so we will affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
