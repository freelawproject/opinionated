The protestors were topless, except for opaque black tape covering their nipples. A month later, the City Council enacted a stricter indecent exposure ordinance. FTN sued the City to overturn it. In March 2016, the City repealed the September 2015 ordinance and replaced it with this ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (a) No person shall engage in or commit any act of indecent exposure or conduct in place open to public view.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (b) \"Indecent exposure or conduct\" shall include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) The exposure of the male or female genitals, pubic area, or the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the areola and nipple, or the showing of the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) Exceptions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) This section shall not prohibit performances of adult entertainment in compliance with section 10-7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) This section shall not regulate nudity when the conduct of being nude cannot constitutionally be prohibited by this section because it is otherwise protected by the United States Constitution or Missouri Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) This section shall not prohibit a mother from breast-feeding her child or expressing breast milk in any public or private location where the mother and child are otherwise authorized to be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   FTN filed an amended complaint, asserting constitutional claims against both ordinances. The parties then agreed to a consent judgment on all counts relating to the September 2015 ordinance. The only remaining claim is FTN's challenge to the March 2016 ordinance. It claims that the ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating men and women differently-prohibiting women, but not men, from exposing their areolas and nipples in public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   FTN and the City moved for summary judgment on the equal protection challenge.

First, the ordinance\n   here does not contain an exception for children under the age of 12 like the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Ways\n   </em>\n   . Second, the ordinance here exempts adult entertainment. FTN contends that this weakens the City's interests. Third, unlike\n   <em>\n    Ways\n   </em>\n   , FTN produced evidence suggesting there is no real difference between male and female nipples and that gender stereotypes motivated the discriminatory treatment. These arguments are unpersuasive. The City regulates adult entertainment in a separate ordinance. It still has an interest in regulating nudity in public places. This court's equal protection analysis in\n   <em>\n    Ways\n   </em>\n   did not turn on the exceptions in the ordinance or the evidence (or lack thereof) produced by the parties about the similarities or differences between men and women's breasts.
