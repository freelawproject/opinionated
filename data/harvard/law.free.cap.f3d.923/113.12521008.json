Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this appeal, we must determine whether certain restrictive covenants, which high-performing employees enter into as a condition of a stock award, constitute an impermissible restraint on trade under New Jersey law. We conclude that these restrictive covenants are not unenforceable in their entirety because they serve a legitimate business interest, but they may place an undue hardship on employees because they are overbroad. Accordingly, we will remand for the District Court to consider whether and to what extent it is necessary to curtail the restrictive covenants' scope, which is the approach prescribed by the New Jersey Supreme Court when confronted with overbroad restrictive covenants such as these.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ADP, LLC (ADP) is a human capital management company that sells technology products and services related to payroll, human resources, benefits, talent management and recruiting to customers worldwide. ADP imposes restrictive covenants on its sales employees\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in two layers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first layer, which applies to all employees and includes a Sales Representative Agreement (SRA) and a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) entered into at the time of hire, is a condition of employment at ADP. The SRA and NDA prohibit ADP employees from, among other things, soliciting any ADP \"clients, bona fide prospective clients or marketing partners of businesses of [ADP] with which the Employee was involved or exposed\" for one year after termination. Rafferty JA 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second layer functions differently. High-performing ADP employees who meet their sales targets are eligible to participate in a stock-option award program, but only if they agree to an additional restrictive covenant known as the Restrictive Covenant Agreement (RCA). Participation by eligible employees in the stock option program, in other words, is voluntary but conditioned on their assent to the terms of the RCA. ADP does not attempt to impose the RCA on other employees or in circumstances outside of the stock award program. It is not imposed, for instance, as a condition of initial or continued employment or in connection with other employment milestones such as a promotion or transfer. Nor does it entitle ADP employees to any employment benefits beyond the compensation of the stock option award itself, such as more or different training or access to proprietary information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The RCA is undisputedly more onerous than the SRA and NDA, and makes it more difficult for former employees bound by its restrictions to compete with ADP upon their separation from the company. Specifically, the RCA contains a strengthened non-solicitation provision (Non-Solicitation Provision), which prohibits employees-for a period of one year following their termination (voluntary or involuntary)-from soliciting any ADP clients to whom ADP \"provides,\" \"has provided\" or \"reasonably expects\" to provide business within the two-year period following the employee's termination from ADP. Rafferty JA 78. Thus, unlike the SRA, which only prohibits solicitation of those ADP clients with whom the former employees \"w[ere] involved or exposed,\" Rafferty JA 42, the RCA also prohibits solicitation of all current\n   <em>\n    and prospective\n   </em>\n   ADP clients. And while the SRA limits former employees' solicitation of ADP's \"marketing partners,\" Rafferty JA 42, the RCA prevents former employees from soliciting ADP's \"Business Partners,\" which is defined to include \"referral partners\" in addition to \"marketing partners,\" Rafferty JA 76, 78.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The RCA also contains a non-compete provision that is absent from the SRA and NDA (Non-Compete Provision): For a period of one year following their termination, employees will not \"participate in any manner with a Competing Business anywhere in the Territory where doing so will require [them] to [either] provide the same or substantially similar services to a Competing Business as those which [they] provided to ADP while employed,\" or \"use or disclose ADP's Confidential Information or trade secrets.\" Rafferty JA 78. The term \"Territory\" is defined as the \"geographic area\" where the employee worked\n   or had contact with ADP clients in the two years prior to her termination. Rafferty JA 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellees Nicole Rafferty and Kristi Mork are both former employees of ADP who, shortly after voluntarily leaving ADP, began working at Ultimate Software Group (Ultimate), a direct competitor of ADP. Rafferty and Mork each signed the SRA and NDA at the outset of their employment in Boston and Chicago, respectively, and each were eligible for and accepted restricted stock awards pursuant to the RCA over several consecutive years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After ADP learned that each of Appellees joined Ultimate upon leaving, it filed a motion for preliminary injunction against each of Rafferty and Mork in the District of New Jersey, seeking enforcement of the SRA, NDA, and RCA, and alleging breach of contract, breach of duty of loyalty, and unfair competition. Their cases were consolidated only for purposes of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    District Court Proceedings in\n    <em>\n     ADP v. Rafferty\n    </em>\n    (No. 18-cv-1922)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In ADP's action against Rafferty in the District of New Jersey, which was assigned to Judge Linares, ADP sought to justify the imposition of all three restrictive covenants. Relying on the sworn statement of an ADP executive, ADP argued that the SRA and NDA, for their part, contain reasonable restrictions designed to protect \"the client relationships and the goodwill that sales associates will develop and help develop in the course of their job duties.\" Rafferty JA 146. The RCAs, it urged, are similarly reasonable-albeit \"more extensive\"-because those employees that qualify for the stock award \"demonstrate that they maintain the strongest personal relationships with their contacts at ADP and ADP's clients and prospects,\" \"generally are involved with and have the most information about the largest number of ADP's clients and prospects,\" and have \"demonstrated the greatest ability to attend to the specialized needs of ADP's clients quickly and with continuity.\" Rafferty JA 147. Thus, because the loss of high-performing employees to a competitor poses a \"particularly high risk to ADP with respect to interference with customer and prospect [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] relationships,\" ADP maintained that the \"heightened restrictive covenants in the RCA provisions\" are justified. Rafferty JA 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After a hearing, the District Court granted some of the relief requested by ADP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Acknowledging\n   <em>\n    Solari Industries,Inc. v.

Apr. 2, 2018). The Court also suggested that the RCAs \"may also impose an undue hardship\" on Rafferty because, notwithstanding its geographic and temporal scope, the \"RCAs apply broadly to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of [ADP]'s current or prospective clients regardless of whether [Rafferty] had contact with those clients. ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to the enforceability of the SRA and NDA, however, the District Court reasoned that ADP\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   shown a likelihood of success because, under\n   <em>\n    Solari\n   </em>\n   , they serve a legitimate business interest in that they \"are intended to protect [ADP]'s confidential and proprietary information and client relationships,\" and are \"narrowly tailored\" to that end.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Rafferty had conceded at a hearing that the SRA and NDA were enforceable against her, the District Court did not further elaborate as to how those agreements satisfied the\n   <em>\n    Solari\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    District Court Proceedings in\n    <em>\n     ADP v. Mork\n    </em>\n    (No. 17-cv-4613)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In ADP's action against Mork, assigned to Judge Cecchi, ADP defended the enforceability of the RCAs on the same grounds. Specifically, it put forth a declaration to support its position that those who receive restricted stock \"have extensive contact with ADP clients because they sell the most ADP products and service[s] and are the most successful sales associates,\" Mork JA 103, and \"maintain the closest personal relationships with the key contacts and personnel\" of ADP's clients and prospects,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and thus \"possess the greatest potential to disrupt ADP's relationships with its clients and prospective clients, [and] to harm the goodwill ADP has generated in the market,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court rejected those arguments, adopting Judge Linares' reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Rafferty\n   </em>\n   in full, and concluding that \"due to the RCA's problematic nature and questions concerning their ultimate legitimacy as undue restraints on trade, [ADP] has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to its claims under the RCAs.\"\n   <em>\n    ADP, LLC v.

As a client services business, ADP's viability depends on its ability to attract-and retain-its clients. And by setting sales goals for its employees and identifying the subset of employees that meet or exceed those goals, ADP has the ability to empirically measure which of its employees have more extensive client contact. Employees can achieve this more extensive client contact in one of two ways-by virtue of selling to a greater number of customers or by selling more products to a smaller number of customers. Either way, post-termination competition from those employees or their solicitation of ADP's clients and Business Partners would pose a greater threat to ADP's business than would that of employees who failed to meet their sales goals and thus, necessarily, have less contact with ADP's clients. ADP therefore has a legitimate business interest in imposing the RCA on this subset of employees, and the RCA's heightened restrictive covenants, over and above those in the SRA and NDA, are reflective of the greater damage those employees could inflict on ADP upon their departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Selective Imposition of the RCA Does Not Negate ADP's Legitimate Business Interests\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellees additionally argue, and the District Courts agreed, that any legitimate interest in protecting client relationships that the RCA may serve is negated by virtue of the fact that it is selectively imposed on a subset of ADP employees as a second layer of restrictive covenants, and is not conditional of anything other than receipt of the stock award itself. They argue that because the acceptance of the RCA was not a condition of initial or continued employment, it did not entitle the employees to access any \"additional\" or \"different\" confidential information, such as client lists, Rafferty Br. 19-20, and was not tied to any specific employment milestones, the imposition of the RCA bespeaks an intent to \"prevent[ ] competition as such,\"\n   <em>\n    Whitmyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20577\">\n    274 A.2d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rendering any proffered legitimate business interest mere pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellees' argument largely relies on the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw\n   </em>\n   , which held that a restrictive covenant tied to a stock-option award was an unenforceable restraint of trade under New Jersey law because its \"primary purpose\" was \"to buy out potential competition.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682243\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/20/727/#p762\">\n    20 F.Supp.2d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the restrictive covenant was not a condition of \"employment, obtaining a particular position within the Company, receiving confidential information, or the opportunity to develop customer relationships,\" and instead the employees bound by it had begun receiving proprietary information and developing client relationships before agreeing to its terms, the district court concluded that they served no legitimate business interest and were per se unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682243\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/20/727/#p762\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682243\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/20/727/#p762\">\n    at 763-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We, like most courts that have confronted this issue,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   are not persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw\n   </em>\n   and decline to adopt its reasoning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while the New Jersey Supreme Court has acknowledged that it may be \"difficult to draw\" the line between a corporation's legitimate attempts to protect its client relationships and illegitimate attempts to lay claim to the \"general skills and knowledge of a highly sophisticated employee,\"\n   <em>\n    Ingersoll-Rand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20A.2d%20879\">\n    542 A.2d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we do not perceive a bright line rule that restrictive covenants are unenforceable restraints on trade if imposed selectively and as a second layer-the rule apparently endorsed by the\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw\n   </em>\n   court and the District Courts here-to be consistent with\n   <em>\n    Solari\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For one, ADP's two-tiered system of binding only a subset of high-performing employees necessarily amounts to\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   of a restraint on trade than a single-tier system\n   in which ADP imposed the RCA on all employees at the outset of employment. While New Jersey courts certainly recognize that \"[e]ach client that [ADP] is able to attract represents a significant investment of time, effort and money which is worthy of protection,\" ADP is not in a position to know at the time of hire from which of its employees it will most need that protection.\n   <em>\n    A.T.

Thus, ADP restrains trade less by declining to uniformly, and perhaps prophylactically, impose the RCA until it knows, through the proxy of met sales targets, which of its employees will go on to develop either a greater number of or deeper relationships with ADP's clients (or both). Appellees object that \"ADP did not and cannot offer any evidence that high performers bound to the more restrictive RCAs have access to additional confidential information that is not available to lower performers who are only bound by the SRA and NDA.\" Rafferty Br. 20. But as even Appellees seem to recognize, that observation bears only on ADP's ability \"to meet its burden to show that the RCAs were aimed at protecting ADP's\n   <em>\n    confidential information\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20A.2d%20412\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added); it does not detract from the ample evidence in the record that the RCA is aimed at protecting ADP's client relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nor are we persuaded that because \"[p]articipation in ADP's incentive stock awards was entirely voluntary,\" Mork Br. 26, and because ADP does not penalize its qualifying employees for declining to accept the award and accompanying RCA, \"the primary purpose of the stock-option non-competes is not to protect [ADP's] legitimate interests, but to buy out potential competition,\"\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682243\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/20/727/#p762\">\n    20 F.Supp.2d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, ADP is not precluded from arguing that the RCA is enforceable, notwithstanding any prior judgments to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    We are not unmindful of the language appearing in one of the declarations submitted by ADP in support of its motions for preliminary injunction that identifies as one justification for the RCA the notion that employees subject to it have demonstrated \"unique knowledge, skills and job performance,\" Rafferty JA 148-precisely the kinds of intangible tools that New Jersey courts say employers have \"no legitimate interest\" in protecting,\n    <em>\n     Whitmyer Bros\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20577\">\n     274 A.2d at 581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That isolated statement, however, does not undermine ADP's other evidence reflecting that the RCA principally serves a legitimate business purpose. Even in the declaration in which this troubling language appears, the declarant goes on to explain that the RCA is imposed on those employees who, by virtue of their client relationships developed over time, have \"the greatest potential to disrupt ADP's relationships with its clients and prospective clients, [and] to harm the goodwill ADP has generated in the market.\" Rafferty JA 148.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    On this point, ADP contends that contrary to Judge Linares' conclusion that ADP \"seeks to enjoin [Rafferty] from working for Ultimate for a period of twelve months,\"\n    <em>\n     Rafferty\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201617705\">\n     2018 WL 1617705\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3, it is merely asking \"that she be precluded from working within her prior ADP territory for one year, consistent with the terms of the RCAs,\" ADP Rafferty Br. 25. \"Since her territory at [Ultimate] is larger than her territory was at ADP, there is no reason for her to be required to quit her job.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201617705\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    While the District Courts found these points salient with respect to the\n    <em>\n     Solari\n    </em>\n    analysis of the SRA and NDA, they did not reach them with respect to the RCA, having concluded that they are unenforceable per se.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
