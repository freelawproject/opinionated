Because Comcast of Sacramento (\"Comcast\") seeks money damages in this suit, brings it against a municipality, and the suit arises out of the regulation of cable services, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 555a(a) bars the only relief sought by Comcast. Thus, we vacate the district court's grants of summary judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss Comcast's lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Cable Industry Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Historically, cable operators pay a fee to local and/or state governments in order to provide service within a particular jurisdiction, usually referred to as a franchise fee. These fees have been justified by the fact that cable operators use public rights-of-way, maintained by the local governmental entities, to deliver their services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the 1980s, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") largely left cable franchise regulation to local governments. However in 1984, the FCC determined that many local authorities were imposing varying and often high franchise fees, and that those fees were impeding the growth of the cable television industry. Thus, Congress enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act (the \"Cable Act\") of 1984.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Cable Act imposes a uniform set of franchise procedures and standards, authorizes local authorities to collect fees in connection with the grant of a cable franchise, but caps those fees at 5% of a cable company's gross revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b).

In response, Congress enacted the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Among other things, that Act provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    In any court proceeding\n   </em>\n   pending on or initiated after October 5, 1992,\n   <em>\n    involving any claim against a franchising authority or other governmental entity\n   </em>\n   , or any official, member, employee, or agent of such authority or entity,\n   <em>\n    arising from\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the regulation of cable service\n   </em>\n   or from a decision of approval or disapproval with respect to a grant, renewal, transfer, or amendment of a franchise,\n   <em>\n    any relief\n   </em>\n   , to the extent such relief is required by any other provision of Federal, State, or local law,\n   <em>\n    shall be limited to injunctive relief and declaratory relief\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   47 U.S.C. \u00a7 555a(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Then in 1996, Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act, which sought to increase competition by allowing non-traditional cable companies to enter state cable markets. However, few were able to successfully enter the California market. This inability to enter that market resulted, in part, from a number of traditional cable companies being well established in California. The inability was also partly attributable to the fact that local and municipal governments within California imposed varied, often onerous franchise requirements that, in effect, created barriers to new market entrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In order to encourage competition in the cable television market, the California legislature enacted the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act (\"DIVCA\") in 2006. DIVCA stripped local governments of their ability to grant cable franchises and established the California Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\") as \"the sole franchising authority for a state franchise to provide video service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205840\">\n    Cal.

Comcast (or Comcast's predecessors in interest, all entities hereafter referred to as \"Comcast\") offered cable television services in the Sacramento area for years prior to the enactment of DIVCA. Prior to\n   2008, Comcast was the beneficiary of a franchise issued by SMCTC. As part of that franchise, Comcast's predecessor had been required to pay a deposit to SMCTC. Following the enactment of DIVCA, Comcast transitioned over to a franchise issued by the CPUC, and the franchise agreement with SMCTC terminated by operation of law in 2011. Comcast was not required to pay a deposit under the CPUC franchise agreement, and the parties do not dispute that the pre-existing deposit (paid to SMCTC) was to be returned to Comcast upon expiration of the SMCTC franchise agreement. However, SMCTC did not return the deposit following the termination of the SMCTC franchise agreement; instead SMCTC continued to hold the deposit in an interest bearing trust account. Though the record does not suggest that SMCTC had any legal authority to continue to hold Comcast's deposit, Comcast did not immediately request its return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the SMCTC franchise had terminated, Comcast continued to pay its annual franchise fee to SMCTC (as rent for use of the public rights-of-way), as required by DIVCA. However, in October 2011, Comcast informed SMCTC by letter that it would deduct the CPUC fee from the franchise fees paid during the 3rd quarter of 2011 and going forward thereafter because, in Comcast's view, the CPUC fee \"qualifies as a 'franchise fee' under federal law\" that counted towards the Cable Act's 5% franchise fee cap. Additionally, Comcast informed SMCTC that it would not include the PEG fees it paid to SMCTC as part of the \"gross revenues\" calculation that formed the basis for Comcast's annual franchise fee obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Though SMCTC does not appear to have responded immediately to Comcast's October 2011 letter, SMCTC eventually informed Comcast that it disagreed with Comcast's interpretation of applicable provisions of state and federal law. Following an audit performed in 2014, SMCTC demanded that Comcast remit the withheld amounts for that period, an amount totaling $ 334,610. The parties exchanged several additional letters over the months that followed, outlining their disagreement concerning the appropriate calculation of CPUC and PEG fees due under state and federal law. In an October 2014 letter sent by SMCTC, SMCTC informed Comcast that, because Comcast had paid less in franchise fees than SMCTC believed was due for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, SMCTC would begin offsetting the amount Comcast owed against Comcast's security deposit unless Comcast promptly paid the amounts it had withheld. Comcast declined to pay the amounts SMCTC claimed it owed; instead, it demanded a return of its security deposit. SMCTC refused and instead responded to Comcast's demand in March 2015 by moving Comcast's deposit out of the trust account and into SMCTC's general fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In June 2016, Comcast brought suit against SMCTC, asserting state law claims for conversion and common count. Both claims ultimately seek a return of Comcast's security deposit, which, with accrued interest, totaled $ 227,639.45. SMCTC did not contest those counts but instead argued as affirmative defenses that: (1) the CPUC fees did not constitute \"franchise fees\" for purposes of the Cable Act's 5% cap, and that Comcast therefore was not permitted to offset those fees against the franchise fees due to SMCTC; and (2) PEG fees counted towards \"gross revenues\" from which the franchise fee would be determined, and Comcast could not exclude those fees when calculating its franchise fee obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted each motion in part following a hearing. It found for SMCTC on the franchise fee issue, reasoning that the CPUC fee did not constitute a \"franchise fee\" and had been improperly withheld by Comcast.\n   <em>\n    Comcast of Sacramento I, LLC v. Sacramento Metro. Cable Television Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274222\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/616/#p626\">\n    250 F. Supp. 3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 (E.D. Cal. 2017). However, the district court found for Comcast on the PEG fee issue, determining that Comcast had properly excluded those fees from its \"gross revenue\" calculations, because those fees fell within DIVCA's express exclusion for \"amounts billed to, and collected from, subscribers to recover ... [a] ... fee imposed by [a] governmental entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (alterations in original and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Though SMCTC hadn't raised the issue, the district court considered sua sponte whether Comcast's lawsuit was barred under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 555a(a). After considering that provision, the district court found that \u00a7 555a(a) did not bar Comcast's suit. The court was not convinced \"that this action 'aris[es] from the regulation of cable service' under section 555a.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 627 n.5 (alterations in original). However, the district court noted that it had found few precedential appellate decisions concerning the application of \u00a7 555a(a). Nonetheless, the few decisions the court located \"indicate that section 555a was meant to bar claims arising directly out of cable regulation, as opposed to claims that are only tangentially related to cable regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

As these claims both seek an award of money damages (and not injunctive or declaratory relief) and are unquestionably brought against a cable franchising authority, Comcast's lawsuit would be barred by this statute if it arises from cable regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We find that Comcast's lawsuit, as pleaded, does indeed arise from cable regulation. Though Comcast's complaint does not mention or obviously concern cable regulation, Comcast's complaint cannot be viewed in isolation, nor can the claims pleaded therein be accepted at face value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bright v.

Comcast\n   argues that its lawsuit merely seeks a return of a security deposit, but this argument glosses over the fact that the security deposit at issue was paid pursuant to a cable franchising agreement that established the terms under which Comcast could offer cable television services in Sacramento and the surrounding area. Thus, however pleaded, Comcast's lawsuit arises from a franchising agreement that plainly regulated cable services and has more than a tangential connection with cable regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, both SMCTC's responsive pleadings and the course of this litigation to date further underscore the connection. SMCTC's answer includes (as an affirmative defense) a setoff claim under California law, arguing that SMCTC retained Comcast's security deposit to offset Comcast's underpayment of its franchise fees in the years (i.e., fiscal years 2011 and 2012) following the expiration of the previous SMCTC issued franchise agreement. SMCTC's answer also alleges that the parties were unable to agree what cable franchise fees were due for that period of time, and how those fees should be calculated under the applicable provisions of state and federal law. Those particular allegations are bourne out in the pleadings, arguments, and evidentiary materials produced by the parties during the course of this litigation. These materials demonstrate that both parties have colorable arguments for their respective franchise fee calculations, but these materials also demonstrate that the relief sought by Comcast, however pleaded, is inextricably intertwined with a wider, ongoing disagreement between the parties that plainly arises from the interpretation of federal and state laws that govern the calculation of cable franchise fees under the current CPUC-issued franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Given the underlying disputes concerning the interpretation of both the current and prior franchise agreements, and the fees and payments due in connection with Comcast's provision of cable services, Comcast's lawsuit arises from the regulation of cable television services. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    City of Glendale v.

To hold otherwise would allow parties, through creative pleading, to do precisely what \u00a7 555a(a) bars them from doing, i.e., bring suit for damages against a franchising authority for claims that arise from cable regulation merely by omitting any mention of the regulatory dispute from their pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turtle Island\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996873\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/937/#p945\">\n    438 F.3d at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To allow parties to avoid this limitation through manipulation of form ... while in substance challenging the regulations, would permit parties 'through careful pleading ...

Instead, it determined that Comcast's lawsuit had only a tangential connection with cable regulation. The problem with this finding is that, as explained above, this lawsuit does not have a merely tangential connection to cable regulation; artfully pled or not, this lawsuit is in substance one that arises from cable regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Comcast also suggests that Congress did not intend to immunize municipalities in circumstances such as these when it enacted \u00a7 555a(a). We disagree. Though \u00a7 555a(a) is undoubtedly broad, its terms are not ambiguous or unclear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660977\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/946/#p951\">\n    569 F.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 951 (9th Cir. 2009) (\"The preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. Thus, our inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.\" (alteration in original and citations omitted)). Section 555a(a) simply does what it says, i.e., it exempts local authorities from civil damages in lawsuits arising from cable regulation. Based on the expansive and unrestricted terms used here by Congress, there is no reason for us to conclude that disputes concerning the calculation of fees due or owed under the provisions governing the provision of cable services were ever intended to be excluded from the scope of \u00a7 555a(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As Comcast seeks a monetary award and has brought claims against a cable franchising authority that arise from cable regulation, we hold that its lawsuit is subject to the bar provided by \u00a7 555a(a) and must be dismissed on that basis. Considering the full record and the entire scope of this litigation, it is clear that this lawsuit has sufficient connection with cable regulation to trigger the application of \u00a7 555a(a). Because we find that Comcast's lawsuit is barred by \u00a7 555a(a), we vacate the district court's grants of summary judgment, and remand with instructions that Comcast's lawsuit be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Though we find that Comcast's lawsuit must be dismissed as pleaded and instruct\n   the district court to enter an order to that effect on remand, that dismissal should be without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoyas v.

Because our holding is narrow in scope, we disagree. We have considered here only the application of \u00a7 555a(a) to the present lawsuit and determine only that the particular relief requested in Comcast's complaint as pleaded is subject to that bar. We have not considered whether a claim for equitable relief would also be subject to \u00a7 555a(a) 's bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor have we considered whether this bar would apply were Comcast defending a suit for underpayment of franchise fees brought by SMCTC-as would likely occur were Comcast to deduct the deposit as an overpayment from its franchise fee payments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   California Public Utilities Code Section 5860(h) -instead of bringing suit for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
