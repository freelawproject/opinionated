As pertinent here, the TCPA prohibits calls to cell phones by use of an automated dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice, subject to three statutory exemptions (the \"automated call ban\"). The Plaintiffs allege that one of the statutory exemptions to the automated call ban - created by a 2015 TCPA amendment - is facially unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause. That exemption authorizes automated calls that relate to the collection of debts owed to or guaranteed by the federal government (the \"debt-collection exemption\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Plaintiffs, the free speech infirmity of the debt-collection exemption is not severable from the automated call ban and renders the entire ban unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In awarding summary judgment to the Government in March 2018, the Opinion rejected the free speech challenge interposed by the Plaintiffs. The district court applied strict scrutiny review to the debt-collection exemption and ruled that it does not violate the Free Speech Clause. As explained below, we agree that strict scrutiny review applies in this case but conclude that the debt-collection exemption does not satisfy such a review. As a result, we agree with the Plaintiffs that the debt-collection exemption contravenes the Free Speech Clause. In agreement with the Government, however, we are satisfied to sever the flawed exemption from the automated call ban. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Enacted in 1991, the TCPA was a response by Congress to the reactions of American consumers over intrusive and unwanted phone calls. As a result of congressional\n   concern with automated phone calls, the automated call ban prohibits phone calls to cell phones that use \"any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The automated call ban does not, however, reach and prohibit all calls made with those technologies. For example, the TCPA authorizes automated phone calls to cell phones if they satisfy one of the statutory exemptions specified in the automated call ban. When it was enacted in 1991, the TCPA created two statutory exemptions to the ban, both of which are yet in effect. Under the first exemption, if an automated call to a cell phone is initiated \"for emergency purposes,\" it does not contravene the automated call ban (the \"emergency exemption\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to the second statutory exemption, an automated call made to a cell phone with \"the prior express consent of the called party\" likewise does not violate the ban (the \"consent exemption\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For more than twenty years, the emergency and consent exemptions were the only statutory exemptions to the automated call ban. In 2015, however, Congress enacted the third statutory exemption - the debt-collection exemption - and therein excepted from the ban all calls to cell phones \"made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Pub.

With the foregoing statutory framework in mind, we turn to the proceedings in the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2016, the Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina, alleging, inter alia, that the debt-collection exemption to the automated call ban contravenes their free speech rights because it is a content-based restriction on speech that fails to satisfy strict scrutiny review. According to the complaint, the debt-collection exemption creates a regime that permits - and thereby unconstitutionally favors - a select group of otherwise prohibited automated calls to cell phones. The complaint also alleges that\n   whether an automated phone call satisfies the debt-collection exemption, and thus escapes the prohibitions of the automated call ban, depends on the call's content. The Plaintiffs therefore allege that the debt-collection exemption to the ban contravenes the Free Speech Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2017, the Plaintiffs and the Government each moved in the district court for summary judgment. By its Opinion of March 26, 2018, the court denied the summary judgment request of the Plaintiffs and awarded summary judgment to the Government. In so ruling, the court rejected the Free Speech Clause challenge of the Plaintiffs. At its outset, the Opinion correctly recognized that the Free Speech Clause prohibits a restriction on speech that is predicated on \" 'its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AAPC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526559\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/737/\">\n    323 F.Supp.3d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

That is, the Government must establish that content-based speech restrictions have been narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although the Opinion ruled that the debt-collection exemption to the automated call ban is constitutional, it initially recognized the exemption as a \"content-based speech restriction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AAPC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526559\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/737/\">\n    323 F.Supp.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cal. 2018) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accepting the proposition that the debt-collection exemption makes content-based distinctions, the Opinion rejected - for two reasons - the Government's contention that the exemption is based only on \"the relationship between a caller and a recipient,\" and not on the call's content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AAPC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526559\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/737/\">\n    323 F.Supp.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the Opinion observed that the \" 'plain language of the [debt-collection exemption] makes no reference whatsoever to the relationship of the parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526559\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/737/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gallion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523149\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/287/920/#p927\">\n    287 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 ). Second, the district court explained that the Government sought to justify the exemption on the basis of the relationship between the federal government and the debtor, i.e., the call-recipient. As the Opinion recognized, however, the debt-collection exemption is not limited to calls from the federal government to the cell phones of debtors. The exemption also provides statutory protection for \" 'a third party [who] has no preexisting relationship with the debtor [call-recipient].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523149\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/287/920/#p927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gallion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523149\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/287/920/#p927\">\n    287 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 ). As such, the court was satisfied that the debt-collection exemption is predicated on the subject matter of the phone call rather than on the caller's relationship to the recipient thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding the content-based restriction imposed by the debt-collection exemption, the Opinion ruled that it does not contravene the Free Speech Clause. The district court thus rejected the proposition advanced by the Plaintiffs that the exemption undermines the narrow tailoring of the automated call ban. In that regard, the court agreed with the Government that the exemption does not subvert the privacy interests furthered by the ban. The Opinion therefore concluded that the debt-collection\n   exemption to the automated call ban satisfies strict scrutiny review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, the exemption does not hinder the automated call ban from furthering the compelling governmental interest of protecting \"the well-being, tranquility, and privacy\" of American consumers in a narrowly tailored fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AAPC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526559\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/323/737/\">\n    323 F.Supp.3d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the district court rebuffed the argument of the Plaintiffs that less restrictive alternatives would equally advance the purposes of the automated call ban. The Opinion explained that alternatives proposed by the Plaintiffs - such as time-of-day limitations, mandatory caller identity disclosure, and do-not-call lists - would not further the privacy interests underlying the TCPA and were otherwise implausible. Because the court ruled that the debt-collection exemption to the automated call ban satisfies strict scrutiny and does not contravene the Free Speech Clause, it awarded summary judgment to the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiffs have noted a timely appeal, which has been briefed and argued. Being satisfied that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and rendered a final decision, we possess appellate jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review de novo legal rulings made by a district court in connection with a summary judgment award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bostic v.

As support, they contend that the debt-collection exemption does not further any compelling governmental interest. Moreover, they maintain that, if a compelling governmental interest is furthered,\n   the exemption does not do so in the least restrictive manner, as required under strict scrutiny review. According to the Plaintiffs, the debt-collection exemption to the automated call ban imposes an impermissible content-based restriction on speech, and the entire ban - not just the debt-collection exemption - must therefore be invalidated. In other words, the Plaintiffs maintain that severance of the exemption, if it is constitutionally flawed, is not a permissible remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In order to properly assess and dispose of the Plaintiffs' Free Speech Clause challenge to the debt-collection exemption, we must address three issues. First, we must decide whether, on one hand, the debt-collection exemption is a content-based speech restriction subject to strict scrutiny review, or whether, on the other hand, it constitutes a content-neutral speech restriction subject to intermediate scrutiny analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Finally, if the debt-collection exemption impermissibly infringes on free speech rights, we must identify the appropriate remedy for that infringement.

As that exemption specifies, otherwise prohibited automated calls made to cell phones \"solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States\" do not violate the automated call ban and are legally permissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). But automated calls made to cell phones that deal with other subjects - such as efforts to collect a debt neither owed to nor guaranteed by the United States - do not qualify for the debt-collection exemption and are prohibited by the automated call ban. A proper application of the debt-collection exemption therefore \"depend[s] entirely on the communicative content of the [call]\" and, as the district court ruled, constitutes a content-based speech restriction that is subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The content-based nature of the debt-collection exemption is demonstrated by an illustrative example. As explained by the district court, a private debt collector could make two nearly identical automated calls to the same cell phone using prohibited technology, with the sole distinction being that the first call relates to a loan guaranteed by the federal government, while the second call concerns a commercial loan with no government guarantee. Although the first automated call would satisfy the debt-collection exemption and not be subject to the automated call ban, the second call would not satisfy the exemption and would be illegal. The legality of those phone calls, due solely to the debt-collection exemption, thus depends on their subject matter (i.e., their content).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Seeking to avoid a judicial determination that the debt-collection exemption is a content-based speech restriction, the Government maintains on appeal that the exemption \"is premised principally on the relationship between the [federal] government and the person being called.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. of Appellees 6. That relationship, according to the Government, emanates from a loan or guarantee arrangement between the federal government and the debtor. Because the debt-collection exemption applies to automated phone calls that have a nexus with a government-debtor arrangement - and the relationship it creates - the applicability of the exemption turns on the debtor's relationship with the federal government. The Government therefore contends that whether an automated phone call is authorized by the debt-collection exemption, and thus not prohibited by the automated call ban, depends on the relationship of the parties thereto, and not on the content thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Like the district court, however, we are persuaded that the statutory text of the\n   debt-collection exemption undercuts the Government's relationship-based contention. The text of the exemption makes no reference to the relationship between the caller and the recipient of the automated phone call. To be sure, a relationship is created when a debtor owes a debt that is guaranteed by the federal government. But the restriction imposed by the debt-collection exemption - and the carveout it creates - does not regulate on the basis of that relationship. Instead, the exemption regulates on the basis of the content of the phone call. Under the debt-collection exemption, the relationship between the federal government and the debtor is only relevant to the subject matter of the call. In other words, the debt-collection exemption applies to a phone call made to the debtor because the call is about the debt, not because of any relationship between the federal government and the debtor. And the Supreme Court has recognized that \"regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is\n   fatally underinclusive for two related reasons. First, by authorizing many of the intrusive calls that the automated call ban was enacted to prohibit, the debt-collection exemption subverts the privacy protections underlying the ban. Second, the impact of the exemption deviates from the purpose of the automated call ban and, as such, it is an outlier among the other statutory exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In seeking to justify the debt-collection exemption, the Government maintains that the automated call ban (including that exemption) furthers a compelling governmental interest by protecting personal and residential privacy. Relying on congressional findings supporting the TCPA, the Government argues that automated calls are \"the most intrusive\" type of phone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. of Appellees 20. By \"generally preventing\" the use of such calls to cell phones, the Government contends that the automated call ban protects and shelters the privacy interests of American consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768818\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/399/#p405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also argues that, as part of the automated call ban, the debt-collection exemption does not undermine the privacy protection efforts embodied in the ban. According to the Government, that exemption applies only to a \"narrow category of calls.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. It therefore asserts that the debt-collection exemption does not \"appreciabl[y] damage\" the privacy interests underlying the automated call ban.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We are unpersuaded by the Government's compelling interest argument. Again, the debt-collection exemption does not further the purpose of the automated call ban in a narrowly tailored fashion. Congress implemented the ban in order to protect privacy interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 102-178, at 1, 5 (1991) (explaining that purpose of TCPA is to protect \"privacy interests\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mims v. Arrow Fin.

The debt-collection exemption, however, undercuts those privacy protections. In fact, the exemption applies in a manner that runs counter to the privacy interests that Congress sought to safeguard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Significantly, the potential reach of the debt-collection exemption belies the Government's asserted \"narrow\" framing of it. According to the FCC, the federal government, by the end of fiscal year 2016, had either guaranteed or was owed nearly eighty-percent of all outstanding student loan debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the TCPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n    31 FCC Rcd. 9074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9077 n.28 (Aug. 11, 2016). An FCC report also revealed that more than 41 million borrowers owed over one trillion dollars in federal student loans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, student loan debt, which is generally handled through the Department of Education, is but one category of debt that is guaranteed by or owed to the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n    at 9077-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Various other categories of such debt are handled through other departments, which include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, millions of debtors owe debts about which third parties can make otherwise prohibited calls under the debt-collection exemption. The exemption is not at all \"narrow\" when it is assessed in that context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because of the expansive reach of the debt-collection exemption, it is woefully underinclusive and does not serve the compelling governmental interest of protecting privacy in a narrow fashion. The exemption thus cannot be said to advance the purpose of privacy protection, in that it\n   actually authorizes a broad swath of intrusive calls. In so doing, the debt-collection exemption exposes millions of American consumers to some of the most disruptive phone calls they receive. The exemption therefore erodes the privacy protections that the automated call ban was intended to further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588820\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1656/#p1668\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1668,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588820\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1656/#p1668\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (recognizing that speech restrictions with vast carveouts can undermine compelling governmental interest). Although theoretically limited by the number of debtors owing loans guaranteed by the federal government, the debt-collection exemption authorizes a nearly \"unlimited proliferation\" of disruptive and intrusive automated debt-collection efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2231.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Likewise, a comparative analysis of the automated phone calls authorized under the debt-collection exemption with those permissible under the other statutory exemptions shows the detrimental effect of debt-collection calls on the privacy interests that underlie the automated call ban. For example, phone calls authorized under the consent exemption require \"the prior express consent of the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Because consent generally diminishes any expectation of privacy, phone calls that qualify for the consent exemption are less intrusive than other automated calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norris v. Premier Integrity Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205548\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/695/#p699\">\n    641 F.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (6th Cir. 2011) (explaining that consent diminishes expectation of privacy in constitutional context). On the other hand, the FCC itself has acknowledged that debt-collection calls are among the most intrusive, disruptive, and complained of phone calls made to American consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the FCC receives more complaints about debt-collection phone calls than calls \"relating to ... any other industry.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the TCPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209074\">\n    31 FCC Rcd. at 9077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, in 2015, FCC received over 900,000 complaints about debt-collection calls).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The automated phone calls authorized under the emergency exemption also contrast sharply with debt-collection calls. In order to qualify for the emergency exemption, phone calls must be \"necessary in any situation affecting the health and safety\" of Americans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(4). Emergency automated\n   phone calls therefore differ from debt-collection calls in three important ways. First, emergency calls serve the vital purpose of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans, and the debt-collection calls lack any similarly important purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p714\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (contrasting debt-collection calls with emergency calls). Second, automated phone calls made under the emergency exemption are much less likely to negatively impact Americans' sense of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re TCPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20FCC%20Rcd%202736\">\n    7 FCC Rcd. 2736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2738 (Apr. 17, 1992) (explaining that emergency calls are only made when \"it is in the public interest to convey information to consumers concerning health or safety\"). Third, such emergency calls are generally made less often because they \"must be about a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   emergency that is relevant to the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the TCPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209054\">\n    31 FCC Rcd. 9054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9063 n. 76 (Aug. 4, 2016) (emphasizing that emergency exemption \"will not promote the proliferation of unwanted\" calls).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Unlike the consent and emergency exemptions, the debt-collection exemption impedes the privacy interests of the automated call ban. The debt-collection exemption is thus an outlier among the statutory exemptions. The divergence between the debt-collection exemption and the other two exemptions shows that the debt-collection exemption is incompatible with the privacy interests justifying the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As the Supreme Court emphasized in its\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   decision, a \" 'law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order, and therefore as justifying a restriction on truthful speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   135 S.Ct. at 2232 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Republican Party of Minn. v.
