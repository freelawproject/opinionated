The previous action-a class action-settled, and the court approved the settlement agreement and closed the case. The settlement agreement released Wojciechowski's and the class's claims against various parties, but it explicitly did not release any claims against Kohlberg. Kohlberg was not a party to the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We hold that the settlement agreement-and in particular, the intent of the settling parties-determines the preclusive effect of the previous action. Because the settlement agreement specifically did not release Wojciechowski's and the class's claims against Kohlberg, claim preclusion does not bar Wojciechowski's current claim. The district court erred in dismissing this action, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wojciechowski was formerly employed by ClearEdge Power, LLC. He was terminated without notice. Six days later, ClearEdge Power, LLC-along with its owner, ClearEdge Power, Inc.-filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wojciechowski filed an adversary class action against the ClearEdge entities in the bankruptcy court. He alleged that the two ClearEdge entities were a \"single employer\" under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (\"WARN\") Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2109, and that the entities violated that act when they fired him and other employees without 60 days' advance notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wojciechowski settled that action. Per the settlement agreement, the class released all claims it had against \"(i) Defendants ClearEdge, Power, Inc. and ClearEdge Power, LLC and their respective estates,\" and \"(ii) each of the Defendants' current and former shareholders, officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, representatives and other agents, and all of their respective predecessors, successors and assigns,\n   <em>\n    excluding any third parties which may or may not be affiliated with Defendants ClearEdge Power, Inc. and ClearEdge Power LLC, including, but not limited to Kohlberg Ventures LLC\n   </em>\n   .\" Kohlberg was not involved in the bankruptcy proceedings or in settlement negotiations. The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and closed the case soon after. The ClearEdge estates paid a portion of the class members' WARN Act wages and benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wojciechowski then filed this putative class action. He alleges that Kohlberg, as a \"single employer\" with the ClearEdge entities, violated the WARN Act when it fired him without advance notice. Wojciechowski seeks \"an award for the balance of\n   the Class'[s] WARN Act wages and benefits.\" That is, he seeks what the class is owed under the Act less the amount received from the ClearEdge estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kohlberg moved to dismiss Wojciechowski's claim on the basis of claim preclusion. The district court granted Kohlberg's motion. Relevant here, the district court held that Kohlberg could not be bound by the settlement agreement-and the provision preserving the class's claims against Kohlberg-because Kohlberg was not a party to the adversary proceeding and did not agree to allow Wojciechowski to split his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wojciechowski timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo whether claim preclusion bars Wojciechowski's claim.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
