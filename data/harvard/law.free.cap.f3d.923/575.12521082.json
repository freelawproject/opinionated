We hold that the test does apply, vacate the lower court's grant of summary judgment dismissing the complaint, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    OVERVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This case dates back over a decade. In 2008, a putative class action was filed in the District of Massachusetts by a Massachusetts plaintiff, Giovani Depianti, and two Pennsylvania plaintiffs, against the Defendant-Appellee, Jan-Pro International Franchising, Inc. (\"Jan-Pro\"), a Georgia corporation. By the end of that year, there was an additional plaintiff from Massachusetts plus seven more from other states, including the three individual Plaintiffs-Appellants (\"Plaintiffs\") in this case, who are California residents. They all had a common cause to pursue: that Jan-Pro, a major international janitorial cleaning business, had developed a sophisticated \"three-tier\" franchising model to avoid paying its janitors minimum wages and overtime compensation by misclassifying them as independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because of the variety of state laws involved, the Massachusetts district court chose Depianti's claim as a test case and, over Jan-Pro's opposition, severed the California plaintiffs' claims and sent them to the Northern District of California, Plaintiffs' place of residence. Depianti's case ultimately made its way to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which in 2017 affirmed the district court's dismissal of the complaint, but not on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Depianti v. Jan-Pro Franchising Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    873 F.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Depianti-CA1\n   </em>\n   \"). The claims of all the other plaintiffs before the Massachusetts district court were also dismissed without reaching the merits. But the California plaintiffs have remained steadfast and, as their litigation enters its second decade, they have now brought their battle to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Jan-Pro obviously has a financial interest in not opening the floodgates to nationwide liability for multiple years of back wages and overtime pay. However, the case has broader ramifications. The National Employment Law Project, which asserts that it has \"a strong interest in this case because of the impacts of [Jan Pro's] franchising schemes and those of similar janitorial companies on low-wage and immigrant workers and their communities,\" has submitted an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief (joined by other similarly interested not-for-profit organizations) to bring to the Court's attention \"details about the kinds of franchising and labor intermediary structures used by Jan-Pro, and their impacts on workers,\n   competing employers, and on state and federal coffers.\" And in support of Jan-Pro, the International Franchise Association (\"IFA\"), \"the oldest and largest trade association in the world devoted to representing the interests of franchising,\" rails against applying the ABC test adopted by the California Supreme Court because it \"would sound the death knell for Franchising in California,\" casting the case as \"of profound importance to franchising\" not only in California but also for the \"national economies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    THE ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   postdated the district court's decision, we issued an order directing the parties to brief its effect on the merits of this case. Plaintiffs devoted most of their supplemental brief to the merits, concluding that \"in light of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   , there can be no question that the District Court's order granting summary judgment to Jan-Pro must be reversed,\" and that we should \"remand the case for further proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By contrast, Jan-Pro devoted only two pages of its sixteen-page supplemental brief to the merits, citing but one clearly distinguishable case. It argued principally that \"the\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   decision should not be applied retroactively,\" and that, in any event, it should prevail under the doctrines of the law of the case and res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   does apply retroactively, that none of Jan-Pro's other efforts to avoid reaching the merits are viable, and that the case must be remanded to the district court to consider the merits in light of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex.\n   </em>\n   To explain why neither the law of the case nor res judicata is applicable, we begin with a recitation of\n   <em>\n    Depianti's\n   </em>\n   complex procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DEPIANTI\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The First Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Depianti\n   </em>\n   opinion, characterizing \"the nearly decade long life-cycle\" of the\n   <em>\n    Depianti\n   </em>\n   litigations as a \"Whirlwind Procedural Tour,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    873 F.3d at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , aptly traces that tour. It also elucidates the nature of Jan-Pro's franchise business and the structure of the three-tier franchise model it created in its effort to establish janitorial cleaners, such as Depianti and Plaintiffs, as independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the First Circuit explained, Jan-Pro \"organizes commercial cleaning franchises\" throughout the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under its particular franchise model, Jan-Pro \"contracts with what are known as intermediary 'master franchisees' or 'master owners' (regional, third party entities) to whom it sells exclusive rights to the use of the 'Jan-Pro' logo, which is trademarked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"These master owners, in turn, sell business plans to 'unit franchisees.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Jan-Pro's business model is two-tiered, \"with (1) Jan-Pro acting as franchisor and the master owner acting as franchisee, in one instance and (2) the master owner acting as franchisor to the unit franchisee, in the other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The First Circuit explained how this two-tiered system works:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Jan-Pro and its master owners are separate corporate entities and each has its own staff. Moreover, master owners may\n   sell or transfer their individual businesses without approval from Jan-Pro. Jan-Pro also reserves the right to inspect any premises serviced by either the master owner or any of the master owner's franchisees to ensure the Jan-Pro standards are being maintained. Still, master owners have their own entity names and internal business structures, and are responsible for their own marketing, accounting, and general operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   As for master owners and their unit franchisees, under the terms of the model franchise agreement, master owners agree to provide their franchisees with an initial book of business, as well as start-up equipment and cleaning supplies. Moreover, the master owner furnishes a training program for its unit franchisees. Once initial set-up and training is complete, the master owner agrees to (1) assist in the unit franchisee's customer relations (by, for example, providing substitute employees or contractors to supply services in the event of an emergency impacting the unit franchisee); (2) provide the unit franchisee with invoicing and billing services; (3) advance the unit franchisee amounts that have been billed but not yet collected from customers; and (4) make available to the unit franchisee any improvement or changes in services or business methods that are made available to other franchisees. Additionally, the agreement notes that a unit franchisee is at all times an independent contractor solely in business for itself. As such, the unit franchisee may, for example, hire its own employees and decide what to pay them, as well as decide whether or not to pursue certain business opportunities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In June 2003, Depianti signed a franchise agreement with Bradley Marketing Enterprises, Inc. (\"BME\"), one of Jan-Pro's master franchisees. He was promised $100,000 in gross annual billings by BME, and paid this master franchisor $23,400 for his unit franchise. In his lawsuit, he alleged \"that his status as a unit franchisee of BME was a farce and that he was actually a direct employee of Jan-Pro.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A Massachusetts statute presumes an individual performing a service, such as Depianti, to be an employee unless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"(1) the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"(2) the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"(3) the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mass.

The court has said that \"[p]articular considerations relevant to the retroactivity determination include the reasonableness of the parties' reliance on the former rule, the nature of the change as substantive or procedural, retroactivity's effect on the administration of justice, and the purposes to be served by the new\n   rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20P.3d%20496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Claxton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20246\">\n    18 Cal.Rptr.3d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20P.3d%20496\">\n    96 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   503 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The parties conceptualize this rule and its exception in different ways. Jan-Pro and the IFA would have us assess the exception\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and hold that it applies. At a minimum, the IFA argues, the extent of reliance is a factual question, and so we should remand to allow the district court to determine how much Jan-Pro relied on pre-\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   law before deciding whether to apply\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   retroactively. Plaintiffs, meanwhile, urge us to hold that the California courts have already held that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively, and that we are obliged to follow those courts' conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The IFA's argument is conceptually problematic. It would make little sense for a court to assess the retroactive effect of\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   by developing a factual record concerning a party's reliance on previous law. Such an approach could lead to the surprising result that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to some parties but not to others. We thus decline the IFA's invitation to remand for further factual development on the question of reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs base their argument that\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   has already been determined to apply retroactively on three points. First, emphasizing the general rule in favor of retroactivity, Plaintiffs point out that in\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court of California denied (albeit without comment) a petition by an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   , the California Employment Law Council, to modify the\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   opinion for \"Clarification That Independent Contractor Test is Prospective Only.\" Second, Plaintiffs also point out that lower courts in California are now applying the ABC test retroactively. Finally, they argue that only the Supreme Court of California has the power to declare one of its decisions non-retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct on at least their first two points.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to their first argument, the IFA argues that \"\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   is silent on the question of retroactivity,\" and reminds us that \"it is well-settled that the California Supreme Court's refusal to hear a matter does not constitute a ruling on the merits.\" But actions sometimes speak louder than words. By denying the petition, even without comment, the court strongly suggested that the usual retroactive application, rather than the exception, should apply to its newly announced rule. To be sure, as the IFA argues, a denial of a request for clarification is not a holding on the merits. But in an unusual case such as this, it is a data point for us to consider in light of California's general tradition that judicial pronouncements have retroactive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In support of their second argument (that lower California courts are now applying\n   <em>\n    Dynamex\n   </em>\n   retroactively), Plaintiffs cite two cases,\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Plaintiff Vazquez purchased his franchise from master franchisor New Venture of San Bernardino, LLC for $2,800; plaintiff Roman bought hers from Connor-Nolan, Inc., also for $2,800; and plaintiff Aguilar, with a business partner, also acquired his from Connor-Nolan, Inc., but for $9,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roman v.

But it was only a \"brief synopsis of the factual background,\"\n   <em>\n    Depianti-CA1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263421\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/21/\">\n    873 F.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , sufficient for the limited purpose of resolving the case on res judicata grounds, not on the merits. What follows is a more comprehensive set of facts taken from the record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Contracts Among the Various Entities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Jan-Pro's franchise agreements provide for several streams of payments. Two are of particular importance. First, master franchisors are obligated to pay 10% of the franchise fee paid to them by unit franchisees to Jan-Pro. Second, master franchisors are required to pay Jan-Pro 4% of the revenues which they collect from unit franchisees' customers for their cleaning services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Regional master franchisees purchase franchises for exclusive operations in a given regional area. Among other things, they advertise cleaning services under the \"Jan-Pro\" name. They do not, however, typically perform any cleaning services; unit franchisees do the cleaning. Regional master franchisors submit bids for cleaning services to unit franchisees who can accept or reject the bid. Unit franchisees may also solicit for their own accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Although the regional master franchisees operate their own independent businesses and can set their own terms with unit franchisees, the regional master franchisees' agreements with Jan-Pro include many requirements for how the businesses are to be conducted. For example, regional master franchisees must use the \"Jan-Pro\" name, logo, and trademark; maintain specific amounts of insurance; attend training sessions hosted by Jan-Pro; provide training for unit franchisees; and allow Jan-Pro to inspect the regional master franchisees' books, records, and premises. Regional master franchisees must also sell a specified number of unit franchises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Furthermore, the franchise agreements between Jan-Pro and the regional master franchisees give Jan-Pro authority to enforce any agreement between the regional master franchisee and its respective unit franchisees. If the franchise agreement between Jan-Pro and a regional master franchisee terminates, the agreement allows Jan-Pro to assume the regional master franchisee's rights and obligations to its unit franchisees. Similarly, in the event that a regional master franchisee defaults on its obligations to cleaning customers, the agreement provides that Jan-Pro may\n   assume all of the regional master franchisee's rights and obligations to those customers. Moreover, Jan-Pro requires that regional master franchisees specify in their contracts with unit franchisees that Jan-Pro is a third-party beneficiary of those contracts. Finally, Jan-Pro reserves the right to unilaterally promulgate binding \"policies and procedures\" that pertain both to the businesses of the regional master franchisees and that of the unit franchisees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   There are inconsistencies between Jan-Pro's agreements with its regional master franchisees on one hand, and the agreements between the regional master franchisors and their unit franchisees on the other. Although the agreements between Jan-Pro and its regional master franchisees require that the regional master franchisees use a specific form when contracting with unit franchisees, Jan-Pro's CEO testified that Jan-Pro only provides its regional master franchisees with a \"template\" for agreements with unit franchisees. Whatever the reason, the unit franchisee agreements do not always fulfill the requirements enumerated in Jan-Pro's agreements with regional master franchisees. For example, none of Plaintiffs' unit franchise agreements include a clause naming Jan-Pro as a third-party beneficiary. They do, however, contemplate that Jan-Pro may promulgate policies and procedures and require unit franchisees to comply with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In most ways, however, Plaintiffs' agreements substantially follow Jan-Pro's requirements. For example, all the agreements describe the unit franchisee as an independent contractor and disclaim an employment relationship. All the agreements require Plaintiffs to obtain the regional master franchisor's consent before assigning their franchise, with failure to obtain consent constituting grounds for termination. All the agreements also include non-competition clauses that forbid Plaintiffs from engaging in either janitorial services or the franchising of janitorial services outside of their Jan-Pro franchise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Practical Realities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In their depositions, the parties dispute the on-the-ground realities. As a practical matter, there may be less control at all levels than what is contemplated in the agreements. For example, it appears that at least one Plaintiff operated and solicited a cleaning business outside of her Jan-Pro unit franchise in apparent violation of her franchise agreement's non-compete clause. And as mentioned, regional master franchisors do not use Jan-Pro's form agreement with unit franchisees, nor do they include the third-party beneficiary provision. Moreover, despite Jan-Pro's reservation of the power to do so, a Jan-Pro Vice President testified that the company's officials rarely make site visits to its regional master franchisees. They also rarely, if ever, inspect the books and records of their regional master franchisees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Additionally, there is considerable daylight between the parties as to Jan-Pro's involvement in the setting of prices by the regional master franchisees. Plaintiffs refer to a proprietary system called \"EZ-Bid,\" which was developed by Jan-Pro and lets regional master franchisees quickly generate bids. Jan-Pro counters that the regional master franchisors that contracted with Plaintiffs did not use this system. Furthermore, Jan-Pro employees testified that the \"EZ-Bid\" system simply incorporates publicly available standards for estimating cleaning costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The parties also dispute whether unit franchisees in general, and Plaintiffs in particular, knew about the franchise structure and understood that Jan-Pro and their regional master franchisors were\n   separate entities. Plaintiffs are not sophisticated parties, and English is not their first language. Based on their deposition testimony, and drawing inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, a fair characterization may be that Plaintiffs understood themselves to be \"Jan-Pro cleaners\" but did not necessarily think they were contracting with a company called \"Jan-Pro Franchising International.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In terms of advertising, Jan-Pro on its website describes itself as a cleaning company, and lists its regional master franchisees as \"locations.\" In turn, many regional master franchisees, including the ones that contracted with Plaintiffs, hold themselves out as \"Jan-Pro International\" on their websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The district court began its analysis by noting that Jan-Pro contended that\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

Application of Prongs A and C is most likely to trigger the need for further factual development, because the considerations relevant to those prongs are the most factually oriented. But the ABC test is conjunctive, so a finding of any prong against the hiring entity directs a finding of an employer-employee relationship. Prong B may be the most susceptible to summary judgment on the record already developed. We leave it to the district court, of course, to determine whether summary judgment is warranted on the current record or whether more factual development is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   More specifically, Prong B requires the hiring entity to establish that it was not engaged in the same usual course of business as the putative employee.

The\n   <em>\n    Sebago\n   </em>\n   court explained that the taxi cab drivers in\n   <em>\n    Parks Cab\n   </em>\n   were incidental to the operations of the medallion lessors because the medallion companies' revenues were not affected by how much the taxi cab drivers worked. In contrast, the owners of the limousine company in\n   <em>\n    O'Hare-Midway\n   </em>\n   derived their profits from the earnings of the limousine chauffeurs. Thus, the work of the chauffeurs was necessary to the success of the limousine company. In a similar vein, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that a company that described itself as a \"real estate and timber management\n   company\" was in the same usual course of business as a timber harvester in part because it derived a profit from the sale of timber by the harvester.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McPherson Timberlands, Inc. v.

First, Jan-Pro's business ultimately depends on someone performing the cleaning. That work is performed solely by the unit franchisees. Thus, Jan-Pro fundamentally depends on a supply of unit franchisees for its business (and, accordingly, requires its regional master franchisees to sell a minimum number of unit franchises). Second, Jan-Pro earns a percentage of the payments that customers pay for cleaning services. Thus, unlike the medallion owners in\n   <em>\n    Parks Cab\n   </em>\n   , Jan-Pro is not indifferent to how much work unit franchisees do or how well they perform that work. It is not simply renting out its trademark and goodwill to independent entities that could use it to perform cleaning services. Rather, Jan-Pro is actively and continuously profiting from the performance of those cleaning services as they are being performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. Do Unit Franchisees Continuously Work in Jan-Pro's Business System?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In analyzing Prong B, some courts have also looked to whether the services of the putative employee are continuously used by the hiring entity. This approach also helps capture the distinction between independent contractor arrangements designed to evade requirements placed on employers and traditional contractors like electricians and plumbers, who perform incidental services for otherwise unrelated businesses.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holbrook v.

This was the approach taken by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in\n   <em>\n    Mattatuck Museum\n   </em>\n   .
