NELSON, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners Boon Global Limited, F8 Vietnam Company Limited, California Fitness &amp; Yoga Centers Company Limited (\"CFYC\"), and Randy Dobson (collectively \"the Third Parties\") seek a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate its order compelling the Third Parties to arbitration, and grant the Third Parties' motions to dismiss. Despite the district court's flawed jurisdictional analysis, we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As alleged in the complaint, around 2013, Randy Dobson began developing an online personal training platform, which later became the \"Morfit App.\" Praveen Narra, CEO of Indyzen (a software development company), pitched his software development expertise to Dobson. Shortly thereafter, Parkridge Limited was formed with Dobson as CEO and Chairman, and Narra as the Chief Technology Officer (\"CTO\"). As CTO, Narra oversaw the hiring of another software company, TIBCO, to develop the Morfit App. TIBCO ultimately did not deliver a mobile platform app.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2015, Parkridge's shareholders agreement was executed, with Narra's father and Mabel Mak (Dobson's wife) designated as shareholders. Parkridge then entered into a software development and licensing agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Indyzen. Dobson signed the Agreement on behalf of Parkridge as CEO and Narra signed on behalf of Indyzen. The Agreement defined the parties subject to arbitration: \"Except for any dispute arising out of payments due to Company, any dispute or disagreement arising between the Company and the Customer ... shall be referred to arbitration ....\" The \"Company\" was defined as Indyzen and the \"Customer\" as Parkridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 29, 2016, Parkridge and Mak sued Indyzen and Narra for improperly developing the Morfit App for Parkridge, alleging breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and fraudulent concealment. Indyzen successfully moved to compel arbitration under the Agreement. In arbitration, Indyzen counterclaimed and added, as defendants to the counterclaim, the Third Parties, all of which have or had an affiliation with Dobson and are located in Hong Kong or\n   Vietnam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arbitrator found he lacked authority to determine jurisdiction over entities not parties to the Agreement and dismissed the Third Parties, subject to a further order from the district court or agreement by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Indyzen petitioned the district court to compel the Third Parties to arbitrate. The Third Parties filed separate motions to dismiss. The district court compelled the Third Parties to arbitration \"in order that the arbitrator may decide whether to allow counterclaims against them to proceed.\" The district court found that the \"Dobson Companies and their business dealings are sufficiently interrelated and interdependent on conduct governed by the Morfit Agreement that the doctrine of equitable estoppel enables the Court to find that the nonsignatories may be bound by the agreement despite not having signed it.\" After the arbitration analysis, the district court then found it \"may properly exercise jurisdiction over the Dobson Companies. These companies are closely associated with Randy Dobson and, by signing the Agreement to perform the subject work in California, he is properly subjected to the jurisdiction of this Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The writ of mandamus is a \"drastic and extraordinary\" remedy \"reserved for really extraordinary causes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Fahey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364973\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/258/#p259\">\n    332 U.S. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259-60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364973\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/258/#p259\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364973\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/258/#p259\">\n    91 L.Ed. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1947). \"Only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power, or a clear abuse of discretion will justify the invocation of this remedy.

Indyzen's lack of clarity before the district court and this court, however, makes it difficult to assess a theory of liability for Dobson sufficient to exercise personal jurisdiction. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , we found jurisdiction over a corporation's only corporate officers because they solicited business from multiple forum residents, had already defended themselves in multiple lawsuits in the forum, and were on notice that they could be personally liable for any securities violations they committed while conducting business in the forum state.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529770\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/885/515/#p522\">\n    885 F.2d at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
