Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Provencio worked for Intel for nearly 20 years. In March 2015, she participated as a witness in an internal investigation of another employee's age-discrimination complaint. Although Provencio did not tell the investigator she had witnessed age discrimination, she did complain that some of her supervisors had created a hostile work environment. She described a female supervisor, Janice Lee, as a bully who seemed to have issues with women, and she stated that a male supervisor, Randie Dorrance, would not write up any managers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A few months later, Provencio's direct supervisor, Keith Baumgardner, told her that three other managers-Lee, Dorrance (who was Baumgardner's supervisor), and Jeff Kiehne-had complained that she was unapproachable and difficult to work with. Baumgardner had not received complaints about Provencio's job performance before\n   she participated in the internal investigation. Although Baumgardner was pressured by Dorrance to coach Provencio pursuant to Defendant's progressive discipline policy, he disagreed with the other managers' criticisms and he told her not to worry about them. Baumgardner did not tell Provencio that he was giving her official coaching. She told Baumgardner that she believed the other managers were retaliating against her for participating in the internal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At about the same time, Dorrance reduced Provencio's job duties by 20-30% by placing Lee in a lead role on a team that Provencio had previously held. Lee initially told Baumgardner that Provencio should not attend team meetings because she would be argumentative. Provencio eventually attended a few meetings, serving only as a minute-taker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Colleagues began ignoring Provencio's emails, which interfered with her job duties. When she appealed to Lee for help, Lee also ignored her emails. Her peers began isolating her, she became nervous and scared, and her health was affected. Kiehne also reneged on a promise to allow Provencio to use a spare work room, which he instead reserved for himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2015, Provencio complained about retaliation to Intel's human resources department (HR). HR investigated but concluded it could not substantiate her claim that Kiehne or Lee had retaliated against her for acting as a witness in the internal investigation. The investigator found no evidence that employees in Provencio's organization knew that she had participated in that investigation. HR did find that Kiehne should be formally coached for stating that employees should shut their mouths if they wanted to keep their jobs, and that Dorrance should be formally coached for instilling fear in his staff, modeling inappropriate behavior, and being a poor manager. Dorrance pressured the investigator to reveal who had submitted a complaint to HR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Baumgardner advised Provencio to seek a new position with Intel in a different department. Frustrated by the ongoing hostility at work, she attempted to do so in November and December 2015. Intel could have, but did not transfer Provencio to a new department. Around that time, Dorrance again pressured Baumgardner to coach Provencio about her approachability. Baumgardner continued to believe that coaching was not warranted. When he met with Dorrance and Kiehne to discuss their issues with Provencio, Baumgardner confirmed to Dorrance that she had been involved in several HR issues. HR subsequently coached Baumgardner for making this disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before Provencio participated in the internal investigation, she had been rated as a \"Regularly High Performer\" whose performance \"Exceeded Expectations.\" But Intel downgraded her job performance rating to \"Successful\" in her annual review for 2015. The lower rating affected her compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2016, Provencio complained again to HR about ongoing retaliation by Kiehne and Dorrance. In early March 2016, she filed an internal report alleging that a co-worker who reported to Kiehne had made statements in the workplace about gun violence that made her fearful. In her complaint, Provencio noted she had previously reported Kiehne for insinuating gun violence against an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Provencio took a leave from her job at Intel from March 22 to April 28, 2016, to deal with the stress and anxiety caused by her work environment. During that period, she received a job offer from another employer. She gave written notice that she was resigning when she returned to work\n   at Intel. She privately told Baumgardner that she was leaving Intel due to the hostile work environment. She felt that, after her two complaints about retaliation for her participation in the internal investigation, her only option was to quit. Before her resignation, Intel had not threatened her with being laid-off, demoted, or disciplined. Provencio unsuccessfully attempted to rescind her resignation notice after Intel subsequently announced a voluntary separation program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Provencio filed this lawsuit alleging a single state-law claim: retaliation in violation of the NMHRA, which provides: \"It is an unlawful discriminatory practice for ... any person or employer to ... engage in any form of threats, reprisal or discrimination against any person who has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice or has filed a complaint, testified or participated in any proceeding under the Human Rights Act[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-1-7\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-1-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (I)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Intel moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion, holding that Provencio failed to establish a prima facie claim of retaliation because she did not come forward with evidence that Intel took an adverse action against her. More specifically, the court held that she did not present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that she had been constructively discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Aplt. App., Vol. 1 at 78-82. Citing\n   <em>\n    Gormley\n   </em>\n   and other cases in accord, Intel argued that the applicable standard was whether Provencio had no other choice but to quit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
