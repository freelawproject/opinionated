He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">A federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging Bizzell with ten crimes: one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846; three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C); three counts of carrying and using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)-(2); and three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Bizzell pleaded not guilty, and a jury returned a verdict finding him guilty on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The presentence investigation report grouped together the convictions for drug conspiracy, drug possession, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3D1.2(d) (Nov.201'0), and it recommended a total\u2019 offense level of 32. It also recommended a criminal history category of IV. Combined with Bizzell\u2019s total offense level of 32, the result was a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months in prison for those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">The PSR also stated that a person convicted of using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime is subject to a mandatory minimum 5-year consecutive sentence on the first count of conviction and to a 25-year consecutive sentence on each \u201csecond or successive conviction.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), (C)(i), (D)(ii). Because Bizzell was convicted of three counts of possessing a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, he is subject to mandatory minimum consecutive sentences of 60 months on the first \u00a7 924(c) count, 300 months on the second, and another 300 months on the third \u2014 a total of 660 months. Those consecutive sentences became the guidelines range for the \u00a7 924(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>counts as well. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b). So his total guidelines range was 828 to 870 months for all ten convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Bizzell did not object to the PSR. He asked the court to impose a 0-month sentence on the seven non-18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) counts in light of the total 660-month sentence the court was required to impose on the three \u00a7 924(c) counts. The district court adopted the PSR, varied downward, and imposed a 780-month total sentence: 120-month concurrent sentences on each non- \u00a7 924(c) count; a 60-month consecutive sentence on the first \u00a7 924(c) count; a 800-month consecutive sentence on the second \u00a7 924(c) count; and another 300-month consecutive sentence on the third \u00a7 924(c) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Explaining the sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the factors and purposes listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). The court also stated that it had to impose a \u201cDraconian\u201d 660-month sentence for the three 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) convictions and that it had considered Biz-zell\u2019s arguments for a 0-month sentence on the non- \u00a7 924(c) counts. Even so, the court concluded that the 780-month \u201csentence [was] sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing,\u201d and it based the slight downward variance on Bizzell\u2019s troubled childhood, drug dependency, and remorse. The court, however, rejected Biz-zell\u2019s request for a 0-month sentence on the non- \u00a7 924(c) counts, reasoning: \u201c[M]y decision not to simply ignore the underlying drug offenses is borne out of the notion that other defendants appear before the Court on drug offenses not facing any gun offenses, and I can\u2019t legitimately say to them they should be punished for their drug offenses and he shouldn\u2019t....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Bizzell appeals his 780-month total sentence, contending that it is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the district court did not properly consider the severity of the 660-month sentence it was required to impose on the three \u00a7 924(c) convictions. If it had done so, Bizzell argues, it would have imposed a lower total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u201cOur substantive reasonableness review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>663 F.3d 1207, 1217 (11th Cir.2011). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in that statutory provision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Those purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment of the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Among other factors, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guidelines range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cThe burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging it.\u201d <em>White, </em>663 F.3d at 1217. \u201cWe will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u2018if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Bizzell has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. His 780-month total sentence is below his guidelines range of 828 to 870 months, and we usually expect a below-the-guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>See White, </em>663 F.3d at 1217. The district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Bizzell\u2019s arguments for a 0-month sentence on the non- \u00a7 924(c) counts, which means it considered his argument that the 660-month sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) convictions was enough to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court concluded, however, that the need to avoid a potential sentencing disparity resulting from a 0-month sentence on the underlying drug convictions outweighed the \u201cDraconian\u201d nature of the \u00a7 924(c) sentences. That conclusion does not render Bizzell\u2019s sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. Bizzell also contends that the court should have ordered that a sentence for one of the \u00a7 924(c) counts run concurrently to the consecutive sentences for the other two \u00a7 924(c) counts. As Bizzell recognizes, however, that contention is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>33 F.3d 1349, 1350 (11th Cir.1994) (\"The plain language of the statute expressly states that a term of imprisonment imposed under section 924(c) cannot run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, period. No exceptions are provided.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
