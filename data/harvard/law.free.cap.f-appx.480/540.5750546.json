Shuler had filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint, claiming that the UAB defendants retaliated against him and wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of: (1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because he was fired for exercising his First Amendment right to free speech; (2) 42</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), because the UAB defendants conspired to deprive him of his constitutional rights; (3) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986, because the UAB defendants knew of this conspiracy and failed to prevent it; (4) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, in that he was discriminated against due to his age; and (5) Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>because he was discriminated against on the basis of his gender. Shuler also brought a state defamation claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The district court handled Shuler\u2019s claims as follows. Following Shuler\u2019s objection that the Board improperly filed a motion to dismiss after its answer and that the motion to dismiss was filed with supporting affidavits, the district court converted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. The district court clarified that the UAB individual defendants\u2019 motion, which was filed as a \u201cmotion to dismiss or for summary judgment,\u201d would also be treated as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">After giving Shuler time to oppose the motions, the district court subsequently granted summary judgment to the UAB defendants based on the following findings. First, with respect to Shuler\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(3), and 1986 claims, the UAB Board and the individual defendants in their official capacities enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, the individual defendants in their individual capacities benefitted from qualified immunity, and Shuler failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a constitutional violation or a conspiracy between the individual defendants. Second, with respect to his ADEA claim, Shuler failed to allege that age was the \u201cbut for\u201d reason for his discharge. Third, with respect to his Title VII gender discrimination claim, Shuler failed to exhaust the claim by filing a charge of gender discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). The district court also granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, based on Shuler\u2019s concession that he did not file a notice of his claim with the City Clerk\u2019s Office, as required by Alabama state law. The district court also denied several motions Shuler filed asking the judge to recuse himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">On appeal, Shuler claims that the district court erred by (1) granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, (2) converting the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, (3) failing to allow discovery, (4) improperly granting summary judgment on the Title VII claim, (5) improperly granting summary judgment on the ADEA claim, (6) improperly granting summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claim, (7) improperly granting summary judgment on the \u00a7 1985 claim, and (8) improperly finding the complaint barred by <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">I. City\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Pursuant to Ala.Code \u00a7 11-47-23, there is a six-month limitations period within which a claimant must notify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>city clerk of a potential tort claim against a municipality. Under Alabama law, the plaintiff has the burden to prove compliance with the claim-filing requirement. <em>McCarroll v. City of Bessemer, </em>289 Ala. 449, 268 So.2d 731, 735 (1972) (\u201c[I]n order to maintain an action against a municipal corporation the filing of the statement of claim in substantial compliance with the statute must be alleged and proved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Shuler conceded to the district court that he did not file this required Notice of Claim with the city clerk within six months. Because of this concession, the district court did not need to consider the affidavit attached to the City\u2019s motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we find no merit to Shuler\u2019s argument that the district court erred by failing to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Harper v. Lawrence Cnty., Ala., </em>592 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cA judge need not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment as long as he or she does not consider matters outside the pleadings. According to case law, \u2018not considering such matters is the functional equivalent of \u2018excluding them-there is no more formal step required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">II.Converting the Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Shuler argues that the district court could not convert the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment because the Board filed an answer before filing the motion to dismiss, and therefore the motion to dismiss was completely invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">If a district court considers matters outside the pleadings when ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d). We find no error here. The district court properly converted the Board\u2019s motion under Rule 12(d), <em>see Harper, </em>592 F.3d at 1232, and this conversion rendered moot any argument that the district court improperly ruled on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">III. Failing to Allow Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Shuler contends that the district court erred by refusing to allow for discovery before granting summary judgment. Where \u201cthe documents or other discovery sought would be relevant to the issues presented by the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party should be allowed the opportunity to utilize the discovery process to gain access to the requested materials.\u201d <em>Snook v. Trust Co. of Ga. Bank of Savannah, N.A., </em>859 F.2d 865, 870 (11th Cir.1988). Under Rule 56, if the party opposing summary judgment shows by affidavit or declaration, for specified reasons, that it cannot present facts essential to its opposition, the court may: (1) defer the motion for summary judgment, (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery, or (3) issue any other appropriate order. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(d). After providing the parties with notice and time to respond, the district court may grant summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party or \u201cconsider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Shuler never filed a motion under Rule 56(d) and did not identify any discovery relevant to the grounds for summary judgment. No amount of discovery would change the conclusion that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">IV. Summary Judgment on Title VII Claim</p>\n<p id=\"Ark\">Shuler claims that the district court erred by granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ment to the UAB defendants on his gender discrimination claim. The individual defendants are not \u201cemployers\u201d under Title VII, and thus Shuler\u2019s claim against them fails. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 830 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that Title VII does not \u201ccountenance individual liability\u201d). With respect to the Board, Shuler has failed to allege any evidence that he was discriminated against due to his gender. \u201c[A] pro se litigant does not escape the essential burden under summary judgment standards of establishing that there is a genuine issue as to a fact material to his case in order to avert summary judgment.\u201d <em>Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 670 (11th Cir.1990). Bare and self-serving allegations are inadequate to carry the plaintiffs burden on summary judgment. <em>Stewart v. Booker T. Washington Ins., </em>232 F.3d 844, 851 (11th Cir.2000). We find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">V. Summary Judgment on ADEA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Shuler argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to the UAB defendants on his age discrimination claim. The individual defendants are not \u201cemployers\u201d under the ADEA, and thus Shuler\u2019s claim against them has no merit. <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 830 (holding that the ADEA, like Title VII, does not \u201ccountenance individual liability\u201d). The Board has Eleventh Amendment immunity from ADEA claims, <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 91-92, 120 S.Ct. 631, 650, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000), and this immunity may be raised for the first time on appeal, <em>Doe v. Moore, </em>410 <em>F.3d </em>1337, 1349 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cA state\u2019s waiver of its sovereign immunity ... must be unequivocally expressed, and Eleventh Amendment jurisdictional questions can be raised for the first time on appeal ....\u201d) (quotations and citation omitted). Thus, Shuler\u2019s ADEA claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">VI. Summary Judgment on 1983 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Shuler argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to the UAB defendants on his 1983 claim. To the extent this claim is against the individual defendants in their official capacity or against the Board itself, the claim fails because of Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Jackson v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>16 F.3d 1573, 1575 (11th Cir.1994). To the extent the complaint is against the individual defendants in their individual capacity, we agree with the district court that Shuler has failed to overcome qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Qualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from liability in their individual capacity if their conduct \u201cdoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (quotation omitted). The immunity \u201cprotects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Mosley, </em>487 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Once a defendant establishes that he was acting within his discretionary authority, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that qualified immunity is not appropriate. <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Shuler has not shown that any clearly established right has been violated. His only alleged evidence is a recorded phone call that he says supports the notion that he was terminated because of the political content of his blog. However, Shuler\u2019s own transcript of the phone call shows only that his time spent researching content for his blog during working hours was a factor&amp;emdash;and an \u201cinsignificant\u201d one, at that-in his termination. There is no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>dence to suggest that the political content of his blog was a factor at all. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the UAB defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">VII. Summary Judgment on 1985 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Shuler contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on his 1985 claim, but Shuler has failed to provide any citations or argument as to why the district court erred by granting summary judgment on this claim. This argument is waived, as are any other claims on which Shuler lost at the district court that have not been properly presented to this Court. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. McClain of Georgia, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1418, 1422 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cIssues raised in a perfunctory manner, without supporting arguments and citation to authorities, are generally deemed to be waived.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. Shuler also argues that the district court erred by denying multiple motions to recuse. He contends that the district court was communicating secretly with the opposing party or interested third parties, as evidenced in part by the court\u2019s statement, \u201cI know that UAB and the people over there are very anxious about this.\u201d Shuler also contends that the district court intended to misapply the law, as evidenced by the court's suggestion that Shuler learn about the procedure for filing a writ of mandamus. We find no abuse of discretion in denying the motions to re-cuse. There are no facts \"that would convince a reasonable person that bias actually exists.\u201d <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). We also find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to strike affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-17\">. Because of the previous holdings, we need not discuss whether the district court erred by finding that all of Shuler's claims also failed under <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
