Keller\u2019s claim arose out of his participation as a research subject in a clinical trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of a drug intended to treat hepatitis C. Keller alleged that, after he experienced adverse side effects, the defendants denied him follow-up medical care in violation of the informed consent contracts he signed before participating in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On appeal, Keller raises two primary arguments: (1) the district court erred by dismissing Keller\u2019s RICO claim and finding that his amendments would be futile; and (2) the district court erred by dismissing Keller\u2019s FDCA claims and by ruling with prejudice on Keller\u2019s state-law claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">1. RICO Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Keller argues that the district court erred in dismissing with prejudice his civil RICO claim and by finding that it would be futile to grant leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2007). While courts should \u201cfreely give\u201d leave to amend a pleading prior to trial, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2), we have held that a court does not abuse its discretion if it denies leave to amend where the amendment would be futile. <em>Campbell v. Emory Clinic, </em>166 F.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">To establish a federal civil RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), a plaintiff must show conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of \u201cracketeering activity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). In order to obtain standing under RICO, the plaintiff must suffer an injury in his business or property. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c); <em>Bivens Gardens Office Bldg., Inc. v. Barnett Banks of Fla., Inc., </em>140 F.3d 898, 906 (11th Cir.1998). We decline Keller\u2019s invitation to find an exception to our precedent stating that personal injury and resulting pecuniary losses are not cognizable under RICO. <em>Grogan v. Platt, </em>835 F.2d 844, 847-48 (11th Cir.1988). Since Keller can assert only personal injury damages, the district court correctly dismissed Keller\u2019s RICO claim and found that amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">II. FDCA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">With a few exceptions irrelevant to this ease, actions brought \u201cfor the enforcement, or to restrain violations\u201d of the FDCA \u201cshall be by and in the name of the United States.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337(a), (b)(1). In no situation does the FDCA provide for a private cause of action. <em>Ellis v. C.R. Bard, Inc., </em>311 F.3d 1272, 1284 n. 10 (11th Cir.2002). Accordingly, to the extent that Keller brought claims for the enforcement or to restrain violations of the FDCA, the district court was proper to dismiss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">To the extent that Keller believes the district court erred by dismissing his remaining state-law claims with prejudice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>we note that these claims were actually dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice, <em>see </em>Dkt. 76 at 16, and we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to do so. <em>See Estate of Amergi v. Palestinian Auth., </em>611 F.3d 1350, 1356 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\">. Keller also alleged that the United States government violated the Federal Tort Claims Act by failing to investigate his complaint. However, Keller has voluntarily dismissed all claims against the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. To the extent that Keller argues that the district court erred by denying Keller\u2019s motion to strike, by construing a motion to dismiss as one for judgment on the pleadings, and by not liberally construing his briefs, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that a district court has broad discretion in managing its docket); <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1307 n. 13 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that the district court may construe a motion to dismiss that was filed after an answer as a request for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-18\">. Keller argues in his reply brief that the district court erred in dismissing his claims involving violations of international law. However, \"we do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
