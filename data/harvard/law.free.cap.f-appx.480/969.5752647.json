The district court sentenced Jones to concurrent terms of 51 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts 1 and 3, a consecutive term of 7 years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2, and a consecutive term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Jones argues that the part of his sentence consisting of the statutory mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He further argues that, even if the statute is not facially unconstitutional, it was unconstitutional as applied to him because he received the 25-year consecutive sentence and his codefendant did not. Finally, he argues for the first time on appeal that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the mandatory minimum sentence should only have been imposed by unanimous jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the constitutionality of a statute and to the constitutionality of a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 770 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3399, 177 L.Ed.2d 313 (2010). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error only. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number><em>States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">\u201cThe Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments, contains a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1256 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and italics omitted). The proportionality principle \u201cforbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343 (11th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). This court recently observed that it has never found a term of imprisonment to violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has emphasized that substantial deference is owed to the legislative branch in reviewing criminal penalties and has insisted on judicial restraint in this area. <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 998-99, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2703-04, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991). \u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">In contrast to a facial constitutional challenge, which \u201casserts that a law always operates unconstitutionally,\u201d an as-applied challenge \u201caddresses whether a statute is unconstitutional on the facts of a particular case or to a particular party.\u201d <em>Harris v. Mexican Specialty Foods, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), any person who brandishes a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment, which must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and (D)(ii). Further, an individual who sustains \u201ca second or subsequent conviction under this subsection ... shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years,\u201d which also must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) and (D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the 25-year mandatory minimum consecutive sentence for violating \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) is not a grossly disproportionate punishment for a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d under \u00a7 924(c), and therefore is not unconstitutional on its face. We also conclude that it was not unconstitutional as applied, because Jones\u2019s codefendant was not convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C), and was not similarly situated to him. Finally, Jones\u2019s argument that the mandatory minimum sentence should only have been imposed by unanimous jury verdict is both contrary to binding precedent in this circuit and irreconcilable with his having entered a guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1050 (11th Cir.2002) (holding <em>Apprendi </em>inapplicable to convictions under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Jones\u2019s total sentence of 435 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
