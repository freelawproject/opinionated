The probation officer calculated an adjusted offense level of 25, which, combined with Titus\u2019s criminal history category of VI, resulted in a guidelines imprisonment range of 110 to 137 months. At sentencing, the district court upwardly departed by four levels based on Titus\u2019s extensive criminal history, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), bringing Titus\u2019s guidelines sentencing range to 151 to 188 months. The court sentenced Titus to two concurrent 180-month prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Titus challenges the upward departure, arguing that it resulted in a sentence that was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing as outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that because the Guidelines treat crack offenses, like his, more harshly than offenses involving powder cocaine, a high-end guidelines sentence would have been sufficient to take into account his criminal history. We review for reasonableness a district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Because Titus did not raise this issue at sentencing, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Contrary to Titus\u2019s suggestion, nothing requires a district court to consider the disparity between sentences for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine, <em>see United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), much less does failure to do so amount to plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Moreover, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Titus\u2019s criminal history score underrepresented his past conduct. Titus\u2019s criminal history score was three points higher than the score required to put him in category VI&amp;emdash;the highest criminal history category. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328 (5th Cir.2004). Over a dozen convictions were omitted from that score, including one for assaulting a police officer and three other assault convictions. Accordingly, the court did not err in departing upward based on Titus\u2019s extensive criminal history and its finding that Titus was not likely to stop his criminal conduct. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
