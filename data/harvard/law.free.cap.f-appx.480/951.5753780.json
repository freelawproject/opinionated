The district court ruled that Faile\u2019s untimely motion to amend was not supported by good cause. The district court also ruled that Estee Lauder could not be liable for an injury allegedly caused by a Dillard\u2019s employee and that Faile \u201coffer[ed] no evidence\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Dillard\u2019s caused Faile to contract an antibiotic-resistant strain of staph infection in her right eyelid. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Faile filed in a Florida court a complaint against Estee Lauder and Dillard\u2019s, and the two companies removed the complaint to the district court based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(1). Faile alleged that she was \u201cinjured when a store employee, located at the Clinique/Estee Lauder eounter[,] negligently applied makeup to [Faile\u2019s] ... eyelid\u201d and used \u201ccosmetics and/or cosmetic applicators\u201d that had not been \u201cproperly cleaned ... by the store[ ].\u201d Faile complained that Estee Lauder and Dillard\u2019s were negligent in four ways: (1) \u201c[cheating a hazardous condition by failing to properly clean its cosmetics and/or applicators\u201d; (2) \u201c[flailing to warn [Faile] of the hazardous condition\u201d; (3) \u201c[flailing to have a safety or cleaning program in place to insure the sterility of its makeup products\u201d; and (4) \u201c[flailing to properly train its employees on proper makeup application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">After Estee Lauder and Dillard\u2019s moved for summary judgment, and after the deadline for amending the pleadings in the scheduling order, Faile moved to amend her complaint. The district court denied Faile\u2019s motion to amend, and the district court entered summary judgment in favor of Estee Lauder and Dillard\u2019s. The district court ruled that Estee Lauder \u201c[could] not be held liable for the negligence, if any, of Dillard\u2019s.\u201d The district court also ruled that Faile failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact about whether the \u201cmakeover, or any negligence on Dillard\u2019s part, caused the staph infection\u201d in Faile\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Faile\u2019s untimely motion to amend her complaint to allege that Estee Lauder had negligently failed to train Dillard\u2019s employees how to apply makeup. Faile moved to amend her complaint more than five months after the deadline to amend pleadings had expired, less than one month before the date scheduled for trial, and after Estee Lauder and Dillard\u2019s had moved for summary judgment. <em>See Lowe\u2019s Home Ctrs., Inc. v. Olin Corp., </em>313 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b), after the expiration of the deadline for amending the pleadings, \u201cas delineated in the court\u2019s scheduling order, the [plaintiff] must show good cause why leave to amend the complaint should be granted.\u201d <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir.2007). The standard delineated in Rule 16 \u201cprecludes modification [of the scheduling order] unless the schedule cannot \u2018be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1417, 1418 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting advisory committee\u2019s note to Rule 16). Faile learned during discovery that an employee of Dillard\u2019s had applied her makeup, and Faile already had alleged in her complaint that she had been \u201cinjured [by] a store employee.\u201d And Faile\u2019s proposed amendment would have unfairly prejudiced Estee Lauder by materially changing the complaint to hold it liable for the alleged actions of a Dillard\u2019s employee. Faile offered no good cause for her untimely motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">The district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of Estee Lauder. Faile failed to produce any evidence that Estee Lauder was responsible for Faile\u2019s injury. Faile complained that her staph infection was caused by Estee Lauder failing to sterilize, warn of a lack of sterilization, or establish a program to sterilize its makeup, but Faile\u2019s expert witness, Dr. David Reifsnyder, an infectious disease specialist, testified that \u201c[t]here\u2019s been no instance of a staph in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>fection from unclean makeup\u201d and tainted makeup caused \u201cpseudomonas, which is an entirely different bacteria.\u201d And Faile failed to establish that the makeup and applicators were owned or controlled by Estee Lauder. Cindy Hubbard, a field sales vice president of Clinique, testified that the \u201c[products on display in the store are from Dillard\u2019s inventory, as are the products used during demonstrations and makeovers.\u201d Faile also complained that Estee Lauder failed to train its employees how to apply makeup properly, but Faile alleged in her complaint that the makeup was applied by a Dillard\u2019s employee. Estee Lauder could not be liable for any alleged negligence of Dillard\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The district court also did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of Dillard\u2019s. Under Florida law, a plaintiff must satisfy the \u201cmore likely than not standard of causation\u201d by establishing that the defendant \u201cprobably caused the ... injury.\u201d <em>Gooding v. Univ. Hosp. Bldg., Inc., </em>445 So.2d 1015, 1018 (Fla.1984). Faile\u2019s expert witnesses refused to opine that Dillard\u2019s \u201cmore likely than not\u201d caused Faile\u2019s staph infection. Dr. Mohamed Kassem testified that \u201cit\u2019s very, very difficult to say where [Faile\u2019s staph infection] is coming from.\u201d Dr. William Bone, an infectious disease specialist, \u201cd[id]n\u2019t have an opinion\u201d about whether the makeover caused Faile\u2019s infection because it is \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d to identify the source of a bacteria that is \u201cubiquitous, it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Although Dr. James Gorry, Faile\u2019s optometrist, stated in a letter that there was a \u201cstrong possibility that the \u2018make over\u2019 triggered the infection,\u201d under Florida law, \u201c \u2018[a] mere possibility of ... causation is not enough,\u2019 \u201d <em>Gooding, </em>445 So.2d at 1018 (quoting Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 41 (4th ed.1971)). Faile testified that the symptoms of the staph infection manifested \u201ctwo hours after the make over,\u201d but Dr. Reifsnyder testified that the incubation period for a staph infection \u201c[could] be sometimes as short as one or two days\u201d and \u201cis usually four to ten days.\u201d Faile argues that \u201cit has become clear through discovery ... that she suffered some kind of trauma to her ... eyelid ... which opened a portal [for] the staph bacteria\u201d to enter her body, but Faile presented no evidence to support her theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Dillard\u2019s.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
