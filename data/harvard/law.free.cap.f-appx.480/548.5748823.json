First, Hamby argues on appeal that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by finding that his vision problems \u2014 in particular, his esotro-pia and amblyopia \u2014 were not severe. Second, he asserts that the ALJ failed to consider his vision impairments in combination with his other impairments. Third, Hamby argues that the ALJ erred in failing to question the vocational expert about his vision impairments. Fourth, Hamby contends that the ALJ failed to develop the record by ordering a consultative exam of his vision problems. Finally, Hamby argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision that he did not suffer from disabling pain was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">We review a Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59. We review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, an ALJ must evaluate the claimant\u2019s case with respect to the following five criteria, as set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520: (1) is the individual performing substantial gainful activity; (2) does he have a severe impairment; (3) does he have a severe impairment that meets or equals an impairment specifically listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; (4) can he perform his past relevant work; and (5) based on his age, education, and work experience, can he perform other work of the sort found in the national economy. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">An impairment is \u201csevere\u201d if it \u201csignificantly limits claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Cray-ton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cBasic work activities\u201d include: (1) physical functions such as walking, standing, sitting, lifting, pulling, reaching, carrying or handling; (2) capacities for seeing, hearing and speaking; (3) understanding, carrying out and remembering simple instructions; (4) use of judgment; (5) responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers and usual work situations; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>and (6) dealing with changes in a routine work setting. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We agree with the district court that there is no reversible error here. The medical records show that Hamby had good overall eye health, could see 20/15 with both eyes with corrective lenses, and had good peripheral and color vision. He was advised that he needed to wear glasses for near work only \u201cas needed.\u201d He could still drive during daylight hours and was able to watch television. There was no analysis in the medical records explaining how Hamby\u2019s esotropia and amblyopia affected his ability to work. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that occasional blurred vision or crossed eyes would not pose a significant limitation to Hamby\u2019s ability to do basic work activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Where a claimant has alleged several impairments, the Commissioner has a duty to consider the impairments in combination and to determine whether the combined impairments render the claimant disabled. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2002). This requirement is met if the ALJ states that the claimant \u201cdid not have an impairment <em>or combination of impairments </em>\u201d that would amount to a disability. <em>Id. </em>at 1224-25 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In this case, the ALJ specifically listed Hamby\u2019s alleged impairments&amp;emdash;including his vision impairments&amp;emdash;and concluded that Hamby \u201cdoes not have an impairment or combination of impairments that could reasonably\u201d result in limitations amounting to a qualifying disability. Therefore, we find no merit in Hamby\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to consider the combination of Hamby\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">In order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question that comprises all of the- claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir.2011). However, the ALJ is not required to include impairments in the hypothetical that the ALJ has properly found to be unsupported. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Here, the ALJ properly found that Hamby\u2019s testimony regarding his subjective symptoms was unsupported, such that the ALJ was not required to include those impairments in the hypothetical to the vocational expert. Therefore, we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">\u201cIt is well-established that the ALJ has a basic duty to develop a full and fair record. Nevertheless, the claimant bears the burden of proving that he is disabled, and, consequently, he is responsible for producing evidence in support of his claim.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted); <em>see 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a) (stating that the claimant \u201cmust furnish medical and other evidence that [the ALJ] can use to reach conclusions about [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairment(s)\u201d). \u201cThe administrative law judge has a duty to develop the record where appropriate but is not required to order a consultative examination as long as the record contains sufficient evidence for the administrative law judge to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1269 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Here, there was sufficient evidence for the ALJ to make an informed decision. The record contained several eye exams, including a very recent one. The ALJ also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>questioned Hamby about his vision impairments. We find no error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through his own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. The pain standard requires evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (1) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain or (2) an objective determination that the medical condition could reasonably be expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">If the ALJ decides not to credit the claimant\u2019s testimony, the ALJ must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so. <em>Id. </em>Here, the ALJ\u2019s decision discussed at-length how the objective medical evidence was inconsistent with Hamby\u2019s reports of pain. Sufficient evidence supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
