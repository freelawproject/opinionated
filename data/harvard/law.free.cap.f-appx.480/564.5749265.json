He presents four issues on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Aguila-Urbay argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his involvement in illicit activities other than the offense charged and that the evidence should have been excluded under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). He asserts that the evidence of his involvement in illicit activities was not inextricably intertwined with the evidence presented at trial because the evidence was not vital to the government\u2019s case against him. He contends that the evidence referencing his involvement in illicit activities should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Finally, Aguila-Urbay argues that the court allowed the admission of multiple hearsay statements without allowing him an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Specifically, those statements concerned how an undercover officer learned that Aguila-Urbay would be interested in certain types of weapons. Aguila-Urbay concludes that, based on the admission of improper evidence at trial, his conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1365 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1540, 179 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011). However, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the question of whether hearsay statements are testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1226 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations omitted). A limiting instruction may be sufficient to cure the risk of undue prejudice in specific circumstances. <em>Mateos, </em>623 F.3d at 1365. We presume that the jury follows the court\u2019s instructions. <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>996 F.2d 1073, 1088 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>1993). We will only reverse an evidentiary ruling when it has affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Extrinsic evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is inherently prejudicial to the defendant and may cause the jury to \u201cconvict the defendant not for the offense charged but for the extrinsic offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1205 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Thus, under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), \u201c[e]vi-dence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). We use a three-part test to determine whether other bad acts are admissible under Rule 404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">First, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\"><em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1203 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1600, 179 L.Ed.2d 499 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Intrinsic evidence, or evidence that is \u201cnot extrinsic,\u201d is not covered by Rule 404(b). <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). Evidence of criminal activity other than the offense charged is intrinsic if it is \u201c(1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Evidence is also intrinsic if it pertains to the \u201cchain of events explaining the context, motive and set-up of the crime, ... or forms an integral and natural part of an account of the crime....\u201d <em>United States v. McLean, </em>138 F.3d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Intrinsic evidence is still subject to Rule 403 balancing. <em>United States v. Utter, </em>97 F.3d 509, 514-15 (11th Cir.1996). Under Rule 403, evidence should be excluded if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1276 (quotation omitted). The major function of Rule 403 is to exclude evidence \u201cof scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Utter, </em>97 F.3d at 514-15 (quotations omitted). Further, Rule 403 \u201cis an extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly since it permits the trial court to exclude concededly probative evidence.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1276 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThe nature of the government\u2019s evidence against a defendant is meant to be prejudicial, for if all evidence were favorable, there would be no trial.\u201d Therefore, we ask \u201cnot whether the evidence itself is prejudicial, but rather whether its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d Thus, the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403 weighs in favor of admissibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">In addition to certain evidence not being admissible under Rule 404(b), the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prohibits the admission of certain forms of hearsay, specifically testimonial, out of court statements, unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a previous opportunity to cross-examine the de-clarant. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2009). Hearsay \u201cis a statement, other than one made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). The Confrontation Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\">We have long recognized that: [statements by out of court witnesses to law enforcement officials may be admitted as non-hearsay if they are relevant to explain the course of the officials\u2019 subsequent investigative actions, and the probative value of the evidence\u2019s non-hearsay purpose is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice caused by the impermissible hearsay use of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1288 (quotation omitted). Further, \u201c[i]f the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\u201d <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1364 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1540, 179 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011); Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence at trial referencing Aguila-Urbay's involvement in illicit activity other than the charged offense because the references were inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense. It was necessary for the jury to understand how witness and undercover officer Perez met Aguila-Urbay, and it was part of the chain of events leading to the discussions about weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Further, the references should not have been excluded under Rule 403. Aguila-Urbay\u2019s defense was that he only discussed the weapons transaction, but that he never took any action relating to the discussions. A large portion of the evidence that the Government presented at trial was in the form of tape recordings of conversations that Aguila-Urbay had with Perez and co-defendant Hamayel. The jury could use those transcripts and recording to evaluate the truth of Aguila-Urbay\u2019s defense. Moreover, the district court\u2019s instructions regarding the proper use of the evidence cured any prejudice resulting to Aguila-Urbay. Thus, the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudice effect the evidence would have on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Next, the government witness\u2019s responses to the government\u2019s questions as to where he got information regarding Aguila-Urbay were not hearsay and, therefore, were not violative of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1287. The responses demonstrated why the government witness took specific investigatory action and were not to show the truth of the statements. Finally, the district court instructed the jury that these statements were <em>not </em>to be considered for the truth of the matter asserted and were only to give the jury context to why Perez acted a specific way. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to its evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Aguila-Urbay argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. He contends that there was no evidence presented that a meeting of the minds or an agreement to commit a crime ever occurred, in part, because his co-conspirator told an undercover officer that he wanted Aguila-Urbay taken out of the venture. Further, Aguila-Urbay argues that there were no steps taken in further-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>anee of the alleged conspiracy, and no evidence was presented that he was actually pursuing the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We review whether evidence presented at trial was sufficient to convict a defendant <em>de novo. United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2006). In considering the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor, and affirm the conviction if, based on this evidence, \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Nolan, </em>223 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). It is not necessary that the evidence presented at trial excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or is wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Faust, </em>456 F.3d at 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government must prove \u201c(1) that an agreement existed between two or more persons to commit a crime; (2) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined or participated in the conspiracy; and (3) a conspirator performed an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1294 (11th Cir.2006). A conspiratorial agreement \u201cmay be proven by circumstantial evidence, including inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circumstantial evidence of a scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). A defendant\u2019s agreement to join a conspiracy may be inferred from acts that further the conspiracy\u2019s purpose. <em>United States v. Brenson, </em>104 F.3d 1267, 1282 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cEvery member of the conspiracy need not be an active participant in every phase of the conspiracy so long as he is a party to the general conspiratorial agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>703 F.2d 1243, 1250 (11th Cir.1983). Thus, one may be found guilty of participating a conspiracy even though his role is minor in the overall scheme. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1326 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cThe knowledge requirement is satisfied when the Government shows a defendant\u2019s awareness of the essential nature of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d at 1294. Further, the government does not need to prove that the defendants accomplished the purpose of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1002 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe overt act requirement in the conspiracy statute can be satisfied much more easily. Indeed, the act can be innocent in nature, provided it furthers the purpose of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">It is unlawful under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j) for an individual to possess a stolen firearm, which was part of interstate commerce, where the individual knew or had reason to know that the firearm was stolen. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1127 n. 1, 1129 (11th Cir.2008). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o), it is unlawful \u201cfor any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(a)(3), it is unlawful to \u201cto transport, ship or cause to be transported, or receive any explosive materials\u201d if an individual is not a licensee or permit-tee.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">There was sufficient evidence presented to show that Aguila-Urbay agreed to commit an offense that would violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(a)(3) if the offense were completed. Based on the testimony at trial of Perez, the evidence showed Aguila-Urbay took part in negotiations for a weapons transaction that would involve firearms, silencers, machine guns, and explosives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Further, Perez\u2019s extensive testimony-showed that Aguila-Urbay had knowledge of the conspiracy and voluntarily joined the conspiracy. Perez\u2019s testimony that he had discussions with Aguila-Urbay about the quantities and prices of the weapons and that Aguila-Urbay met with the ultimate buyers of the weapons showed that Aguila-Urbay performed overt acts in furtherance of the agreement. Finally, even after Aguila-Urbay\u2019s co-conspirator told Perez that he no longer wanted Aguila-Urbay involved in the weapons transaction, evidence showed that Aguila-Urbay continued to participate in the conspiracy and volunteered to transport the weapons. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support Aguila-Urbay\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Aguila-Urbay argues that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to grant his motions for an eviden-tiary hearing on his motions for disclosure of exculpatory evidence and to suppress his post-arrest statement that were made after the government disclosed two Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) reports concluding that the FBI was ending its terrorism investigation against Aguila-Ur-bay. Aguila-Urbay made these motions at the eve of trial, immediately after the government disclosed the FBI reports, and the district court denied these motions as untimely. In his request for exculpatory materials, Aguila-Urbay requested a hearing to inquire into the basis of the FBI reports. With respect to his motion to suppress his post-arrest statement, Agui-la-Urbay argues that, had he received the FBI reports in a timely manner, he would have filed a timely motion to suppress regarding the issue of the FBI\u2019s potential motivation to secure his confession. Because of the court\u2019s refusal to hold a full hearing on his motions, Aguila-Urbay contends that he was deprived of an opportunity to explore the implications of the FBI reports fully and to react to the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\"><em>Brady </em>Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>alleged <em>Brady </em>violations. <em>United States v, Jones, </em>601 F.3d 1247, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). A <em>Brady </em>violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights occurs where the prosecution suppresses material evidence favorable to the defendant. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). We have held that \u201cregardless of request, favorable, exculpatory or impeachment evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Scheer, </em>168 F.3d 445, 451 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). In order to show a reasonable probability that the result would have been different, a defendant must show that the government\u2019s eviden-tiary suppression undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The typical <em>Brady </em>claim involves \u201cthe discovery, <em>after </em>trial of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Kubiak, </em>704 F.2d 1545, 1549 (11th Cir.1983) (quotations omitted). However, a <em>Brady </em>claim can also involve a mere delay in the transmission of the material to the defense and \u201cnot outright omission that remained undiscovered until after trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The delayed disclosure of <em>Brady </em>evidence compels reversal only when the defendant demonstrates prejudice, in that the delay effectively rendered the material unusable. <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412, 1426 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The government is not required to disclose the contents of files or submit them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>for <em>in camera </em>review simply based on the defendant\u2019s unsupported contention that they might contain information of significance to his case. <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1189 (11th Cir.2006). The district court does not have to order discovery based on mere speculation as to whether the material would contain exculpatory evidence because to do so would \u201cconvert <em>Brady </em>into a discovery device and impose an undue burden upon the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Suppression of Post-Arrest Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We apply a mixed standard of review to the denial of a suppression motion, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1326 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). The voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1326. The district court\u2019s decision as to whether to hold an eviden-tiary hearing on a motion to suppress is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>203 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2000). Even when a district court erroneously denies a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the error is harmless if, in the absence of the confession, the evidence against the defendant is still sufficient to support his conviction. <em>United States v. Burgest, </em>519 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion as untimely is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 864 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that a district court may set a deadline for the filing of all pretrial motions and requests. Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(c). Any motions not filed by the deadline are considered to be waived. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). The district court may grant relief from the waiver if the party is able to show good cause for the late filing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>713 F.2d 633, 649 (11th Cir.1983) (concluding that good cause existed where the government did not give notice of its intent to introduce evidence until after the deadline for filing a motion to suppress had passed). A district court may deny a motion to suppress as untimely without conducting a hearing, even where the motion concerns the voluntariness of statements made to the police. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>792 F.2d 1019, 1025 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that while it may be permissible for the district court to consider a motion to suppress involuntary statements despite its untimeliness, the district court is not required to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Defendants are not entitled to an evi-dentiary hearing based on a \u201cpromise\u201d to prove at the hearing that which they did not specifically allege in their motion to suppress. <em>Cooper, </em>203 F.3d at 1285 (quotation omitted). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">[w]here a defendant in a motion to suppress fails to allege facts that if proved would require the grant of relief, the law does not require that the district court hold a hearing independent of the trial to receive evidence on any issue necessary to the determination of the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlM\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cA motion to suppress must in every critical respect be sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented. A court need not act upon general or conclusory assertions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Although the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is fully applicable during a custodial interrogation, a suspect may still waive his right to remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>silent after being properly advised of it if he does so \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1326 (quotation omitted). The government has the burden of showing the knowing and intelligent nature of a waiver and must show (1) that a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent was relinquished voluntarily in \u201cthat it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception\u201d and (2) that the waiver was \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If a court finds that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal[s] both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension,\u201d the right to remain silent has been validly waived. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Because the only issue in determining whether the right to remain silent has been validly waived is whether the defendant\u2019s decision to waive his rights was knowing and voluntary, the only relevant state of mind is that of the defendant himself. <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (holding that law enforcement\u2019s subjective motives are irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether a waiver was voluntarily and knowingly waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">Aguila-Urbay\u2019s motion to suppress his post-arrest statement was untimely filed, and he failed to show good cause for excusing his untimely motion. Despite Aguila-Urbay\u2019s assertion that the government\u2019s disclosure of two FBI reports constitute <em>Brady </em>materials and that the reports supported his motion to suppress his post-arrest statements, the FBI reports do not bear on the voluntariness of Aguila-Urbay\u2019s post-arrest statements because there is no connection between the FBI reports and Aguila-Urbay\u2019s post-arrest statements based on the plain language of the reports. To the extent that Aguila-Urbay argues that the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing with respect to his motion for <em>Brady </em>materials, the district court did not abuse its discretion in its decision not to hold an evidentia-ry hearing. The reports, based on their plain language were not favorable to the defense of this case and were not <em>Brady </em>materials. The district court did not have to investigate the reports further at an evidentiary hearing or even order discovery based on Aguila-Urbay\u2019s \u201cmere speculation\u201d that the government possessed exculpatory materials. <em>Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Aguila-Urbay argues that the district court misapplied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors when it sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, which constituted both the applicable guideline range and the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the offense. Aguila-Urbay asserts that his co-conspirator was sentenced to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment, despite his co-conspirator\u2019s larger role in the conspiracy. Aguila-Urbay contends that the only reason for the difference in sentences was the fact that his co-conspirator spared the government the need to go to trial, which Aguila-Urbay argues is not a legitimate consideration under the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We generally review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court\u2019s sentence need not be the most appropriate one, it need only be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). We \u201cmay set aside a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable based on the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although we do \u201cnot automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We undertake a two-part inquiry in evaluating a sentence\u2019s reasonableness. First, we ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous factors, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). If there are no such errors, the second step is to review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness by \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Although one of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors focuses on the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, a defendant may not rely on another co-conspirators\u2019 sentence to show unwarranted disparities unless the defendant has first shown that he is similarly situated. <em>McNair, </em>605 F.3d at 1231-32. \u201c[T]here is no unwarranted disparity when a cooperating defendant pleads guilty and receives a lesser sentence than a defendant who proceeds to trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cDefendants who cooperate with the government and enter a written plea agreement are not similarly situated to a defendant who provides no assistance to the government and proceeds to trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOn a practical level, it would seem patently unreasonable to endorse a regime in which a defendant could steadfastly withhold cooperation from the authorities and then cry foul when a coconspirator benefits from rendering substantial assistance to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The district court stated that the difference between Aguila-Urba/s sentence and his co-conspirator\u2019s sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment was based on the fact that his co-conspirator pled guilty and accepted responsibility for his offense. Thus, Aguila-Urbay failed to show that he was similarly situated to his co-conspirator and failed to show that there was an unwarranted sentencing disparity between his sentence and his co-conspirator\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tence. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Aguila-Urbay failed to show that his sentence was unreasonable, and we affirm Aguila-Ur-bay*s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Based upon the foregoing and our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Aguila-Urbay\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\">. Aguila-Urbay\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
