L. c. 140D, \u00a7\u00a7 1-35, governs the rights and duties of creditors and obligors (borrowers or consumers) engaged in consumer credit transactions. One type of consumer credit transaction to which the MCCCDA applies is the refinancing of a consumer\u2019s home where the consumer grants a mortgage to the creditor to secure the refinancing loan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981), a judge in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has certified the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cMay an obligor [borrower] who grants a mortgage in a consumer credit transaction rescind the transaction under the Massachusetts Consumer Credit Cost Disclosure Act, [G. L. c.] 140D, \u00a7 1 et seq. (the \u2018MCCCDA\u2019), defensively by way of common law recoupment after the expiration of the four year statute of limitations set forth in [\u00a7] 10 (/) of the MCCCDA?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">For the reasons we discuss hereafter, we answer no to the question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The essential background facts are undisputed by the parties. On October 7, 2005, Kenneth May and Valerie Corbin-May, the plaintiffs, refinanced their home in Brockton in a mortgage loan transaction with Summit Mortgage (Summit), for $300,000. The mortgage later was assigned to and is held currently by the defendant here, SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. (Sun-Trust).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 28, 2010, the plaintiffs, facing foreclosure, filed a petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq., in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. In response, SunTrust filed a proof of claim alleging that the plaintiffs owed $329,965.80, including $49,704.47 in arrears, on the mortgage note.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 4, 2010, the plaintiffs sent a letter to SunTrust notifying it of their election to rescind the loan transaction. When SunTrust took no action to terminate its security interest (e.g., by discharging the mortgage), on June 28, the plaintiffs filed an adversary proceeding against SunTrust in the pending Chapter 13 bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>case, seeking rescission of the loan transaction and damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for rescission in count III of their adversary complaint may be summarized as follows: Summit, the original creditor, violated the mandatory notice provisions of \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>of the MCCCDA by presenting the plaintiffs with, and instructing them to postdate and sign, a \u201cStatement of Non-Rescission\u201d; because the notice provision did not comply with those mandatory notice provisions of the MCCCDA, the plaintiffs did not receive the clear and conspicuous disclosure of their right to cancel the transaction required by the MCCCDA; and under c. 140D, \u00a7 10 (i) (3), the plaintiffs may seek to rescind the transaction by way of recoupment as a complete or partial defense to SunTrust\u2019s claim to recover monies allegedly owed under the mortgage note.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On July 13, 2012, SunTrust moved for summary judgment, arguing that because the plaintiffs filed their adversary complaint more than four years after the mortgage loan transaction, their defensive rescission-by-way-of-recoupment claim is time barred by \u00a7 10 <em>(f) </em>of the MCCCDA. The plaintiffs have asserted in response that the time limits of the MCCCDA do not apply when rescission is claimed defensively by way of recoupment because \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) of the MCCCDA allows for recoupment claims at any time. A judge in the Bankruptcy Court, noting conflicting interpretations of the MCCCDA in a number of Bankruptcy Court decisions and a lack of controlling Massachusetts precedent, reported the question set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">2. <em>Statutory scheme. </em>The MCCCDA is modeled after the consumer protection provisions contained in the Federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq. (2012).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See O\u2019Connell vs. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., U.S. Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Court, No. 11-10940-FJB, slip op. at 5 (D. Mass. July 6, 2012) (O\u2019Connell). Both the MCCCDA and TILA were enacted \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.\u201d <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>Central Coop. Bank, </em>226 B.R. 734, 736 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1998), quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Although a consumer credit transaction in theory could be governed by both TILA and the MCCCDA, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System has deemed certain types of Massachusetts consumer credit transactions exempt from TILA, including the one at issue here; as a consequence, such transactions are governed solely by the MCCCDA. See <em>DiVittorio </em>v. <em>HSBC Bank USA, NA, </em>670 F.3d 273, 282 (1st Cir. 2012); <em>Laudani </em>v. <em>Tribeca Lending Corp., </em>401 B.R. 9, 25 n.13 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2009). Nevertheless, because of the close relationship between TILA and the MCCCDA, we interpret the MCCCDA mindful of TILA\u2019s presence and influence. See <em>Fidler, supra </em>at 736 (\u201cBecause TILA was the model on which [M]CCCDA was based, federal court decisions construing TILA are instructive in construing parallel provisions of [M]CCCDA\u201d). See also O\u2019Con-nell, <em>supra </em>at 5 (\u201cAlthough the MCCCDA is the operative law in Massachusetts, its similarity to the TILA requires that the former be construed in accordance with the latter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">a. <em>The right to rescind. </em>Under the MCCCDA, as is true of TILA, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635, in any consumer credit transaction in which a security interest in the borrower\u2019s principal dwelling is granted, the borrower has an automatic right to rescind the transaction within three business days of the transaction\u2019s closing or within three business days of receiving the required rescission forms and other material disclosures from the creditor, whichever is later. G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ngly, if the creditor does not make the required disclosures or properly notify the borrower of his right to rescind at the time the transaction closes, the borrower remains entitled to seek rescission until three days after the creditor does so. This right, however, is subject to a limitation set out in \u00a7 10 (f), which provides that the extended period for exercise of the right of rescission completely ends after four years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But \u00a7 10 also contains a provision, \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3), that, notwithstanding the four-year limitation period in \u00a7 10 (f), preserves a consumer\u2019s \u201cright of recoupment under the laws of the [Commonwealth. \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we discuss <em>infra, </em>we understand \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) to be the focus of the Bankruptcy Court judge\u2019s reported question.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">b. <em>The effects of rescission. </em>Section 10 <em>(b) </em>of the MCCCDA and its implementing regulations define the process and effect of rescission of a consumer credit transaction involving a security interest in the borrower\u2019s principal dwelling. See 209 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.23(4)(a)-(d) (2010). When a borrower rescinds such a transaction, the underlying security interest in the dwelling \u2014 the mortgage \u2014 becomes void and the borrower is no longer hable for finance charges. See G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 <em>(b); </em>209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.23(4)(a). Within twenty days thereafter, the creditor is required to return any monies or property given in relation to the transaction and must also take any additional action necessary to terminate the mortgage. See G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 <em>(b)] </em>209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.23(4)(b). The borrower may retain the property until the creditor has performed these obligations, after which time the borrower \u201cshall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the [borrower] shall tender its reasonable value.\u201d G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>See 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.23(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>We repeat the reported question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cMay [a borrower] who grants a mortgage in a consumer credit transaction rescind the transaction under the [MCCCDA, G. L. c. 140D], defensively by way of common law recoupment after the expiration of the four year statute of limitations set forth in [c. 140D, \u00a7 10 (/)]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Although the Bankruptcy Court judge refers to the common law in framing it, we understand her question to pose an issue of statutory interpretation: does G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3), which provides that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed so as to affect a consumer\u2019s right of recoupment under the laws of the commonwealth^] \u201d entitle the consumer to exercise the right of rescission set out in \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>after the four-year limitation period in \u00a7 10 <em>(f) </em>has expired, as a form of defensive recoupment against the amount the creditor claims to be owed?<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>As is obvious, \u00a7 10 (0 (3) does not provide explicitly for rescission by way of recoupment, or include the word \u201crescission\u201d at all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor does \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3), or any other section of the MCCCDA, define the word \u201crecoupment.\u201d Accordingly, the question we need to answer is whether, apart from \u00a7 10 (z) (3) and the MCCCDA, any \u201claws of the Commonwealth\u201d pertaining to recoupment provide for or recognize rescission as a form of recoupment, at least where rescission is used defensively to meet an obligation due. The parties do not suggest, and we have not found, any Massachusetts statute that does so, or even touches on this issue. We turn, therefore, to the common law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 747 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>392 Mass. 688, 690 (1984) (\u201cWhere the Legislature does not define a term, we presume that its intent is to incorporate the common law definition of the term, \u2018unless the intent to alter it is clearly expressed\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Both recoupment and rescission find their origins in the common law. \u201cRecoupment was a common law concept, a defendant\u2019s claim arising out of the transaction that formed the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s claim; ... it served, if the defendant succeeded on it, to reduce or extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but it could not result in an affirmative recovery for the defendant.\u201d <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>367 Mass. 424, 427-428 (1975). Beginning in the early Nineteenth Century, this court applied the doctrine to contract actions, recognizing the right of a defendant, facing suit for nonpayment on a contract, to assert defensively within the same action a claim for damages due to the plaintiff\u2019s own nonperformance of the same contract. See <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Montague, </em>14 Mass. 282, 285 (1817), overruling <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>1 Mass. 101 (1804). See also <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Guillow, </em>105 Mass. 18, 19-20 (1870) (discussing cases).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The concept of recoupment subsequently was extended beyond cases concerning the sale of goods to actions on promissory notes \u201cgiven in payment of property sold or exchanged.\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>22 Pick. 510, 513 (1839). See <em>Stacy </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>97 Mass. 166, 168 (1867) (defining recoupment as \u201can equitable set-off of damages which ought to be deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s demand\u201d and allowing it in action on promissory note). Overall, recoupment was a significant development in the law because it allowed for \u201cfull and complete justice [to] be done to the parties in a single suit,\u201d thus \u201cavoidfing] circuity of action\u201d caused when parties had no alternative but to bring a separate cross action to assert their defensive claims. <em>Harrington, supra </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Rescission is fundamentally different from recoupment. Rescission is the \u201cunmaking\u201d or \u201cvoidance\u201d of a contract. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1420-1421 (9th ed. 2009). Its primary purpose is to \u201ceffect[] a return to the status quo.\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>418 Mass. 41, 47 (1994). \u201cOrdinarily one seeking rescission of a transaction must restore or offer to restore all that he received under it.\u201d <em>Bellefeuille </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>335 Mass. 262, 266 (1957). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>See <em>Ann &amp; Hope, Inc. </em>v. <em>Muratore, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 223, 230 (1997). However, \u201cwhere complete restoration is not possible, rescission may ... be granted upon such equitable conditions as would amply protect the rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Beliefeuille </em>v. <em>Medeiros, supra. </em>See <em>J.C. Penney Co. </em>v. <em>Schulte Real Estate Co., </em>292 Mass. 42, 45 (1935) (strict return to status quo not essential in suit for rescission \u2014 court may \u201cinsert whatever conditions, if any, justice and equity may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Further, at common law, recoupment and rescission were consistently treated as separate, nonoverlapping remedies. See <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Gryzmish, </em>277 Mass. 575, 579-580 (1931) (buyer defrauded in purchase of property may seek rescission or recoupment, not both: \u201c[a]s these are inconsistent remedies, a person who has once elected to pursue one of them cannot afterwards seek the other\u201d; claim for recoupment requires showing of damages by which debt is limited or reduced accordingly); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>162 Mass. 351, 352 (1894) (\u201cWhen the plaintiff discovered the breach of warranty, he could avail himself of his rights in either [sic] of three ways. He might rescind the contract, return the property, and recover back his money; he might set up the breach of warranty as a defence in whole or in part to a claim upon the note, and have his damages allowed by way of recoupment; or he might pay the whole amount of the note and bring a suit for his damages\u201d [citations omitted]); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>183 Mass. 410, 412 (1903) (affirming rule of <em>Gilmore); Whiteside </em>v. <em>Brawley, </em>152 Mass. 133, 134 (1890) (\u201cOf course an action for the breach of a contract goes on the footing of affirming the contract relied on, and therefore is inconsistent with an action going on the footing of rescission\u201d). See also <em>Ohl </em>v. <em>A.L. Smith Iron Works, </em>66 F.2d 93, 99 (1st Cir. 1933) (party pleading breach of warranty by way of recoupment also cannot bring affirmative cross action for same claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">. The language and structure of \u00a7 10 appear to reflect these common-law differences between rescission and recoupment. In particular, the separate treatment of rescission and recoupment by \u00a7 10 is in harmony with the common-law concepts of each, as well as with the common-law premise that the two are separate remedies. Thus, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), (b), </em>and <em>(f) </em>deal exclusively with rescission, and \u00a7 10 (z) (3) deals separately with recoupment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Section 10 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(f) </em>impose strict time requirements on exercise of the right to rescind: \u00a7 10 (a) requires a borrower to rescind within three days of the transaction, extended if the creditor fails to comply fully with its disclosure requirements, but \u00a7 10 (f) terminates the right to rescind completely after four years. Moreover, consistent with the common-law concept of rescission generally, as set out in \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>rescinding a transaction under the MCCCDA essentially undoes the transaction: the security interest held by the creditor is cancelled, any money or property given in relation to the transaction (such as a down payment) is returned to the borrower, and the borrower then must return the property or, if that is inequitable, its reasonable value. See 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.23(4)(a)-(d). In other words, as is true of common-law rescission principles, the apparent intent and effect of rescission under \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>is to return the creditor and the borrower to the status quo ante \u2014 i.e., to how things were <em>before </em>the transaction existed \u2014 or as reasonably close to it as fairness permits. In contrast, under \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3), the right of recoupment contains no time limitations on assertion of the right. This accords with the common-law understanding of recoupment as a defensive mechanism whereby a defendant may, at any time, assert claims against the plaintiff in reduction of the plaintiff\u2019s claims when those claims arise out of the same transaction; it is an offsetting of liabilities <em>within </em>a transaction. See <em>Bose Corp., </em>367 Mass. at 427-428.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Recognizing that our common-law definition and understanding of recoupment is consistent with the language and structure of \u00a7 10, we are bound to conclude that insofar as the MCCC-DA\u2019s provision for the right of recoupment in \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) looks to and incorporates the common law, it does not include rescission as one type of defensive recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The plaintiffs argue against this conclusion because \u201cmuch of the relief available to a borrower through rescission . . . has the effect of reducing amounts sought by a creditor that is foreclosing a mortgage, suing on a promissory note, or pursuing a claim against a bankruptcy estate.\u201d That may be so, but it is. beside the point here because rescission and recoupment are separate, and common-law recoupment does not include the use of rescission as a form of recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Although we have answered the reported question, we address briefly the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory arguments. They first argue that legislative intent for rescission to be available by way of recoupment is \u201cevident\u201d because \u00a7 10 deals only with rescission rights, while damages for violations of the MCCCDA are addressed in G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 32, a \u201cwholly separate\u201d section of the MCCCDA. This is not the case. Section 10 states explicitly that if a creditor violates any part of the section a court may award damages \u201cunder [\u00a7 32] <em>not relating to the right to rescind\u2019\u2019</em>(emphasis added). G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7 10 (g).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The plaintiffs contend also that prohibiting them from rescinding their transaction by way of recoupment would render \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) ineffective as a savings clause and ultimately superfluous because, without rescission, there would be no more claims to save. See <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 868 (2000). However, we agree with SunTrust that our reading of \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) does not render the section meaningless. Rather, because \u00a7 10 (g) explicitly allows for damages as a form of relief for violations of \u00a7 10 in addition to rescission, a party clearly may seek those damages defensively, via recoupment, after expiration of the statutory period in \u00a7 10 (f). See O\u2019Connell, <em>supra </em>at 17 n.11.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>even though rescission is not a form of recoupment, \u00a7 10 (z) (3) remains a viable and relevant provision of the MCCCDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Moreover, borrowers like the plaintiffs who may have a claim for damages to assert defensively in recoupment against a creditor\u2019s claim are not limited to the statutory damages provided in \u00a7 32 in the MCCCDA. For example, borrowers can assert a claim for unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A against the creditor, so long as the alleged c. 93A violation is connected to the underlying credit transaction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The fact that borrowers may assert any available damages claim in recoupment after expiration of the four-year period for rescission underscores the point that \u00a7 10 (z) (3) is not rendered meaningless without the ability to claim rescission in recoupment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed, we answer the reported question in the negative.

On one side are <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>Central Coop. Bank, </em>226 B.R. 734, 737 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1998), and its progeny, see, e.g., <em>Bettano </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>440 B.R. 13, 15 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2010); <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Fairbanks Capital Corp., </em>281 B.R. 101, 124 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2002), which all concluded that a borrower\u2019s right to recoupment under \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(3) includes the right to rescind the transaction beyond the expiration of the four-year statutory period. On the other side is O\u2019Connell, <em>supra </em>at 8, which concluded that a borrower \u201ccannot rescind a transaction by way of recoupment at all, and . . . may not do so by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>means after the MCCCDA\u2019s four-year expiration date\u201d because rescission is not a form of recoupment and, \u201cby its nature, cannot be accomplished by way of recoupment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In this respect, \u00a7 10 (i) (3) of the MCCCDA differs from TILA, which expressly references rescission by way of recoupment. In particular, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(i)(3) states that \u201c[n]othing in this subsection [addressing rescission rights] affects a consumer\u2019s right of <em>rescission in recoupment </em>under State law\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Section 10 (i) (3) was added to \u00a7 10 of the MCCCDA in 1996. See St. 1996, c. 238, \u00a7 5. The legislative history of \u00a7 10 (i) (3) indicates that it was added as part of a package that sought to conform the MCCCDA with recently enacted amendments to TILA, including the addition to TILA of \u00a7 1635(i)(3), quoted <em>supra. </em>Memorandum from Thomas J. Curry, Commissioner of Banks, to Nancy Merrick, Office of Consumer Affairs &amp; Business Regulation, Sen. Doc. No. 2106, An Act Relative to Interstate Banking &amp; Branching (luly 26, 1996). It is obvious that the Legislature modeled \u00a7 10 (i) (3) on 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(i)(3), but also obvious that it did not do so completely, because the phrase, \u201crescission in recoupment,\u201d does not appear in \u00a7 10 (i) (3). Despite this difference, we do not find anything in the legislative history relating to \u00a7 10 (i) (3) to suggest that the Legislature\u2019s omission of the word \u201crescission\u201d \u2014\u2022 and more particularly the phrase, \u201crescission in recoupment\u201d \u2014 was an intentional rejection of the idea that rescission used defensively might be a form of recoupment. As a consequence, we do not place weight on the language difference between \u00a7 10 (i) (3) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(i)(3) in answering the certified question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Consumer credit transactions are matters of contract, and therefore we focus on recoupment as applied to contract actions. But at common law, recoupment was not limited solely to contract actions. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Guillow, </em>105 Mass. 18, 20-21 (1870) (\u201cThe fact that the plaintiff sues in tort does not complicate the matter. It is not more difficult, or less desirable, in such an action, to have the whole litigation adjusted in a single suit .... The doctrine of recoupment is not novel, but is as ancient as the common law, and was in early times applied to actions founded in tort\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">General Laws c. 140D, \u00a7 10 <em>(g), </em>provides: \u201cIn any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under [\u00a7 32] not relating to the right to rescind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Section 32 allows a person to seek damages when a \u201ccreditor fails to comply with any requirement imposed under [c. 140D] or any rule or regulation issued thereunder including any requirement under [\u00a7 10].\u201d G.

See <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Fairbanks Capital Corp., </em>281 B.R. at 124, quoting <em>Fidler, </em>226 B.R. at 737 (recoupment claim in bankruptcy context requires that: \u201c(1) the TILA [or MCCCDA] violation and the creditor\u2019s debt arose from the same transaction, (2) [the claimant] is asserting her claim as a defense, and (3) the main action is timely\u201d [quotations omitted]). In the present case, both the plaintiffs\u2019 rescission claim and SunTrust\u2019s foreclosure are based on the original extension of credit to the plaintiffs as borrowers \u2014 the 2005 refinancing transaction. Any rights that the plaintiffs assert are related to SunTrust\u2019s claim against them and stem from alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>violations of \u00a7 10 <em>(a)\u2019s </em>disclosure requirements by the creditor (Summit) at the closing. See <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>Central Coop. Bank, </em>210 B.R. 411, 420 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997) (defining original loan refinancing as \u201csame transaction\u201d that gave rise to subsequent rescission claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Here, however, because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim alleging a violation of G. L. c. 93A is tied to their asserted right to rescission, which does not exist, their c. 93A claim currently does not appear to offer relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In its amicus brief, the National Consumer Law Center advances a strong argument in support of the plaintiffs, essentially asserting that permitting rescission via recoupment is good public policy that \u201cbalances the scales between lenders and consumers\u201d because it permits a borrower to keep his or her home while providing a means for the mortgage holder to be repaid. Notwithstanding the import of this argument as a practical equitable remedy, the fact remains that, at present, the right to rescission in recoupment is simply not a part of the MCCCDA. This is not to say that the statute could not be amended to include a provision allowing for rescission to be used defensively by way of recoupment, but only that in its present form, the MCCCDA does not provide for such a right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
