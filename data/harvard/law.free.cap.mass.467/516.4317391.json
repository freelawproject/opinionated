At the defendant\u2019s subsequent probation revocation hearing, the sole evidence against the defendant was hearsay testimony presented by two police officers indicating that he had committed certain sex offenses against two relatives. Relying upon hearsay evidence that he determined to be substantially reliable and trustworthy, and finding that good cause thus existed for proceeding without a witness having personal knowledge of the evidence presented, a District Court judge concluded that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation, revoked his probation, and ordered him incarcerated. The defendant appealed, arguing that the hearing did not comport with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">More specifically, the defendant claims, first, that the hearsay testimony on which the judge solely relied was not substantially reliable and trustworthy and, consequently, that such evidence was insufficient to permit a finding that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation. Second, because the judge made no separate finding as to good cause for proceeding without a witness with personal knowledge of the evidence presented, as Rule 6(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, at 94 (LexisNexis 2012-2013) (rule 6[b]), on its face requires, the defendant maintains that he was denied due process on this basis as well. Finally, he asserts that, insofar as the district attorney\u2019s office is within the executive branch of government while the probation department is within the judicial branch, an employee of the district attorney\u2019s office impermis-sibly interfered with the probation officer\u2019s conduct of the hearing, in violation of art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Concluding that the defendant was accorded due process and clarifying that rule 6(b) is not to be construed as requiring more than is constitutionally mandated, we affirm the order revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite the facts as presented at the surrender hearing, reserving some facts for later discussion. Officer Jacob Poulin of the Abington police department testified that he took a report on December 5, 2011, from twenty-three year old Amir<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a close friend of his family, Kimberly McDonald. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>McDonald told Poulin that she brought Amir, who had been diagnosed as having Asperger\u2019s syndrome, to the police station at his mother\u2019s request because she was unavailable to do so. Poulin described Amir as being \u201ca bit reserved\u201d but able to tell him \u201cin full detail\u201d about an incident involving the defendant that had occurred the previous day at Amir\u2019s father\u2019s house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">According to Poulin, Amir recounted that on December 4, 2011, he was at his father\u2019s apartment with the defendant and Amir\u2019s then seven year old half-sister, Alana. The defendant \u201cwas making some strange sexual comments,\u201d describing in detail a pornographic film scene, and commenting a number of times on the size of Amir\u2019s penis, which he had seen while Amir was sleeping the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Amir also described to Poulin what he called a \u201clap dance,\u201d when the defendant rubbed his buttocks on Amir\u2019s knee until Amir pushed him away. Alana then went over to the defendant and mimicked the \u201clap dance.\u201d The defendant told Alana, \u201cNo, no, go do that to your brother.\u201d She responded, \u201cNo, no, I can\u2019t do that, he\u2019s my brother.\u201d Amir told his mother about the incident later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After speaking with Amir and McDonald, Poulin and Officer Susan Manning of the Abington police department met with Alana, her mother, and Amir\u2019s father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alana told Manning that while she was alone in the apartment with the defendant and her brother, the defendant began to \u201chump\u201d Amir, who tried to push the defendant away. Alana told Manning that the defendant had both exposed his naked buttocks to her and had described in detail part of a pornographic film he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On December 6, 2011, a criminal complaint issued against the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the same day, probable cause was found to believe that the defendant had violated the conditions of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>probation based on the newly alleged crimes. A probation revocation hearing and a probable cause hearing on the new charges were both scheduled for January 5, 2012. When the probation matter was called, neither the civilian witnesses <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor the police officers appeared, despite having been summonsed by the probation officer. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge granted the probation department\u2019s request for a continuance until January 10, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On January 12, the same judge heard testimony from the probation officer as well as from Poulin and Manning, who testified to the facts described above. After the parties rested, the judge heard closing arguments. The following day, he ruled that the defendant was in violation of the conditions of his probation by virtue of having committed an indecent assault and battery on a person over the age of fourteen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge found that, although all of the evidence before him was hearsay,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the stories of Amir and Alana corroborated one another in three significant respects, and the hearsay thus bore sufficient indicia of reliability. The judge revoked the defendant\u2019s probation, sentencing him to two years in the house of correction, six months to be served and the balance suspended for a two-year period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Hearsay testimony. A </em>determination whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>a violation of probation has occurred lies within the discretion of the hearing judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 111-112 (1990). The Commonwealth must prove a violation of probation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>446 Mass. 54, 59 (2006). Although a probationer is entitled to the due process rights established in <em>Morrisey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471 (1972), and <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scar-pelli, </em>411 U.S. 778 (1973), he need not receive the \u201cfull panoply of constitutional protections applicable at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Durling, supra </em>at 112-113. Accordingly, while \u201c[ujnsubstanti-ated and unreliable hearsay cannot, consistent with due process, be the entire basis of a probation revocation,\u201d \u201c[wjhen hearsay evidence <em>is </em>reliable . . . , then it <em>can </em>be the basis of a revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>458 Mass. 119, 132-133 (2010), citing <em>Durling, supra </em>at 121 (discussing five factors suggesting reliability); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 932 &amp; n.4 (1994) (where only hearsay presented, proper focus of inquiry is reliability of hearsay).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The defendant contends that the judge erred in determining that the hearsay testimony against him bore sufficient indicia of reliability. He asserts that the testimony of Amir, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, was inherently unreliable due to social cognition and communication impairments, and that it was natural for Alana to echo Amir\u2019s story to the police in order to protect her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The hearing judge\u2019s assessment of reliability was supported by the record. Poulin testified that Amir volunteered all of the information regarding the incident, did not struggle to answer questions, and understood that his allegations could result in criminal charges against the defendant. Although the defendant asserts that Amir\u2019s Asperger\u2019s syndrome made him an unreliable witness, he does not contest Amir\u2019s ability to make accurate observations or to offer a truthful report to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The judge also correctly employed the five factors discussed in <em>Patton, supra </em>at 132-133, for assessing the reliability of hearsay evidence. He emphasized that, although the interviews of Amir and Alana had been conducted separately, three elements of their accounts to police independently corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>one another.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Amir and Alana both discussed the incident while it was fresh in their minds, and used very different words, including slang expressions, to describe the defendant\u2019s conduct; there is no indication that Alana merely repeated Amir\u2019s recitation of what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">It is the exclusive province of the hearing judge to assess the weight of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janovich, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 50 (2002). We discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s determination that a probation violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">b. <em>Rule 6(b). </em>In promulgating the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, effective as of January 3, 2000, the District Court sought \u201cto codify the provisions of applicable case law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 759, 762 (2003), quoting commentary to Rule 1 of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra </em>at 80. Rule 6(b) addresses those situations where hearsay evidence alone is submitted to prove a violation of probation based on a probationer\u2019s alleged commission of new crimes. In order to rely on such evidence in those circumstances, the rule provides that the judge must find both that the hearsay evidence is \u201csubstantially trustworthy and demonstrably reliable\u201d and that \u201cthe probation officer has good cause for proceeding without a witness with personal knowledge of the evidence presented.\u201d Rule 6(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra </em>at 94. The defendant asserts that the judge erred in failing to comply with the text of rule 6(b), arguing that a finding of good cause to proceed without live witnesses may not be premised on the reliability of the hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Rule 6 \u201cis based almost exclusively on the opinion in <em>[Darling, supra].\u201d </em>Commentary to Rule 6 of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra </em>at 94 (Rule 6[b] commentary). However, the comment accompanying rule 6 notes that <em>Darling </em>is unclear as to whether the reliability of hearsay evidence may itself constitute good cause for failing to produce a live witness or whether reliability and good cause must be established separately. Rule 6(b) commentary, <em>supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>95. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 691 (2004) (noting that <em>Durling </em>was \u201csomewhat ambiguous\u201d regarding relationship between reliability and good cause). Recognizing <em>Darling\u2019s </em>ambiguity, the rule 6(b) commentary, <em>supra, </em>states that \u201cthe opinion appears to settle on the two-pronged definition of good cause\u201d under which a judge must find good cause to exist on grounds other than the reliability of the hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">However, rule 6(b) no longer reflects our current case law. Since the District Court rules went into effect, this court has resolved Durling\u2019s ambiguity, concluding that a finding of substantial reliability is itself sufficient to demonstrate good cause in such circumstances. <em>Negron, supra </em>at 691 (\u201cif reliable hearsay is presented, the good cause requirement is satisfied\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>446 Mass. 54, 58-59 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>414 Mass. 193, 197 (1993). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 444, 450 n.6 (2010), and cases cited (discussing genesis of rule 6[b] and declining to apply two-prong inquiry given case law that sufficiently reliable hearsay obviates need for finding of good cause); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 740 n.6 (2008) (\u201cWhile the language of rule 6[b] establishes a two-prong inquiry, Supreme Judicial Court decisions subsequent to the rule\u2019s adoption have held that good cause need not be separately proven if the hearsay is deemed sufficiently reliable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The hearing judge, relying on <em>King, supra, </em>determined that the hearsay testimony of Poulin and Manning was substantially reliable, and then noted in his findings that \u201cgood cause need not be separately proven.\u201d This was a correct statement of current law. As discussed, rule 6(b) was not intended to require more than is constitutionally mandated, as set forth in <em>Durling </em>and its progeny. Because rule 6(b) in its current form appears to do just that, it should be amended forthwith to conform to our decisions subsequent to <em>Durling, </em>clarifying that due process does not require, where the hearsay is substantially reliable, separate proof as to good cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">c. <em>Separation of powers. </em>Article 30 guarantees the separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>of powers between and among the three branches of government. Although staff from the office of the district attorney may not interfere unduly with a probation officer\u2019s conduct of a probation hearing, an assistant district attorney may in appropriate circumstances assist in such hearings because, despite the separation of powers, the \u201ccompartments are not watertight.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 448 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>427 Mass. 18, 22-23 (1998); G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 3; Rule 5 of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra </em>at 89. Here, for example, the probation officer explicitly requested that the prosecutor question the police witnesses at the January 12 hearing. Such conduct constitutes cooperation, rather than interference, with the probation officer\u2019s presentation of the case. See <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The defendant asserts that the civilian witnesses were not present at the surrender hearing because a victim/witness advocate wrongly informed them that they need respond only to summonses sent by the office of the district attorney, not those sent by probation officers. He bases this on a statement made by the probation officer on January 13, 2012, after the close of the evidence. The probation officer told the judge that the probation department \u201cdid reach out to [the civilian witnesses,] but they did not get the summons and ... I hate to put it this way, but they did speak with victim/witness advocates in the [district attorney\u2019s] office and . . . they were told [that] ... if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>district attorney did not send them this summons, then they did not have to go.\u201d The defendant made no attempt to question the probation officer or otherwise to pursue the matter, and did not object when the judge then indicated that he would exclude this information from his consideration of what due process required with respect to the hearsay testimony before him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">On the basis of the foregoing statement by the probation officer, the defendant maintains on appeal that the office of the district attorney impermissibly interfered with the probation officer\u2019s efforts to protect the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights by summonsing witnesses. Absent speculation, the record itself provides no indication that the office of the district attorney deliberately advised civilian witnesses against heeding a summons from the probation office. The prosecutor informed the judge that a victim/witness advocate had at some point spoken to the mother of one of the victims, but that she had done no more than explain the arraignment process and the next court date. He added that he had no notes on the matter in his file. There is nothing of record as to the date or time when any conversations between the witnesses and the advocate took place, or as to whether at the time of such conversations the advocate was aware of any summonses that the probation officer had sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We decline to speculate and draw the adverse inferences necessary to support the defendant\u2019s allegation of misconduct. We accordingly discern no basis on which to conclude that there was improper interference by the office of the district attorney with \u25a0 the probation department\u2019s conduct of the hearing that would give rise to a violation of art. 30. We note, moreover, that it was the probation department and not the defendant who had summonsed the civilian witnesses. Had the defendant deemed their presence requisite for the exercise of his constitutional rights of confrontation or to present a defense, he was free to, but did not, request a continuance for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We refer to the adult victim and his half-sister, a minor, by pseudonyms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Amir\u2019s parents did not live together at that time; Amir lived primarily with his mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Alana\u2019s mother is the girl friend of Amir\u2019s father.
