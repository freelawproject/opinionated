Weaver and David B. Weaver, the owner and manager of the property, respectively. Sheehan ascended an exterior staircase leading to an outer door on the second floor landing, where he leaned against the staircase guardrail. The guardrail broke, and Sheehan fell to the pavement below, suffering serious injuries as a result. Sheehan filed a complaint against the Weavers in the Housing Court. A jury found both parties negligent and apportioned to Sheehan forty per cent of the comparative negligence. The jury found also that, pursuant to G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51 (\u00a7 51), the Weavers were strictly liable for Sheehan\u2019s injuries because they were caused by various violations of the State building code. Section 51 imposes strict liability on an owner, or other party, in control of \u201ca place of assembly, theatre, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment or building\u201d for damages caused by a violation of \u201cthe provisions of [G. L. c. 143] and the state building code.\u201d The Weavers filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial, arguing in part that \u00a7 51 did not apply in the circumstances. This motion was denied, and the Weavers appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. The Weavers do not challenge the verdict of negligence but argue that the judge erred in permitting Sheehan\u2019s claim under \u00a7 51.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">This case once again presents questions regarding the scope and meaning of \u00a7 51, which have confronted our courts since the statute was enacted in its current form in 1972. See St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 35. The issues we address in this appeal are, first, whether \u00a7 51 applies to all State building code violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>or, as stated in <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>429 Mass. 300, 304 n.5 (1999) <em>(McAllister), </em>only those concerning fire safety; and second, whether the property involved in this case qualifies as a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Overruling our holding in <em>McAllister, supra, </em>we conclude that \u00a751 applies to all violations of the State building code. We conclude also that \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the statute is a narrowly defined term that does not encompass within its ambit of strict liability a small-scale residential structure like that occupied by Sheehan, notwithstanding that the structure had some commercial characteristics. Therefore, so much of the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as relates to the \u00a7 51 claim must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Situation Mgt. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ma-louf, Inc., </em>430 Mass. 875, 876 (2000). Sheehan resided alone in the third-floor apartment of a three-story mixed-use business-residential structure on Rantoul Street (Rantoul structure). In addition to his apartment, there were two residential apartments on the second floor, one in the front and one in the back, each occupied by a single tenant, and a chiropractor\u2019s office occupied the first floor. Other than the fire escape, the only access to Sheehan\u2019s apartment was by way of the exterior wooden staircase on the side of the Rantoul structure. The staircase led to a landing in front of an exterior door located on the second floor. That door opened into a foyer shared by Sheehan and the resident of the second-floor front apartment. The staircase did not serve the second-floor rear apartment, which had a separate entrance, or the chiropractor\u2019s office. Only Sheehan and the resident of the second-floor front apartment, and their guests, used the staircase.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Weavers never resided in the Rantoul structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">At the time of Sheehan\u2019s fall, the sixth edition of the State building code was in effect. As Sheehan\u2019s expert testified, the Rantoul structure had eighteen building code violations, including defects in the strength, height, and condition of the guardrail. See, e.g., 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1014.9.1, 1022.2.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>1028.2 (1997). The jury determined that these violations caused Sheehan\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Because this case involves questions of statutory interpretation, our review is de novo. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. 463, 467 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u201cOur primary duty in interpreting a statute is \u2018to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Atl. &amp; Gulf Maritime Region, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). \u201cWe begin with the language of the statute itself and \u2018presume, as we must, that the Legislature intended what the words of the statute say.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>453 Mass. 707, 713 (2009), quoting <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 687 (1986). \u201cIn construing the Legislature\u2019s intent, we may also enlist the aid of other reliable guideposts, such as the statute\u2019s \u2018progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, contemporary customs and conditions and the system of positive law of which they are part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 454 (2007), quoting <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>433 Mass. 568, 570 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">a. <em>Scope of building code violations. </em>In relevant part, \u00a7 51 in its current form provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cThe owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession or occupant, being the party in control, of a place of assembly, theatre, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment or building shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and the state building code relative thereto, and such person shall be liable to any person injured for all damages caused by a violation of any of said provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Prior to 1972, \u00a7 51 imposed strict liability for violations of \u201csections twenty-one, twenty-four to twenty-eight, inclusive, and thirty,\u201d St. 1945, c. 510,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which concerned various fire safety issues. See St. 1913, c. 655, \u00a7\u00a7 20-25, 27, as amended prior to 1972. Based on this language, in our decisions interpreting the pre-1972 version of \u00a7 51, we stated that \u201cnone of the benefits of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 51, is available to persons using stairways and egresses for purposes other than escape from danger from fire.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Festa </em>v. <em>Piemonte, </em>349 Mass. 761, 761 (1965). See <em>Repucci </em>v. <em>Exchange Realty Co., </em>321 Mass. 571, 575 (1947), citing <em>Stevens, landowner, </em>228 Mass. 368, 373, 374 (1917) (\u201cThe statute was designed for the protection of human life against fire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In 1972, as part its enactment of a comprehensive State building code, the Legislature repealed the then-existing version of \u00a7 51, as well as the sections referenced therein, and replaced it with the current version.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 35. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>language of the new version omitted the reference to the particular sections dealing with fire safety and, in its place, inserted language imposing strict liability for violations of \u201cany\u201d of the \u201cprovisions of [G. L. c. 143] and the state building code.\u201d St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 35. The plain meaning of this language, and the fact that it replaced a narrower reference to particular statutory provisions, suggests that the Legislature intended the current version of \u00a7 51 to apply to all violations of the State building code, not just those pertaining to fire safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The Appeals Court also has reached this view in several of its decisions, which interpreted the 1972 changes to \u00a7 51 as requiring notice before an individual may be criminally prosecuted for violating \u201cany provisions of the State building code and related codes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porrazzo, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 169, 177 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eakin, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 697-698 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 590 (1998) (requiring notice where violations related generally to conditions affecting habitability); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duda, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 923 &amp; n.1 (1992), quoting 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 121.1 (1980) (\u201c[\u00a7 51\u2019s] statutory notification in writing is a condition precedent to criminal prosecutions for violations of the State Building Code,\u201d including use of structure \u201cin violation of any of the provision[s] of this code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">However, in a decision issued in 1999, we relied upon our 1965 decision, <em>Festa </em>v. <em>Piemonte, </em>349 Mass. at 761, for the proposition that \u201cnone of the benefits of G. L. c. 143, [\u00a7 51,] is \u2018available to persons using stairways and egresses for purposes other than escape from danger from fire.\u2019 \u201d See <em>McAllister, supra </em>at 304 n.5. <em>McAllister </em>involved a tenant who had slipped on ice that had accumulated on the exterior stairs of the defendant\u2019s property, and brought claims of negligence, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and violation of the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 301. The tenant sought a jury instruction that, pursuant to \u00a7 51, a property owner \u201cshall be liable . . . [for] a violation of the State Building Code\u201d; this request was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 304 n.5. On appeal to this court, the asserted error was summarily rejected in a footnote citing <em>Festa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>v. <em>Piemonte, supra. </em>See <em>McAllister, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Weavers rely on <em>McAllister </em>to support their argument that they may not be held strictly liable under \u00a7 51 because, when he fell, Sheehan was not using the staircase to flee from a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">That footnote, however, has since come under scrutiny. In <em>Fox </em>v. <em>The Little People\u2019s Sch., Inc., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 578, 581 (2002), the Appeals Court, endeavoring to reconcile the holding in <em>McAllister </em>with the language of \u00a7 51, described the decision as having \u201cimported into the new \u00a7 51 the fire safety concerns the old statute embodied.\u201d On that basis, the court concluded that \u201ccontrolling cases regard the pedigree of [G. L.] c. 143, \u00a7 51, as a limitation on its facially broad language,\u201d but noted also that it might have interpreted \u00a7 51 differently were it \u201cwriting on a clean slate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Since our decision in <em>McAllister, </em>we have described \u00a7 51 more broadly as \u201ca statute that imposes strict liability on the property owner (among others) for injuries resulting from building code violations.\u201d <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dotfman, </em>438 Mass. 242, 242 (2002) <em>(Banushi). </em>Although we rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 strict liability claim in <em>Banushi </em>because the structure at issue was not a \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 51, see <em>id. </em>at 245, we apparently assumed that the broadly defined scope of \u00a7 51 applied where the claimed building code violations pertained to debris cleanup. See <em>id. </em>at 243, 245 n.8. See also <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Maglio, </em>430 Mass. 694, 698 &amp; n.8, 699 (2000) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim under \u00a7 51 not because violation was unrelated to fire safety but for fact-based reason that violation did not cause plaintiff\u2019s injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>445 Mass. 119, 127-128 (2005), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 20 (1985), the Weavers contend that the Legislature\u2019s silence since our decision in <em>McAllister </em>demonstrates tacit approval of <em>McAllister\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 51. As suggested by the cases they cite, however, the principle that legislative approval can be derived from legislative silence carries its greatest force when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the Legislature has reenacted or amended a statute without disturbing the judicial construction placed on it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 128, quoting <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>217 Mass. 548, 551 (1914) (\u201cwhen a statute after having been construed by the courts is reenacted without material change, the Legislature are presumed to have adopted the judicial construction put upon it\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, supra </em>(noting that Legislature\u2019s \u201creenactments and amendments of\u201d specified statutes \u201chave not attempted to alter our decisions\u201d). Otherwise, \u201clegislative inaction following a judicial interpretation of a statute provides frail evidence that the Legislature approves of the court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 526 n.26 (1980), superseded on other grounds by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 35. See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. at 457 n.18, quoting <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 615-616 (1980) (\u201cThe practicalities of the legislative process furnish many reasons for the lack of success of a measure other than legislative dislike for the principle involved in the legislation\u201d). Given that the Legislature has not revisited \u00a7 51 since <em>McAllister, </em>we do not take its silence as tacit approval of our construction of the statute in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we now overrule the holding in <em>McAllister </em>and determine that, in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and considered in light of the prior legislation it replaced, \u00a7 51 applies to any violations of G. L. c. 143 and the State building code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">b. <em>Definition of \u201cbuilding. \u201d </em>The Weavers contend also that the Rantoul structure does not qualify as a \u201cbuilding\u201d under \u00a7 51. As noted, \u00a7 51 applies to the party in control of \u201ca place of assembly, theatre, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment or building.\u201d General Laws c. 143, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201cunless a contrary meaning is required by the context,\u201d the term \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in that chapter broadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>refers to \u201ca combination of any materials, whether portable or fixed, having a roof, to form a structure for the shelter of persons, animals or property.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The context in which the term \u201cbuilding\u201d appears in \u00a7 51, however, requires a more narrow construction. Applying the broad definition in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1, \u201cwould render the remaining words in the listing superfluous.\u201d <em>Banushi, </em>438 Mass. at 245. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eakin, </em>427 Mass. 590, 592 (1998) <em>(Eakin); Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 92 (1996) <em>(Santos). </em>Our decisions therefore have interpreted the term \u201cbuilding\u201d pursuant to the doctrine of ejusdem generis: \u201cWhere general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u201d <em>Banushi, supra </em>at 244, quoting 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 273-274 (6th ed. rev. 2000). See <em>Eakin, supra; Santos, supra. </em>This principle permits \u201cthe specific words to identify the class and [restricts] the meaning of general words to things within the class.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 31 (2010), quoting 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 379 (7th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Adopting this principle, we have described the class of structures covered by \u00a7 51 as \u201cplaces of public or commercial use, places of assembly or places of work.\u201d <em>Banushi, supra. </em>See <em>Santos, supra </em>(\u201cWe need not define the class precisely except to note that it is characterized by public and commercial structures and that the context does not encompass a single family house\u201d). On this basis, we have determined that the term \u201cbuild<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ing\u201d does not encompass a single-family house, see <em>Eakin, </em>427 Mass. at 592, citing <em>Santos, </em>supra, or an owner-occupied two-family home in which the owner rents one of the units to a tenant. See <em>Banushi, supra </em>at 244. See also <em>Osorno </em>v. <em>Simone, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 612-613 (2002) (\u201cbuilding\u201d does not encompass thirteen-unit condominium, in which three units are rented or leased). Although the lack of commercial or public character sufficed to exclude from the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d the small-scale residential structures at issue in these cases, we did not intend the terms \u201ccommercial\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d \u201cto define the class encompassed by the statute . . . precisely, . . . preferring to leave that either to the Legislature or to development on future factual records.\u201d <em>Banushi, supra </em>at 244, citing <em>Santos, supra </em>at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">As indicated by our prior decisions, what all of the commercial and public structures listed in \u00a7 51 have in common is that they are places in which a large number of people gather for occupational, entertainment, or other purposes. Accordingly, that an owner of a small-scale residential structure derives income therefrom does not make it \u201cthe type of commercial, public use, assembly, or workplace structure contemplated by the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Banushi, supra </em>at 244. Likewise, merely because portions of a structure are \u201caccessible to the general public\u201d does not necessarily bring the structure within the statute. See <em>Osorno </em>v. <em>Simone, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. at 613. Rather, the structure must have been \u201cdesigned and maintained for continuing public assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">This interpretation properly focuses \u00a7 51 on structures in which building code violations pose a risk to a significant number of people, each of whom is ordinarily poorly positioned to determine whether the structure complies with the safety requirements in the building code. Cf. <em>id. </em>It also prevents an expansion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>scope of strict liability beyond that which the Legislature evidently intended. See <em>Banushi, supra </em>at 244, quoting <em>Santos, supra </em>at 94 (\u201cThe large number of owners of [owner-occupied two-family homes] in the Commonwealth should not be exposed to expanded civil liability deriving from the regulatory provisions of [c.] 143 except by express and clear legislation evidencing that intention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Our prior decisions have not addressed the extent to which \u00a751 applies to a structure that contains both commercial and residential uses. We conclude that \u00a7 51 contemplates that, in some instances, the term \u201cbuilding\u201d may encompass only a portion of a larger structure. After defining the term \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of the chapter, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1, adds that \u201c[t]he word \u2018building\u2019 shall be construed where the context requires as though followed by the words \u2018or part or parts thereof.\u2019 \u201d Although the list of other structures in \u00a7 51 demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend the broad definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d contained in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1, to apply to the term as used in \u00a7 51, see <em>supra, </em>the structures listed support construing \u201cbuilding\u201d in that section as followed by \u201cor part or parts thereof.\u201d The listed structures include some that may occupy only a portion of a larger structure. See, e.g., G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201c[t]heatre\u201d as \u201ca building <em>or part thereof in </em>which it is intended to make a business of the presentation of performances for the entertainment of spectators\u201d [emphasis supplied]). See generally G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201c[w]orkshop\u201d for purposes of another statute as \u201cany premises, <em>room </em>or place . . . wherein manual labor is exercised by way of trade\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The case before us presents an appropriate circumstance in which to treat portions of a structure separately for purposes of \u00a7 51. The Rantoul structure constituted a mixed-use business-residential structure, in which the business and residential components were segregated. The chiropractor\u2019s office occupied the first floor while the residential apartments occupied the second and third floors. The State building code applies different rules to the different portions of a mixed-use structure. See 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 101.1 (2010), adopting International Building Code \u00a7 508 (2009); International Building Code \u00a7 1004.9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>adopted by 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 101.1 (\u201cWhere a building contains two or more [uses], the <em>means of egress </em>requirements shall apply to each portion of the building based on the [use] of that space\u201d). Additionally, the residential tenants in the Rantoul structure had their own entryways separate and apart from the chiropractor\u2019s office. Therefore, the residential portion of the Rantoul structure was both legally and structurally distinct from the business portion, and we treat it separately for purposes of \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Because the building code violations and Sheehan\u2019s injury both occurred in the residential portion of the Rantoul structure, we consider whether that portion is a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51. The evidence indicates that the residential portion of the Rantoul structure was not used as a place for a large number of people to gather. The structure contained only three residential apartments, and only two of these apartments utilized the staircase and landing whose defects resulted in Sheehan\u2019s injury. Hence, the structure at issue does not qualify as a \u201cbuilding\u201d under \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as relates to the claim under G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51, is reversed. The remainder of the order is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Housing Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys, the Boston Housing Authority, the Massachusetts Defense Lawyers Association, and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Sheehan contends that the chiropractor\u2019s office would use the staircase to access its mail, but the record makes clear that this was not the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">General Laws c. 143, \u00a7 51 (\u00a7 51), includes a requirement that notice be given before an individual may be criminally prosecuted for the violations mentioned in the first sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">\u201cNo criminal prosecution for such violation shall be begun until the lapse of thirty days after such party in control has been notified in writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ing by a local inspector as to what changes are necessary to meet the requirements of such provisions, or if such changes shall have been made in accordance with such notice.
