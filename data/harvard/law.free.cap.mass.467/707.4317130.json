Consequently, during the course of the investigation, it sought to record conversations of those H-Block members whose involvement in the murder was suspected. A cooperating witness consented to the recording of his conversations with the defendant and other H-Block members, and subsequently recorded a conversation with the defendant in which he admitted to the killing. Although this recorded conversation ultimately took place in an automobile and not in a home, out of an abundance of caution the Commonwealth had obtained a warrant, as provided for in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 77 (1987) (warrant required, pursuant to art. 14 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, for surreptitious recording of oral communication in private home even if it comes within \u201cone-party consent\u201d exception of G.L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 and C 1) <em>(Blood </em>warrant), before surreptitiously recording the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the recorded conversation. He argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the shooting of the victims was a \u201cdesignated offense\u201d occurring in \u201cconnection with organized crime\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 7, and, therefore, the one-party consent exception to the proscription of the \u201csecret transmission or recording of oral communications without the consent of all parties\u201d was inapplicable and the warrant was inadequate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>459 Mass. 289, 298 (2011), quoting <em>Blood, supra </em>at 66. In his motion to suppress, the defendant also argued that statements he made to the police during a post-arrest interview were not voluntary and were not preceded by adequate Miranda warnings and therefore should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">After hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress as to all of his statements. The defendant sought leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), which was granted by a single justice of this court. On appeal, he raises substantially the same argument regarding the surreptitious recording of his conversation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, as to his post-arrest statement, the defendant does not challenge the judge\u2019s rulings that it was voluntary and preceded by a voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights; rather, he contends that he invoked his right to remain silent during the police interview and that his invocation was not respected by the interrogating officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We affirm the motion judge\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress with respect to the defendant\u2019s recorded conversation, and reverse her denial with respect to the statements he made during the custodial interview after invoking his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite the relevant facts regarding the shooting as they appear in Sergeant Detective Joseph G. MacDonald\u2019s affidavit in support of the <em>Blood </em>warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">MacDonald worked in the homicide unit of the Boston police department. He had been a Boston police officer for twenty-five years, and his experience included assignments with the organized crime strike force of the United States Attorney\u2019s office for the District of Massachusetts, the special investigations bureau of the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office, the organized crime unit, and the youth violence strike force. MacDonald also served as a sergeant detective in the community disorders unit. The information in the affidavit was drawn from his extensive experience and familiarity with organized criminal organizations in the neighborhoods of Boston, from his personal involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>in the investigation, and from \u201creports made by other agents of the [Boston police department] and other [F]ederal, [S]tate and local law enforcement agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On May 8, 2010, officers went to a basketball court on Heath Street in Jamaica Plain in response to a radio call and discovered Martin suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest and Bell suffering from gunshot wounds to his chest and arm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Through eyewitness accounts, officers were able to determine that the shooter, a black male, got out of a green Acura automobile, approached the victims, shot at both victims multiple times, fled back into the vehicle, and drove away. A black sport utility vehicle (SUV) was also seen leaving the scene behind the green Acura.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">After reviewing video surveillance, the police determined that the Acura belonged to Daron Silvelo (Daron), who admitted that he and his brother Ramon Silvelo-Miles (Ramon) had been in the automobile that day. Cellular telephone records confirmed that they were both near the scene of the shooting when it took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">On June 18, 2010, Gregory Tillery, an admitted associate of H-Block,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> told MacDonald that on May 10, 2010, the defendant, a known member of H-Block, told him that he went on a \u201cmission\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with \u201cDouble R\u201d (Ramon) and \u201cDay Reeze\u201d (Daron) in Ramon\u2019s Acura. The defendant added that \u201cHood\u201d (James McGee) and \u201cRibs\u201d (Robert Heckstall) followed the defendant to the shooting in a black Ford Expedition SUV, in order to offer guidance to him, Ramon, and Daron. The defendant told Tillery that when the group arrived at Heath Street, the defendant got out of the vehicle, walked up to the victims, and shot both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">MacDonald knew McGee and Heckstall to be senior members of H-Block, responsible for directing younger gang members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cto distribute narcotics and commit violent offenses for the benefit of the gang organization.\u201d MacDonald also knew that Ramon was an associate of H-Block, and that he had been arrested in the past for unlawfully possessing a firearm and distributing narcotics. Tillery further informed MacDonald that guns belonging to H-Block were kept at a central apartment and that H-Block associates picked up guns at this location before going on their \u201cmissions\u201d and brought them back when they were finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">MacDonald further averred that based on his experience, as well as that of other members of the Boston police department, H-Block and Heath Street were two rival organized and disciplined gangs engaged in the supply of illegal goods and services such as drugs and firearms in Boston, that members of these gangs regularly used weapons and violence as part of their ongoing criminal enterprises, and that \u201c[t]hey commit[ted] violent acts such as murder and shootings to attack and pay[]back their rival gangs.\u201d MacDonald also averred that Heath Street and H-Block were engaged in an \u201con-going feud,\u201d and that, as part of such feuds, gang members commit violent acts on individuals located in geographical areas controlled by rivals. Heath Street counted the area where the victim was killed as part of its \u201cturf,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and MacDonald believed that the defendant, Ramon, Daron, Heckstall, and McGee embarked on a \u201cmission\u201d to travel to Heath Street\u2019s \u201cturf\u201d and murder individuals in that territory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">D.B., a cooperating witness, told MacDonald that the defendant had confessed his participation in the murder to him. MacDonald believed that the defendant and other members of H-Block would have further discussions about the murder with D.B., and gained D.B.\u2019s consent to be fitted with a concealed recording device.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">After MacDonald was granted a <em>Blood </em>warrant and D.B. was outfitted with an audio recording device, the defendant described to D.B., while the two sat in an automobile, how he committed the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>a. <em>Custodial interview. </em>On July 30, 2010, the defendant was arrested and interviewed by MacDonald. He was properly informed of the Miranda rights and consented to the recording of the interview. MacDonald then informed the defendant that the police had put together a case showing that he had shot and killed Martin. The defendant admitted that he was a member of H-Block, but denied being involved in a feud with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Immediately thereafter, the defendant asked, \u201cCan you tell me how you guys got this case together?\u201d MacDonald replied, \u201cWell that\u2019s something that we will discuss in court.\u201d The defendant then responded, \u201cWell then, I don\u2019t want to talk. I haven\u2019t got nothing to say.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After this response, MacDonald implied that the shooting may have been an accident, and that the defendant had an opportunity to perhaps be convicted of manslaughter if he admitted that it was an accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t shoot nobody,\u201d and MacDonald continued to ask questions and elicit responses until the defendant eventually said, \u201c[I]f I\u2019m under arrest, you all can take me away, because I haven\u2019t got nothing else to say.\u201d At that point the interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">b. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant moved to suppress both the surreptitiously recorded statement and his statement to police following his arrest. At the hearing on the motion, the judge considered MacDonald\u2019s affidavit as well as his testimony that he had obtained the defendant\u2019s board of probation record during the course of his investigation and prior to the recorded conversation, and learned from the record that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>had previously been convicted of illegal possession of firearms and drug distribution offenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion as to all statements, the judge concluded that the recorded conversation need not be suppressed because the Commonwealth had reasonable suspicion to believe that the shooting was undertaken in an attempt to further the interests of H-Block gang\u2019s organized and disciplined criminal enterprise. In doing so, she considered both the warrant affidavit and MacDonald\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s criminal record, as she believed that a <em>Blood </em>warrant was not required to surreptitiously record the defendant in an automobile under the one-party consent exception and thus she could consider relevant evidence outside of the affidavit. The judge found that the evidence sufficed to show that the gang was engaged in the sale of narcotics, the pursuit of which infer-ably may have motivated the shooting. She also found that significant signs of organization and discipline were present where the members of H-Block picked up and dropped off their firearms at a central location and where the shooters were sent out on a \u201cmission\u201d and accompanied by senior members of the gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The judge also found that the postarrest statements made by the defendant to police were the result of a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary Miranda waiver. Further, although the defendant did not raise the issue, she considered whether the defendant clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent when he said, \u201c[Wjell then, I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d She concluded that he did not, and that the statement was merely a negotiating ploy in which he implied that his desire to talk to police was conditioned on police informing him about their case in an attempt to discern the strength of the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Motion to suppress recorded conversation. </em>The first issue before us is whether the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress oral communications that were surreptitiously recorded by D.B. at the behest of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>monwealth. In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we give substantial deference to the motion judge\u2019s findings, but conduct an independent inquiry to determine whether the judge correctly applied the law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>433 Mass. 549, 554 (2001). The defendant argues that neither the warrant nor the one-party consent exceptions to the wiretap statute (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 9) applied, and therefore his communications were impermissibly recorded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The wiretap statute prohibits all surreptitious recording of oral communications, except as provided in a few narrow exceptions. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1. Of primary relevance here is the one-party consent exception, which allows for the recording of oral communications where the party surreptitiously recording the communications \u201cis an investigative or law enforcement officer investigating a \u2018designated offense,\u2019 and that officer is either (1) a party to the communication, or (2) has advance authorization from a party to the communication to intercept the conversation.\u201d <em>Tavares, </em>459 Mass. at 297, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 275-276 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A \u201cdesignated offense\u201d is an offense enumerated in \u00a7 99 B 7, which includes murder and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, occurring \u201cin connection with organized crime.\u201d \u201cOrganized crime\u201d consists of a \u201ccontinuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Whether the recording in this case properly comes within the one-party consent exception depends on whether the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cdecision to intercept was made on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that interception would disclose or lead to evidence of a designated offense in connection with organized crime.\u201d <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. at 281. \u201cThe standard of reasonable suspicion is an objective one; it is met by a showing of articulable facts from which a reasonable person could conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>interception would lead to evidence of a designated offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">We agree with the motion judge that MacDonald\u2019s affidavit, although conclusory in part, provided an adequate basis from which to conclude that H-Block was sufficiently organized and disciplined, and engaged in the supply of drugs and guns, to qualify as an organized criminal group under the wiretap statute. That basis included MacDonald\u2019s statements regarding H-Block\u2019s activities and its membership drawn from his extensive knowledge and experience with organized groups selling drugs and guns in the neighborhoods of Boston, much of which was gained through police assignments focused specifically on such organized criminal activity. It further included corroborating information gathered during interviews of members of H-Block either conducted directly by MacDonald or by other officers during the course of their investigation, regarding the organization and distribution of weapons belonging to H-Block, the role of senior H-Block members in directing the drug selling and violence of junior members, and the use of \u201cmission\u201d assignments to carry out the gang\u2019s criminal objectives.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is also apparent that the crimes allegedly committed by the defendant are among those enumerated within the definition of \u201cdesignated offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Thus, the inquiry becomes whether there was sufficient information available to the Commonwealth from which it might reasonably have concluded that the shooting under investigation was committed in connection with the organized criminal activity of the H-Block gang. In this regard, the information available to the Commonwealth was substantially greater than that available in <em>Tavares, </em>459 Mass. 289. In that case, the information was that the murder at issue was not authorized by the criminal group with which the defendant was affiliated and, indeed, suggested that his actions were of a \u201croguish or free-agent quality\u201d consistent with his \u201callegedly violent impulses, rather than an organized criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. The defendant in <em>Tavares </em>appeared to have acted alone in mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>killing his victim against the wishes of another gang member. <em>Id. </em>Here, the information set forth in the affidavit and provided to MacDonald by individuals affiliated with H-Block was that the defendant, an H-Block member and known drug dealer, was sent on a \u201cmission\u201d by H-Block, a mission that was guided and observed by senior members in the organization, and that the mission was part of an ongoing \u201cfeud\u201d (or war) between turf-conscious criminal organizations involved in the sale of illegal drugs in adjoining territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Although the specific origins and dimensions of the ongoing feud were not included in the affidavit, it is reasonable to infer from the information available to the police at the time that the shooting at issue was intended as an act of intimidation directed at Heath Street and related to its competing illegal enterprises. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth, objectively, had a reasonable suspicion that the interception of conversations between a cooperating witness and an H-Block member, who had admitted involvement in the shooting, would lead to evidence regarding the commission of the crime, its motivation, and its relationship to H-Block\u2019s organized criminal activities. That is, evidence of a \u201cdesignated offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">For these reasons, we find that the motion judge did not err and affirm her decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the conversation that was the subject of surreptitious recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">b. <em>Invocation of right to remain silent. </em>Next, we consider the defendant\u2019s argument that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made during his interrogation after what he claims to have been an invocation of his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Prior to any custodial questioning, a defendant must be warned, among other things, \u201cthat he has the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966). \u201c[A]fter a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>suspect clearly requests an attorney,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461 (1994), or invokes his right to remain silent, <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 103-104 (1975). See <em>Berghuis </em>v. <em>Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 387-388 (2010) (\u201cAny waiver, express or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Once he has been advised of the protections afforded by <em>Miranda, </em>the \u201cresponsibility for invoking the protections guaranteed by [Miranda] and art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] rests squarely in the hands of [the] criminal defendant[].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baye, </em>462 Mass. 246, 252 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 342 (2012). After waiving those protections, the defendant bears the burden of showing that his subsequent invocation of his right to remain silent was clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous. <em>BAye, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 347-349 (2012). In determining whether the invocation was adequately clear, we consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the alleged invocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almonte, </em>444 Mass. 511, 518-519, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1040 (2005). In doing so, we consider whether a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be an invocation. <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 342. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWell then, I don\u2019t want to talk. I haven\u2019t got nothing to say,\u201d was a clear invocation of his right to remain silent. The defendant made the statement mere moments after waiving his Miranda protections, indicating an immediate unwillingness to talk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass. 319, 322, 324 (1979) (right invoked where defendant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to say\u201d right after being read Miranda warnings). He did not immediately continue speaking after asserting his right to silence; rather, he remained silent while MacDonald spent a considerable amount of time persuading him to continue with the interview.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>388 Mass. 269, 277-278 (1983) (statement, \u201cI\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>not making any statement knowing that I am being held for this alleged murder of said person,\u201d not invocation when immediately followed with proclamations of innocence without provocation). Simply put, his choice of words fell well within the range of cases where we have found a clear and unequivocal invocation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>463 Mass. 273, 285 (2012) (statement, \u201cI\u2019m not going on with this conversation,\u201d was invocation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 828 (2009) (defendant\u2019s statement that he \u201cdid not have anything to say at this time\u201d was invocation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19, 28-29 (2001) (statement, \u201cI think at this point we need to stop. ... I think we\u2019re going to stop, and I think I\u2019m going to get a lawyer. If this is the way this is going, you\u2019re either accusing me or charging me,\u201d was invocation of right to counsel). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>445 Mass. 481, 488-489 (2005) (statement, \u201cNot right now, in a minute, I need to figure some things out,\u201d in response to request for interview not invocation).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Even if the officers were uncertain whether the defendant had chosen to invoke his right to remain silent, we have said that the proper course of action in circumstances such as these is to attempt to clarify the defendant\u2019s statement to determine what he had intended. <em>Santos, </em>463 Mass. at 286 (where reasonably uncertain, \u201can interrogating officer must cease the interrogation, but is entitled to ask a question to clarify the defendant\u2019s intent\u201d). Rather than attempting to clarify the defendant\u2019s intentions, MacDonald attempted to convince the defendant to continue talking, erroneously telling him that he would be liable only for manslaughter or murder in the second degree if Martin had not been his intended target.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Finally, we do not agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>or the motion judge\u2019s ruling, that the defendant\u2019s statement was merely a negotiating ploy, indicating that he wished to continue with the interview contingent on the actions of MacDonald.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On review of the interrogation, no such negotiation took place. The defendant asked MacDonald if he would outline the evidence against him, and when MacDonald refused, the defendant indicated that he no longer wished to speak. What followed was not a negotiation, but further interrogation by MacDonald in an attempt to persuade the defendant to continue the interview. See <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass. at 325-326 (statements by police that evidence \u201cpointed to\u201d defendant after invocation represented resumed interrogation in attempt to restart interview). When considering the statement in context, it is clear that the defendant invoked his right to remain silent and gave his reason for doing so \u2014 namely, an unwillingness to talk to police because they would not reveal the evidence against him.

We understand that, you know, sometimes during an incident we have, you know, people that you could be upset with. And at times accidents happen. The intended person was the wrong person, and it wasn\u2019t intentional to shoot that person \u2014 such as we believe this case. And there\u2019s a difference there between first degree murder and a manslaughter or second degree murder. And the opportunity is now for you \u2014 if you want \u2014 you don\u2019t have to have it \u2014 is to state whether it \u2014 was it an accident? You didn\u2019t mean to shoot that kid? You have a problem with Heath Street.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Specifically, the judge found that the defendant had been convicted of illegal possession of a firearm and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon in 2009, and of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in both 2008 and 2005. She added that he had been arrested at least nine other times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The statute also allows for recording with a valid warrant issued in conformity with the requirements set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 d and E through M. This is different from a <em>Blood </em>warrant, which is required in addition to the one-party consent exception in the context of a private home, and the Commonwealth correctly concedes that it did not obtain such a warrant, and thus relies only on the one-party consent exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The judge also properly considered the defendant\u2019s record of criminal convictions of drug and firearm offenses as corroborating his role in, and the nature of, the H-Block criminal enterprise with which he was associated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Although the defendant raises this argument for the first time on appeal, in her decision the motion judge considered whether the defendant invoked his right to remain silent and made findings to that effect. Consequently, we consider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">That the defendant answered questions after MacDonald\u2019s efforts to persuade him to continue is not dispositive whether he intended to assert his right to remain silent where his initial invocation was clear. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 152 (2011), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 100 (1984) (police may not ignore \u201cthe long-standing principle that \u2018postar-rest responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">MacDonald\u2019s assertion was a misstatement of the law. Under Massachusetts law, even if the defendant had intended the death of another and mistakenly killed the victim, he would be guilty of murder in the first degree under the theory of transferred intent, not murder in the second degree or manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>433 Mass. 340, 345-347 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Even if the defendant were expressing a contingency to his refusal to speak, his statement was functionally identical to his final statement, \u201cAnd if I\u2019m under arrest, you all can take me away, because I haven\u2019t got nothing else to say.\u201d As the motion judge found, the police immediately understood that statement as the defendant \u201cclearly and unequivocally asserting] his rights.\u201d In both instances, the defendant stated an unwillingness to continue with the interview due to the actions of the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
