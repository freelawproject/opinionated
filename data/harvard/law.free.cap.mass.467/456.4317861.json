The defendant, his brother, his sister-in-law, and his cousin worked together in a tiling business based in Oklahoma.

The defense at trial was based on a theory of actual innocence and that the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law was the true culprit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The defendant argues error in the denial of a motion to suppress statements; improper joinder of charges for trial; admission of certain hearsay evidence; and the denial of his first motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. The defendant also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a defense of lack of criminal responsibility, based on evidence that the defendant may have been suffering from a spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine-induced psychosis at the time of the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">We conclude that there was no error requiring reversal and, after a review of the entire record pursuant to our responsibility under G.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have found the following. In December, 2000, a fast-food restaurant was under construction in Clinton. The defendant, his brother Gary Spray, his sister-in-law Monica Spray, and his cousin Thomas Barron,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who lived in Oklahoma and all worked together on tiling jobs there, were hired to install tile in that restaurant. The defendant, Gary, Monica, and occasionally Thomas had worked in similar jobs across the country; Gary and Monica often worked as a team on such jobs, while the defendant worked by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Gary, Monica, and Thomas initially were solely responsible for the December, 2000, job in Clinton. However, they were delayed in starting the 1,500-mile drive to Massachusetts, and the defendant decided to travel to Clinton as well. He drove to Massachusetts alone, arriving in Clinton in the early morning hours of Thursday, December 7, 2000. Gary, Monica, and Thomas arrived in a separate vehicle late that afternoon; their arrival was delayed by an unscheduled stop in St. Louis, where they had \u201ca little drug party\u201d involving mostly methamphet-amines. While at the job site on Friday, the defendant and Gary spoke with the general contractor, who observed that they were already behind schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The victim, Sherylann Miller, was also present at the construction site where the defendant and his relatives were working. Miller was the general manager of the future restaurant, and was in the process of accepting job applications and conducting interviews for employment there. Since the heating system had yet to be installed, the area was being kept warm by propane heaters. At one point, the defendant heard the victim say that she was cold, and suggested that she move closer to the heater; she also apologized to the defendant when she stepped on freshly laid tile. The two had no prior relationship and did not interact any further that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At approximately 4 p.m. on Saturday, December 9, the defendant, Gary, Monica, and Thomas were working at the job site when the defendant walked out the door. The other three con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tinued to install tile until they heard the victim \u201chollering,\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d and \u201cStop, stop!\u201d Monica turned around to see the defendant \u201cwrestling\u201d with the victim and \u201cpunching on her\u201d while \u201cdragging her backwards.\u201d Thomas saw the defendant holding the victim \u201caround the waist or kind of in a bear hug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Monica began \u201cjumping up and down and hitting herself in the chest,\u201d and said to Gary, \u201cIt\u2019s Merle, it\u2019s Merle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gary turned around to see the defendant \u201cpunching [the victim] in the back.\u201d Gary ran to the defendant, pushed him against the wall, and asked, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? What are you doing to this lady?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell them somebody else done it.\u201d By that time, the victim had fallen to the floor and a large amount of blood had begun to flow from her body. Gary directed Monica and Thomas to telephone for help. Monica ran to a nearby gasoline station and the attendant there telephoned 911. The defendant walked to the front of the restaurant, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get this tile laid so we can get out of here and go to the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Clinton police responded within two minutes of receiving the 911 call. They encountered the family in various states of shock outside the restaurant. Monica was \u201chysterical\u201d; Thomas was pacing nervously and crying; and Gary was standing over the defendant, yelling repeatedly, \u201cWhat the fuck did you do that for?\u201d The defendant was sitting on the curb outside the restaurant, acting \u201cvery calm\u201d and not seeming at all upset. Monica pointed to the defendant and said, \u201cHe stabbed her, he did it.\u201d Thomas and Gary also indicated to police that the defendant had stabbed the victim. In response to questions regarding the whereabouts of the weapon, Gary stated that the defendant had had a knife, and that it had a green handle and a blade approximately five inches in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Police found the victim lying on the floor in the back of the restaurant with a large pool of blood around her head. The victim was transported to a local hospital, and then transferred via helicopter to a hospital in Worcester, where she was pronounced dead in the early morning hours of the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Shortly after police arrived and his relatives identified him as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the one who had stabbed the victim, the defendant was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in a police cruiser. Gary continued to yell at the defendant while he sat in the cruiser, \u201cWhat are you doing, you didn\u2019t even know her.\u201d Monica was permitted to change clothes and throw out the clothing she had been wearing, as she had soiled herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant, Gary, Monica, and Thomas were transported in separate police cruisers to the Clinton police station. There, Gary, Monica, and Thomas each gave a written statement while sitting in separate rooms; police observed that none appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Gary again provided a description of the weapon used in the attack, and said that he had seen the defendant kneel down beside a bucket at the scene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officers located the bucket, filled with dirty water and plaster or mud, and retrieved a green-handled knife with a serrated edge from it; a red-handled knife was also recovered from the scene. The green-handled knife was brought back to the police station, where Gary identified it as belonging to the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">While the defendant was booked<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and fingerprinted, officers observed a cut on his left hand. A Clinton police officer and a State trooper interviewed the defendant after reading him the Miranda rights and presenting him with a card listing those rights, which he initialed. The defendant agreed to speak with police and to allow police to transcribe his statement. During the interview, the defendant denied having had anything to do with the stabbing; police described him as \u201ccalm, cool, collected, very cooperative,\u201d and said that he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Later that evening, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>defendant\u2019s vehicle was towed; an inventory search produced an unlicensed firearm, ammunition, and spent shell casings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At approximately 2 a.m. Sunday morning, police learned that the victim had died as a result of her injuries, and booked the defendant on the additional charge of murder. Later that afternoon, after advising him of the Miranda rights, and procuring a waiver of his right to a prompt arraignment pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>422 Mass. 48 (1996) <em>(Rosario), </em>police again interviewed the defendant. He denied knowing anything about the source of the victim\u2019s injuries, but, in response to repeated questioning, eventually stated, \u201cIf I did do it, I didn\u2019t mean to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">An autopsy revealed that the victim died as a result of six stab wounds to the neck, and that her injuries were consistent with having been stabbed from behind. Two of the wounds severed her spinal cord. Forensic testing established that a sample from a blood stain on the defendant\u2019s shirt cuff matched the victim\u2019s blood.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A hair matching the victim\u2019s was found on the green knife, as well as a piece of fabric that was consistent with the fabric of the jacket that the victim was wearing at the time of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">b. <em>Pretrial motions. </em>The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress all statements made by him to the police, as well as all evidence obtained as a result of the search of his vehicle. He argued that the statements made to the police should be suppressed as involuntary, and that items found in his vehicle should be suppressed because they were the result of an illegal war-rantless search. Both the defendant and the Commonwealth filed motions in limine regarding the admissibility of the statements made by the defendant\u2019s family members to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">After a hearing at which a number of local and State police officers testified, the motion judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part. The judge held that, with regard to the police interviews of the defendant on December 9 and 10, 2000, the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving a valid waiver of Miranda rights beyond a reasonable doubt; the defendant had signed a written waiver form and there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>evidence that the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and no evidence of police coercion. However, the judge ruled that, because the second interview came to an end when the defendant said, \u201cI think I need a lawyer,\u201d no subsequent statement could be admitted unless the Commonwealth proved that the defendant initiated further communication with police officers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Contos, 435 Mass. 19, 30 (2001). Since the Commonwealth failed to meet this burden, the judge suppressed the defendant\u2019s statements to police after the termination of the second interview when an officer approached him to ask about ownership of the firearm found in his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The judge ruled that the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was lawful as an inventory search of an impounded vehicle, and that the firearm and ammunition discovered during the search should not be suppressed. The judge determined that \u201cit was reasonable for the police to take measures to guard against a potential claim of liability,\u201d where the vehicle was exposed to a risk of theft or vandalism where it was parked, and where the police had a reasonable basis to believe that the defendant would not be released due to the high cash bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Finally, the judge determined that statements made by Gary, Monica, and Thomas to police were admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, since they were made within minutes of the stabbing and there was ample evidence that each was very upset and under the influence of a startling event.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">c. <em>Trial proceedings. </em>The defendant was tried on the charges of murder, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card. He testified in his own defense. The defendant said that he did not kill the victim and did not know who did; he was installing tile when he looked up and saw the victim lying on the floor. When the defendant knelt down to check on her, Gary came running and shoved him against the wall, accusing him of stabbing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The defense strategy was to maintain the defendant\u2019s innocence and to suggest that Monica was the true perpetrator. Counsel suggested that Monica, as a methamphetamine addict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>robbed and killed the victim in order to obtain money for drugs. Monica\u2019s guilt was evidenced by her quickness to blame the defendant and deflect attention from herself, her melodramatic state after the attack, and the fact that, immediately after the stabbing, she threw away her clothes before the police could examine them. Because Monica \u201cfingered\u201d the defendant immediately, counsel argued, the police focused their investigation on the defendant from the start and, as a result, did not search Monica\u2019s vehicle. Counsel also impeached the credibility of Gary, Monica, and Thomas by pointing to their heavy methamphetamine use prior to the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; the defendant was acquitted of the firearms and ammunition charges. The judge dismissed the assault and battery conviction as merged with the murder conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 371-372 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">d. <em>First motion for new trial. </em>In February, 2007, the defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), on the ground that two eyewitnesses, Gary and Monica, had recanted their testimony. The defendant submitted affidavits from Gary and Monica averring that they, in fact, did not see the defendant argue with, fight with, or stab the victim. Gary stated also in his affidavit that, before trial, he wanted to alter the statement he gave to Clinton police on the evening of the stabbing, but the prosecutor told him that if he changed it, he \u201cwould do an automatic [seven] years for perjury.\u201d Monica stated that either the assistant district attorney\u2019s partner or secretary \u201ccoached [her] into saying only yes or no to defense counsel\u2019s questions [and] not to be explicit in [her] answers\u201d and that she \u201cwas under the influence of methamphetamine and many other mind-altering drugs \u2014 [her] memory of what happened wasn\u2019t close to the truth.\u201d In response, the prosecutor submitted an affidavit stating that he never told Gary that he would serve time for perjury if he changed his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion without a hearing, declining to credit Gary\u2019s and Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ica\u2019s affidavits. The judge found that the affidavits contradicted accounts that the two repeatedly had given throughout the proceedings as well as other evidence presented at trial, and that the affidavits were less credible in light of the six years that had passed since the stabbing. Moreover, the judge concluded that, even if the affidavits were accurate, the evidence against the defendant was \u201csolid\u201d without Gary\u2019s and Monica\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">e. <em>Second motion for new trial. </em>In July, 2010, represented by new appellate counsel, the defendant filed a second motion for a new trial. He argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate a defense based on lack of criminal responsibility, where posttrial investigation yielded substantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s mental health was impaired at the time of the stabbing. According to the defendant, affidavits of various family members and documentary evidence revealed his significant history of alcohol and methamphetamine abuse; previous psychotic episodes, including hallucinations, potentially associated with methamphetamine abuse; and the presence of various \u201cstressors\u201d in his life at the time of the killing. Given the unusual and apparently motiveless circumstances of the crime, and the strength of the evidence against him, the defendant asserted that trial counsel \u201cshould have recognized his prospects for acquittal were minimal \u2014 even nonexistent\u201d and instead pursued the \u201cobvious alternative\u201d of a defense premised on his mental state. The defendant argued that, had evidence related to his mental state been presented to the jury, it could have influenced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">A judge who was not the trial judge denied the motion after a hearing at which a clinical psychologist, trial counsel, and the defendant testified. The psychologist, Dr. Helene Presskreischer, opined that it was most likely that,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at the time of the stabbing, the defendant was suffering from a spontaneous recurrence of a methamphetamine-induced psychosis and acted in what he perceived to be self-defense; this psychosis would have affected his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of, and to control, his behavior such that he could have been found not guilty by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>reason of insanity. Presskreischer\u2019s opinion was based on the defendant\u2019s nearly twenty-year history of chronic methamphetamine abuse beginning at the age of fourteen; prior incidents of hallucinations; and certain \u201cstressors\u201d in his life at the time of the killing, including his father\u2019s recent death and the defendant\u2019s having taken over the family tiling business, his ongoing divorce, and the stressful and noisy working environment prior to the murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Presskreischer testified to her review of a number of medical records and reports concerning the defendant\u2019s previous psychotic episodes. In 1997, three years before the stabbing, he was observed waving and yelling at motorists driving by his home. Police transported him to a community health center, where he reported that someone was trying to kill him and that he had seen four satellites collide over his house; he was diagnosed with amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucination. Sometime after his father\u2019s death in 1999, the defendant\u2019s mother observed the defendant \u201ctalking crazy\u201d and, concerned, asked his cousin Terry to come to the house. When Terry arrived, the defendant was moving about his house as if to evade detection, and was frightened that someone was trying to kill him. Terry took him to the hospital. Several months before the stabbing, Gary found the defendant in \u201cstocking feet\u201d outside his home, standing in snow and ice, holding a gun. He discovered that the defendant had shot bullet holes in his bathroom ceiling and garage door, in order to fend off intruders who he believed were trying to kill him. No evidence of intruders was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Presskreischer opined that, based on her observations of the defendant during their meetings, he continued to suffer from residual psychosis. She also testified to the long-term effects of methamphetamine abuse. She said that chronic abuse of the drug can lead to structural changes in the brain that may cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>up to three-quarters of abusers to experience psychotic episodes. She testified further that, even when active drug use has ceased, users can experience \u201cflashbacks,\u201d or spontaneous recurrences of psychotic episodes, that may be triggered by even mild \u201cpsychosocial stressors.\u201d While the specific diagnosis of spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine-induced psychosis was not listed in the edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that was current at the time of trial, that edition did include a chapter on amphetamine-induced disorders; Presskreischer also submitted a bibliography of articles on the topic published in peer-reviewed journals before the date of the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The judge found that \u201cthe post trial affidavits and expert testimony of Dr. Presskreischer suggest that methamphetamine psychosis may have been a viable defense,\u201d but nonetheless concluded that \u201cthe facts known to, or accessible to [trial counsel], did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s mental state\u201d and that \u201c[t]he investigation conducted by [trial counsel] was constitutionally effective based on the information available to her.\u201d The judge noted that trial counsel met with the defendant approximately twelve times prior to trial, and during such meetings, the defendant consistently maintained his innocence. Although he told trial counsel of his history of drug abuse, the defendant also stated that he was not under the influence of methamphetamine or other drugs at the time of the crime, and that he had not used any drugs on the day of the stabbing. The judge found that trial counsel conducted a reasonable investigation of the defendant\u2019s family; the defendant\u2019s mother provided the name of an Oklahoma facility where the defendant received drug and mental health treatment as a teenager, but trial counsel was unsuccessful in obtaining medical records from that facility. The judge found that trial counsel was not otherwise on notice of any mental health problems affecting the defendant, and did not observe or learn of any instances of hallucinations, delusions, or other indicators of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The defendant appeals from his conviction of murder and from the denials of his motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Denial of motion to suppress statements. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement to police that \u201cif [he] did do it, [he] didn\u2019t mean to kill [the victim],\u201d as it was involuntary. The defendant contends that involuntariness is demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel immediately after making the inculpatory statement, and by the interviewing officers\u2019 use of a \u201cruse\u201d while questioning him, in that they asked him why he had committed the killing after he repeatedly had denied involvement. The involuntariness of the statement was exacerbated, the defendant maintains, by his \u201clong isolation\u201d in a holding cell before the ruse was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">As in all cases where the Commonwealth intends to rely on a defendant\u2019s confession to a crime, the Commonwealth here \u201cbear[s] the \u2018heavy burden of establishing that [the confession] was voluntary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>BAye, </em>462 Mass. 246, 256 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 563 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). \u201cIn meeting this burden, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was [not] overborne,\u2019 but rather that the statement was \u2018the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 595-596 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">While police officers\u2019 use of trickery and other deceptive tactics during an interrogation may cast doubt on both the validity of a suspect\u2019s waiver of rights and the voluntariness of any ensuing confession, \u201cthe interrogator\u2019s use of trickery is to be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 433 (2004). \u201c[W]here the use of a false statement is the <em>only </em>factor pointing in the direction of involuntariness, it will not ordinarily result in suppression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The officers\u2019 interrogation tactics in this case were not of a variety that we have previously condemned as impermissibly misleading. The officers properly questioned the defendant about the circumstances of the stabbing and any involvement he had in it. Although they varied their line of questioning at one point to ask why the defendant had committed the crime, such a change in the form of a question falls far short of an intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>misrepresentation that \u201cmay undermine \u2018the defendant\u2019s ability to make a free choice,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scoggins, </em>439 Mass. 571, 576 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 563, nor does it constitute a false statement. At no point did officers improperly imply that confessing would benefit the defendant, or exaggerate the strength of the evidence against him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>463 Mass. 95, 105 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">That the defendant invoked his right to counsel immediately after making the inculpatory statement does not render otherwise voluntary statements involuntary. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19, 27-32 (2001) (statements made after invocation of right to counsel should have been suppressed, but error was harmless where statements \u201cmirrored\u201d similar voluntary statements made prior to invoking right). The same is true regarding the length of time between the defendant\u2019s initial arrest and the time at which the statement in question was made. Although the statement was made during an interview in the midaftemoon of the day following his arrest, after the defendant had been held in the police station overnight, he was advised properly of his right to a prompt arraignment under <em>Rosario, supra, </em>and executed a waiver. There is no indication that the defendant was deprived of food or sleep while being held at the police station, nor is there any suggestion \u201cthat the delay in any way tainted the otherwise free, intelligent and voluntary statements of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>423 Mass. 517, 526 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">b. <em>Joinder of charges at trial. </em>The defendant argues that the joinder of the firearms charges with the murder charge for trial posed a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, where they were not \u201crelated offenses\u201d within the meaning of Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a), 378 Mass. 859 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) permits the joinder of \u201crelated offenses\u201d for trial \u201cif they are based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d \u201cFactors a judge may consider in determining whether offenses are related include factual similarities,. . . closeness of time and space[, and]. . . whether evidence of the other offenses would be admissible in separate trials on each offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>180 (2005), and cases cited. \u201cOffenses are related if the \u2018evidence in its totality shows a common scheme and pattern of operation that tends to prove\u2019 each of the complaints.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijao, </em>419 Mass. 486, 494-495 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 755-758 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">A defendant claiming that two or more offenses have been joined improperly for trial bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice from misjoinder. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zemtsov, </em>443 Mass. 36, 45 (2004). \u201cPrejudice requiring severance does not arise from the mere fact that the defendant\u2019s chances for acquittal of [one of the charges] might have been better\u201d had the offenses been tried separately. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981). Rather, the defendant must show that a particular tactic or right was foreclosed by the joinder. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Here, while the firearms and murder charges were not \u201crelated offenses,\u201d the defendant has not met his burden of demonstrating a specific ground of prejudice. It is the case, as the defendant argues, that \u201cthe firearms charges were entirely distinct from the homicide.\u201d The victim was stabbed with a knife; the firearm played no role in the attack, but was discovered in the defendant\u2019s vehicle as part of an inventory search following his arrest, along with ammunition. However, the defendant claims only that joinder tended to show his bad character or propensity to commit a crime; he does not point to a specific right or defense tactic that was unavailable to him as a result of such joinder. In any event, the jury acquitted the defendant of the firearms charges. \u201cSuch discernment by the factfinder in assessing the evidence is a strong indication that a misjoinder of offenses has not resulted in any actual prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 98,103 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 595 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">c. <em>Admission of hearsay evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the improper admission of hearsay evidence created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Specifically, he contends that testimony from a State trooper regarding Gary\u2019s identification of the green-handled knife as belonging to the defendant, not objected to at trial, was improper, since too much time had elapsed for it to qualify as an excited utterance; made almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>five hours after the stabbing at the police station, it was not a \u201cspontaneous reaction to an exciting event.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 240 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the testimony was proper as an extrajudicial identification, rather than as an excited utterance. \u201cTestimony by a third party, such as a police officer, regarding a witness\u2019s extrajudicial identification is substantively admissible if the identifying witness is unable or unwilling [to make an identification] in court and is available for cross-examination .... [I]t is immaterial that the identifying witness disavows having made a prior extrajudicial identification, or even denies having any basis for making an identification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raedy, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 446-447 (2007), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 441 (2005). Such testimony is admissible to establish identifying features of a defendant \u201cbecause of the superior probative worth of an identification made closer in time to the events in question.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 61 (1984), overruled on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, supra. </em>Where the identifying witness disavows his or her earlier identification, other prior identification testimony can be put to the jury, who \u201ccan determine whose version to believe.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, supra </em>at 439-440. In addition to testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s physical characteristics, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 72 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984), we have permitted descriptions of the weapon used by the defendant under this rule. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 170-171,. 175-176 (2000) (statement regarding color of defendant\u2019s gun, by declarant who knew that defendant possessed silver gun and saw him shoot victim with it, was properly admitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Here, though he denied that the knife produced at trial belonged to the defendant, Gary both testified that he previously had identified the knife as the defendant\u2019s and was available for cross-examination. The knife had unique features, including a green handle and a serrated edge, and matched the earlier description that Gary had given to police at the scene of the crime. However, Gary did not witness the defendant use the knife to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>commit a crime, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, id. </em>at 171, but rather identified the knife on the basis of his personal knowledge regarding his brother\u2019s possessions. Neither is it clear from the record when Gary last saw the defendant in custody of the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Assuming without deciding, however, that it was error to admit the testimony, any such error did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Although the testimony created an additional linkage between the defendant and the stabbing, that linkage was cumulative of other evidence against the defendant, including testimony about Gary\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s knife at the scene of the crime, testimony from an employee of the general contractor who saw a green knife next to the defendant before the stabbing, eyewitness accounts, and forensic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">d. <em>Denial of first motion for new trial without hearing. </em>The defendant argues that it was error to deny the first motion for a new trial without a hearing, particularly where the motion was based on recantation affidavits of Gary and Monica. The defendant maintains that an evidentiary hearing on the motion was required, given that recantation by witnesses requires \u201cserious consideration from the motion judge.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>432 Mass. 623, 632-633 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>377 Mass. 814, 837-838 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>409 Mass. 110 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Because the defendant\u2019s appeals of the denial of his first and second motions for a new trial have been consolidated with his direct appeal, we review them under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>450 Mass. 704, 711 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 353 (2007). See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Further, with respect to the first motion for a new trial, \u201c[i]n reviewing an order granting or denying a motion for a new trial, we accord deference to the views of a motion judge who was also the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 176 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). Even where a motion for a new trial is based on the recantation of trial witnesses, a defendant \u201cmay be required to present the evidence upon affidavits alone.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>Jones, supra </em>at 632, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coggins, </em>324 Mass. 552, 557, cert. denied, 338 U.S. 881 (1949). The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial \u201cis left to the sound discretion of the motion judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Here, the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, reviewed the recantation affidavits and determined that they were not credible, and, even if true, the absence of Gary\u2019s and Monica\u2019s testimony at trial would not have changed the verdict. In denying the motion for a new trial without a hearing, the motion judge properly \u201c[took] into account his knowledge of what occurred at trial [in order to] assess questions of credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>393 Mass. 523, 536-537 (1984), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 269 (1981). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">e. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that in deciding the second motion for a new trial, the motion judge erred in \u201cpapering over a wealth of evidence\u201d regarding the inadequacy of trial counsel\u2019s investigation of a defense based on the defendant\u2019s mental health. The defendant contends that trial counsel\u2019s forgoing of a comprehensive examination of the defendant\u2019s mental state and reliance instead on \u201cso palpably inadequate a defense\u201d of actual innocence was constitutionally ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we consider claims of ineffective assistance to determine \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). If we conclude \u201cthat counsel erred by failing to raise a substantial defense, \u2018a new trial is called for unless we are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>429 Mass. 590, 595 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 822 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u201cFailure to investigate an insanity defense would fall below the level of competence demanded of attorneys, if facts known to, or accessible to, trial counsel raised a reasonable doubt as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the defendant\u2019s mental condition.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 458-459 (1984), citing <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 104, 111 (1979). Such a failure to investigate an insanity defense is especially unreasonable where it is the only viable defense available to a defendant. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haggerty, </em>400 Mass. 437, 441-442 (1987) (defendant deprived of effective assistance of counsel where \u201cdefense counsel abandons the only defense available to a defendant and leaves the defendant without any defense at all\u201d). However, a decision not to pursue an insanity defense for tactical reasons, for instance because in the circumstances the defense would be factually weak, is not tantamount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Genius, </em>387 Mass. 695, 699 (1982), <em>S.C., </em>402 Mass. 711 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The defendant argues that this case is akin to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>428 Mass. 278, 279-282 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>440 Mass. 245 (2003), where we held that the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was violated by trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a defense based on a lack of criminal responsibility. In that case, the defendant\u2019s parents told defense counsel, prior to trial, that the defendant had received mental health treatment at the suggestion of the police, \u201cbefore [the] crime and before trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279. Trial counsel did not follow up on this information, nor did he attempt to obtain further information from the local mental health center or ask the defendant to submit to a psychiatric evaluation. <em>Id. </em>Instead, trial counsel made his own assessment of the defendant\u2019s mental health. <em>Id. </em>We stated in that case that trial counsel \u201ccould not have made an accurate assessment of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime without expert training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279 n.2. The defendant argues that here, likewise, trial counsel\u2019s opinion as to his mental state was an inadequate substitute for a court-appointed psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Commonwealth maintains that the circumstances here instead should be compared to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 225-228 (2005), where we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. There, trial counsel was aware of the defendant\u2019s history of alcohol and drug abuse, his prior suicide attempt, and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>that he had been discharged from the armed services due to psychiatric problems. <em>Id. </em>at 223. However, we held that such facts were insufficient to suggest a potential mental health defense, where the suicide attempt and discharge had occurred thirteen years previously and neither incident suggested that the defendant was suffering from mental illness at the time of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Moreover, in meetings with trial counsel, the defendant consistently presented himself as a responsible father and maintained that he had committed the crime in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 226. The Commonwealth argues that trial counsel similarly lacked notice of the defendant\u2019s mental problems in this case, and that a defense based on a lack of criminal responsibility would have been inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s adamant and unfailing denial of any involvement in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Although the question is a close one, we are ultimately convinced that trial counsel\u2019s assistance was not ineffective. It remains the case that an attorney\u2019s own assessment of her client cannot replace the opinion of a mental health professional with expert training, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, supra </em>at 279 n.2; however, here, there were no facts known or accessible to trial counsel that would have put her on notice of the need to obtain a psychiatric evaluation of her client, even after she conducted additional investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Trial counsel met with the defendant approximately twelve times. During those meetings, the defendant did not appear to be suffering from psychiatric problems, nor did he report any prior hallucinations. Although he discussed his history of chronic methamphetamine abuse, and the fact that he had been treated for alcohol abuse as a teenager, he stated that he was not under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of the stabbing, nor had he consumed the drug that day. There is no suggestion in the record that he told counsel of any prior psychotic episodes or hallucinatory behavior. The defendant complied with counsel\u2019s recommendations as to how to conduct himself during the arraignment, and did not exhibit hallucinatory behavior either during trial preparation or during the trial itself. There are likewise no reports in the record of the defendant suffering from any hallucinations or psychotic episodes while incarcerated awaiting trial. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra </em>at 226, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>defendant consistently maintained that he was acting in self-defense, here, too, the defendant claimed innocence, thus presenting trial counsel with a theory of defense to pursue at trial other than lack of criminal responsibility. Indeed, the two discussed strategy at their many meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In addition to meeting with the defendant on twelve occasions, trial counsel actively communicated with the defendant\u2019s mother. Counsel asked her about the incident involving treatment at a rehabilitation center for alcohol abuse that the defendant had discussed with her. The defendant\u2019s mother indicated that the care the defendant had received was not, in fact, related to alcohol, but that when he was fifteen or sixteen years old,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant had had a \u201cbreak\u201d for which he received mental health treatment. Counsel attempted to obtain the medical records, almost twenty years old, from the treatment facility, but was unsuccessful in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">However, there is no evidence that the defendant\u2019s mother discussed with trial counsel the incident that the mother later recounted in her affidavit submitted in connection with the defendant\u2019s second motion for a new trial, where she spoke of the defendant \u201ctalking crazy\u201d and being taken to the hospital, over ten months before the stabbing. There is likewise no evidence that the hallucinations described by other family members in affidavits, submitted ten years after the stabbing, were recounted to counsel before the trial in 2003. In addition to speaking with the defendant\u2019s mother, counsel spoke with the defendant\u2019s ex-wife, with his brother Gary, and with his cousin Thomas in preparing her defense. None of them mentioned that the defendant was suffering or had suffered from psychiatric problems, nor did any speak of the defendant having experienced hallucinations at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Thus, the only information concerning possible mental illness of which trial counsel was on notice was a \u201cbreak\u201d that had occurred while the defendant was a teenager, approximately two decades earlier. After interviewing four different family members and attempting to locate nearly twenty year old medical records, counsel had no concrete information available to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>regarding the defendant\u2019s current mental state that would have suggested a defense of lack of criminal responsibility. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra </em>at 225 (counsel was informed that defendant had attempted suicide thirteen years earlier, but such incident did not suggest that defendant was suffering from mental illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We recognize that, given the unusual and apparently motiveless circumstances of the crime, the defendant\u2019s flat affect, the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic and eyewitness evidence, and the defendant\u2019s history of methamphetamine abuse, another attorney might well have investigated the psychological effects of this type of drug abuse to determine whether it would have had a possible connection with the crime. Research into the effects of long-term methamphetamine abuse would presumably have revealed the extant DSM chapter on amphetamine-induced disorders, including amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as well as academic literature on the spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine-induced psychosis. In light of the strong evidence against him, establishing that the defendant was suffering from methamphetamine-induced psychosis at the time of the stabbing might have been a more powerful defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">However, in the circumstances here, particularly where trial counsel was not on notice of the defendant\u2019s belatedly-asserted prior psychotic episodes and hallucinations, she was not under a constitutional duty to undertake a supplemental investigation. This is especially so given the limited prevalence of methamphetamine use in the Commonwealth in the early 2000s, and the attendant limited exposure of attorneys to methamphetamine-related crimes at that time. Trial counsel testified at the hearing on the second motion for a new trial that, at the time of trial preparation, methamphetamine was \u201cnot something that was common yet to our area.\u201d Presskreischer, the psychologist, who opined that the defendant was \u201cmost likely\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> suffering from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine-induced psychosis, acknowledged that she had no professional experience with psychosis induced by methamphetamine in particular, since that drug is not as common in the \u201cmid-Atlantic States\u201d as it is in other parts of the country. Indeed, a 2001 report on drug prevalence in the Commonwealth notes that, at the time,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201c[m]ethamphetamine [was] available in small quantities in Massachusetts, but the drug [was] not a significant threat to users or society. Some reporting occasionally suggested] that methamphetamine might be growing in popularity in New England, but the region [had] yet to see a widespread increase in trafficking, distribution, or use. Methamphetamine production occur[ed] in Massachusetts on only a very small scale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">National Drug Intelligence Center, Massachusetts Drug Threat Assessment at 32 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We discern no error in the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant did not demonstrate that facts known or accessible to trial counsel would have put her on notice of a potential mental health defense. Nor do we discern error in his conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a mental health defense did not fall below constitutional standards of competency. Accordingly, because the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, the motion for a new trial properly was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">f. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have conducted plenary review of the entire record pursuant to our obligation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We are satisfied that the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel and that he was afforded a fair trial. The extraordinary remedy of relief under G.
