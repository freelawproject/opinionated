The board denied the applications, concluding that Doherty had not demonstrated that her lots were \u201cnot subject to flooding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 470.9 of the zoning bylaw. Doherty sought review pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17; after a bench trial, a Land Court judge entered judgment affirming the board\u2019s decision and dismissing Doherty\u2019s complaint. In an unpublished order and memorandum pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court reversed, concluding that the phrase \u201csubject to flooding\u201d has a specific meaning derived from a map setting forth the FPWP district and based only on elevation from sea level. We granted the board\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the Appeals Court adopted an incorrect definition of the phrase \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d and we agree with the meaning adopted by the Land Court judge, we affirm the judgment entered by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The judge found the following facts, which we occasionally supplement with undisputed facts in the record. See <em>Wendy\u2019s Old Fashioned Hamburgers of N.Y., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Billerica, </em>454 Mass. 374, 383 (2009) (Wendy\u2019s) (on appellate review, judge\u2019s factual findings will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous or where there is no evidence to support them). The unimproved lots in question are located at 114 and 118 Edward Foster Road, in the town\u2019s A-3 residential district. The lots consist of approximately 21,600 and 20,950 square feet in area. They are located on a barrier beach peninsula. The easterly side of the peninsula is bounded by the Massachusetts Bay, and the westerly, or landward side, is bounded by Scituate Harbor. On either end of the peninsula, in a north-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>south direction, are the geographic areas known as First Cliff and Second Cliff. The two lots lie on a strip of land between and connecting these cliffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On the ocean side of Edward Foster Road (facing Massachusetts Bay), a concrete seawall abuts the residential homes between the First Cliff and Second Cliff. The height of the seawall stands consistently at 19.4 feet, with the exception of the seawall abutting both of Doherty\u2019s lots. That portion of the seawall, in the main, stands only 16.5 feet high.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The single-family dwellings proposed by the plaintiff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would comply with all setback and other dimensional requirements, and would be constructed on pilings. The land under the footprints of the dwellings ranges in elevation from fourteen to sixteen feet above sea level.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The local building inspector determined that the lots were located in the FPWP district and that, as a consequence, the plaintiff needed to obtain special permits from the board authorizing construction of new residential dwellings on the lots. The FPWP district is an \u201coverlay\u201d zoning district that was established in 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time, the local conservation commission retained the services of Vincent John Kalishes, III (Kalishes), and Bill Richardson (Richardson) to create the FPWP district, which was intended \u201cto protect the town\u2019s coastal resources and watersheds.\u201d Kalishes and Richardson were to do \u201cresearch to establish where those areas [flood plains and watersheds] are and to identify them and then to come up with some type of mapping system that could be reproduced on the ground by a surveyor or engineer.\u201d According to Kalishes, \u201cthe scope of the available data at that time was limited, but we got together what we could from the National Weather service and local knowledge and ... we had meetings in the neighborhoods to get information about where certain lands might be and what had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>impacted.\u201d Thereafter, they developed a map that showed these flood areas.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The map that was created is entitled, \u201cTown of Scituate, Massachusetts, Flood Plain and Watershed Protection District, 1972\u201d (map). Section 470.3 of the zoning bylaw provides that \u201c[t]he locations and boundaries of the [FPWP district] shall be as shown on [the map] . . . [and are] made a part of this zoning bylaw.\u201d On the map, the boundaries of the district are indicated by thick dashed lines. Along the dashed lines are references, such as \u201c10 foot contour\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201c50 feet behind sea wall.\u201d The dashed lines do not follow lot lines, but instead follow natural profiles of the land and other permanent boundaries. The \u201c[m]ap shows the boundary of the [FPWP district] encircling the areas of First and Second Cliff at an elevation of ten feet, placing the encircled area <em>outside </em>the [district, while placing the remainder of the barrier beach peninsula [and the lots] within the [district.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The map was intended to be relevant only for determining the location of the FPWP district.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The construction of a new residential dwelling on land located in the FPWP district is prohibited unless a special permit is obtained. To obtain a special permit, \u00a7 470.9 of the zoning bylaw requires an applicant to demonstrate that the land on which the construction is proposed is \u201cin fact not subject to flooding.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In April, 2008, the plaintiff applied to the board for the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>permits. The board conducted three days of public hearings. At the hearings, several neighborhood residents described flooding conditions on the lots during various storms, including the \u201cBlizzard of 1978\u201d and \u201cthe October 1991 Nor\u2019easter.\u201d Also mentioned was the existence of the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) flood zones and there was discussion regarding \u201cwhether information from FEMA should be used in the decision making process.\u201d In its decision, the board noted that a majority of its members \u201cagreed [that] a substantial amount of water would be present on the site during flood events.\u201d The board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application, concluding that the sites \u201cdo not meet the criteria for Section 470.9,\u201d i.e., the plaintiff had not established that the lots were \u201cin fact not subject to flooding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 470.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Affirming the board\u2019s decision, the Land Court judge heard evidence from neighbors, which he credited, concerning their observations of flooding conditions on the lots,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and heard expert testimony from both parties concerning the location of the lots in FEMA flood zones. The judge found that FEMA\u2019s knowledge of flooding today is based on greater technological and scientific advancements than were available in the early 1970s. Based on these advances, FEMA has recognized and defined three flood zones: a velocity zone, an overwash zone, and an \u201cAE\u201d zone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Each of these flood zones is present on both lots in varying degrees such that, in the event of a \u201chundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>year storm,\u201d see note 12, <em>supra, </em>significant flooding with wave action consisting of waves at least less than three feet in height, can be expected on the lots.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The FEMA flood zones, however, postdate the creation of the map.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">As relevant here, the judge noted that the zoning bylaw does not define the phrase \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d The judge looked to the ordinary meaning of the phrase as defined in a dictionary in circulation at the time, Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1967), as well as the stated purposes of the bylaw. He concluded that the phrase is \u201cbroad, and encompasses all varieties of water rising and overflowing on normally dry land.\u201d The judge reasoned that, to limit the meaning of the phrase to either solely elevation or surge flooding, as flooding was understood in the 1970s when the FPWP district was established, would frustrate the stated purpose of the district of protecting \u201cthe health and safety of persons against those hazards which may result from unsuitable development... in areas subject to flooding.\u201d Therefore, the judge determined that the board permissibly could \u201cimport the latest science and technology of flooding!] into its construction of the [bjylaw\u201d and \u201cwas not precluded from relying upon the witness testimony that it did, or the presence of FEMA [fjlood [zjones, to establish that the . . . lots are subject to flooding.\u201d The judge went on to determine that the lots are indeed \u201csubject to flooding\u201d within the meaning of the bylaw, and that the board\u2019s decision \u201cwas in no way arbitrary, capricious or whimsical, nor was it legally untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Doherty appealed. In an unpublished order and memorandum pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court reversed, concluding that \u201cthe board erred in relying on FEMA flood mapping, a standard not permitted by the by-law; thus, the board\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>was based on a legally untenable ground.\u201d The Appeals Court determined that the map alone identifies and defines the land that is \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d and that the phrase \u201csubject to flooding\u201d encompasses only the meaning that existed in 1972 when the bylaw was amended to establish the FPWP district. That meaning involved a concept of flooding that was predicated solely on elevation. In support of its conclusion, the Appeals Court cited <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973) <em>(Turnpike </em>Realty), for the proposition that the meaning of the phrase \u201csubject to flooding\u201d in the zoning bylaw \u201cis found in the 1972 map.\u201d The Appeals Court went on to conclude that the board wrongfully denied the special permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cJudicial review of a local zoning board\u2019s denial of a special permit involves a combination of de novo and deferential analyses.\u201d <em>Shirley Wayside Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Shirley, </em>461 Mass. 469, 474 (2012) <em>(Shirley </em>Wayside), citing <em>Wendy\u2019s, </em>454 Mass. at 381. \u201cThe trial judge makes his own findings of facts and need not give weight to those the board has found.\u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra. </em>See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. \u201cThe judge then \u2018determines the content and meaning of statutes and by-laws and . . . decides whether the board has chosen from those sources the proper criteria and standards to use in deciding to grant or to deny the variance or special permit application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra, </em>quoting <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 73 (2003). \u201cWe accord deference to a local board\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own zoning bylaw . . . with the caveat that an \u2018incorrect interpretation of a statute ... is not entitled to deference (citations omitted).\u2019 \u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra </em>at 475, quoting <em>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>439 Mass. 1, 6 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\u201cAfter determining the facts and clarifying the appropriate legal standards, the judge determines whether the board has applied those standards in an \u2018unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary\u2019 manner.\u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra, </em>quoting <em>Wendy\u2019s, </em>454 Mass. at 382. \u201cThis stage of judicial review \u2018involves a highly deferential bow to local control over community planning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra, </em>quoting <em>Wendy\u2019s, supra. </em>\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>board is entitled to deny a permit even \u2018if the facts found by the court would support its issuance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra, </em>quoting <em>Wendy\u2019s, supra </em>at 383. \u201cThe judge nonetheless should overturn a board\u2019s decision when \u2018no rational view of the facts the court has found supports the board\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra, </em>quoting <em>Wendy\u2019s, supra. </em>On appellate review, \u201c[w]e review the judge\u2019s determinations of law, including interpretations of zoning bylaws, de novo.\u201d <em>Shirley Wayside, supra. </em>The traditional canons of statutory construction apply to zoning bylaws. <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass. 283, 290 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>As an initial matter, a municipality may validly use its zoning power to restrict development in areas that are prone to flooding. See <em>Turnpike Realty, 362 </em>Mass. at 227-228. \u201c[T]hree basic public policy objectives of restricting use of flood plains have been advanced: (1) the protection of individuals who might choose, despite the flood dangers, to develop or occupy land on a flood plain; (2) the protection of other landowners from damages resulting from the development of a flood plain and the consequent obstruction of the flood flow; [and] (3) the protection of the entire community from individual choices of land use which require subsequent public expenditures for public works and disaster relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228-229, citing Dunham, Flood Control Via the Police Power, 107 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1098, 1110-1117 (1959). Consistent with these public policy objectives, the stated purposes of the FPWP district bylaw permissibly include: \u201cprotecting] the health and safety of persons against those hazards which may result from unsuitable development in . . . areas subject to flooding,\u201d \u201cconserving] the values of lands and buildings in such flood-prone areas,\u201d and \u201cencouraging] the most appropriate and suitable use of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Pursuant to the bylaw in this case, once land is determined to be located in the FPWP district, as the lots are here, the construction of new residential dwellings requires a special permit pursuant to \u00a7 470.9, which in turn requires the applicant to establish that the land is \u201cin fact not subject to flooding.\u201d The phrase, \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d is not defined in the zoning bylaw. As recognized by the parties, the case turns on the meaning of this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The plaintiff argued, and the Appeals Court agreed, that the meaning of the phrase, \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d is \u201capparent\u201d from the bylaw, which adopts the map, which in turn employs elevation as solely determinative of flooding. Although the bylaw does expressly incorporate and adopt the map, and although the map uses various contours as some of its boundaries, we conclude that the map does not define \u201csubject to flooding\u201d as meaning only whether land is above or below a certain elevation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">First, a close examination of the map shows that it does not exclusively use contours as district boundaries. The map also marks boundaries using designations such as \u201c50 Feet Behind Wall,\u201d \u201cE Jericho Road,\u201d \u201cWesterly Edge RR Bed,\u201d \u201cSouth of Curb,\u201d various distances from \u201cBrook,\u201d and \u201c100 Ft. Edge of Pond.\u201d To the extent that the map uses contours as boundaries in some instances, it is by no means in all instances and, more importantly, not on the land on which the lots lie.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, where the map does employ contours as boundaries, it does not do so based on a uniform elevation. For example, in addition to setting forth various \u201c10 foot contour[s],\u201d the map has boundary designations of \u201c12 foot contour,\u201d \u201c15 foot contour,\u201d and \u201cMean sea level.\u201d The map, on its face, does not look to elevation or to one elevation as solely determinative of whether land is \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Significantly, to limit the phrase, \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>map boundaries (whatever elevation or designation they may be) would render \u00a7 470.9 of the bylaw impermissibly superfluous. See <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985) (statute should not be construed \u201cso as to render it or any portion of it meaningless\u201d). This is so because if the boundary designation were the sole criteria in determining whether land is \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d then no special permit procedure would be needed to show that land on a particular lot is \u201cin fact not subject to flooding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The judge correctly looked to the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cflood\u201d as used in the phrase \u201csubject to flooding\u201d and correctly determined that \u201cflooding\u201d is a broad term. \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge consulted such a source, a Webster\u2019s Dictionary in circulation at the time the FPWP district was created, Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1967), which defined \u201cflood\u201d as \u201ca rising and overflowing of water especially onto normally dry land.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Also, prior to 1972, other accepted definitions of the term \u201cflooding\u201d did not restrict the meaning of the term to elevation only. See, e.g., <em>Long Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>67 S.E.2d 512, 515 (S.C. 1951) (noting that \u201cflood\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [3d ed.] as \u201cinundation of water over land not usually covered by it\u201d and in another text as \u201ca body of water rising, swelling, and overflowing land not usually covered with water\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">A broad meaning of the phrase, \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d encompassing, as the judge explained, \u201call varieties of water rising and overflowing on normally dry land,\u201d is consistent with three of the stated purposes of the bylaw, namely, \u201c[t]o protect the health and safety of persons against those hazards which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>may result from unsuitable development... in areas subject to flooding,\u201d \u201c[t]o conserve the values of lands and buildings in such flood-prone areas,\u201d and \u201c[t]o encourage the most appropriate and suitable use of the land,\u201d as well as with the recognized public policy concerns prompting flood plain zoning regulation. See <em>Gove </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>444 Mass. 754, 757, 761 (2005); <em>Turnpike Realty, </em>362 Mass. at 228-229. The public safety issues relative to \u201cthe damage to life and property caused by flooding,\u201d <em>Turnpike Realty, supra </em>at 233, are the concerns, not an artificial modifier focused on elevation. Thus, the purposes of the bylaw do not reflect a restricted concept of flooding based solely on elevation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Further, the judge correctly reasoned that the board could, in determining whether the lots were \u201csubject to flooding,\u201d consider testimony of witnesses describing their observations of water on the lots<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as well as the presence of FEMA flood zones which describe expected occurrences, albeit infrequent, of floodwater and wave action on the lots. This conclusion is informed by the inclusion of the phrase, \u201cas being in fact,\u201d that precedes the phrase \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d The phrase \u201cin fact\u201d means \u201cin truth: actually, really,\u201d \u201can actual happening in time or space.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 813 (1993). See <em>id. </em>at 873 (defining \u201cflood\u201d as \u201ca rising and overflowing of a body of water that covers land not usually under water\u201d). Thus, by its express terms, \u201cin fact not subject to flooding\u201d status permits consideration of evidence of the actual occurrences of flooding on the lots. See <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass, at 290 (\u201cSpecific provisions of a zoning enactment are to be read in the context of the law as a whole, giving the language its common and approved meaning . . .\u201d). The words \u201cas being in fact\u201d cannot be ignored and are not superfluous.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Also significant to us is \u00a7 470.1 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the bylaw, which sets forth the purposes of the bylaw. It is noteworthy that the first purpose speaks to \u201careas subject to flooding,\u201d followed by, in the next purpose, the phrase \u201cin such flood-prone areas.\u201d The use of this language suggests that land \u201csubject to flooding\u201d is to be synonymous with \u201cflood-prone areas,\u201d which also is a broad phrase that was not further defined or restricted under the bylaw. See <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The provision in \u00a7 470.10 of the bylaw does not, as the plaintiff contends, \u201cmake[] plain that elevation is to be determinative.\u201d A complete reading of this section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cWhenever an application is made for a building permit on land which the building commissioner[] believes may involve the use of land in the [FPWP district], he or she may require the applicant for such permit to provide as part of such application a plan of the lot on which said building [] is intended to be built, showing elevations of the land contours at one foot intervals, referred mean sea level datum and certified by a registered land surveyor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">When read in its entirety, the import of this section is to determine whether certain land indeed falls within the district. Here, there is no dispute that the lots are located in the district. If (or once) the land is determined to fall within the district, \u00a7 470.9 applies, requiring a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Our decision in <em>Turnpike Realty </em>does not require a contrary result. In <em>Turnpike Realty, </em>we upheld a bylaw regulating filling and building in a flood plain district. <em>Turnpike Realty, </em>362 Mass. at 229. We examined a special permit procedure in the bylaw in that case (a procedure nearly identical to the one in this case) that established a special permit procedure relating to land \u201cnot subject to flooding or not unsuitable because of drainage conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230-231. We stated that the purpose of such a provision was \u201cto prevent injustice resulting from the establishment of zoning districts based on \u2018the physical char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>acteristics of substantial areas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, quoting <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of New Bedford, </em>308 Mass. 128, 132 (1941). We set forth an example where a landowner might apply for a special permit pursuant to this provision, i.e., where the landowner could establish that portions of his land, namely, two knolls, \u201cone of 3.2 acres and the other of .2 acres,\u201d within the district \u201c[rose] above the general level of the swamp\u201d and were \u201cnot subject to flooding.\u201d <em>Turnpike Realty, supra </em>at 223, 230-231. We made clear, however, that elevation alone, or even an inadvertent inclusion of the property in the flood plain district, did not obviate the need for the landowner to apply for a special permit. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 237. The <em>Turnpike Realty </em>case does not, as suggested by the Appeals Court, stand for the proposition that a property owner can circumvent the procedures and requirements of the bylaw and rely only on the content of a map and a contour boundary therein to determine whether certain property, regardless of its area and the portion of that area rising above the flood plain, is \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d Further, nothing in the <em>Turnpike Realty </em>case addresses the types of evidence that may be considered to determine whether land is \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our conclusion does not render the bylaw impermissibly vague. \u201cIt is true, of course, that a zoning ordinance or by-law may not be cast in such vague terms that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Fogelman </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 588 (1983), citing <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Brockton Bd. of Appeals, </em>344 Mass. 208, 212 (1962). \u201cBut this does not mean that the application of the zoning ordinance or by-law may not validly call for the exercise of judgment ... or require findings of fact to determine whether particular land falls within the regulatory framework established by the ordinance or by-law\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Fogelman </em>v. <em>Chatham, supra </em>at 588-589. The standard to be applied by the board in this case \u2014 that the land is \u201cin fact not subject to flooding,\u201d considered together with the general purposes of the FPWP district and the public policy concerns of development in flood plains, and the existence of judicial review \u2014 has been determined to be precise. <em>Turnpike Realty, </em>362 Mass. at 231-232. The standard is not subject to attack for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We briefly address some of the plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>We are not bound by a model bylaw that was consulted when drafting the bylaw, rather, we are to construe the language of the bylaw at issue. Nor are we bound or estopped by former decisions of the board regarding unrelated property. See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. 205, 224 (1982) (doctrine of estoppel not applicable to municipalities); <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Cohasset, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 456 n.9 (2006) (local zoning decisions do not necessarily qualify as final determinations for issue or claim preclusive effect because of various provisions of Zoning Act that bear on finality). Further amendments to the bylaw were not necessary to convey the meaning of \u201csubject to flooding\u201d because the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase is broad and unrestrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Last, the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the board and judge applied the standard \u2014 whether the land is \u201csubject to flooding\u201d \u2014 in an unreasonable manner is based only on an argument that the standard involves elevation only as noted on the map. Because we reject that argument, the plaintiff\u2019s contention similarly fails. We point out, however, that our review of the record shows that the board did not apply the standard at issue in an \u201cunreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary\u201d manner.

Another neighbor recounted that, after the \u201cBlizzard of 1978,\u201d water completely washed over the lots for three days, leaving over five feet of wet sand covering the road.

The judge\u2019s finding on the issue is supported by the evidence. The ten-foot contour line on First Cliff and Second Cliff is relevant only to the property encircled on First Cliff and Second Cliff (signifying that those lands within the circles are exempted from the FPWP district). The land outside of those contour lines, including the lots, is included in the FPWP district. Kalishes testified that the lots were intentionally included in the FPWP district and that, on the land comprising the barrier beach peninsula on which the lots were located, \u201cthere would be land that\u2019s higher or above or below [and] that\u2019s why you go to the permitting authority to determine whether you[r] lots flood or not.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The plaintiff contends that the \u201cvariant boundary designations\u201d on the map, or designations that differ from a ten-foot contour boundary, are not relevant because they are located in noncoastal areas and regarding those in coastal areas, they \u201care either proxies for the [ten-foot contour] or are accommodations to political or commercial realities.\u201d Although the plaintiff has provided some evidence to support this contention, it does not, however, change the fact that a ten-foot contour line was not uniformly used on the map or the fact that the lots are located in the FPWP district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The definition is similar to more current definitions.

Elevation was a factor, but Kalishes also relied, in part, on the observations of others in determining whether land was \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d As the Land Court judge noted, \u201c[i]t is unlikely that the residents interviewed [as part of preparing the map] understood or were aware of the distinction between surge flooding and other observable instances of water flowing onto normally dry land, when they reported their observations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Our construction does not compel a conclusion in a future case that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>mere puddle on land after a storm is indicative that the land is \u201csubject to flooding.\u201d Local boards and courts should \u201cnot abandon reason and common sense\u201d in construing a bylaw. <em>DeMello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Acushnet, </em>21 Mass.
