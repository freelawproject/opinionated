L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(f), </em>where a defendant convicted of a sex offense is not \u201csentenced to immediate confinement,\u201d the judge \u201cshall relieve such sex offender of the obligation to register\u201d as a sex offender with the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) if the judge, within fourteen days of sentencing, determines that \u201cthe circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history indicate that the sex offender does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public.\u201d However, \u00a7 178E (f) also provides that a judge \u201cmay not make such a determination or finding if the sex offender . . . has been convicted of a sex offense involving a child.\u201d The defendant in this case was convicted of statutory rape of a fourteen year old girl, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, which is a \u201csex offense involving a child\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, and was not sentenced to immediate confinement. The issue presented in this case is whether a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>may relieve the defendant of the obligation to register with SORB because \u00a7 178E (f) declares that a judge \u201cmay not,\u201d rather than \u201cshall not,\u201d make the required determination. We conclude that the judge may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><em>Background. </em>After a jury-waived trial, the defendant was found guilty of one count of statutory rape and sentenced to a term of probation of six years, with special conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion for relief from the obligation to register as a sex offender, and the Commonwealth filed an opposition. After hearing, the judge found that, if \u00a7 178E (f) allows him the discretion to determine that the circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s criminal history indicate that the defendant does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public, \u201cthe circumstances in this case present exactly the situation in which that discretion should be applied in favor of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge recognized that \u201c[t]he more difficult question\u201d is whether he was barred under \u00a7 178E (f) from relieving the defendant of the obligation to register because the defendant had been convicted of a sex offense involving a child. The judge concluded that \u00a7 178E (f) did not bar him from doing so. He reasoned that the Legislature used the word \u201cmay\u201d when it allowed a judge or a board to exercise discretion, and \u201cshall\u201d when it prohibited such discretion, and that the choice of the words \u201cmay not\u201d in \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>reflected the Legislature\u2019s intent to grant a judge the discretion to relieve a defendant of the obligation of registering with SORB even where the defendant has been convicted of a sex offense involving a child. The Commonwealth sought relief from the judge\u2019s order relieving the defendant of the obligation to register by filing a petition with the single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice reserved and reported the petition to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>if), </em>provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cIn the case of a sex offender who has been convicted of a sex offense . . . and who has not been sentenced to immediate confinement, the court shall, within [fourteen] days of sentencing, determine whether the circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history indicate that the sex offender does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public. If the court so determines, the court shall relieve such sex offender of the obligation to register under [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7] 178C to 178P, inclusive. The court may not make such a determination or finding if the sex offender has been determined to be a sexually violent predator; has been convicted of two or more sex offenses defined as sex offenses pursuant to the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071, committed on different occasions; has been convicted of a sex offense involving a child or a sexually violent offense; or if the sex offender is otherwise subject to minimum or lifetime registration requirements as determined by [SORB] to [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7] 178D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u201c[T]he meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boe, </em>456 Mass. 337, 347 (2010), quoting <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982). Because criminal penalties may be imposed on a defendant who is required to register and fails to do so, we apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d in interpreting the registration requirement and \u201c \u2018resolve any ambiguities\u2019 against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ventura, </em>465 Mass. 202, 212 (2013), quoting <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 151564 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 612, 618 (2010). Therefore, if the statute were \u201cfound plausibly to be ambiguous, the defendant is given the benefit of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742 (1996). We conclude that there is no such plausible ambiguity in \u00a7 178E <em>if); </em>where, as here, a defendant is convicted of a sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>offense involving a child, the language of \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>clearly prohibits a judge from making the determination that \u201cthe circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history indicate that the sex offender does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public,\u201d and thereby prohibits a judge from relieving the defendant of the obligation to register with SORB.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">According to the plain language of \u00a7 178E (f), where a judge sentences a defendant to a term of probation rather than a sentence of \u201cimmediate confinement,\u201d the judge for many defendants has the discretion timely to consider the circumstances of the offense and the criminal history of the defendant, and determine whether the defendant \u201cdoes not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public.\u201d Where a judge makes such a determination, the judge is required to relieve the defendant of the obligation to register with SORB. However, for certain defendants, including a defendant convicted of a sex offense involving a child, a judge \u201cmay not make such a determination\u201d and therefore lacks the authority to relieve the defendant of the obligation to register. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Domino, 465 Mass. 569, 582 (2013) (defendant \u201cstatutorily foreclosed\u201d from relief from registration under \u00a7 178E [f], because of prior convictions of rape of child); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 424 n.13 (2001) (\u201cexceptions to registration\u201d under \u00a7 178E <em>[f] </em>\u201cdo not apply to . . . those convicted of sex offenses involving a child or sexually violent offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in a statute is generally permissive, reflecting the Legislature\u2019s intent to grant discretion or permission to make a finding or authorize an act. See, e.g., <em>School Comm, of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 81 (1982) (\u201cthe word \u2018may\u2019 does not impose a mandate but simply authorizes an act\u201d). The use of the words \u201cmay not\u201d denies such discretion or permission, and is therefore mandatory in nature. See, e.g., <em>Edwards, petitioner, </em>464 Mass. 454, 462-463 (2013) (judge \u201cmay not\u201d reduce hourly rate of retained expert below that set by Committee for Public Counsel Services); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., </em>437 Mass. 592, 597 (2002) (judge may not, over Commonwealth\u2019s objection, impose \u201csubstantial\u201d period of pretrial probation). Here, the Legislature granted sentencing judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>in certain circumstances the discretion to make a factual finding that would require relief from registration, but denied judges the discretion to make that determination in other circumstances, including where the defendant has been convicted of a sex crime involving a child. Therefore, we see no distinction between the words \u201cshall not\u201d and \u201cmay not\u201d in terms of their practical consequence. Neither allows the exercise of discretion. Where the Legislature grants discretion in some circumstances and denies it in others, the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d contrasted with the words \u201cmay not\u201d simply clarifies where discretion is granted and where it is forbidden more effectively than the words \u201cshall not.\u201d Compare G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(e) </em>(on written motion of Commonwealth, judge \u201cmay\u201d at time of sentencing find that sex offender shall not be required to register if judge determines that circumstances of offense and offender\u2019s criminal history do not indicate risk of reoffense or danger to public, but judge \u201cmay not make such a finding if the sex offender has been . . . convicted of a sex offense involving a child\u201d), with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d) </em>(SORB may relieve sex offender of further obligation to register where it makes specific written findings that circumstances of offense and offender\u2019s criminal history do not indicate risk of reoffense or danger to public, but \u201cprovisions of this subsection shall... not apply if a sex offender has been convicted of a sex offense involving a child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Therefore, although we understand why the judge, in light of the circumstances of this offense and the offender\u2019s absence of significant criminal history, wished to have the discretion to relieve the defendant of the obligation to register as a sex offender, the plain language of \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>forbids the exercise of such discretion where, as here, the defendant has been convicted of a sex offense involving a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, we remand this case to the single justice with instructions to vacate the judge\u2019s order relieving the defendant of the obligation to register as a sex offender, and to remand the case to the Superior Court for a further hearing so that the defendant may be informed in accordance with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (c), of his duty to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The defendant was found not guilty of one count of rape of a child by force, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A; two counts of rape of a child, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; and one count of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years of age or older, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The statutory rape conviction was based on the fourteen year old victim performing oral sex on the twenty-one year old defendant. The judge found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cwrong and criminal,\u201d but that the circumstances did not suggest that the defendant \u201cis a sexually violent predator or that he is somebody that poses a danger to society or to the public or that he poses a risk of re-offense of a sexual nature.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
