L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q, the sex offender registry law (SORL), including amendments that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>require the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) to publish on the Internet information contained in the sex offender registry (registry information) regarding all individuals given a level two or level three classification by SORB. See St. 2013, c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9. Before these amendments were enacted, \u00a7 178D required SORB to publish on the Internet the registry information of sex offenders given a level three classification, but expressly prohibited SORB from publishing on the Internet the registry information of level two offenders. The issues presented are whether the amendments are retroactive in effect \u201cfor the purposes of further constitutional inquiry,\u201d as applied to those who were classified as level two offenders on or before the date of the amendments\u2019 enactment, see <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 787 (2008) <em>(Doe No. 8725); </em>whether the Legislature intended that they apply retroactively; and, if so, whether their retroactive application would violate due process under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We conclude that the amendments are retroactive in effect as applied to level two offenders who were classified on or before the date of the amendments\u2019 enactment and that the Legislature intended such retroactive application, but that such retroactive application would violate State constitutional due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>History of the case. </em>On July 5, 2013, after the Legislature had passed the amendments but before the Governor had signed them into law, the named plaintiffs, as putative representatives of the class of all persons presently and prospectively classified as level two sex offenders, filed in the county court a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction barring SORB from publishing registry information on the Internet of the class of level two offenders, as well as a declaratory judgment, and was accompanied by a motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 25, 2013, the single justice allowed the motion of the plaintiff class<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the extent that he preliminarily enjoined SORB from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>publishing on the Internet the registry information of any individual who had been finally classified as a level two sex offender on or before July 12, 2013, pending final adjudication of this proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The single justice denied the plaintiff class\u2019s motion to preliminarily enjoin SORB from publishing on the Internet the registry information of any individual who had been given a final classification as a level two sex offender after July 12, 2013. The single justice also reserved and reported the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to a full panel of this court for final adjudication, provided the parties filed with the county clerk a statement of stipulated facts, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On September 9, the single justice allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to file an amended complaint that narrowed the scope of the putative class to include only those who were classified as a level two sex offender on or before July 12, 2013 (the effective date of the amendments) and, as a consequence, narrowed, the scope of the relief sought. With the filing of the amended complaint, the plaintiffs seek an injunction that effectively would make the preliminary injunctive relief permanent, and a judgment declaring that Internet publication of the registry information of level two sex offenders classified on or before July 12 would violate the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>Background. </em>As amended in 1999, St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, the SORT established a sex offender registration system in the Commonwealth of those convicted of a sex offense, as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Unless otherwise ordered by a court pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(e) </em>or (f), sex offenders are required to register with SORB within five days of receiving a sentence on a conviction or juvenile adjudication. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(a). </em>\u201cUpon review of any information useful in assessing the risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public by the sex offender, including . . . any materials submitted by the sex offender, [SORB prepares] a recommended classification of each offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1). If an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>offender contests SORB\u2019s recommended classification, after a hearing conducted pursuant to guidelines established by SORB, a panel of three SORB members or a hearing examiner designated by SORB must issue a decision that finally classifies a sex offender into one of three \u201clevels of notification depending on the degree of risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public by the sex offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2). See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (2). \u201cWhere [SORB] determines that the risk of reoffense is low and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public is not such that a public safety interest is served by public availability, it shall give a level [one] designation to the sex offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a). </em>\u201cWhere [SORB] determines that the risk of reoffense is moderate and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public is such that a public safety interest is served by public availability of registration information, it shall give a level [two] designation to the sex offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(b). </em>\u201cWhere [SORB] determines that the risk of reoffense is high and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public is such that a substantial public safety interest is served by active dissemination, it shall give a level [three] designation to the sex offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (c). Neither \u201cpublic availability\u201d nor \u201cactive dissemination\u201d is a defined term in the SORL, but their meaning can be discerned from the extent of public access to information associated with each term.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Under the SORL, as amended in 1999, the \u201cpublic availability of registration information\u201d applicable to level two offenders under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(b), </em>was limited to two types of information requests, each of which could only be made by a person \u201cwho [was eighteen] years of age or older and who state[d] that he [was] requesting sex offender registry information for his own protection or for the protection of a child under the age of [eighteen] or another person for whom the requesting person has responsibility, care or custody.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781, 178J.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(b), </em>as amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe public shall have access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the information regarding a level [two] offender in accordance with the provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7] 1781 and 178J\u201d). Under the first type of information request, provided for in \u00a7 1781, an adult may identify an individual, by name or otherwise, and ask SORB to indicate whether the individual is a sex offender. Under the second type, that provided for in \u00a7 178J, an adult who appears in person at a police station may make a similar request regarding an identified individual or may ask whether any sex offender resides, works, or attends \u201can institution of higher learning\u201d within that city or town and, if so, obtain, among other information, the name, home address, and work address of the sex offender and, if available, a photograph of the sex offender.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even after enactment of the contested amendments, such information is only available, on public inquiry, for offenders given a level two or a level three classification. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781, 178J.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In contrast, under the SORE, as amended in 1999, the \u201cactive dissemination\u201d of sex offender information referenced in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (c), involved a \u201ccommunity notification plan\u201d in which police departments in the communities where a level three sex offender resided or worked were required to \u201cnotify organizations in the community which [were] likely to encounter such sex offender and individual members of the public who [were] likely to encounter such sex offender.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (c). In addition, \u201c[neighboring police districts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>[were required to] share sex offender registration information of level [three] offenders and [could] inform the residents of their municipality of a sex offender they [were] likely to encounter who reside[d] in an adjacent city or town.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The SORL, as amended in 1999, did not provide for Internet publication of any information regarding any sex offender. Internet publication of registry information was first required through an amendment to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D, in 2003, St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7 5, but was limited to registry information regarding level three offenders. The 2003 amendment specifically prohibited Internet publication of registry information of level two offenders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, until July 12, 2013, the \u201cpublic availability of registration information\u201d regarding level two offenders did not include Internet publication of registry information. The contested amendments at issue in this case effectively revise the definition of \u201cpublic availability of registration information\u201d to include Internet publication, because they make the registry information of level two offenders publicly available on the Internet where it previously had been explicitly unavailable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Of the 11,171 sex offenders registered with SORB as of July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>12, 2013, registry information is currently available on the Internet for only the 2,422 level three offenders, a group that comprises approximately 21.7 per cent of registered sex offenders. Were the recent amendments to become effective, the number of offenders whose registry information is publicly available would rise to 8,496, approximately 76.1 per cent of the sex offenders registered with SORB.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Implicit in the earlier prohibition against Internet publication of the registry information of level two offenders and the existing prohibition against the publication of the registry information of level one offenders is the recognition by the Legislature that public identification of a sex offender poses a risk of serious adverse consequences to that offender, including the risk that the sex offender will suffer discrimination in employment and housing, and will otherwise suffer from the stigma of being identified as a sex offender, which sometimes means the additional risk of being harassed or assaulted. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 2), </em>425 Mass. 217, 221-222 (1997) <em>(Doe [No. 2]) </em>(without safeguards as to who can access sex offender information, \u201c[t]he possibility exists . . . that a person with no remedial motive will obtain sex offender registry information and reveal it to the plaintiff\u2019s detriment. The potential harm to the plaintiff in his employment or in his community, or both, from the use of such information for other than personal protection is substantial\u201d). Cf. <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 801, 813 (2010), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 144 (1997) (\u201cClassification and registration entail possible harm to a sex offender\u2019s earning capacity, damage to his reputation, and, \u2018most important, ... the statutory branding of him as a public danger\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The best evidence that the Legislature recognized this risk is its enactment of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178N, which provides that \u201c[information contained in the sex offender registry shall not be used to commit a crime against a sex offender or to engage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>in illegal discrimination or harassment of an offender.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178D, 1781, 178J (requiring that those seeking registry information be warned regarding criminal penalties for use of such information to commit crime or engage in \u201cillegal discrimination or harassment of an offender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Publication of registry information on SORB\u2019s Web site substantially increases the risk of public identification for at least three reasons. First, to obtain registry information under either G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781 or 178J, a person must identify himself or herself and make a specific request for information about a particular person or about level two or three sex offenders in a particular city or town. In contrast, to obtain registry information from SORB\u2019s Web site, persons may remain anonymous, seek information regarding every level two and level three sex offender in the Commonwealth, and conduct this search from the comfort of their home, at any time of day or night. Second, once a sex offender\u2019s registry information is published on SORB\u2019s Web site, it is likely to be republished on other Web sites that are not controlled by SORB that publicly identify sex offenders, and that do not include the same warnings or certifications provided on SORB\u2019s Web site as required by statute or SORB regulation. Third, because a sex offender\u2019s name is published on SORB\u2019s Web site and on such unrelated private Web sites, a person searching for that individual on the Internet through one of the usual search engines, such as Google, may learn that the individual is a sex offender, even if that was not the reason for the Web search, because the search results may include \u201chits\u201d to private Web sites listing sex offenders. See D.J. Solove, The Future of Reputation: Gossip, Rumor, and Privacy on the Internet 78 (2007) (\u201cWhen one puts information on the Internet, it can easily become like Frankenstein\u2019s monster, escaping the dominion of its master\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The evidentiary record also demonstrates that the injury to members of the class that could arise from Internet publication would likely be irreparable, even if SORB were later to reduce their classification to level one or release them from the obligation to register. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178G (authorizing SORB to terminate obligation to register for certain sex offenders under certain circumstances); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.37C (2013) (offender may seek reclassification three years after final classification). Once the plaintiffs\u2019 registry information is published on SORB\u2019s Web site, there is a substantial likelihood that they would soon be identified on private Web sites listing sex offenders, and that the subsequent removal of their names from SORB\u2019s Web site would not result in the removal of their names from these private Web sites. See <em>Doe (No. 2), supra </em>at 222 (once sex offender information is obtained and distributed with no remedial motive, \u201cat best it will not easily be remediable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Where a party argues, as the plaintiffs do here, that a statute is impermissibly retroactive, we must resolve three distinct but related questions. Preliminarily, we must determine whether the law, as amended, has a retroactive effect. If not, and assuming the law is otherwise constitutional, no further inquiry is necessary. If the statute is retroactive, we look to see whether the Legislature clearly intended it to be retroactive. Where it so intended, we determine whether retroactive application is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">1. <em>Do the amendments operate retroactively? </em>We first examine whether G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D, as amended on July 12, 2013, is retroactive in operation insofar as it requires SORB to publish the registry information of level two offenders on its Web site, whereas before July 12, 2013, under \u00a7 178D, it was expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>barred from publishing such information on its Web site. \u201cA statute does not operate \u2018retrospectively\u2019 merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute\u2019s enactment ... or upsets expectations based in prior law.\u201d <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>460 Mass. 511, 522 (2011), quoting <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 269 (1994). Rather, the United States Supreme Court has declared that a statute is retroactive in effect where \u201cthe new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Landgraf supra </em>at 270. Determining whether \u201ca particular rule operates \u2018retroactively\u2019 comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court recognized that its test \u201cis unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity,\u201d but noted that \u201cfamiliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 321 (2001), quoting <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hadix, </em>527 U.S. 343, 357 (1999) (\u201cThe inquiry into whether a statute operates retroactively demands a commonsense, functional judgment . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We have adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cnew legal consequences\u201d test in deciding whether Massachusetts statutes operate retroactively. See <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 787 (registration law \u201cmust be considered retroactive\u201d because it \u201cattaches new legal consequences to events that occurred before its enactment\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 498 (2000) (applying \u201c \u2018new consequence\u2019 formulation of retroactivity\u201d). See also <em>Nunez, </em>460 Mass. at 522 (citing <em>Landgraf </em>\u201cnew legal consequences\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the appropriate test of retro-activity is the test we applied in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>366 Mass. 779, 781 (1975), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cIn order to determine whether a statute is retroactive, it is necessary to look at the rights and obligations of the parties as they existed immediately before and after the effec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>live date thereof. It is only where vested substantive rights of the parties have been adversely affected that we can say a statute operates retroactively, and it is only then that we need analyze the nature of the governmental interest involved in order to determine whether the statute, as applied, violates due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The <em>McCarthy </em>\u201cvested substantive rights\u201d test was formulated nineteen years before <em>Landgraf </em>s new legal consequences test, and we have gradually abandoned the <em>McCarthy </em>test in favor of the <em>Landgraf </em>test. The last time we cited <em>McCarthy </em>with respect to its retroactivity analysis was fourteen years ago, and that was in <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. at 498, where we applied the new legal consequences test.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The impairment of a vested substantive right certainly qualifies as a new legal consequence that would render a statute retroactive, but it is not the only new legal consequence that would do so. In <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 787, we concluded that G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (d), operated retroactively to the extent that it provided that persons who were convicted of a \u201c[s]exually violent offense,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, before the enactment of \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>could not be relieved by SORB of the obligation to register, regardless of their risk of reoffense or degree of dangerousness. A sex offender convicted of a \u201c[s]exually violent offense\u201d had no vested substantive right to SORB\u2019s exercise of discretion regarding the obligation to register as a sex offender, but we nonetheless concluded that the conclusive statutory presumption of risk to reoffend implicit in \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d) </em>was a new legal consequence of the earlier conviction that rendered the statute <em>retroactive in effect. Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Anderson v. BNY Mellon, N.A., </em>463 Mass. 299, 306 (2012), we concluded that the 2009 amendment to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, was retroactive in effect even though we determined that \u201cthe plaintiff ha[d] no vested right in the operation of this statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Apart from the narrowness of its scope, the problem with the vested substantive rights test is that it conflates the question whether a retroactive statute is unreasonable in its application, and therefore unconstitutional, with the more appropriate question whether the statute is retroactive in operation and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>subject to constitutional analysis. \u201c[I]t has long been recognized that the term \u2018vested right\u2019 is conclusory \u2014 a right is vested when it has been so far perfected that it cannot be taken away by statute.\u201d Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 692, 696 (1960). Consequently, as the Supreme Court of Texas stated, \u201cThe \u2018impairs vested rights\u2019 test . . . comes down to this: a law is unconstitutionally retroactive if it takes away what should not be taken away.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., </em>335 S.W.3d 126, 143 (Tex. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Under the new legal consequences test, the contested amendments are retroactive in operation, because they mandate a substantial new legal consequence (Internet publication of offender\u2019s registry information) to events completed on or before the date of their enactment (SORB\u2019s final determination that offender should be given level two classification) that previously had been expressly prohibited under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D. In practice, the newly enacted amendments in this case transformed level two offenders into something akin to level \u201ctwo and one-half\u201d offenders, because what before was limited to level three offenders (Internet publication of their registry information) is now required for level two offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">2. <em>Did the Legislature intend retroactive operation of the amendments? </em>Having determined that the amendments are retroactive in operation, the next question we must address is whether the Legislature intended them to be retroactive. \u201cAs a general matter, \u2018all statutes are prospective in their operation, unless an intention that they shall be retrospective appears by necessary implication from their words, context or objects when considered in the light of the subject matter, the pre-existing state of the law and the effect upon existent rights, remedies and obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nunez, </em>460 Mass. at 516, quoting <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 441, 448-449 (2007). \u201cSuch implication must be \u2018unequivocally clear. \u2019 \u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>462 Mass. 370, 377 (2012), quoting <em>Sentry Fed. Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Cooperative Cent. Bank, </em>406 Mass. 412, 414 (1990). In the context of this case, the question is whether the Legislature intended Internet publication of registry information to apply retroactively to <em>all </em>level two offenders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>including those so classified by SORB on or before the effective date of the amendments, or whether it intended Internet publication to apply only prospectively to those given a final level two classification after the amendments became effective. We conclude that it \u201cappears by necessary implication\u201d that the Legislature intended the amendments to apply retroactively to all level two offenders, regardless of their date of classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178D, as amended, defines the sex offender registry as \u201ca central computerized registry of all sex offenders required to register.\u201d By amending \u00a7 178D to provide that \u201c[SORB] shall make the sex offender information contained in the sex offender registry\u201d of level two offenders \u201cavailable for inspection by the general public\u201d on SORB\u2019s Web site, the Legislature must have recognized that it was authorizing Internet publication of sex offender information regarding those who were classified as level two offenders on or prior to the date of the enactment of these amendments. Moreover, when the Legislature in 2003 amended the SORL to authorize Internet publication of registry information of level three offenders, it was applied retroactively to those who had been previously classified as level three offenders. There is no reason to believe that the Legislature intended that the recent amendments would be applied any differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">3. <em>Does the retroactive operation of the amendments comport with due process? </em>Having determined that the amendments operate retroactively and that the Legislature intended them to be retroactive, we must address the question whether their retroactive operation is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 786, quoting <em>Landgraf </em>511 U.S. at 266, we declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c[Retroactive statutes raise particular constitutional concerns. \u2018The Legislature\u2019s unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals.\u2019 . . . This risk is acute in the context of people who have committed crimes that have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>sexual component, and who are frequently the target of public ire and scorn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The constitutional entitlement to due process \u201cprotects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation.\u201d <em>Landgraf, supra. </em>\u201cWhile nonpunitive retroactive regulation is not unconstitutional per se, it nonetheless raises due process concerns.\u201d <em>Doe No. 8725, supra </em>at 788. Therefore, under our jurisprudence, \u201c[r]etroactive laws must meet the test of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 to comport with State constitutional due process requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 190 (1978). \u201cUltimately, the \u2018principal inquiry \u2014 as to reasonableness \u2014 is essentially a review of whether it is equitable to apply the retroactive statute against the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe No. 8725, supra, </em>quoting <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 191. See <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>416 Mass. 698, 704 (1993) (\u201cfairness is the touchstone of due process\u201d and retroactive application of statute \u201cwould offend fundamental fairness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Because we presume that a statute is constitutional, the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of its retroactive application rests with the plaintiffs. See <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 788. In light of the special risks posed by retroactive application, the plaintiffs\u2019 burden, as noted, is to prove that retroactive application of the statute would be unreasonable and therefore inequitable, not that the statute has no rational basis. See <em>id. </em>Retroactive legislation has \u201cto meet a burden not faced by legislation that has only future effects. \u2018It does not follow . . . that what Congress [or the Legislature] can legislate prospectively it can legislate retrospectively. The retroactive aspects of legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must meet the test of due process, and the justifications for the latter may not suffice for the former.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. </em>v. <em>R.A. Gray &amp; Co., </em>467 U.S. <em>717, </em>730 (1984), quoting <em>Usery </em>v. <em>Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1976). \u201cIn determining whether the application is equitable \u2014 and thus whether the regulation is reasonable \u2014 we examine the statute from three perspectives: \u2018the nature of the public interest which motivated the Legislature to enact the retroactive statute; the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>rights . . . affected retroactively; and the extent or scope of the statutory effect or impact,\u2019 \u201d and then we balance these various perspectives. <em>Doe No. 8725, supra, </em>quoting <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>374 Mass. at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Examining the amendments from two of these three perspectives is rather simple. As to the public interest that motivated the Legislature to enact the retroactive statute, it is apparent that the purpose of the amendments was to make it easier for members of the public to access registry information related to level two sex offenders, and presumably thereby to permit the public better to defend themselves and those in their care from the risk of sexual assault by these offenders.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As to the scope of the contested amendments\u2019 impact, they would subject over 6,000 currently classified level two sex offenders to the likelihood of permanent disclosure of their personal information and criminal history on multiple Web sites, which, as discussed above, is likely to result in their identification as sex offenders within their communities, with all the harmful adverse consequences that inevitably will flow from such identifications. Cf. <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 792-793, quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 149 (1997) (Fried, J., concurring), and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 117 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (concluding that this factor weighs against finding retroactive application reasonable where sex offender registration requirement \u201cis properly viewed as a \u2018continuing, intrusive, and humiliating regulation of the person himself,\u2019 \u201d and where such offender \u201cwill remain subject to long-term monitoring and inescapable humiliation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The third perspective \u2014 the nature of the rights affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>retroactively \u2014 requires far closer analysis. In <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>442 Mass. 250 (2004), we in essence concluded that it was not inequitable to apply the 2003 amendment that authorized Internet publication of the registry information of level three offenders retroactively to those already classified as level three offenders. We noted that the fact \u201c[t]hat there may be additional adverse consequences to the plaintiffs resulting from Internet dissemination of their sex offender registration information does not increase the State due process protection due to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257 (footnote omitted). The plaintiffs in that case argued that publication of their registry information on SORB\u2019s Web site violated art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because \u201c \u2018[w]orld-wide [internet dissemination is not \u201ccarefully calibrated\u201d to serv[e] a public safety interest\u2019 and is overly broad because publication is not targeted to reach persons supposedly threatened by them,\u201d but we rejected their argument. <em>Id. </em>at 258. In doing so, we concluded that \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s choice of Internet dissemination of only level three sex offender registration information bears a real and substantial relation to protecting the public health and safety by notifying the public about dangerous offenders who live and work in the Commonwealth, and who are not necessarily residing or working in a potential victim\u2019s neighborhood or community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-259. Not surprisingly, SORB contends that the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Coe </em>applies with equal force in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">There is, however, a fundamental difference between the circumstances in this case and those in <em>Coe. </em>The plaintiffs in <em>Coe </em>had been classified as level three sex offenders, the most dangerous category of offender, who, even before enactment of the amendment requiring Internet publication, were subject to \u201cactive dissemination\u201d of their registry information through a community notification plan. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (c), as amended through St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. There could be no reasonable claim that SORB may have given any of these level three offenders a lower classification level had it recognized that the consequence of a level three classification was Internet publication of the offender\u2019s registry information, because a level three classification already carried with it the more invasive con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sequence of \u201cactive dissemination\u201d of the offender\u2019s registry information by the local police department where the offender lived, worked, or attended school. In contrast, the plaintiff class in this case is comprised of level two sex offenders, who were so classified because SORB \u201cdetermined that the risk of reof-fense [was] moderate and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public [was] such that a public safety interest [was] served by public availability of [their] registration information.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (b). As earlier noted, until July 12, 2013, \u201cpublic availability of registration information\u201d was limited to the public access accorded by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781 and 178J, which require an individual personally to request specific information from SORB or a local police department; it did not include Internet publication, which was expressly prohibited for the registry information of level two sex offenders. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D, as amended through St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7 5. Therefore, when SORB gave a sex offender a level two classification after the 2003 amendment, SORB implicitly determined that the offender was not so dangerous that the interest of public safety required Internet publication of the offender\u2019s registry information, because SORB would have given the offender a level three classification if it believed that Internet publication of the offender\u2019s registry information was warranted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the practical consequence of the recent amendments is that offenders whose degree of dangerousness, according to SORB, was not so substantial that Internet publication of their information was needed to protect the public safety would now be subject to Internet publication of their registry information. And further, those offenders who did not challenge their level two classification, either administratively under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (2), or through judicial review under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, because they specifically relied on their accurate understanding that a level two clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>sification did not carry the consequence of internet publication of their registry information, would now be subject to exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">This inequity arises because the legal standard for the designation of a sex offender classification level under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K, interweaves the risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness with the level of notification appropriate to protect the interests of public safety. Section 178K (1) delegates to SORB the task of promulgating guidelines that provide for \u201cthree <em>levels of notification </em>depending on [the] risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public\u201d (emphasis added). Pursuant to this authority, SORB promulgated regulations that provide that SORB, in making its initial classification recommendation and in issuing a final classification decision, is required to determine \u201cwhether and <em>to what degree </em>public access to the offender\u2019s personal and criminal history information, pursuant to [G. L.] c. 6, \u00a7 178K, is in the interest of public safety\u201d (emphasis added). 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.22(3)(c), 1.39(3)(c) (2004). Therefore, in determining the appropriate classification level, SORB is determining what degree of public access to registry information is appropriate in light of the offender\u2019s risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness. Increasing the scope of public access to include Internet publication of the registry information of level two offenders may affect that determination, even if it does not affect SORB\u2019s evaluation of an offender\u2019s degree of dangerousness, because SORB may decide that public access with Internet publication is not warranted by the public safety risk posed by the specific offender\u2019s degree of dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Viewing the contested amendments from the three required perspectives, and having balanced those perspectives, we conclude that the plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that retroactive application of the amendments to persons finally classified as level two offenders on or before July 12, 2013, would be unreasonable and inequitable, and therefore unconstitutional as a violation of due process. What shifts the balance in favor of the plaintiff class is that retroactive application would require Internet publication of the registry information of persons who SORB implicitly concluded were not so dangerous that their information needed to be published on the Internet to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>protect the public safety, and who SORB may have classified as level one offenders if SORB had known that Internet publication would be a consequence of a level two classification. The inequity of retroactively applying the contested amendments to these level two offenders is aggravated by the risk, already attested to in the evidentiary record, that at least some of these offenders \u201cacted in reasonable reliance upon the previous state of the law\u201d in choosing not to challenge their level two classifications specifically because such classifications did not subject them to Internet publication of their registry information. See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 578 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We declare unconstitutional the retroactive application of the amendments to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178D and 178K, that became effective on July 12, 2013, to the extent they would require the Internet publication of the registry information of individuals who were finally classified as level two sex offenders on or before July 12, 2013. The matter is remanded to the county court for entry of an order allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification and permanently enjoining SORB from publishing on the Internet the registry information of any individual who was finally classified as a level two sex offender on or before July 12, 2013, unless the individual is subsequently reclassified a level two or level three sex offender. Nothing in this order affects the ability of SORB to publish on the Internet the registry information of any individual who was given a final classification as a level two sex offender after July 12, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Association for Treatment of Sexual Abusers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The single justice allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification only for purposes of the preliminary injunction motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Although the contested amendments became effective immediately on enactment, SORB agreed to defer implementation until the motion for a preliminary injunction was decided by the single justice, so no publication on the Internet of the registry information of level two offenders classified on or before July 12, 2013, has yet occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In 1997, we considered whether a trial judge was correct in issuing a preliminary injunction preventing the previous version of G.
