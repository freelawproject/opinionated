L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. The petitioners, electric companies as defined by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1, within the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Utilities (department), appeal a final order of the department imposing on the petitioners monetary assessments for the Storm Trust Fund (assessment), pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 12P, 18. In accordance with the language of the fourth sentence of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., the order specifically prohibited the petitioners from seeking recovery of the assessment in any rate proceeding. The petitioners claim that this prohibition on recovery, as required by the statute and imposed by the department\u2019s order, is an unconstitutional taking in violation of art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. They seek a declaration that the recovery prohibition is unconstitutional, severance of the prohibition from the remainder of the statutory scheme, and reversal of the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">The petitioners essentially assert three grounds on which the recovery prohibition constitutes a taking. First, they claim that the recovery prohibition, as it operates on the assessment, effects a per se taking without just compensation. We conclude that it does not, because a mere obligation to pay such an assessment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>regardless of whether recovery is permitted or precluded, does not rise to the level of a compensable per se taking. Second, they assert that it constitutes a taking by way of a confiscatory rate because the recovery prohibition denies the petitioners and their shareholders the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment. This claim is inadequate because it does not present a specific rate set by the department that is allegedly confiscatory. Third, the petitioners contend that the department\u2019s order imposing the assessment and articulating the recovery prohibition constitutes a regulatory taking under <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978) <em>(Penn Central). </em>We conclude that it does not, because the order simply requires the petitioners to pay an assessment that serves a legitimate public purpose and does not in and of itself interfere with the petitioners\u2019 over-all property rights. Accordingly, we remand the case to the single justice to affirm the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Storm assessment. </em>In 2012, the Legislature created a Storm Trust Fund within the department to enable the department to \u201cinvestigate] the preparation for and responses to storm and other emergency events by the electric companies.\u201d St. 2012, c. 216, \u00a7 1 (inserting G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 12P). Statute 2012, c. 216, also authorized the department to impose \u201ca separate assessment proportionally against each electric company\u201d based on the intrastate operating revenues derived from each company\u2019s sales of electric service. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 2012, c. 216, \u00a7 2. The statute sets a minimum annual amount for the industry-wide assessment and permits annual increases, up to a defined cap.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In addition, the statute expressly prohibits electric companies from passing the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>this assessment on to consumers: \u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, no electric company may seek recovery of any assessments made under this paragraph in any rate proceeding before the department.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at third par. This is the only assessment within \u00a7 18 to prohibit such recovery; the other two enumerated assessments, which serve different purposes, explicitly permit the electric companies to include the assessment as an operating expense, which is then factored into their rate. See <em>id. </em>at first and second pars. (\u201cAssessments made under this section may be credited to the normal operating cost of each company\u201d); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>436 Mass. 233, 234-235 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u201cThis assessment shall be made at a rate that shall be determined and certified annually by the commission [that supervises the Department of Public Utilities (department)] as sufficient to produce an annual amount of not less than $165,000, plus the costs of fringe benefits and indirect <em>costs </em>as established by the secretary of administration and finance .... The amount of the assessment may be increased by the commission annually by a rate not to exceed the most recent annual consumer price index as calculated for the northeast region for all urban consumers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The petitioners challenge a September, 2012, order of the department imposing the storm assessment for fiscal year 2013. See Storm Trust Fund Assessment, D.P.U. 12-ASMT-5, at 1 (2012). The total assessment for all electric companies was $191,153, distributed pro rata based on the 2011 operating revenues of each company, and to be credited to the Storm Trust Fund. <em>Id. </em>The order explicitly stated, \u201cPursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, no electric company may seek recovery of any amount assessed herein in any rate proceeding before the Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">2. <em>Department oversight of utility rates. </em>Whether recovery of a cost is permitted or prohibited is relevant to the takings analysis because the amount a public utility, such as an electric company, may charge its rate payers, and therefore the return it can make on its investment, is ultimately determined by the department. The department has the authority \u201cto prescribe the \u2018rates, prices and charges\u2019 which utilities may charge.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>390 Mass. 772, 774 (1984), quoting G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>300 Mass. 591, 595 (1938). Public utilities must file rate schedules with the department on a regular basis and when seeking to change a rate; the department may then \u201cinvestigate the propriety of any proposed rate, price or charge\u201d and \u201cdirect[] a change in any schedule filed.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">A rate is ultimately based on two calculations: the rate base, reflecting the utility\u2019s reasonable operating expenses, and the rate of return beyond the recoupment of expenses. See <em>Bay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>State Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>459 Mass. 807, 808 &amp; n.2 (2011); <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>436 Mass. at 234. \u201cTogether these computations yield a return on investment.\u201d <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>371 Mass. 881, 884 n.5 (1977). Public utilities submit calculations for each of these elements, which are subject to modification and approval by the department by way of any number of calculation methods. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92, 93, 98 (1975). The rate base is meant to include all costs \u201cincurred by efficient management.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 539 (1982). See <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>459 Mass. at 814-815. As such, the department typically \u201cexclude[s] from the rate base items that are not currently used and useful to the ratepayers,\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>375 Mass. 1, 21, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 921 (1978), as well as costs that are \u201cexcessive, unwarranted, or incurred in bad faith.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>387 Mass. at 539. It is also within the department\u2019s purview to determine an appropriate rate of return, which covers operating expenses and adequately compensates investors based on the risk of investment. <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., supra </em>at 884. Cf. <em>Flingham </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>433 Mass. 198, 205-206 (2001) (based on shareholder risk, department determined that fourteen per cent return was more appropriate than fifteen per cent return requested by utility).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The petitioners challenge the constitutionality of the recovery prohibition in G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., both facially and as applied to them through the department\u2019s order, which imposes the assessment and reiterates the recovery prohibition. Where a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, raises constitutional questions, we employ our own independent judgment as to both law and facts. See <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>324 Mass. 80, 86, cert. denied, 338 U.S. 825 (1949). Because we presume that statutes are constitutional, the petitioners bear the substantial burden of proving a constitutional violation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sperry Corp., </em>493 U.S. 52, 60 (1989); <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 652 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">At the core of the parties\u2019 dispute is a question of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>propriate legal framework for takings claims made by regulated public utilities in relation to their rates, and not a challenge to a specific rate proceeding. On the whole, the petitioners claim that the recovery prohibition in G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., is an unconstitutional taking, because it is a direct, per se government taking of their shareholders\u2019 property without just compensation, and because it denies them the opportunity to achieve a reasonable rate of return on their investment. In addition, they contend that the department\u2019s order imposing the assessment and articulating the recovery prohibition is a regulatory taking. See <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The department argues that the petitioners have not satisfied the requirements under general takings jurisprudence for their per se and regulatory takings claims. In addition, with regard to the petitioners\u2019 reasonable rate of return argument, the department asserts that under confiscation jurisprudence, the petitioners have not met their burden of presenting a specific affected rate and demonstrating that excluding the cost of the assessment results in a confiscatory rate. Absent the context of a specific rate proceeding, the department claims that the petitioners have not demonstrated that excluding the cost of the assessment from rate recovery would necessarily result in a confiscatory over-all rate in all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We first address a critical assertion underlying the petitioners\u2019 claims that the recovery prohibition prevents any possible recovery of the assessment cost, and provide a basic framework of our takings jurisprudence. We then address each of the petitioners\u2019 arguments in turn and conclude that on the record presented to us, there is no unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">1. <em>Scope of recovery prohibition. </em>The petitioners\u2019 claims rest largely on their assertion that the recovery prohibition eliminates all possible avenues for recouping the cost of the assessment. Because the veracity of this particular assertion heavily influences the remainder of our analysis, we begin by assessing its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The statutory language forbids electric companies from \u201cseek-ting] recovery of [the storm assessment] in any rate proceeding before the department.\u201d G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par. Where an agency is tasked with enforcing a statute, the agency has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>\u201csubstantial discretion\u201d to interpret that statute. <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>457 Mass. 663, 681 (2010). Because the petitioners\u2019 claims arise outside the context of a specific rate proceeding, we do not know precisely what interpretation of the statute the department would employ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A possible interpretation of the statute would be, as the petitioners suggest, that the assessment may in no way factor into the rate set by the department. But see <em>Route One Liquors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>439 Mass. 111, 118 (2003) (\u201cthe positing of theoretically possible unreasonable scenarios are insufficient to make [statute] unreasonable\u201d on facial constitutional grounds [citation omitted]). However, under a narrower interpretation, the statute could mean only that the assessment may not be included in the rate base, which is comprised of the reasonably incurred expenses set forth by the electric company. See <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>387 Mass. at 539.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the ultimate rate set is determined by the rate base and a reasonable rate of return, this interpretation could, essentially, offset the impact of the assessment through the allowance of a higher rate of return.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Sidak &amp; Spulber, Deregulatory Takings and Breach of the Regulatory Contract, 71 N.Y.U. L. Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>851, 958 (1996) (\u201cutility investors must be compensated in one way or another for prudently incurred sunk costs\u201d and listing higher rate of return as one method for such compensation). This distinction is significant because the petitioners have a right to a reasonable rate of return (as discussed below), but they do not have a right to include all identifiable costs in their rate base. See <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>387 Mass. at 539. Rather, the department may properly limit cost inclusion on certain grounds,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as long as the ultimate rate set is not confiscatory. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1218 (1996) (\u201cif the statute allows the setting of guidelines that may reasonably be applied in ways that do not violate constitutional safeguards, then we must indulge that presumption\u201d). It is therefore in the department\u2019s application and accommodation of this recovery prohibition where we must look for a potential taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">2. <em>Applicable takings jurisprudence. </em>Article 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit the taking of private property for public use without just or reasonable compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is a well-developed body of case law on per se and regulatory takings, which arises primarily in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>text of land use and economic regulation. A taking requiring compensation can result from a physical invasion or government appropriation of private property. See <em>Lingle </em>v. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 538 (2005). Government regulatory actions may be deemed per se takings if a regulation causes a permanent physical invasion, see <em>Loretto </em>v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 426-428 (1982), or if the regulation deprives a property owner of any viable economic use of the property. See <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1015-1016 (1992); <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation, </em>457 Mass. 634, 639 (2010). A regulatory action also may constitute a taking if it interferes too significantly with one\u2019s property use on balance with the legitimate public purpose the interference serves. <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124. See <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">A separate line of cases has addressed a subset of regulatory takings claims that challenge utility rate decisions as confiscatory. See <em>Duquesne Light Co. </em>v. <em>Barasch, </em>488 U.S. 299, 307 (1989); <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>367 Mass. at 98. This confiscation jurisprudence arises from the \u201cpartly public, partly private status of utility property,\u201d which \u201ccreates its own set of questions under the Takings Clause\u201d and merits a unique legal analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Duquesne Light Co., supra. </em>See also <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Elec. Light Comm\u2019rs, </em>197 Mass. 556, 557-558 (1908), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We have long recognized that although utilities are subject to State rate regulation, they are entitled to \u201cthe opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>realize a fair and reasonable return on [their] investment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>375 Mass. at 10. See <em>Lowell Gas Co., </em>324 Mass. at 94-96. See also <em>Duquesne Light Co., </em>488 U.S. at 307-308. A confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional rate is one that denies the public utility the opportunity to earn such a return on its investment (its rate base). <em>Boston Gas Co., 361 </em>Mass. at 97-98. See <em>Duquesne Light Co., supra. </em>A confiscatory rate can result from the improper exclusion of a cost or item from the rate base, or from a rate of return that is too low to produce a reasonable return that would maintain investor confidence. See <em>Boston Gas Co., 361 </em>Mass. at 97-98. Cf. <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., </em>371 Mass. at 884 n.5 (\u201cA utility\u2019s income can be increased either by increasing its rate base or by increasing its permissible rate of return\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Takings claims brought by public utilities need not be governed by only one set of takings jurisprudence. A claim of a denial of a reasonable rate of return is a confiscation claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>that is properly governed by the confiscation analysis. Other takings claims, which allege that a regulation either facially or as applied constitutes a taking, merit the application of the broader takings jurisprudence, such as the <em>Loretto </em>per se taking standard or the <em>Penn Central </em>regulatory taking standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The nature of the claim properly dictates the selection of the jurisprudential strand.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">3. <em>Per se taking claim. </em>With this framework, we turn to the petitioners\u2019 claims. They first assert that the assessment, as paired with the recovery prohibition, constitutes a per se taking because there is no opportunity for them to recoup the cost through rates. The department avers that by challenging the recovery prohibition, the petitioners are effectively challenging the assessment itself as a taking, despite their claims to the contrary, and that the mere imposition of an obligation to pay money from a company\u2019s general funds is not a taking in and of itself. We agree with the department that the assessment, and the accompanying recovery prohibition, is not a per se taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">A per se taking occurs when a property owner suffers a permanent, physical invasion, without just compensation, of any portion of the property. See <em>Loretto, </em>458 U.S. at 421, 435; <em>Blair, </em>457 Mass. at 639; <em>Steinbergh </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>413 Mass. 736, 741 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 909 (1993) (no per se taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>where \u201cchallenged regulation did not authorize, direct, or otherwise involve a physical intrusion into the plaintiffs\u2019 property\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has distinguished on at least two occasions monetary obligations from physical appropriations of property rising to the level of per se takings. See <em>Eastern Enters. </em>v. <em>Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 498, 529-530 (1998) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (employer\u2019s obligation under statute to pay annual premium to commissioner of Social Security for certain retired miners not per se taking because not \u201cpermanent physical occupation of [petitioner\u2019s] property\u201d);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Sperry Corp., </em>493 U.S. at 62 n.8 (\u201cIt is artificial to view deductions of a percentage of a monetary award as physical appropriations of property\u201d). On the whole, Federal courts have established that an obligation to pay money is not a per se taking where the obligation does not affect or operate on a specific, identified property interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Koontz </em>v. <em>St. Johns River Water Mgt. Dist., </em>133 S. Ct. 2586, 2601 (2013) (\u201cproperty taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations that may impose financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>burdens on property owners\u201d do not constitute takings); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>626 F.3d 280, 285-286 (6th Cir. 2010), and cases cited (concurring with seven other United States Circuit Courts of Appeal that \u201cTakings Clause is not an appropriate vehicle to challenge the power of [a legislature] to impose a mere monetary obligation without regard to an identifiable property interest,\u201d and concluding that enforcement of traffic offense ordinance against vehicle lessees was not per se taking because it did \u201cnot seize or otherwise impair an identifiable fund of money\u201d [citation and quotation marks omitted]); <em>Branch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>69 F.3d 1571, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 810 (1996) (\u201c[T]he principles of takings law that apply to real property do not apply in the same manner to statutes imposing monetary liability. . . . [T]axes or special municipal assessments indisputably \u2018take\u2019 money from individuals or businesses, [but] assessments of that kind are not. . . <em>per se </em>takings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The assessment here is at bottom a requirement that the petitioners pay the department an annual assessment for a specifically identified purpose with whatever funds the companies choose. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par. The Legislature is free to authorize such assessments, and the department is free, within certain limits, to collect them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In concluding that challenged monetary assessments and fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>are not per se takings, courts typically have not taken into account whether the payees have the possibility of recovering the cost of the assessment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>271 F.3d 1327, 1338-1339 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1096 (2002) (analysis focused solely on whether assessment involved any specific property interest); <em>Branch, </em>69 F.3d at 1577 (court declined to classify assessment as per se taking, even though assessment amount exceeded net worth of bank assessed). Rather, absent a showing that the assessment itself is a taking and that the taking results in physical invasion or complete deprivation of all economically beneficial use, the question of economic impact has been reserved for a regulatory taking analysis, and has not been a determinative consideration in a per se taking analysis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth Edison Co., supra; Branch, supra. </em>See also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Legal Found. of Wash., </em>538 U.S. 216, 224, 235 (2003).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>In sum, we are guided by the decisions in the Federal circuit courts and conclude that, with or without the recovery prohibition, the assessment does not constitute a per se taking. See, e.g., McCarthy, 626 F.3d at 285-286; <em>Commonwealth Edison Co., </em>271 F.3d at 1329, 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">4. <em>Reasonable rate of return claim. </em>The petitioners next assert that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., on its face denies the petitioners a reasonable rate of return on their investments because it constitutes a complete bar to recovery of the assessment cost by prohibiting them from passing on the cost to rate payers. Although they assert that they are making a general takings claim rather than a confiscation claim, they direct us to our confiscation precedent. See, e.g., <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>387 Mass. at 539; <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., </em>371 Mass. at 884. We agree with the department that this claim is appropriately governed by confiscation jurisprudence, as we discuss above, and that it fails to situate the claim within a rate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The confiscation analysis clearly requires a challenge to a specific rate decision in order to assess whether the ultimate rate set is confiscatory. Without a record evidencing the permitted recoverable expenses, the determined rate of return, and the ultimate filed rate, we cannot say whether a rate is confiscatory unless we speculate as to what the department might do among its myriad options in the rate-setting process. See <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944) (must look to \u201ctotal effect of the rate order\u201d to determine if it is unreasonable). Because the petitioners do not bring the claim within the context of a specific rate decision, we do not engage in this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">As noted above, there is a reasonable interpretation of the recovery prohibition that would still produce adequate rates for the petitioners. The department could read the statute as requiring only that the assessment cost be excluded from the rate base, and then could provide a higher rate of return to compensate for this exclusion. See <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., </em>371 Mass. at 884 n.5. Alternatively, the department could determine that the existing rate of return is adequate to preserve investor confidence and cover legitimate expenses, despite the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ment cost. See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>124 N.J. 32, 50 (1991), citing <em>Edgewater Inv. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Borough of Edgewater, </em>103 N.J. 227, 240 (1986) (regulated company \u201cmust anticipate that its profit levels can be . . . reduced by changes in government regulation. There is no constitutional entitlement to maximum profits\u201d). See <em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 769 (1968) (\u201cRegulation may, consistently with the Constitution, limit stringently the return recovered on investment, for investors\u2019 interests provide only one of the variables in the constitutional calculus of reasonableness\u201d). The petitioners are entitled to a <em>reasonable </em>rate of return, but not to the rate they desire or have historically received. On the facts as they are presented to us, we cannot say that the department has gone too far.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We therefore turn to the petitioners\u2019 regulatory taking claim, for which a <em>Penn Central </em>analysis is appropriate. Cf. <em>Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>48 Fed. Cl. 35, 48 (2000) (employing <em>Penn Central </em>rather than <em>Duquesne Light Co. </em>reasonable rate of return standard to challenge of assessment on public utilities brought outside specific rate-setting context).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">5. <em>Regulatory taking claim. </em>The petitioners assert that the department\u2019s order constitutes a regulatory taking by specifically levying assessments totaling slightly over $190,000, and by denying just compensation, by way of the recovery prohibition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Our regulatory taking analysis consists of \u201cad hoc, factual inquiries,\u201d <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124, employing \u201cseveral interrelated\u201d and well-established factors. <em>Daddario </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Comm\u2019n, </em>425 Mass. 411, 416, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1036 (1997). To determine whether there has been a compensable regulatory taking, we look to: \u201c(1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tion has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action\u201d (quotation marks omitted). <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>423 Mass. 152, 154, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1028 (1996). As the department correctly observes, we consider each of these factors in relation to the property as a whole. See <em>Blair, </em>457 Mass. at 642-643; <em>Steinbergh, </em>413 Mass. at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">a. <em>Economic impact. </em>To constitute a compensable regulatory taking, the economic impact on the property owner must be severe. See <em>Daddario, </em>425 Mass. at 416; <em>Leonard, </em>423 Mass. at 156. \u201c[M]ere diminution in value of property ... is insufficient to demonstrate a taking.\u201d <em>Concrete Pipe &amp; Prods. of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Construction Laborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., </em>508 U.S. 602, 645 (1993). See <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Envtl. Mgt., </em>384 Mass. 530, 533 (1981), quoting <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 19 (1979) (regulation \u201cmay deprive an owner of a beneficial property use \u2014 even the most beneficial such use \u2014 without rendering the regulation an unconstitutional taking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Here, the economic impact is minimal in relation to the petitioners\u2019 total budgets. Overall, the assessment represents 0.0037% of each company\u2019s 2011 operating revenues. See <em>Blair, </em>457 Mass, at 645 (eight to eleven per cent reduction in amount of usable land could result in diminution of property value but did not interfere to extent of taking, because property owner could \u201ccontinue to derive significant economic benefit\u201d from whole of property). Although the petitioners are indeed deprived of this money, they retain significant beneficial use of their property without it. See <em>Daddario, </em>425 Mass. at 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">b. <em>Investment-backed expectations. </em>We next consider the reasonable and legitimate investment-backed expectations of the petitioners. See <em>Ruckelshaus </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. 986, 1005 (1984); <em>Gove </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>444 Mass. 754, 765 (2005). We have previously noted that the mere fact that owners could make a more profitable use of the property and had intended to do so is not sufficient interference with investment-backed expectations. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. 152, 159-160 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The investment-backed expectations of a public utility and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>investors are quite different from those of the average private landowner. When an investor chooses to invest in a public utility, he or she is presumed to be aware of the high level of regulation. See <em>Branch, </em>69 F.3d at 1575. Historically, public utilities have agreed to subject themselves to State regulation, including required accounting procedures, rate regulation, and other obligations, in exchange for access to public resources and the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on investment. See Priest, The Origins of Utility Regulation and the \u201cTheories of Regulation\u201d Debate, 36 J.L. &amp; Econ. 289, 303 (1993); Sidak &amp; Spulber, <em>supra </em>at 898, 907, 909. The utilities\u2019 expectations are therefore necessarily limited by the scope of the regulations that bind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The public utilities and their investors expect to obtain a reasonable rate of return, such that the enterprise of providing a public utility is at least to some extent profitable. See <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., </em>371 Mass. at 884 &amp; n.5. However, as with any business, they have no reasonable expectation to obtain a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for expenses incurred every year.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Because the challenged department order merely requires the petitioners to pay an assessment, and indicates a limitation on recovery but does not actually implement that limitation, the order itself does not interfere with the petitioners\u2019 investment-backed expectations. As we have noted elsewhere, on this record we cannot truly assess \u201cthe degree of interference with investment-backed expectations\u201d of the department\u2019s order without knowing whether the petitioners will be adequately compensated through the rate-setting process. See <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>403 Mass. 203, 210 (1988). We simply do not know whether they will be denied what is owed to them: an opportunity to achieve a reasonable rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">c. <em>Character of governmental action. </em>We turn finally to the character of the government action, and whether the order implementing the mandate of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., serves a legitimate public purpose. See <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 127; <em>Blair, </em>457 Mass. at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>in testimony on predecessor bills to the one that ultimately passed, 2012 Sen. Doc. No. 2143, suggests that the legislative purpose was twofold: to enable the department to investigate public utilities\u2019 storm preparedness and responsiveness, and to impose penalties on those companies for inadequate storm response planning and implementation. See An Act relative to the emergency service response of public utility companies, Hearing on 2012 Sen. Doc. No. 2140 before S. Comm. on Ways &amp; Means (Feb. 16, 2012) (statement of Sen. Benjamin B. Downing) (goals of legislation are to ensure \u201csignificant penalties for utility companies that do not respond in accordance with their emergency response plans\u201d and to provide department with \u201cmore resources to complete the thorough investigations we are asking them to do\u201d). See also letter from Attorney General Martha Coakley to Chairs of Joint Comm. on Telecomm., Utils. &amp; Energy, regarding 2011 Sen. Doc. No. 2087, An Act relative to emergency response of public utility companies (Jan. 11, 2012) (indicating that utilities\u2019 response to storms was inadequate and advocating for \u201cmore robust penalties\u201d). The Attorney General asserted that the companies, rather than the rate payers, should have to absorb the cost of these penalties, because the inadequate storm response caused harm to rate payers. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>This legislative purpose of enabling the department to monitor storm responsiveness by public utilities and penalize poor performance in such natural emergencies serves a legitimate public purpose. See <em>Blair, </em>457 Mass. at 646; <em>Gove, </em>444 Mass. at 767. See also <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>375 Mass. at 44 (operational efficiency and effectiveness of public utilities \u201care matters of legitimate public interest,\u201d and department may place requirements on utilities in furtherance of this interest). Cf. <em>Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 45. On its face, the recovery prohibition is not at odds with this purpose. Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 assertion, we cannot say that requiring the electric companies to absorb the costs associated with achieving these purposes, where the costs are associated with potentially inefficient or inadequate performance by the companies themselves, does not serve to further the legitimate governmental interest at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">d. <em>Balancing. </em>On the record before us, the petitioners have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>not established that the order effects a regulatory taking. See <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co., </em>403 Mass. at 210-211. Absent any related rate proceeding, the order simply requires the electric companies to pay a very small portion of their revenues into a fund that enables the department to investigate the companies\u2019 storm preparedness efforts. See G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par.; <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co., supra </em>at 211 &amp; n.8. It does not alone interfere so significantly with the utilities\u2019 over-all property rights as to constitute a compensable regulatory taking. See <em>Leonard, </em>423 Mass. at 156; <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co., supra </em>at 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In sum, we conclude that the Legislature may properly authorize the department to impose an assessment of this nature on the public utilities it regulates, and may prohibit the companies from including the assessment as a direct cost in a rate proceeding where the assessment is imposed for a legitimate public purpose. Therefore, G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., does not, standing alone, effect a taking. However, even when such an assessment is properly excluded from the rate base, the department must permit the utilities to achieve a fair and reasonable rate of return on their investments, in accord with our constitutional mandates. Cf. <em>Texaco P.R., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ocasio Rodriguez, </em>749 F. Supp. 348, 373 (D.P.R. 1990). What constitutes a reasonable return is a fact-specific inquiry that must be made in the context of a particular rate proceeding. See <em>Hope Natural Gas, </em>320 U.S. at 602. Because the department order at issue here merely imposes the assessment, and does not reflect any rate decision by the department, the order itself does not constitute a regulatory taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We remand the case to the single justice, who is directed to affirm the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">General Laws c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., provides in relevant part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">It appears that the department itself has not settled on an interpretation of the statutory language.

But in a subsequent order imposing the assessment for the next fiscal year, the department indicated that \u201cno electric company may list any amount assessed herein as a recoverable expense in any rate proceeding before the department.\u201d Storm Trust Fund Assessment, D.P.U. 13-ASMT-3, at 2 (2013).

A reasonable interpretation of the prohibitive language in paragraph three would be the exact opposite: that a company may <em>not </em>include this particular assessment in its expenses for the rate base. See <em>id. </em>at third par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">As noted, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>in a more recent department order, the department suggested that it may interpret the statute in this way. See Storm Trust Fund Assessment, D.P.U. 13-ASMT-3, at 2 (\u201cPursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, no electric company may list any amount assessed herein as a recover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>able expense in any rate proceeding before the [department\u201d). The use of the more narrow term \u201crecoverable expense\u201d rather than \u201crecovery\u201d could indicate that the department understands \u00a7 18 to require only that the assessment cost not be included as a cost in the rate base.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\">The department may properly exclude costs that are attributable to inefficient management or otherwise unwarranted.

In theory, the department could determine that the assessment cost is appropriately excludable not only because of the statutory mandate but also because it stems from concerns regarding the utilities\u2019 poor storm preparedness and response. See letter from Attorney General Martha Coakley to Chairs of Joint Comm. on Telecomm., Utils. &amp; Energy, regarding 2011 Sen. Doc. No. 2087, An Act relative to emergency response of public utility companies (Jan. 11, 2012). Exclusion of a cost from the rate base is permissible if the exclusion does not threaten the company\u2019s survival and the company is still able to obtain a reasonable rate of return.

Va., </em>262 U.S. 679, 683, 693 (1923). More recent cases, however, have articulated them as takings claims.

See <em>Route One Liquors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>439 Mass. 111, 113, 120 (2003). In that case, we upheld an excise tax on commercial parking lot operators because it did not deny operators \u201call economically beneficial or productive use\u201d of their property. <em>Id. </em>at 120, quoting <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1018. In support of this conclusion, we indicated that there was no evidence that \u201clot operators could not pass on the amount of the excise tax to their customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This observation does not change our analysis here. Where physical invasion or complete deprivation of economic use of the property as a whole has not been established, there is no per se taking. Here, because the petitioners retain some economic use of their property, the recovery prohibition is not dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Even if the potential for cost recovery were relevant to the determination whether a per se taking has occurred, we would not be persuaded on the record before us that the prohibition on recovery, as it operates on the assessment, necessarily would effect a taking. As discussed above, a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language would be to limit the recovery prohibition to inclusion in the rate base. The mere disallowance of a particular expense from inclusion in the rate base would not constitute a taking, as the petitioners have no automatic right to include all costs. See <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>387 Mass. at 539. Under this reading, the petitioners could still recover the assessment cost by way of the rate of return, which in relation to the rate base informs the designated rate the utility may collect. Accordingly, the recovery prohibition in G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., does not necessarily result in a taking in all circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The department could, of course, go too far in the future. Where a rate determination, in complying with the recovery prohibition of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 18, third par., defeats the incentive to invest in the public utility and renders the operation of the company financially unfeasible, the department quite likely has gone too far. See <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>375 Mass. at 16; Sidak &amp; Spulber, <em>supra </em>at 945-946 (public utility needs assurance of reasonable return to incur capital costs and serve public interest by providing reasonable, uniform rates).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
