Ass\u2019n, </em>462 Mass. 569, 569 (2012) <em>(Eaton), </em>may pursue claims seeking to invalidate foreclosure proceedings based on our decision in that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held in <em>Eaton </em>that a foreclosure by power of sale pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C, is invalid unless a foreclosing party holds the mortgage and also either holds the underlying mortgage note or acts on behalf of the note holder. <em>Id. </em>at 571. We concluded also that the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d in statutes governing foreclosures under statutory power of sale provisions would have only prospective effect, although we applied our newly announced interpretation to the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in that case. <em>Id. </em>We now extend application of the holding in <em>Eaton </em>to cases such as this one, in which the issue was preserved and an appeal was pending in the Appeals Court on June 22, 2012, the date of the rescript in <em>Eaton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Background,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, Anne-Marie and Joseph Galias-tro (Galiastros), obtained a home mortgage loan on July 26, 2006, from Fremont Investment &amp; Loan (Fremont).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To secure the obligation, the Galiastros contemporaneously granted a mortgage on the home to defendant Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), which was described in the mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>as \u201ca separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns.\u201d The Galiastros ultimately defaulted on their mortgage payments; on March 1, 2010, Harmon Law Offices, P.C. (Harmon), as legal counsel for MERS, notified them of MERS\u2019s intention to foreclose by statutory power of sale pursuant to G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">On March 29, 2010, the Galiastros filed a complaint in the Superior Court against MERS and Harmon, claiming, inter alia, that MERS did not have standing to initiate foreclosure proceedings because it was not the holder of the Galiastros\u2019 promissory note, nor was it an authorized agent of any note holder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Galiastros also filed a motion for injunctive relief seeking to enjoin MERS from proceeding with the foreclosure. In July, 2010, a Superior Court judge denied the Galiastros\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, and MERS subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 754 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">When the Galiastros sought to enjoin the foreclosure proceedings, our decision in <em>Eaton </em>had not issued. In that case, we determined that the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d as used in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C, although not free from ambiguity, \u201crefer[s] to the person or entity then holding the mortgage and also either holding the mortgage note or acting on behalf of the note holder.\u201d <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 571. We therefore concluded that unless a foreclosing party holds the mortgage and is either the note holder or an authorized agent of the note holder, a foreclosure by power of sale pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C, is invalid. See <em>Eaton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>supra </em>at 586. In this case, MERS has argued repeatedly against this interpretation of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">For purposes of the motion to dismiss, MERS accepted <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Galiastros\u2019 allegation that MERS neither held the note nor acted as an authorized agent of the note holder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The animating premise of its motion was that the \u201callegations that MERS lacks standing because it does not hold the note or the right to enforce the note is without support under Massachusetts law.\u201d In January, 2011, a Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the [defendants\u2019 memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The Galiastros appealed from the judgment of dismissal; their appeal was entered in the Appeals Court on February 24, 2011, and the parties thereafter filed briefs. On September 6, 2011, we transferred to this court on our own motion an appeal filed in the Appeals Court on August 24, 2011, seeking relief from a preliminary injunction in Eaton vs. Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, No. SUCV2011-01382, Suffolk Sup. Ct. (June 17, 2011). See <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 570-571. The Appeals Court then stayed all proceedings in the instant case pending our decision in <em>Eaton. </em>The rescript in <em>Eaton </em>issued on June 22, 2012, and on July 11, 2012, the Appeals Court vacated its stay in this case. We thereafter allowed the Galiastros\u2019 petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">While these proceedings were pending, other activity was taking place that affected the status of the parties relevant to the issues in this case. On September 7, 2011, after the Galiastros\u2019 appeal was docketed in the Appeals Court but before it was stayed, MERS, as nominee for Fremont, assigned the Galias-tros\u2019 mortgage to \u201cDeutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for Fremont Home Loan Trust 2006-3\u201d (Deutsche Bank). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>On November 18, 2011, the Galiastros received a notice that Deutsche Bank had scheduled an auction sale, and they then filed a motion in the Superior Court for a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent the commencement of foreclosure proceedings pending a decision on their appeal. On February 9, 2012, a Superior Court judge denied the motion on the ground that \u201cDeutsche Bank is not a party to th[e] case and Deutsche Bank has both the mortgage and the note.\u201d Deutsche Bank then proceeded with the nonjudicial foreclosure sale, purchased the property, and brought a summary process action in the Housing Court seeking to evict the Galiastros from their home. The Galiastros moved to stay the eviction proceedings pending resolution of this appeal, and a Housing Court judge ordered a stay of the proceedings on the condition that the Galiastros pay use and occupancy costs while the stay was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The Galiastros since have vacated the property, and they acknowledge that their request for injunctive relief is now moot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Galiastros\u2019 complaint, however, also asserts claims for damages, and thus not all of their claims are moot. We consider, first, the ramifications of our decision in <em>Eaton </em>for the Galias-tros and other parties who, at the time of the issuance of the re-script in <em>Eaton, </em>had cases pending on appeal based on preserved claims that the foreclosing party did not hold the note at the time of foreclosure. Second, we consider whether the motion judge erred in dismissing all the other claims raised by the Galiastros.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>We review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo. See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 696, 700 (2012). We accept as true the facts alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as well as any favorable inferences that reasonably can be drawn from them. <em>Id. </em>Factual allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under rule 12 (b) (6) if they \u201cplausibly suggest [and are] (not merely consistent with)\u201d an entitlement to relief. <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>623, 636 (2008), quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007). Although a complaint need not contain \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d it must offer more than mere \u201clabels and conclusions.\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, supra </em>at 555. The factual allegations must \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . [based] on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact). . . .\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Discussion. Retroactive application of </em>Eaton. Whether the Galiastros\u2019 complaint states a claim entitling them to relief based on allegations that MERS lacked standing to effect a foreclosure by the power of sale depends first on whether the rule we announced in <em>Eaton </em>applies to the Galiastros\u2019 claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As stated, we determined in <em>Eaton </em>that the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C, must be interpreted to mean \u201ca mortgagee who also holds the underlying mortgage note.\u201d <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 584. We therefore concluded that, unless a foreclosing party holds both the mortgage and the underlying mortgage note, a foreclosure by power of sale is invalid, unless the foreclosing party acts as an authorized agent of the note holder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 586. In reaching that decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>we looked to long-standing common law and noted that, in Massachusetts, real estate mortgages operate under a \u201ctitle theory,\u201d meaning that a mortgage is a transfer of legal title to the mortgagee that serves as security for the mortgagor\u2019s debt, as set forth in the underlying note. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Under Massachusetts common law, in contrast to that in a number of other jurisdictions, the transfer of an underlying note does not carry with it the mortgage. <em>Id. </em>at 576, citing <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>149 Mass. 106, 114 (1889). A mortgage thus can be separated from the note, and when it is, the mortgage holder acts as \u201cequitable trustee for the note holder.\u201d <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 576-578. Therefore \u201cat common law, a mortgagee possessing only the mortgage [and not the note] was without authority to foreclose on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 579-581, we applied the rules of statutory construction against this common-law background to reach the determination that, to be valid, a foreclosure effected through the statutory power of sale, as governed by and set forth in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C, requires the mortgagee to hold the note or to act on behalf of the note holder. At the same time, we recognized that \u201cnone of our cases ha[d] considered directly the question whether a mortgagee must also hold the note or act on behalf of the note holder in order to effect a valid foreclosure by sale.\u201d <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 587-588. We also acknowledged that \u201cthere may be significant difficulties in ascertaining the validity of a particular title if the interpretation of \u2018mortgagee\u2019 ... is not limited to prospective operation, because of the fact that our recording system has never required mortgage notes to be recorded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We therefore exercised our discretion to give our interpretation of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d prospective effect, stating that our interpretation would \u201capply only to mortgage foreclosure sales for which the mandatory notice of sale has been given after the date of th[e] opinion [June 22, 2012].\u201d <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 588-589, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 721 n.10 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005) (where decision announces new interpretation of State statute, there is no \u201crequirement that the new rule or new interpretation be applied retroactively\u201d). Although decisional law interpreting a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>generally applies retroactively, where it conveys an understanding of what the statute has meant since its enactment, we recognized in <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 588, that, in the context of property law, prospective application may be more appropriate because of the considerable reliance interests at stake, particularly where \u201cprior law is of questionable prognostic value.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Edgar\u2019s, Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 402, 407 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We nonetheless applied the newly announced interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d to the litigants in <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 589. Although we observed that \u201csomewhat similarly situated\u201d parties would not receive the benefit of that interpretation, we did not decide whether parties in a procedural posture identical to that of the litigants in <em>Eaton </em>could receive such a benefit. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Bou-chard </em>v. <em>DeGagne, </em>368 Mass. 45, 48-49 (1975). Consequently, that question has resulted in conflicting treatment by different panels of the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Galiastros contend that the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d announced in <em>Eaton </em>should apply to them because they raised the same issue in an appeal that was stayed pending our decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We agree, and we now decide that the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d announced in <em>Eaton </em>is applicable to cases that were pending on appeal in the Appeals Court when the rescript in <em>Eaton </em>issued,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in which the litigants asserted and preserved a claim that a foreclosure by power of sale is invalid where the foreclosing mortgagee does not hold the note.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Where multiple cases await appellate review on precisely the same question, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is inequitable for the case chosen as a vehicle to announce the court\u2019s holding to be singled out as the \u201cchance beneficiary\u201d of an otherwise prospective rule. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 555 n.16 (1982) (noting \u201cinequity that results\u201d when multiple defendants raise same question on direct appeal and court chooses only one to be \u201cchance beneficiary\u201d of new rule); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, </em>448 Mass. 718, 736 (2007) (affirming judge\u2019s decision that \u201cfairness require[d]\u201d application of prospective, nonconstitutional rule of criminal procedure in case that had preserved same issue and was on appeal when new rule was announced and where new rule was applied to parties in case announcing it). See also Bender, The Retroactive Effect of an Overruling Constitutional Decision: <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>110 U. Pa. L. Rev. 650, 675-676 (1962) (\u201ccapricious\u201d to apply new rule in case announcing rule while withholding application to relatively identical litigants who had raised same issue on direct review in same time frame). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 305 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1181 (2009) (declining to apply rule applied in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pring-Wilson, supra, </em>to case that was on appeal at same time because issue was not pressed at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Our decision to expand our holding in <em>Eaton </em>to apply to cases that preserved the issue presented in that case and that were pending on appeal as of June 22, 2012, is consistent with the principles on which we relied in applying the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d to the <em>Eaton </em>parties. See <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 589, citing <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 663-665 (1987) (Abrams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907, 918-919 (1978) (Kaplan, J., concurring in the result); <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>DeGagne, supra </em>at 48-49. Although in <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>DeGagne, supra, </em>and <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra, </em>we did not apply an otherwise prospective rule to the parties, we recognized in those cases that the court had authority to do so. In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 663-664 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(Abrams, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part), one of the justices joined in the majority decision announcing a new prospective rule, but dissented from the majority\u2019s decision not to apply that rule to the litigants in the case. As the dissent observed, there were two reasons supporting application of the new rule to the litigants in the case. First, the court would have avoided the result that the announcement of the rule would \u201camount[] to no more than dictum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663-664, and cases cited. Second, \u201cand more importantly,\u201d the court would preserve the \u201cincentive to bring challenges to existing precedent because the appellant [would not be] deprived of the benefit for the work and expense involved in challenging the old rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Preservation of the incentive to challenge existing precedent provides as much reason to extend changes in the law to litigants in the case announcing the change, as it does to litigants who raise the same issue in cases pending on appeal. Like the litigants in <em>Eaton, </em>the Galiastros had filed and perfected their appeal in the Appeals Court, and had argued that a mortgagee must hold the note in order to validly foreclose. Such litigants should not be \u201cdeprived of the benefit of the work and expense involved in challenging the old rule.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 663-664.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Applying the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d in <em>Eaton </em>to this case, and others that were pending appellate review on the same issue, respects the concern identified in <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 586, that holding as we did could \u201cwreak havoc with the operation and integrity of the title recording and registration systems by calling into question the validity of any title that has a foreclosure sale in the title chain.\u201d Although we now exercise our discretion to allow a limited set of litigants to seek relief on the basis of the interpretation of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d announced in <em>Eaton, </em>that interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d otherwise remains applicable \u201conly to mortgage foreclosure sales for which the mandatory notice of sale has been given after [June 22, 2012].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. Recognizing an exception only for the parties in <em>Eaton, </em>and for cases pending on appeal that raise the same issue, accommodates and preserves the reliance interests that warranted giving prospective effect to the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d to the <em>Eaton </em>plaintiffs, while limiting the \u201cunevenness [that] is an inevitable consequence of any change in doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Johnson Controls, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>381 Mass. 278, 283 n.4 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Having decided that the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d announced in <em>Eaton </em>applies to this case, we consider whether any of the claims asserted in the Galiastros\u2019 complaint remain viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\"><em>Standing to foreclose. </em>The Galiastros allege in their complaint that Fremont was the original holder of the note when the Gali-astros executed the mortgage on July 26, 2006; that \u201cshortly after\u201d this date, Fremont divested itself of any ownership rights in the note; that the note thereafter was held by an \u201cundisclosed securitized trust\u201d; that the identity of the note holder was otherwise unknown;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that MERS was not an \u201cauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>agent of any purported undisclosed principal.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Assuming these factual allegations to be true, as we must in reviewing a motion to dismiss, <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008), the allegations plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief that is premised on establishing that MERS was neither the note holder nor acting as an agent of the note holder when it commenced foreclosure proceedings. At oral argument, the Galiastros stated a tort theory of liability for damages on the basis of their claim that MERS asserted standing to foreclose and commenced foreclosure proceedings without holding the note or acting as an agent of the note holder. Thus, the complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim on these grounds, even though the Galiastros\u2019 claim for injunctive relief is now moot. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, without regard to the likelihood of success in developing this or an alternate theory of damages in light of the applicability of our holding in <em>Eaton, </em>we vacate the dismissal of the claim for damages and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><em>Violation of G. L. c. 93A. </em>In addition to alleging that MERS lacked standing validly to foreclose on the mortgage by power of sale, the complaint alleges that MERS violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, when it engaged in conduct aimed at evading the terms of an order providing injunctive relief entered by the Superior Court and affirmed by this court (Fremont order). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>452 Mass. 733, 735 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Fremont order issued in response to a consumer protection enforcement action brought by the Attorney General against Fremont, contending that Fremont had engaged in unfair and deceptive practices between 2004 and 2007 by originating and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>servicing certain subprime mortgage loans. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, supra </em>at 734-735. The injunction, as modified, requires Fremont to \u201cgive advance notice to the Attorney General of its intent to foreclose on any of its home mortgage loans,\u201d and further that \u201cany assignment, sale, or transfer of ownership rights or servicing obligations by Fremont be conditioned on the assignee\u2019s or purchaser\u2019s acceptance of the obligations imposed by the preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739-740. If a Fremont-originated loan is determined by the Attorney General to be \u201cpresumptively unfair\u201d based on four criteria specified in the order, and the loan is secured by the borrower\u2019s principal dwelling, then Fremont (or its assignee) is required to work with the Attorney General in attempting to \u201cresolve\u201d the issues regarding foreclosure, \u201cpresumably through a restructure or workout of the loan,\u201d before seeking court approval for foreclosure. See <em>id. </em>at 740. If the loan is not presumptively unfair, then a workout need not be attempted, and court approval is not required, before foreclosure proceedings may commence. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The foundation of the Galiastros\u2019 claim is that MERS violated the. Fremont order by failing to notify the Attorney General prior to initiating a foreclosure of its Fremont-originated loan. The Galiastros\u2019 complaint alleges that they entered into a loan with Fremont in 2006, that Fremont transferred the loan to an undisclosed party on an undisclosed date, and that neither Fremont nor the undisclosed assignee provided notice to the Attorney General of the foreclosure proceedings that MERS initiated in March, 2010. The Galiastros further allege that MERS, directly or through knowledge of its counsel, knew that the Galiastros\u2019 loan was Fremont-originated and that an as-signee of a Fremont loan was required to notify the Attorney General prior to commencing a foreclosure. Based on these allegations, the Galiastros claim that MERS acted deceptively by initiating foreclosure proceedings in its name as mortgagee, knowing that disclosure of the identity of the holder of the note would reveal a violation of the Fremont order. The Galiastros allege that MERS intentionally acted so as to obscure facts which would have revealed that their mortgage fell under the purview of the Fremont order, and that MERS undertook these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>acts in order to foreclose on a subprime loan without review by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Even assuming that MERS had acted deceptively to avoid notification to the Attorney General of the foreclosure, the Galiastros\u2019 claim under G. L. c. 93A would fail. Although the complaint makes the assertion that \u201c[t]he Galiastros mortgage meets the[] four characteristics [of the Fremont order],\u201d the copy of the Galiastros\u2019 mortgage and note attached to the complaint shows that the mortgage did not meet the four criteria that characterize loans as presumptively unfair in the Fremont order. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Golchin </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>460 Mass. 222, 224 (2011) (in reviewing motion to dismiss, court considers documents attached to motion to dismiss where plaintiff relied upon them in framing complaint). Cf. <em>Olpin </em>v. <em>Ideal Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>419 F.2d 1250, 1255 (10th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1074 (1970) (in reviewing motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12[b][6], court must accept plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations as true unless they are contradicted by terms of document attached to complaint). Because the Galiastros\u2019 mortgage was not an adjustable rate mortgage with an introductory period of three years or less, it did not meet the first of the four criteria set forth in the Fremont order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, supra </em>at 739. Thus, on its face the mortgage is not \u201cpresumptively unfair\u201d under the terms of the Fremont order. Accordingly, even if the Attorney General had been informed of MERS\u2019s initiation of foreclosure proceedings against the Galiastros, the Fremont order provides no basis on which the Attorney General could have objected to the foreclosure; nor would the Fremont order have entitled the Galiastros to relief such as a workout arrangement, or the requirement of court approval before foreclosure could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The Galiastros therefore failed to state a claim that could support an entitlement to relief pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, either for conduct that unfairly sought to avoid the requirements of the Fremont order, or for direct violation of that order.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Ian-nacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008). We affirm the judgment of dismissal on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Civil conspiracy and fraud claims. </em>The Galiastros appear to argue that Harmon entered into a civil conspiracy with MERS by using a fraudulent method to foreclose on the Galiastros\u2019 Fremont-originated loan without complying with the Fremont order. This method consisted of Harmon first assigning the mortgage to MERS and then having MERS foreclose on the mortgage, since MERS was structured in such a way that it was possible to seek foreclosure without disclosure of the Fremont-originated note.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In support of this claim, the complaint asserts that \u201c[t]he actions of both parties [MERS and Harmon] appear to imply they acted in concert to bring [the foreclosure] action,\u201d and with a \u201cwillful disregard of the prohibition against foreclosing on Fremont originated loans.\u201d These assertions constitute mere recitals of elements necessary to establish a civil conspiracy claim. Cf. <em>Kurker </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 188 (1998). Such assertions are supported only by the allegation that Harmon provided legal representation to MERS, and do not alone suggest a plausible claim for relief. Although a complaint need not provide \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d it must offer more than mere \u201clabels and conclusions.\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. at 636. \u201c[B]are assertion^]\u201d will not suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 632-633. The claim fails to state a claim for relief under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), and dismissal was warranted.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Galiastros make no argument concerning the dismissal of the fraud claim. Therefore, that claim is waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975) (\u201cThe appellate court need not pass upon questions or issues not argued in the brief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Appellate attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Contending that the Galiastros\u2019 claims were frivolous, Harmon seeks appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See Mass. R. A. P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(1979) (\u201cIf the appellate court shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee, and such interest on the amount of the judgment as may be allowed by law\u201d). The only two claims that the Galiastros pressed against Harmon were the civil conspiracy and fraud claims, which we have concluded were dismissed properly. Given the complexity of the law surrounding the Fremont order and the applicability of our ruling in <em>Eaton, </em>however, it was not frivolous for the Galiastros to pursue their appeal, and Harmon is not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the judgments of dismissal on count one of the complaint, alleging a lack of authority to foreclose. We affirm the judgment of dismissal on counts two, three, and four alleging respectively a violation of G. L. c. 93A, civil conspiracy, and fraud. Finally, we vacate as moot the judgment of dismissal on count five, seeking an injunction. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the National Consumer Law Center and Grace C.
