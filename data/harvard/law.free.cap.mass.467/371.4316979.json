L. c. 272, \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>(\u00a7 105 <em>[b]), </em>which prohibits secretly photographing or videotaping a person \u201cwho is nude or partially nude\u201d in certain circumstances, includes \u201cupskirting.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>alleged in two criminal complaints that the defendant, Michael Robertson, while riding as a passenger on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) trolley on two occasions, aimed his cellular telephone camera at the crotch area of a seated female passenger and attempted secretly to photograph or videotape a visual image of the area in violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(b). </em>The defendant sought relief from the denial of his motion to dismiss the two complaints. He contends that \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>does not criminalize the conduct he is charged with having committed. We agree and reverse the order of the Boston Municipal Court judge denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>We summarize the facts as alleged by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At approximately 8:30 a.m. on August 11, 2010, while the defendant was a passenger on an MBTA trolley in Boston, he turned on his cellular telephone camera and held it by his waist. A woman wearing a skirt was seated across from him, and an image of the woman\u2019s upper leg appeared on the screen of the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone. A passenger who observed the defendant\u2019s actions reported the incident to the MBTA transit police (transit police) and stated that the woman being photographed appeared to be unaware that she was being photographed. At approximately 5 p.m. that same day, a second MBTA passenger reported to the transit police that she saw the defendant attempting to photograph a woman\u2019s crotch area. With her own cellular telephone, she captured images of the defendant taking those photographs and forwarded them to the transit police.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As a result of these two reports, transit police officers initiated a decoy operation the next day at around 5 p.m. When the officers saw a man whom they identified as the defendant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> board the MBTA trolley, the officers boarded as well. The defendant stood in a stairwell of the trolley, and the female decoy officer, who was wearing a dress, sat across from him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Between the Park Street and Government Center MBTA stations, the defendant directed his cellular telephone camera lens to within two to three feet of the decoy officer, focusing on her crotch area, and steadily held the telephone in that position for approximately one minute. In addition, a red light on the defendant\u2019s telephone was illuminated, indicating that it was videotaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">After observing this event, the other transit police officers approached the defendant, advised him to stop, and attempted to seize his cellular telephone, an attempt that the defendant resisted. Ultimately, the officers succeeded in securing the telephone and noted that it had been recording until the officers turned off the recording function. The defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On December 8, 2011, two criminal complaints issued charging the defendant under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6, with attempting to commit the offense of photographing, videotaping, or electronically surveilling a nude or partially nude person in violation of \u00a7 105 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 6, 2012, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaints, which a Boston Municipal Court judge denied on August 3. Thereafter, the defendant filed a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, in the county court, seeking interlocutory review of the denial of his motion to dismiss. On December 21, 2012, the single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. </em>The Commonwealth contends that relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is unavailable to the defendant here because the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory ruling, and the defendant has failed to satisfy his burden to \u201cdemonstrate both a substantial claim of violation of his substantive rights and irremediable error, such that he cannot be placed in statu quo in the regular course of appeal.\u201d <em>Morrissette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>380 Mass. 197, 198 (1980). It is true, as the Commonwealth asserts, that our power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is to be used sparingly. See, e.g., <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 157, 158 (1977). However, \u201c[w]here the single justice has, in [her] discretion, reserved and reported the case to the full court, we grant full appellate review of the issues reported.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>451 Mass. 113, 119 (2008). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 14-15 (2010); <em>Burke, supra </em>at 159. Accordingly, we consider the merits of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">b. <em>Scope of\u00a7 105 (b). </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 105 (\u00a7 105),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> begins with a brief definitional subsection, \u00a7 105 <em>(a); </em>has two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>separate provisions defining crimes, \u00a7 105 (b)-(c); and also has two exemption provisions, see \u00a7 105 <em>(d)-(e). </em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 105 <em>(b), </em>at issue here, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cWhoever willfully photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils another person who is nude or partially nude, with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity, when the other person in such place and circumstance would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed, videotaped or electronically surveilled, and without that person\u2019s knowledge and consent, shall be punished by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than 2 V2 years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As its text indicates, \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>has five elements that the Commonwealth must prove: (1) the defendant willfully photographed, videotaped, or electronically surveilled;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) the subject was another person who was nude or partially nude; (3) the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ant did so with the intent to secretly conduct or hide his photographing activity; (4) the defendant conducted such activity when the other person was in a place and circumstance where the person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being \u201cso photographed\u201d; and (5) the defendant did so without the other person\u2019s knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">At least for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the defendant does not contest that the conduct alleged by the Commonwealth in each complaint satisfies the first, third, and fifth of these elements \u2014 i.e., that (1) he attempted willfully to photograph a person with his cellular telephone camera; (3) he did so secretly with the intent to hide such conduct; and (5) he did so without the knowledge or consent of the person being photographed. He argues, however, that insofar as the Commonwealth\u2019s specific claim here is that his attempt was to photograph up the skirt of a clothed female passenger on the MBTA trolley, the charged conduct does not come within the scope of either the second or fourth element of the \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>offense because the female passenger was not \u201cnude or partially nude,\u201d and also was not in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy not to be \u201cso photographed.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We turn to the two challenged elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">i. <em>\u201cAnother person who is nude or partially nude. \u201d </em>Section 105 <em>(b) </em>focuses on a person who \u201cwillfully photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils <em>another person who is </em>nude or <em>partially </em>nude\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In seeking to determine the meaning of this provision, we consider first the meaning of the actual language used by the Legislature. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983) (\u201cthe primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute\u201d). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 274 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Section 105 <em>(a) </em>defines \u201c[p]artially nude\u201d as \u201cthe exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of the human genitals, buttocks, pubic area or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola.\u201d \u201cExposure\u201d is not defined in the statute, but is generally defined as \u201can act of exposing,\u201d \u201ca condition or instance of being laid bare or exposed to view.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 802 (2002). \u201cExpose,\u201d in turn, means \u201cto lay open to view; lay bare; make known,\u201d with \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cexhibit\u201d noted as synonyms. <em>Id. </em>See American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 626 (4th ed. 2006) (defining \u201cexpose\u201d as \u201cto make visible\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With these two definitions in mind, the defendant argues that \u201cpartially nude\u201d refers to having one or more private parts of the body uncovered by any clothes and exposed or openly visible to another person\u2019s eyes; and that in proscribing the secret photographing of \u201ca person who is . . . partially nude,\u201d the Legislature sought to protect against \u201cPeeping Toms,\u201d that is, to punish secret photographing \u2014 by electronic means or otherwise \u2014 of such persons. The Commonwealth disagrees. It focuses on the definition of \u201cexposure\u201d or \u201cexpose\u201d as \u201cto cause to be visible or open to view,\u201d and appears to contend that the term \u201cpartially nude\u201d includes the \u201cexposure\u201d \u201ccaused\u201d by one person of an otherwise private part of another person\u2019s body through the creation of a photographic image; the fact that this other person was wearing some layer of clothing over that otherwise private body part is irrelevant. In essence, the Commonwealth reads \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>to apply to one who secretly photographs another person\u2019s partial nudity, whether the nudity is openly exposed and visible or only becomes exposed and visible by virtue of the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7 105 (6)\u2019s language and reach is flawed. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s view, \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>does not penalize the secret photographing of partial nudity, but of \u201ca person who <em>is .. . </em>partially nude\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cIs\u201d denotes a state of a person\u2019s being, not a visual image of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>person. Moreover, this person who is partially nude should be defined with reference to the other category of person included in the same sentence, namely, \u201ca person who is nude.\u201d See 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:16, at 352-353 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201cordinarily the coupling of words denotes an intention that they should be understood in the same general sense\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423, 428 (1974) (\u201cwords in a statute must be considered in light of the other words surrounding them\u201d). Just as \u201ca person who is nude\u201d is commonly understood to mean a person who is not wearing any clothes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> so, in this context, we understand \u201ca person who is . . . partially nude\u201d to denote a person who is not wearing any clothes covering one or more of the parts of the body listed in the definition of that term, specifically, \u201cthe human genitals, buttocks, pubic area or female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 105 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In sum, we interpret the phrase, \u201ca person who is . . . partially nude,\u201d in the same way that the defendant does, namely, to mean a person who is partially clothed but who has one or more of the private parts of body exposed in plain view at the time that the putative defendant secretly photographs her.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is \u201cpartially nude,\u201d no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ii. <em>\u201cIn such place and circumstance [where the person] would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed.\u201d </em>Our interpretation of \u00a7 105 <em>(b)\u2019s </em>phrase, \u201ca person who ... is partially nude,\u201d essentially disposes of this case: as just indicated, under our interpretation, the two women the defendant is alleged to have attempted to secretly photograph on the MBTA were not \u201cpartially nude.\u201d However, we discuss briefly the fourth statutory element of the crime, namely, that the person being photographed \u201cin such place and circumstance would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being so photographed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant argues that this language means that the person must be in a private place or a location where a person \u201cwould normally have privacy from uninvited observation.\u201d As such, because the MBTA is a public transit system operating in a public place and uses cameras, the two alleged victims here were not in a place and circumstance where they reasonably would or could have had an expectation of privacy. The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s proffered interpretation restricts \u00a7 105 <em>(b\u2019s) </em>application to private places, and there is no such limiting language in the statute. It reads the statutory phrase, \u201creasonable expectation of privacy in not being <em>so photographed\u201d </em>(emphasis added), as focusing less on the location where the photographing occurs than the location on the body that is the subject of that photograph. It argues that because a female MBTA passenger has a reasonable expectation of privacy in not having the area of her body underneath her skirt photographed, which she demonstrates by wearing the skirt, the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within \u00a7 105 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s reading. The word \u201cso\u201d in the phrase, \u201cso photographed,\u201d clearly is used referentially \u2014 that is, it serves to refer back to preceding language in the subsection addressing or describing the act of photographing. The preceding descriptive language in the section is the following: \u201cWhoever willfully photographs . . . another person who is nude or partially nude, with the intent to secretly conduct or hide such activity . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 105 <em>(b). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>463 Mass. 620, 624 (2012) (applying rules of grammar to interpret statute). Thus, it follows that the \u201cso photographed\u201d language in connection with the \u201cplace and circumstance\u201d language requires that the person being photographed be in a state of complete (\u201cnude\u201d) or partial (\u201cpartially nude\u201d) undress, and present in a place, private or not, where in the particular circumstances she would have a reasonable expectation of privacy in not being wilfully and secretly photographed while in that state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">iii. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons we have discussed, we conclude that \u00a7 105 (b), as written, as the defendant suggests, is concerned with proscribing \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d voyeurism of people who are completely or partially undressed and, in particular, such voyeurism enhanced by electronic devices. Section 105 <em>(b) </em>does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">At the core of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument to the contrary is the proposition that a woman, and in particular a woman riding on a public trolley, has a reasonable expectation of privacy in not having a stranger secretly take photographs up her skirt. The proposition is eminently reasonable, but \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>in its current form does not address it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">c. <em>Constitutional challenges to \u00a7 105 (b). </em>The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>argues that if \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>criminalizes the act of photographing a fully clothed woman under her skirt while she is in a public place, it is both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Where \u201ca particular construction of a statute is the premise of a constitutional claim, [the court] must resolve any issues of statutory interpretation . . . prior to reaching any constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Suave, </em>460 Mass. 582, 586-587 (2011), quoting <em>Santos, petitioner, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 284 (2010). Because we have concluded that \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>does not criminalize the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct, we need not reach the constitutional questions he raises. See, e.g., <em>Suave, supra </em>at 589; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>453 Mass. 739, 743 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion to dismiss reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-14\"> \u201cUpskirting\u201d is the practice of secretly photographing underneath a woman\u2019s dress or skirt.

While the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was pending, the Commonwealth moved to amend the complaints to charge only attempt because it could not gain sufficient access to the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone to examine the images he took and determine what they captured. On October 17, 2011, a Boston Municipal Court judge denied both the motion to dismiss and the motion to amend.

Detective Conway\u2019s affidavit is less than clear whether the defendant was attempting to videotape or photograph on August 11; as previously indicated, videotaping occurred during the decoy operation on August 12.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977) (when statute does not define words, court gives them \u201cusual and accepted meanings\u201d derived from dictionaries and other sources known to enacting legislators, so long as such meanings are consistent with statutory purpose).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1548 (2002) (defining \u201cnude\u201d as \u201cnaked\u201d; \u201cdevoid of clothing\u201d; \u201cunclothed\u201d). Accord Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1170 (9th ed. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Interpreting the term \u201cexposure\u201d in the statutory definition of \u201cpartially nude\u201d to mean in plain view is consistent with how that term has been used in the context of other crimes included in G. L. c. 272. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blackmer, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 474, 475-477, 479-480 (2010) (masturbation under defendant\u2019s clothing did not constitute exposure of body part necessary to sustain conviction for open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 536-537, 541 (1995) (where defendant pulled his shorts or bathing suit down, enabling witnesses to observe his pubic hair but not his penis or genitalia, evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of indecent exposure in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, because exposure of pubic hair alone did not fit within scope of crime).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Given that our interpretation of \u201cexposure\u201d requires that the intimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>areas be in plain view, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, a photograph revealing intimate areas of the body not otherwise in plain view would not be sufficient for exposure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We find support for this reading of the \u201cplace and circumstance\u201d provision in \u00a7 105 <em>(b) </em>in a later subsection, \u00a7 105 <em>(d). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 681 (2012) (\u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper, no doubt, to look into other parts of the statute\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Palmer, 464 Mass. 773, <em>111 </em>(2013) (statutes should be read as whole). Section 105 <em>id) </em>provides that \u00a7 105 \u201cshall not apply\u201d to merchants who electronically surveil customers in changing rooms so long as warning signage is conspicuously posted. This express exemption reinforces the conclusion that the Legislature intended \u00a7 105 <em>(b)\u2019s </em>\u201cplace and circumstance\u201d requirement to refer to a physical location and also intended that the person being photographed be in a state of some level of undress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Other States, recognizing that women have such an expectation of privacy, have enacted provisions specifically criminalizing the type of upsldrting the defendant is alleged to have attempted. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.145(2)(c) (2013) (\u201cA person commits the offense of video voyeurism if that person . . . [fjor the amusement, entertainment, sexual arousal, gratification, or profit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>oneself or another, or on behalf of oneself or another, intentionally uses an imaging device to secretly view, broadcast, or record under or through the clothing being worn by another person, without that person\u2019s knowledge and consent, for the purpose of viewing the body of, or the undergarment worn by, that person\u201d); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 250.45(4) (McKinney 2008) (\u201cA person is guilty of unlawful surveillance in the second degree when . . .
