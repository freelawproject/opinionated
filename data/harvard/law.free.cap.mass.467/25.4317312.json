The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree. While his appeal was pending in this court, he filed a motion for a new trial that we remanded to the Superior Court. That motion, as subsequently amended, was denied, as was the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. The defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>consolidated with his direct appeal. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant asserts error in the denial of his new trial motion on the grounds that: (1) his trial counsel rendered constitutionally deficient assistance by failing to obtain a full transcript of a witness\u2019s testimony from another trial (involving Bonrad Sok [Sok], see note 2, supra) for impeachment purposes, and (2) the trial judge erroneously admitted state of mind evidence. The defendant also argues, citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), that his mandatory sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional as applied to him as a juvenile under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights prohibits imposition of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree. Last, the defendant seeks relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. We vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for sentencing consistent with <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>466 Mass. 655 (2013), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>466 Mass. 676 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the jury could have found the following facts. The defendant and Bonrad Sok, on the one hand, and the victim, on the other, were members of rival gangs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth introduced evidence that the murder was committed in retaliation for a stabbing of the defendant by the victim approximately five weeks before the victim\u2019s murder. At the time of the stabbing, Sok and Vannarith Chhay (Chhay) had been with the defendant. Evidence also was presented that, two months prior to the shooting, the defendant\u2019s then girl friend overheard him telling someone that he had a gun, but that it was not in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In the late afternoon on November 1, 2007, the victim and his girl friend went to a restaurant in Lynn and sat at a booth inside. Nearby, Sok shared a table with Maverick Tran (Tran), Rebecca Pen, and her brother Moses. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sok borrowed Rebecca\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>cellular telephone, ostensibly to contact his girl friend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ten to fifteen minutes later, the defendant<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Chhay arrived at the restaurant and joined Sok\u2019s group.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The victim and his girl friend got up and left the restaurant, followed by Sok, Tran, and Chhay. Outside, Sok asked the victim whether he was a \u201ccuz,\u201d meaning \u201ccrip.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The victim asked him why, and Sok repeated the question. When the victim answered affirmatively, the three men tried to \u201cjump\u201d and hit him. They chased the victim around his automobile, which was parked directly in front of the restaurant, as the victim\u2019s girl friend told them to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The victim ran back inside the restaurant, followed by the three men. According to Rebecca, the defendant was at the front door when the men returned. There was a \u201cfight\u201d and the defendant fell on the floor. When the victim\u2019s girl friend reentered the restaurant, she saw Sok hitting the victim as he was held in a \u201cbear hug\u201d from behind by Chhay. The restaurant owner\u2019s son broke up the fight and told the group to leave. The victim and his girl friend left, followed by the defendant, Sok, Chhay, and Tran. The victim\u2019s girl friend did not recall seeing the defendant at the restaurant, inside or outside, but his presence there was established by Rebecca, the owner, and the owner\u2019s son, all of whom previously knew him.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The victim\u2019s girl friend was the only witness who testified to what next transpired. After leaving the restaurant, she and the victim walked over and stayed at the victim\u2019s automobile. Sok, Chhay, and Tran walked past them, and some distance away, to the left of the restaurant sign.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The men faced the victim and his girl friend, and Sok and the victim exchanged words. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>victim\u2019s girl friend heard a \u201cring\u201d in her ear and looked at herself to see whether she had been shot. The victim said, \u201cBabe, I got shot,\u201d then dropped to the ground. Tran\u2019s \u201cjaw dropped,\u201d and he looked \u201cshocked.\u201d Sok and Chhay were gone. The victim\u2019s girl friend ran inside the restaurant and asked someone to telephone 911. The owner\u2019s son, who had heard a \u201cpop\u201d when the group had been outside, did so. He then ran outside and saw \u201cseveral\u201d people running down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Police officers responded to the call from the restaurant at approximately 5 p.m. They recovered a .22 caliber discharged cartridge casing near the victim. The victim, who was found on the ground partly leaning against the front entrance to the restaurant, was transported to a hospital where he died. He died as a result of a gunshot wound to the torso, with perforations of the stomach, small intestine, and aliac artery. The bullet had entered the left side of his abdominal area and traveled \u201cleft to right, downward, and front to back.\u201d The bullet lodged inside the victim\u2019s body; there was no exit wound. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Just before 5 p.m., two men, working near the restaurant, saw four young men run past. Shortly thereafter, the defendant, Sok, Chhay, and Tran went to the home of a friend of the defendant, Malcolm Leng King (King), and woke him. They stayed in his room for approximately one hour. King heard the defendant say that something had happened at the restaurant and heard the defendant state, \u201cWe shot him.\u201d Tran and Chhay left together; Sok and the defendant departed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On the Tuesday following the murder, the defendant saw Kevin Sim (Sim) at Rebecca\u2019s residence, where Sim also lived. Sim had heard about an incident at the restaurant and asked the defendant about it. The defendant told Sim that he had gone to the restaurant in response to a telephone call from Sok. The defendant stated that Sok, Tran, and Chhay were the ones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>involved in the initial altercation with the victim; the defendant remained inside. The defendant went on to tell Sim that once the victim had reentered the restaurant, the victim had assaulted the defendant and a fight had ensued. The owner told them to leave, but they continued to argue outside and the victim was shot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant told Sim that he had had no intention of harming the victim when he went to the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Subsequent to the shooting, in a search of the defendant\u2019s home, police recovered one box of .22 caliber ammunition under the defendant\u2019s bed and two .22 caliber projectiles in his closet. One of the projectiles, as well as the boxed ammunition, bore the stamp \u201cREM,\u201d signifying its manufacturer, Remington. The other loose projectile bore a different marking, possibly a \u201cT\u201d or an \u201cF,\u201d indicating a different manufacturer. It appears that the .22 caliber discharged cartridge casing recovered near the victim at the restaurant was from a manufacturer different from that of the ammunition seized from the defendant\u2019s bedroom. Lieutenant Michael Vail of the Lynn police department, however, testified that a firearm capable of firing .22 caliber ammunition would be able to fire any brand of .22 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On the day following the shooting, police executed a search warrant at Sok\u2019s home. They did not find any firearms or ammunition,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but photographed three groupings of numbers on Sok\u2019s bedroom wall. Lieutenant Vail testified that, based on his training and experience, the numbers are used by local gangs to signify words. He gave his opinion that the numbers on Sok\u2019s wall stood for the words \u201cblood family,\u201d \u201cinsane gangster bloods,\u201d and \u201ccrip killer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Testing of the victim\u2019s clothing revealed a pattern of nitrate particles. A chemist from the State police crime laboratory gave her opinion that this pattern indicated that the distance from which the victim had been shot could not have exceeded four feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The defendant was arrested several days after the shooting, on November 9, at Rebecca\u2019s residence. There, police found him hiding behind a bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The defendant did not testify. His counsel argued that Sok had been the shooter and that the defendant\u2019s presence and membership in the same gang as Sok did not make him criminally responsible for the crime. The defendant produced one witness, Kathleena Am (Am), and introduced the grand jury testimony of Terry Leng (Terry). On November 1, Am was visiting Terry<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and when she arrived, Terry\u2019s family was present as well as the defendant, Sok, Tran, and Chhay. Am gave Tran and Chhay a ride to another location and then returned to Terry\u2019s home. Am, along with Terry, Terry\u2019s sister Saky, and another woman, Soy Anna Kouch (Kouch), then headed to an event in Chelsea. Am drove; the four women were inside the automobile, along with Sok and the defendant. During the ride, Am heard Sok say, \u201cI shot him. I think I shot him in the heart,\u201d \u201cit would be twenty-five to life,\u201d and \u201cI think I shot a crab [meaning a crip].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In her testimony to a grand jury, Terry relayed that she was in King\u2019s room on the night of the shooting and heard either the defendant or Sok say that he had shot somebody. Subsequently, while in Am\u2019s automobile, she heard Sok state, \u201cI shot somebody,\u201d and \u201cPut the blame on me.\u201d Terry recalled that, at the time, Sok was speaking to Kouch.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In rebuttal to Terry\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth called Kouch as a witness who testified that, during the automobile ride, Sok remarked to her, \u201cWhatever happens, put the blame on me. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">1. <em>Admission of state of mind evidence. </em>In his motion for a new trial and on appeal, the defendant argues error in the admission of Lieutenant Vail\u2019s testimony that certain numbers on Sok\u2019s bedroom wall stood for the words \u201ccrip killer.\u201d The judge admitted this testimony over the objection of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel as probative of Sok\u2019s state of mind and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>whether the defendant, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>shared that state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 470 (Appendix) (2009) (individual may be liable as aider and abettor if he \u201cknowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged\u201d alone or with others while he \u201chad or shared the intent required for that crime\u201d). Any error in the admission of this evidence would not have prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a \u2018rational tendency to prove an issue in the case,\u2019 ... or render a \u2018desired inference more probable than it would be without [the evidence].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sicari, </em>434 Mass. 732, 750 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1142 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 702 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989). \u201cWhether evidence is relevant in any particular instance, and whether the probative value of relevant evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, are questions within the sound discretion of the judge .... [T]he judge\u2019s determination of these questions will be upheld on appeal absent palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smiley, </em>431 Mass. 477, 484 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 270 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>460 Mass. 181, 193 (2011) (defendant bears burden of establishing abuse of discretion and prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">During a sidebar conference, the judge explained his ruling to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u201c[I]t seems to me that the probative value of the evidence is that the Commonwealth has a theory that Sole may have been the shooter and that the defendant shared the same mental state with Sok. In order to understand Sok\u2019s mental state, you have to understand the mental state he brought to the restaurant that night. There\u2019s no evidence that before he left to go to the restaurant he took an eraser or whited out the numbers [on his bedroom wall]. So, there\u2019s an inference that on that occasion, that\u2019s the mental state he took to [the restaurant<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]. And then you have in all the circumstances of this case to suggest that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>was sharing in that mental state that Sok brought to [the restaurant].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Here, the words \u201ccrip killer\u201d bore on Sok\u2019s state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>427 Mass. 90, 95 (1998) (\u201cA declarant\u2019s threat to \u2018get\u2019 or kill someone is admissible to show that the declarant had a particular state of mind and that he carried out his intent\u201d). The words also were significant in establishing the fact that the gang to which the victim belonged was, in fact, a rival to the gang to which Sok and the defendant belonged. In this context, the words bore as well on whether there existed a possible motive for the killing, namely, revenge for the stabbing of the defendant five weeks prior thereto. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 536-537 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">There was no evidence, however, that the defendant saw the words on Sok\u2019s wall and affirmed that he too wished to be a \u201ccrip killer.\u201d Thus, attributing the import of these words to the defendant, without more, is problematic. We need not decide whether the judge abused his discretion in admitting the evidence because its admission could not have prejudiced the defendant, whose defense was that Sok, not him, alone was the shooter and alone harbored the intent to kill. The words served to underscore that it was Sok who had the requisite state of mind to commit murder. The judge\u2019s limiting instruction, while not the most artfully constructed, did not require the jury to find that the defendant did in fact share the same state of mind as Sok and did not permit the jury to consider the evidence for its truth.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the circumstances, no prejudice to the defendant has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>At the defendant\u2019s trial, the victim\u2019s girl friend was the only witness to testify about the distance between Sok and the victim just prior to the shooting. This testimony was important because forensic evidence suggested that the fatal shot was fired from no more than four feet away. In his motion for a new trial, and on appeal, the defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>transcript of a portion of the victim\u2019s girl friend\u2019s testimony from Sok\u2019s trial. The critical testimony from Sok\u2019s trial, he claims, was the victim\u2019s girl friend\u2019s estimation that Sok was more than twelve feet, but possibly less than twenty feet, from the victim when the shot was fired. This testimony, the defendant asserts, should have been used to impeach the victim\u2019s girl friend at his trial and would have prohibited the prosecutor from being able to assert that Sok could not have been the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We review the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, which \u201cis more favorable to a defendant than is the general constitutional standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>433 Mass. 185, 187 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>420 Mass. 242, 246 (1995). We consider \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We agree with the trial judge who denied the motion that the absence of this so-called \u201cimpeachment\u201d testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial was not \u201clikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 188, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra. </em>Significantly, the jury were not required to find that the defendant was the shooter because the Commonwealth had proceeded pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>arguing alternatively that the defendant knowingly participated in the crime alone as the shooter, or with others, sharing the intent for murder. Further, any impeachment value from the victim\u2019s girl friend\u2019s testimony at Sok\u2019s trial<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was diminished by the fact that, at the defendant\u2019s trial, the victim\u2019s girl friend only was able to say that Sok, Tran, and Chhay were over by the restaurant sign. While the prosecutor suggested a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>distance of thirty feet, the judge refused to take judicial notice of that distance because the witness was asked and was not able to quantify the actual distance. In the postconviction proceedings, the prosecutor stated (and it was not contested) that, at this time, he had positioned himself at essentially the same position in the court room where Sok\u2019s counsel had positioned himself during Sok\u2019s trial (in alignment with \u201cthe security person,\u201d see note 17, <em>supra). </em>Thus, the victim\u2019s girl friend\u2019s testimony from Sok\u2019s trial concerning distance would not have established any significant discrepancy from her testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial and could not have been used either to impeach her at the defendant\u2019s trial or to foreclose the prosecutor from arguing that Sok could not have been the shooter. There was no ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the record before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>437 Mass. 487, 502 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>433 Mass. 340, 357 (2001) (\u201cabsent counsel\u2019s failure to pursue some obviously powerful form of impeachment available at trial, it is speculative to conclude that a different approach to impeachment would likely have affected the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">3. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Although we conclude that there are no issues that would cause us to exercise our authority after review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, one issue worthy of discussion is the conflicting closing arguments advanced by the prosecutor in the defendant\u2019s case and Sok\u2019s case. Prosecutors have a special role in the criminal justice system \u201cin the search for truth in criminal trials.\u201d <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281 (1999). \u201cA prosecutor is duty bound to exercise his best judgment both in deciding which suits to bring and in conducting them in court.\u201d <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 424 (1976). Expectations of prosecutors are demanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">\u201cThe United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor \u2014 indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>400 Mass. 612, 615-616 (1987) (role of prosecutor \u201cis to assist the jury to discover the truth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In view of a prosecutor\u2019s unique role in criminal proceedings, some courts have found, mainly in cases involving the death penalty, that the use of inherently factually contradictory theories against different defendants for the same crime violates the principles of due process, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 326 (4th Cir. 2003). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Poe, </em>284 Neb. 750, 765 (2012) (recognizing that State and Federal courts, in concluding that inconsistent prosecutorial theories sometimes may violate due process, do so in cases that \u201calmost exclusively involve the death penalty\u201d). For a due process violation to occur, \u201can inconsistency must exist at the core of the prosecutor\u2019s cases against defendants for the same crime.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Groose, </em>205 F.3d 1045, 1047, 1051-1052 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 985 (2000) (finding due process violation where, in obtaining two convictions for same murder, prosecutor \u201cmanipulat[ed]\u201d evidence by using different and conflicting statements from same cooperating codefendant). Such a \u201ccore\u201d change may occur where a party \u201cwholly without explanation, . . . make[s] a fundamental change in its version of the facts between trials, and then conceal[s] this change from the final trier of the facts.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>GAF Corp., </em>928 F.2d 1253, 1260 (2d Cir. 1991). Thus, the change typically involves the use of evidence at the different trials which was \u201cfactually inconsistent and irreconcilable.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>217 F.3d 989, 998 (8th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 829 (2001). The change also possibly may represent an attempt by a prosecutor to undertake criminal proceedings against a second individual whom the prosecutor otherwise would not have been able to prosecute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1043-1044 (11th Cir. 2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>cert. denied, 536 U.S. 957 (2002). Due process violations have also resulted when a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpursuit of fundamentally inconsistent theories in separate trials against separate defendants charged with the same murder [involves a situation where a prosecutor] knowingly uses false evidence or acts in bad faith.\u201d <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>232 F.3d 1236, 1240 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Significantly, in situations where a prosecutor argues at different trials that the defendant then on trial was the shooter for the same crime, courts have rejected due process challenges to the convictions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Housen, </em>458 Mass. 702, 708-709 (2011); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>489 F.3d 201, 214 (5th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1126 (2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, supra </em>at 998-999; <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>Lindsey, supra </em>at 1240-1241; <em>State </em>v. <em>Poe, </em>284 Neb. at 768. Courts have done so where it cannot be determined which of the two defendants was the shooter and where either defendant could have been convicted as a principal or as an aider and abettor, accomplice, or joint venturer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, supra </em>at 998. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Housen, supra </em>(no due process violation where evidence was ambiguous as to identity of shooter, and where such a determination \u201cwas not essential\u201d to joint venture theory); <em>Council </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>114 Conn. App. 99, 111-112 (2009) (no due process violation where, at separate trials, prosecutor argued each defendant could have been shooter and each shooter was charged as both principal and accessory); <em>Sifrit </em>v. <em>State, </em>383 Md. 77, 106 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1056 (2005) (\u201ca due process violation will only be found when the demonstrated inconsistency exists at the core of the State\u2019s case. Discrepancies based on rational inferences from ambiguous evidence will not support a due process violation provided the two theories are supported by consistent underlying facts\u201d). In these circumstances, it is said that any inconsistency is \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the conviction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frye, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 186-187 (2005) (upholding guilty plea where defendant\u2019s \u201cassertions of inconsistency relat[ed] entirely\u201d to which individual shot victim, but where \u201cthe precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to [defendant\u2019s] conviction for aggravated murder\u201d; further review of death sentence, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>was warranted in circumstances). Courts also have found important to the analysis that (1) each theory of liability was supported by the evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Housen, supra </em>at 707; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, supra </em>at 998; (2) the use of evidence at the different trials was not factually inconsistent and irreconcilable at the \u201ccore,\u201d see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, supra </em>at 998, but see <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>120 F.3d 1045, 1057, 1059 (9th Cir. 1997), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 523 U.S. 538 (1998) (finding due process violation on rape conviction where prosecutor argued at different trials that each defendant committed rape and murder and where in second trial, prosecutor \u201cmanipulated evidence and witnesses, argued inconsistent motives,\u201d and \u201coffer[ed] facts that directly conflicted with the underlying premise of the charges . . . brought\u201d);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (3) the prosecutor had acknowledged in closing arguments, that the evidence was conflicting as to who shot the victim, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paul, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Here, no due process violation occurred where the prosecutor argued principally at Sok\u2019s trial that Sok had shot the victim, and where the main thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s argument at the defendant\u2019s trial was that the defendant had shot the victim. Significantly, at Sok\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth proceeded pursuant to a joint venture theory, and at the defendant\u2019s trial, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. at 470 (Appendix) (individual may be liable as aider and abettor if he \u201cknowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged\u201d alone or with others while he \u201chad or shared the intent required for that crime\u201d), which had recently been decided. The prosecutor acknowledged at each trial in his closing argument that the jury were not required to decide who was the shooter because, as he stated in Sok\u2019s trial, \u201c[Tjhey both are guilty,\u201d and as he similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>related in the defendant\u2019s trial, \u201cThey\u2019re all guilty. . . . They shot him.\u201d The evidence, concerning the motive and circumstances of the killing (no one saw and could identify the shooter), essentially was the same in each trial; the underlying \u201ccore\u201d facts in evidence did not change. The evidence in each trial was sufficient to support a finding that each defendant had been the shooter, or alternatively, as to Sok, had been a joint venturer, and as to the defendant, had \u201cknowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged\u201d with others while he \u201chad or shared the intent required for that crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the prosecutor\u2019s change of position in the defendant\u2019s case concerning who was the shooter may have resulted from the jury\u2019s verdict in Sok\u2019s trial, specifying that Sok was guilty of murder in the second degree only as a joint venturer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Sifrit </em>v. <em>State, </em>383 Md. at 106 (\u201cevidence presented at multiple trials is going to change to an extent based on relevancy to the particular defendant and other practical matters\u201d). Last, there is no suggestion of prosecutorial misconduct or bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Our examination, however, does not end here. Some courts, in certain circumstances, have found a prosecutor\u2019s argument to a jury admissible in evidence in subsequent litigation as an admission by a party opponent under Federal Rules of Evidence 801 (d) (2) or its State\u2019s counterpart.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 406 (1992) (prosecutors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>are agents of State); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>937 F.2d 797, 811-812 (2d Cir. 1991), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 505 U.S. 317 (1992) (opining in dicta that government\u2019s opening and closing statements in prior trial should have been admitted as admissions of party-opponent in subsequent trial to show inconsistent positions of government); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kattar, </em>840 F.2d 118, 130 (1st Cir. 1988) (concluding that government, as represented by prosecutor, is considered \u201cparty-opponent\u201d of defendant in criminal case); <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>State, </em>552 So.2d 834, 838, 840 (Miss. 1989) (prosecutor\u2019s inconsistent argument regarding who was shooter should have been admitted at codefendant\u2019s later trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that <em>opening statements </em>by a <em>defendant\u2019s attorney </em>in a criminal case are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801 (d) (2) where they are (1) \u201cassertion[s] of fact\u201d that are the \u201cequivalent of a testimonial statement by the [client];\u201d and (2) \u201cinconsistent with similar assertions in a subsequent trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>738 F.2d 26, 30, 33 (2d Cir. 1984). The court cautioned, however, that \u201c[speculations of counsel, advocacy as to the credibility of witnesses, arguments as to the weaknesses in the prosecution\u2019s case or invitations to a jury to draw certain inferences should not be admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. In addition, the court explained that the \u201cinconsistency\u201d \u201cshould be clear and of a quality which obviates any need for the trier of fact to explore other events at the prior trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Before admitting the prior jury argument, a court must, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, \u201cdetermine by a preponderance of the evidence that the inference the prosecution seeks to draw from the inconsistency is a fair one and that an innocent explanation for the inconsistency does not exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Before reaching its conclusion, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>remarked that \u201cprior opening statements are not per se inadmissible in criminal cases. To hold otherwise would not only invite abuse and sharp practice but would also weaken confidence in the justice system itself by denying the function of trials as truth-seeking proceedings. That function cannot be affirmed if parties are free, wholly without explanation, to make fundamental changes in the version of facts within their personal knowledge between trials and to conceal these changes from the final trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Subsequently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>937 F.2d at 810-811, the court, in dicta, indicated that statements satisfying the requirements cited in <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, supra, </em>made by a prosecutor during a <em>closing argument </em>at a prior, related trial, would be admissible. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orena, </em>32 F.3d 704, 716 (2d Cir. 1994). However, when an additional theory for a murder is offered at a later trial of a different defendant for that same murder, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s theories\u201d have been held not to be contradictory. See <em>id. </em>Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>79 Wash. App. 21, 30-31 (1995) (\u201cwhen an attorney is permitted to state alternative or inconsistent [positions], the statement does not qualify as the admission of a party opponent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In this case, because we were concerned with the prosecutor\u2019s inconsistent closing argument at Sok\u2019s trial and at the defendant\u2019s trial concerning who shot the victim, we invited further briefing regarding whether the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective at the defendant\u2019s trial in failing to seek admission of a transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in Sok\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">As an initial matter, we note that the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel suggested at oral argument derives from the law of the Second Circuit and not from any precedent in Massachusetts. While numerous Federal and State courts permit admissions against interest by a party-opponent, including admissions by prosecutors, we have never done so or, in the words of the dissent, \u201cadopted the logical corollary,\u201d <em>post </em>at 51, in the context of admitting a transcript of a prosecutor\u2019s closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ment from another defendant\u2019s trial. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective at the defendant\u2019s trial in failing to seek admission of the transcript based on the law of the Second Circuit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 12, 20 (1986) (concluding that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to advance argument based on principle unfamiliar in Massachusetts, although espoused in United States Supreme Court ruling invalidating New York statute). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 19 (2004) (attorneys are not required to foresee future); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>427 Mass. 245, 256-257 (1998) (counsel not ineffective for failing to object to charge under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-3 [1851], some five years before it was criticized). Further, even under the law of the Second Circuit, a transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument from Sok\u2019s trial would not have been admissible at the defendant\u2019s trial because the Commonwealth properly presented alternative (albeit inconsistent) theories of liability in each trial and in so doing presented different theories that as a matter of law are not contradictory. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orena, </em>32 F.3d at 716. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>79 Wash. App. at 30-31. The dissent ignores this law. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Apart from the existence of alternative legal theories at each trial, our conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument at Sok\u2019s trial would not have been admissible at the defendant\u2019s trial is reinforced by other factors. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecutor\u2019s theories of liability came as no surprise, as each theory was supported by the evidence. The \u201ccore\u201d evidence presented at both the defendant\u2019s trial and Sok\u2019s trial, as previously has been mentioned, essentially was the same. Although that evidence was ambiguous as to who was the shooter, the \u201ccore\u201d evidence strongly implicated <em>both </em>the defendant and Sok as being involved and responsible for the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Certainly, at the defendant\u2019s trial the prosecutor never abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>his argument that the jury ultimately were not required to determine the identity of the shooter. Further, there was no manipulation or concealment of evidence, or other prosecutorial misconduct. The jury were instructed correctly that the closing arguments of counsel are not evidence. In these circumstances, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument at Sok\u2019s trial would not have been admissible at the defendant\u2019s trial and that his trial counsel, therefore, was not ineffective in failing to seek its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We add that even under Second Circuit law, the evidence of the prior closing argument could have been used only if there had been a judicial determination \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence . . . that an innocent explanation for the inconsistency d[id] not exist.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>738 F.2d at 33. While we do not have the benefit of an affidavit of the prosecutor which could have been obtained in proceedings that usually follow the filing of a motion for a new trial (the proper vehicle to vet a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel), we cannot ignore the probable impact on the prosecutor of the jury\u2019s verdict in the Sok trial \u2014 that Keo had been the shooter and that Sok was liable as a joint venturer. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 102-103 (2d Cir. 2013) (no error in excluding prosecutor\u2019s prior jury argument because \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d existed for inconsistency). The dissent dismisses these facts, concluding, essentially, as a matter of law, that a jury\u2019s verdict could never result in an \u201cinnocent explanation.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The dissent also misstates the evidence the prosecution had at Sok\u2019s trial that was used to establish that Sok was the shooter. The prosecutor called Am and Terry to testify concerning statements they heard Sok make that he was the shooter (the victim\u2019s girl friend could not say who shot the victim). Not uncommon in gang-related trials, each witness, who were youths at the time of the shooting (Am was seventeen years of age and Terry was sixteen years of age), at trial could not recall who exactly had made the incriminating statements. In fact, Leng had no recall of the day, where she was going, giving Sok and the defendant a ride, hearing any statements, or even telling the grand jury anything. Consequently, in the case of Am, the prosecutor tried to elicit Sok\u2019s statements through her statements to police, but was unsuccessful because during cross-examination she agreed that the police wore her down and she only told them what they wanted to hear.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Regarding Terry, after getting nowhere during his direct examination with her, the prosecutor was able only to elicit Sok\u2019s statement (that he shot the victim) through the admission of Terry\u2019s grand jury testimony. Witness recantation or memory loss certainly can serve also as an \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d for a prosecutor arguing that another coventurer was the shooter was in a subsequent trial. To remand this case for further proceedings on this record, where apparent explanations exist for the prosecutor\u2019s shift in argument (concerning the identity of the shooter), undermines judicial economy, ignores what occurred at Sok\u2019s trial and its import, and belittles the substantial difficulties and challenges faced by prosecutors in many gang-related cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Even if the defendant\u2019s trial counsel should have sought admission of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in Sok\u2019s trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>any error in its exclusion at the defendant\u2019s trial was not likely \u201cto-have unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. 745, 754 (1999). This is so because the Commonwealth submitted the case to the jury pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. at 470. As such, the jury could have reached its verdict without determining that the defendant had been the shooter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>456 Mass. 1, 18 (2010) (distinctions concerning who in joint venture was portrayed as principal \u201cless meaningful\u201d after <em>Zanetti </em>decision). The dissent\u2019s position on this consequence ignores the import of the <em>Zanetti </em>decision and the corresponding jury instruction that was given in this case. No substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice occurred. Although a transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument at Sok\u2019s trial might have strengthened the defendant\u2019s case,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> assuming that it even would have been admissible, the defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to present a case. His trial counsel vigorously argued that Sok had been the shooter and offered evidence in the nature of statements that Sok had made to Am and Terry that he (Sok) had shot the victim. The evidence in both trials, at the \u201ccore,\u201d was the same, and was sufficient in this case to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The prosecutor remarked in his closing argument at each trial that it was not necessary to determine who the shooter was because each defendant was legally responsible under a joint venture theory (as to Sok) or pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, supra </em>(as to the defendant). Any error, based on the evidence in these trials and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, did not pertain to \u201cactual as compared to legal innocence,\u201d <em>Calderon </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 559 (1998), quoting <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 339 (1992), and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">That said, prosecutors, in future cases, should proceed with caution when asserting inconsistent arguments in different trials involving the same crime, assuming no \u201cinnocent explanation,\u201d significant changes, or new evidence have come to light. We note that, particularly after <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, supra, </em>there is no need for a prosecutor to emphasize principal liability. If a prosecutor does so and the position is inconsistent with what he formerly argued at another trial for the same crime, he does so possibly at his own peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">4. <em>Sentence. </em>In a recent decision issued after the defendant\u2019s conviction, the United States Supreme Court concluded that imposition of a \u201cmandatory life [sentence] without parole for those under the age of [eighteen] at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u2018cruel and unusual punishments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455, 2460 (2012). In view of this decision and the fact that the defendant was sixteen years of age at the time of the offense, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>the defendant argues, and the Commonwealth agrees, that the defendant\u2019s sentence of life in prison without parole is invalid under the Eighth Amendment pursuant to <em>Miller. </em>The defendant also argues that art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights prohibits imposition of both a mandatory and discretionary sentence of life without the possibility of parole on juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree. We recently addressed these contentions in <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>466 Mass. 655, 667-671 (2013). In <em>Diatchenko, </em>we held that the <em>mandatory </em>imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole on juvenile homicide offenders violates the Eighth Amendment and art. 26. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 667. We also concluded that <em>discretionary </em>sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders violates art. 26. <em>Id. </em>at 669-671. We explained, however, that the lesser punishment under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, of mandatory life in prison with the possibility of parole, set pursuant to the parole eligibility statute in effect at the time of the juvenile offender\u2019s crime, would apply.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 673. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>466 Mass. 676, 678 (2013). Thus, the defendant\u2019s sentence cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. We vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the Superior Court for sentencing proceedings consistent with our decisions of <em>Diatchenko </em>and <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\">At the time of this crime, the defendant was sixteen years of age.

This statement is complete speculation. Only a \u201cfew minutes\u201d transpired from when Sok, Chhay, and Tran left the restaurant to follow the victim and his girl friend to when they all reentered. Just because the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ant did not follow them outside initially does not mean that there was not a plan to taunt and chase the victim back inside the restaurant, or to shoot and kill him at some point after they had their way with the victim. Regardless, thereafter, at the relevant time of the shooting, all four men, including Sok and the defendant, went back outside. On this point raised by the dissent, we add (noting that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice existed) that at Sok\u2019s trial, there was evidence from Chhay that inside the restaurant Sok and the defendant plotted to \u201cdo it outside.\u201d According to Chhay the defendant said, \u201cDo it outside, not inside; yo, I\u2019ve got the blammer.\u201d Chhay also recounted that the defendant had the gun and only gave the gun to Sok <em>after </em>the shooting when they were at \u201cthe house,\u201d presumably King\u2019s residence. The evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial did not foreclose the jury from reasonably inferring that a plan to kill the victim had been agreed on by Sok and the defendant before Sok, Chhay, and Tran first went outside following the victim and his girl friend. Just before their departure, Rebecca Pen testified that the defendant and Chhay were seated right next to the table at which she was seated together with Sok. Statements of the defendant put the defendant at the same table at this time \u201cwith his friends.\u201d That evidence, together with the motive evidence, and testimony from Sim (that the defendant said that Sok contacted him to come to the restaurant because of the victim\u2019s presence), permitted the jury reasonably to infer that Sok and the defendant made a plan to kill the victim well before Sok, Tran, and Chhay initially followed the victim outside.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Am\u2019s memory was fine at the defendant\u2019s trial and she testified for the defense that, after the shooting, when she was driving that night, she heard Sok state, \u201cI think I shot a crab.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The trial judge would have had discretion to exclude the prior argument if he concluded that \u201cthe probative worth of the evidence [was] outweighed by the prejudicial effect it may have [had] on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>407 Mass. 629, 631 (1990).

In his closing argument in the trial of Bonrad Sok, the prosecutor began by telling the jury, \u201cThe defendant [Sok] shot and killed Christian Martinez on November 1st of 2007.\u201d He later argued, \u201cKevin [Keo] brought the gun and Bonrad [Sok] shot it.\u201d He said that when the victim left the restaurant the second time, when the shooting occurred, \u201cthat\u2019s when Bonrad [Sok] had the gun, as again [sr'c] Kevin [Keo], with [Keo\u2019s] dominant hand with the limited mobility, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d In that argument, the prosecutor addressed the testimony of Kathleena Am, who testified that after the shooting, while sitting in an automobile with Sok and Keo, she heard one of them say, \u201cI shot him; I shot him in the heart.\u201d Although Am said she did not know who had made that statement, the prosecutor asserted he could tell the jury \u201cwhere it came from. It came from him [pointing at Sok].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">However, six months later, in the trial of Keo for the same crime, the same prosecutor, based on what the Commonwealth and the court concede was essentially the same evidence, told a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>different story to the jury in his closing argument. Here, he argued that Keo \u201cis the shooter, that\u2019s what all the evidence shows.\u201d He said, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Bonrad [Sok],\u201d because the fatal shot was fired from within four feet of the victim, and Sok was approximately thirty feet from the victim at the moment of the shooting. Addressing the testimony of Am, who at Keo\u2019s trial testified that Sok had admitted to being the shooter, the prosecutor said that, even if Sok had said that, the inference that he was \u201cconfessing right there . . . just flat-out can\u2019t be true based on the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In each case, the prosecutor also pursued a joint venture theory, and told the jury that they could convict even if they found that Keo (in the Sok trial) or Sok (in the Keo trial) was the shooter. But a joint venture theory was far harder for the prosecution to prove. Based on the evidence, it reasonably could be inferred that Sok telephoned Keo when he saw the victim at the restaurant, and that Keo then arrived at the restaurant with a gun. When the victim left the restaurant, Keo remained in the restaurant, but Sok, Maverick Tran, and Vannarith Chhay followed the victim out, confronted him outside the restaurant, and assaulted him, but did not shoot him. It was only after the victim unexpectedly returned to the restaurant after this confrontation that he got into a fight with Keo, Sok, Tran, and Chhay, and was shot at close range shortly after he again left the restaurant. There can be no doubt that the shooter intended with premeditation to kill the victim. But if Sok was the shooter, there certainly could have been a reasonable doubt whether Keo shared Sok\u2019s premeditation and intent to kill, particularly where Sok did not kill the victim when he first had the chance outside the restaurant and where Keo could not reasonably have anticipated that the victim would return to the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">No doubt recognizing the weakness in the Commonwealth\u2019s joint venture theory, Keo\u2019s counsel rested his defense on the argument that Sok was the shooter. That defense would have been immeasurably stronger had defense counsel offered in evidence, as admissions of an opposing party, statements made by the prosecutor in his closing argument in the Sok trial, because the prosecutor told the jury in that trial what defense counsel was arguing in the Keo trial. But Keo\u2019s defense counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>seek to do so. The court concludes that defense counsel\u2019s failure to offer these admissions in evidence is without consequence because: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s statements would not have been admissible in evidence if offered; (2) even if these statements were admissible their admission would not likely have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict; and (3) the verdict is consonant with justice under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, even though the jury never learned that the same prosecutor in his closing argument in the Sok trial had declared that Sok was the shooter. I disagree with each of these three conclusions, and therefore respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Before commencing my critique of the court\u2019s opinion, let me first be clear as to what I am <em>not </em>contending. I do <em>not </em>contend that the prosecutor was legally barred from arguing at Keo\u2019s trial that Keo was the shooter where he had argued at Sok\u2019s trial that Sok was the shooter, or that Keo\u2019s right to due process was violated by his doing so. A prosecutor may argue any theory of criminal liability supported by the evidence, and is not bound in a subsequent case to a theory argued in an earlier case.

In <em>Arsenault, </em>the prosecutor had argued in the first trial, at which Arsenault was tried with his alleged joint ventur-ers, Arthur L. Devlin and Russell R LeBlanc, \u201cthat the defendant LeBlanc was the \u2018finger man\u2019 for the robbery which resulted in the alleged murder, that he had selected the house in which the robbery would be committed and that he had brought the defendant and Devlin there for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. At the second trial, which occurred fifteen years later, and where Arsenault was the only defendant, the prosecutor argued that \u201cArsenault looked at a house and said, \u2018That looks like a good place to rob. Let\u2019s rob that house.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Arsenault </em>court affirmed the judge\u2019s exclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s prior assertions in his opening statement and closing argument in the second trial, stating, \u201cAdmittedly the two trials proceeded on different theories of the defendant\u2019s part in the crimes, but the trial of a case on one theory does not, without more, constitute an admission by a party who proceeds on a different theory in a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The court correctly states that \u201cour earlier holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>361 Mass. [at 298], that in the second trial of a defendant, the defendant was not entitled to introduce the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument made at his first trial \u2018as an admission by the Commonwealth, \u2019 is no longer sound precedent.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at note 21. The court then proceeds to create its own unsound precedent, effectively resurrecting the same holding it just buried.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The court acknowledges that we have stated that prosecutors \u201care agents of the State.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 406 (1992). See <em>ante </em>at 39-40. The court also acknowledges that numerous Federal courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, have concluded that \u201cthe Federal Rules clearly contemplate that the federal government is a party-opponent of the defendant in criminal cases,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kattar, </em>840 F.2d 118, 130 (1st Cir. 1988), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>581 F.2d 933, 937 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1978), and that the prosecutor acts as the agent of the Federal government in a criminal prosecution. <em>Kattar, supra </em>at 131, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>467 F.2d 1089, 1097 n.1 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 983 (1973) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cassertions made by the government in a formal prosecution . . . \u2018establish the position of the United States and not merely the views of its agents who participate therein\u2019 \u201d). See <em>ante </em>at 40. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adopted the logical corollary to this legal principle and, applying Fed. R. Evid. 801 (d) (2), has ruled that a defendant in a criminal case may offer in evidence prior statements made by an assistant United States attorney that are factually inconsistent with the government\u2019s theory of the case at trial. See, e.g., <em>Salerno, </em>937 F.2d at 810-812 (judge abused discretion in excluding statements in Federal prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and closing argument at earlier trial that characterized defendant as victim of extortion rather than participant in fraudulent bid-rigging, concluding, \u201cThe government, at different times, has urged both [that the defendant was a \u201cculpable bid-rigger\u201d and a \u201cpuppet on a string\u201d] \u2014 and the jury [were] entitled to know that, because the jury, and not the government, must ultimately decide which he was\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>GAF Corp., </em>928 F.2d at 1262 (judge erred in excluding inconsistent original bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>particulars prepared by assistant United States attorney who tried case, concluding, \u201cAlthough the Court in no way suggests that the government should not be able to amend its bill of particulars as it sees fit, we do hold that, if the government chooses to change its strategy at successive trials, and contradict its previous theories of the case and version of the historical facts, the jury [are] entitled to be aware of what the government has previously claimed, and accord whatever weight [they deem] appropriate to such information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At least two State courts and the District of Columbia have also recognized that in certain circumstances a prosecutor\u2019s prior statements may be admissible as admissions against interest by a party-opponent. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>834 A.2d 106, 120 (D.C. 2003) (\u201cThe language of the party admission rule provides no basis for creating a prosecutorial exception or an exception where the government is the party opponent. . . . [T]he prior statements of an Assistant United States Attorney can be treated as party admissions\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardenas-Hernandez, </em>219 Wis. 2d 516, 531 (1998) (\u201cWe find persuasive the reasoning of <em>Salerno </em>and <em>McKeon. </em>We therefore refuse to adopt a per se prohibition on the use of prior statements of prosecutors as admissions of a party-opponent . . . We agree that to adopt such a rule could invite abuse and sharp practice by prosecutors and could weaken the public\u2019s confidence in the justice system itself by denying the function of trials as truth-seeking proceedings\u201d); <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>State, </em>552 So. 2d 834, 838, 840 (Miss. 1989) (prosecutor\u2019s statements at earlier trial of codefendant that codefendant killed victim should have been admitted in evidence at defendant\u2019s subsequent trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">To be sure, not every inconsistent statement by a prosecutor is admissible in evidence. \u201cThe defense is allowed to introduce a prosecutor\u2019s statement from a prior trial when: (1) the prosecution offered an inconsistent assertion of fact at the prior trial; and (2) the prosecution can offer no \u2018innocent\u2019 explanation for the contradiction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orena, </em>32 F.3d 704, 716 (2d Cir. 1994). See Poulin, Party Admissions in Criminal Cases: Should the Government Have to Eat Its Words?, 87 Minn. L. Rev. 401, 443 (2002). Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s assertion of fact is not inconsistent and therefore not admissible where the prosecutor at a subsequent trial offered \u201cadditional, not conflicting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>theories\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s motivation to commit the murder. <em>Orena, supra. </em>Nor would an inconsistent assertion of fact be admissible where new evidence was discovered after the first trial that caused the prosecutor to alter his understanding of the facts of a case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 86 n.1, 102-103 (2d Cir. 2013) (government provided \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d for inconsistency between its stated position at earlier trial and at subsequent trial where defendant in first trial, after conviction, proffered new information that led government to different view as to her culpability for murder). And a judge always retains the discretion to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth. See <em>Ruszcyk </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>401 Mass. 418, 422-423 (1988); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Applying these principles to this case, it is plain that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing argument at the Sok trial that Sok was the shooter is an assertion of fact that is inconsistent with his statements in closing argument at the Keo trial that Keo was the shooter. The court contends that the prosecutor\u2019s statements are not inconsistent because, in both trials, he argued that the defendant was guilty regardless of whether he was the shooter or an aider or abettor, but any fair reading of the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments would reveal that he made a forceful factual (and inconsistent) assertion that the defendant on trial was the shooter; he did not merely identify the evidence supporting the theory that the defendant on trial was a shooter and the theory that he was an aider and abettor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Because the defendant did not seek to offer in evidence the prosecutor\u2019s inconsistent assertion that Sok was the shooter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>prosecutor did not have an opportunity to offer an \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation for his contradictory assertions of fact at the two trials. Even though essentially the same evidence was offered at both trials, the prosecutor should be given this opportunity, which requires remand of the case to the trial judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the prosecutor can provide an \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation, the jury in this case were entitled to know that the prosecutor in his closing argument at the Sok trial had told the Sok jury what Keo\u2019s attorney had told the Keo jury \u2014 that Sok was the shooter \u2014 and give this inconsistent statement whatever weight they believe it deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">2. <em>Prejudice from the failure to admit this evidence. </em>The court states that, even if it were error to not admit this evidence, the error was \u201cnot likely \u2018to have unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 44-45, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. 745, 754 (1999). I recognize that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant on a joint venture theory if the jury were to have learned of and adopted the prosecutor\u2019s earlier inconsistent statements that Sok was the shooter. But the sufficiency of the evidence of joint venture does not mean that the defendant was not prejudiced by the jury\u2019s failure to learn of the prosecutor\u2019s inconsistent statements as to who was the shooter. As noted earlier, to convict Keo as an aider and abettor of premeditated murder, the jury would have needed to find beyond a reasonable doubt that, when the fatal shot was fired, Keo, with premeditation, shared Sok\u2019s intent to kill the victim. The difficulty in proving this theory beyond a reasonable doubt was that the victim was not killed immediately after he first left the restaurant, but only after he unexpectedly returned to the restaurant and fought with Keo, Sok, and their two fellow gang members inside the restaurant. If Sok was the shooter, the jury would have needed to consider whether Keo and Sok devised a plan to kill the victim that Sok did not attempt when the victim first left the restaurant, or whether Keo, during or immediately after the fight in the restaurant, somehow directed Sok to kill the victim even though they were many feet apart at the time of the killing and there was no evidence of any verbal communication between them in the moments that preceded the shooting. The evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that Keo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>directed Sok to shoot the victim, but the <em>weight </em>of the evidence of Keo\u2019s premeditation and intent to kill was far weaker if Sok was the shooter rather than Keo. Where Keo\u2019s strategy at trial was to argue that Sok was the shooter, no doubt because he recognized the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Keo was guilty as an aider and abettor if the jury found that Sok was the shooter, it is unreasonable for the court to conclude that Keo was not unfairly prejudiced by the jury\u2019s inability to weigh the prosecutor\u2019s declarations at the earlier trial that Sok was the shooter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">3. <em>Is the verdict consonant with justice under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E? </em>The court concludes, among other reasons, that the verdict is consonant with justice under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, because the defendant\u2019s counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to seek to admit evidence that we have yet to declare admissible. <em>Ante </em>at 41-46. Under our broad authority in capital cases under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we may order a new trial where \u201cthe verdict was against the law or the weight of the evidence, or because of newly discovered evidence, or for any other reason that justice may require.\u201d In view of the breadth of this authority, I do not believe the court needs to decide whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize that the court might conclude, as did the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and various State courts, that an inconsistent factual statement of a prosecutor in an earlier closing argument is admissible where there is no \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation for the inconsistency. Regardless of whether counsel was ineffective for failing to offer this evidence, the fact remains that: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing argument in the Sok trial that Sok was the shooter may have been admissible; (2) the admission of this evidence would have substantially bolstered defense counsel\u2019s argument that Sok was the shooter; and (3) we cannot be certain, or even confident, that the jury would have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Keo guilty of murder in the first degree as an aider and abettor if they had a reasonable doubt whether Keo was the shooter. This alone is more than sufficient to justify remand to the trial judge to determine whether the prosecutor had an \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation for arguing that Keo was the shooter after having earlier argued that Sok was the shooter. If there is no \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation, this conviction is not consonant with justice and must be vacated, so that a new trial may be conducted where the jury learns that, when Sok was on trial, the prosecutor argued that Sok was the shooter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">To affirm this conviction without first remanding it is to affirm that the truth does not matter in criminal trials, that a prosecutor who lacks an \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d may, without consequence, argue in one trial that one codefendant is the shooter where that theory will more easily lead to that codefendant\u2019s conviction and, in another trial, argue that a different codefendant is the shooter where that approach offers an easier path to securing a conviction. In short, I am convinced that affirming this conviction without first remanding it \u201cwould not only invite abuse and sharp practice [by prosecutors] but would also weaken confidence in the justice system itself by denying the function of trials as truth-seeking proceedings.\u201d <em>Salerno, </em>937 F.2d at 811, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>738 F.2d 26, 31 (2d Cir. 1984). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">concur with the court that, given that the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree is affirmed, the defendant\u2019s sentence should be reduced to life with the possibility of parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">I have inserted in brackets the words \u201cthe Commonwealth\u201d in place of the words \u201cany party\u201d that are used in this quotation because I limit my discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to the admission of the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing argument and do not address whether an inconsistent statement by a defense counsel in opening statement or closing argument may also be admissible in evidence as an admission of an opposing party, as it was held to be in <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>738 F.2d 26, 34 (2d Cir. 1984). Because a prosecutor plays a \u201cspecial role ... in the search for truth in criminal trials,\u201d <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281 (1999), the admission of a prosecutor\u2019s contrary assertion in a previous opening statement or closing argument warrants a legal analysis different from that for the admission of a defense counsel\u2019s contrary prior statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The court states that the conclusion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>937 F.2d 797, 811-812 (2d Cir. 1991), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 505 U.S. 317 (1992), that the judge abused her discretion in refusing to admit the prosecutor\u2019s inconsistent statements in an earlier closing argument, was \u201cdicta.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 40, 41. To the extent this characterization suggests that the court\u2019s conclusion was without practical consequence, it is misleading. Although the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions on other grounds, it recognized that a retrial was \u201clikely\u201d and reached the issue to \u201coffer some guidance on this subject.\u201d <em>Salerno, supra </em>at 811.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u2018The court, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orena, </em>32 F.3d 704, 716 (2d Cir. 1994), claims that \u201ceven under the law of the Second Circuit, a transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument from Sok\u2019s trial would not have been admissible at the defendant\u2019s trial because the Commonwealth properly presented alternative (albeit inconsistent) theories of liability in each trial and in so doing presented different theories that as a matter of law are not contradictory.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 42. The court also claims that the \u201cdissent ignores this law.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 42. In fact, the court badly misreads the <em>Orena </em>case and, in doing so, mischaracterizes the law of the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In <em>Orena, supra </em>at 716, the prosecutor in the first trial said that the victim was murdered because he was skimming loansharking proceeds; at Orena\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>trial, he offered the same claimed motivation, as well as two alternative motivations, to kill the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao-dedup-0\">\u201cAt Bonfiglio\u2019s trial, the prosecution postulated that Ocera was murdered because he was skimming loansharking proceeds. At Orena\u2019s trial, the prosecution proffered three bases for Ocera\u2019s murder: (1) Ocera was skimming loansharking proceeds; (2) Ocera had not been able to retrieve the loansharking records seized from his restaurant by the Suffolk County police; and (3) Orena wanted to ingratiate himself with John Gotti, then the boss of the Gambino family, who for his own reasons wanted Ocera to be killed. Thus, the prosecution at Orena\u2019s trial offered additional, not conflicting, theories for the Ocera murder. Further, there is no showing that evidence was introduced at the Bonfiglio trial that would have justified arguing the additional theories to the jury in that case. Accordingly, the district court properly excluded the prosecution\u2019s opening statement at Bonfiglio\u2019s trial from being admitted in evidence at Orena\u2019s trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">Offering additional possible motivations for a victim\u2019s murder is a world apart from changing position as to who shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">The court also cites support for its position, albeit with a \u201ccf.\u201d citation, from <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>79 Wash. App. 21, 30-31 (1995), where the Court of Appeals of Washington concluded that a judge erred in allowing a prosecutor to admit in evidence a defense lawyer\u2019s stipulation that his client\u2019s defenses would be \u201c[gjeneral denial, entrapment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 42. The <em>Williams </em>court stated, \u201cWe hold only that when an attorney is permitted to state alternative or inconsistent defenses on behalf of his or her client, the statement does not qualify as the admission of a party opponent.\u201d <em>Williams, supra. </em>The fact that the court looks to this case for support reflects how little support the court has for its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Though, as the court notes, <em>ante </em>at 43, \u201cwe do not have the benefit of an affidavit of the prosecutor\u201d explaining why he told the jury in the Sok trial that Sok was the shooter and the jury in the Keo trial that Keo was the shooter, the Commonwealth suggests, and the court agrees, that the jury verdict in the Sok trial that Sok was guilty as a joint venturer justified the change. Even if the prosecutor were to offer this explanation, it is the role of the trial judge, not this court, to determine whether it is credible and whether, in the absence of newly discovered evidence, it suffices as an innocent explanation for the prosecutor\u2019s 180 degree shift in his theory of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The court states that the dissent \u201cmisstates the evidence the prosecution had at Sok\u2019s trial that was used to establish that Sok was the shooter,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 44, although it does not identify any misstatement and I am not aware of any. As best I can tell, the thrust of this paragraph is that the fact that Am testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>at Keo\u2019s trial that Sok said, \u201cI think I shot a crab,\u201d where she was not sure who made this statement at Sok\u2019s trial, provides an \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d for the prosecutor\u2019s change in position at Keo\u2019s trial that Keo, not Sok, was the shooter. Since this evidence more strongly pointed to Sok as the shooter, I cannot see how this can possibly explain the prosecutor\u2019s new assertion that Keo was the shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Where I have twice in my dissent recognized that the evidence was sufficient to convict Keo on a joint venture theory if Sok was the shooter, I fail to understand how the court can state that the dissent attempts \u201cto extinguish any accomplice or joint venture type of liability.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at note 23. My disagreement with the majority rests in their unwillingness to recognize the prejudice that arises from the jury not learning that the prosecutor earlier declared that Sok was the shooter, not the sufficiency of the evidence of joint venture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The court appears to state that there can be no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where the defendant \u201cwas not deprived of his constitutional right to present a case\u201d or, alternatively, where the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction on a joint venture theory. <em>Ante </em>at 45-46. Neither assertion accurately reflects our law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
