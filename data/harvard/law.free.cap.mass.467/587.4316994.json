L. c. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u00a7 59H. The defendant, the New England Regional Council of Caipenters, appeals from a Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of its special motion to dismiss a suit by the town of Hanover (town) claiming that the defendant engaged in abuse of process in prior legal proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that support of litigation constitutes protected petitioning activity within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, and that, here, the town did not demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s right to petition was \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 123 (2002), we allow the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">1. <em>Prior litigation. </em>We begin by briefly discussing certain events relevant to the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss. In May, 2009, the town engaged in an open bidding process for the construction of the town\u2019s new high school. <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>457 Mass. 248, 251-252 (2010) <em>(Fordyce). </em>The town awarded the contract to the contractor with the lowest formal bid, following which a subcontractor who was not involved in the winning contract filed a bid protest with the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at 252. After an investigation of the town\u2019s bidding process and award of the contract, the Attorney General found that the contractor who had won the bid had engaged in fraud pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>during the prequalification stages of the bidding process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Nevertheless, the town continued to honor its contract with the winning contractor, and ten taxpayers of the town initiated an action against the town pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53 (the 2009 litigation).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 254. The taxpayers sought, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>things, a temporary and permanent injunction to prevent the town from paying the contractor who had committed fraud and \u201cto require the town to rescind the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A Superior Court judge allowed the taxpayers\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, relying in part on the Attorney General\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>As a result, construction was halted for approximately one month. Appeals ensued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After our decision in <em>Fordyce, id. </em>at 266, which effectively permitted the town to adhere to the contract with the lowest bidder, the parties stipulated to a dismissal of the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">2. <em>Current litigation. </em>In October, 2011, the town filed a complaint against the defendant alleging abuse of process during the 2009 litigation. The town claimed, in essence, that the defendant supported the taxpayers in the 2009 litigation by commencing and maintaining the litigation, providing legal counsel, and controlling the taxpayers\u2019 interests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, the defendant filed the special motion to dismiss at issue here, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (\u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute). In its motion, the defendant asserted that the town\u2019s claims against it are solely based on the organization\u2019s constitutionally protected right to petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">After a hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, stating that, because it was not a named party in the 2009 litigation and had not established that it engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>petitioning activities, the defendant did not have standing to bring a special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute. The defendant contends that associations that support litigants in seeking redress against the government, like the litigants themselves, are engaging in constitutionally protected petitioning activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The town argues that the judge correctly denied the special motion to dismiss because the act of supporting individuals for the purpose of filing litigation against the town does not qualify as protected petitioning activity under the antiSLAPP statute. Relying on <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 333 (2005), the town contends that if a party is not directly aggrieved by the government, and has not sought redress on his own behalf, a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, is unavailable. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The town also contends that the alleged involvement in the 2009 lawsuit was unlawful because some of the named plaintiffs were substituted for other plaintiffs in amended complaints and, at one point during the litigation, there were fewer than ten taxpayers to bring the suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, the town states that the appeals and the preliminary injunction that halted construction caused damages in the form of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">a. <em>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Constitutional petitioning activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute is not limited to being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>named party in litigation, but rather includes activities such as \u201cwriting to government officials, attending public hearings, testifying before government bodies, circulating petitions for signature, lobbying for legislation, . . . filing agency protests or appeals, being parties in law-reform lawsuits, and engaging in peaceful boycotts and demonstration.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161-162 (1998), quoting Pring, SLAPPs: Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, 7 Pace Envtl. L. Rev. 3, 5 (1989). The right to petition the government also includes \u201creporting violations of law.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 161, quoting Pring, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 523 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004) (filing complaint and supporting affidavits for abuse protection order constitutes petitioning activity pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H). \u201c[T]here is no statutory requirement that petitioning parties directly commence or initiate proceedings . . . [but] the statute requires that the protected party have more than a mere contractual connection\u201d to petitioning activity. <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59H, protects several types of \u201cstatements\u201d that constitute protected petitioning activity regardless of whether the parties provide support for, or are named parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in judicial proceedings. See <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Schlichtmann, </em>448 Mass. 242, 248 (2007) (five types of statements are protected pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H). A party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition includes \u201cany written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a . . . judicial body . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. Likewise, \u201cany statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a . . . judicial body\u201d or \u201creasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration\u201d is also protected. <em>Id. </em>We have held that parties other than named parties who are sued for their involvement with petitioning activity in an underlying lawsuit have engaged in actions protected by the statute and, therefore, may utilize the statute\u2019s protections. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 349 (2000) (parents involved with reporting crime against son, and who were sued based on that involvement, had engaged in constitutionally protected petitioning activity). Anti-SLAPP protections are also available to attorneys who represent individuals engaging in petitioning activity against the government. <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 156-157 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Here, the ten taxpayers in the 2009 litigation petitioned against the town for redress of what was deemed to be, before our decision in <em>Fordyce, </em>an illegality in the prebidding process. In other words, the taxpayers brought suit against the town to commence judicial review of what they deemed to be the town\u2019s expenditure of money binding the town\u2019s taxpayers \u201cin any manner other than that for and in which [the] town . . . has the legal and constitutional right and power to raise or expend money.\u201d G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53. See <em>Fordyce, </em>457 Mass. at 254. The defendant\u2019s organizational support of the taxpayers who brought suit constitutes the practice of reporting a violation of law, particularly in light of the statute\u2019s definitions of protected petitioning activity. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 549-550 (2001) (defendant\u2019s statements made in response to State and Federal officials were protected by anti-SLAPP statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant\u2019s role in the commencement and maintenance of the action against the town, as well as its actions of providing legal counsel and advice to the taxpayers, falls within the statute\u2019s scope of protected activities. The defendant, like the taxpayers themselves, was enlisting the taxpayers in order to effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>judicial review of an expenditure of town funds that had been misused. Its involvement in the litigation was likely to encourage consideration by the courts and enlist the participation of the public, here, the taxpayers, to effect that consideration. The defendant\u2019s support thus falls within the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201cstatement.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Marabello </em>v. <em>Boston Bark Corp., </em>463 Mass. 394, 400 (2012) (special motion to dismiss not applicable where claim not based on \u201cany statement made ... in the exercise of [the defendant\u2019s] right of petition\u201d). Such support of litigation brought to seek redress against the government constitutes petitioning activity for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The town\u2019s reliance on <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. at 332, is misplaced. There, we concluded that the defendant, an expert witness hired by a governmental agency in connection with a disciplinary proceeding, could not avail himself of the anti-SLAPP statute because he \u201cwas not seeking from the government any form of redress for a grievance of his own or otherwise petitioning on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. The defendant\u2019s support of the taxpayers also is not, as the town contends, similar to the actions of a newspaper reporter whose articles \u201cdid not contain statements seeking to redress a grievance or to petition for relief\u201d and were thus not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>Fustolo </em>v. <em>Hollander, </em>455 Mass. 861, 867 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Contrary to the town\u2019s argument, making statements to seek redress is not always an individual activity, and the phrase \u201con their own behalf\u201d in the case law does not indicate that only named parties in a lawsuit have standing to bring an anti-SLAPP special motion to dismiss. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. at 347; <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 156-157. The constitutional \u201c[f]reedom of association guarantees an opportunity for people to express their ideas and beliefs through membership or affiliation with a group.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 871-872 (1983). Associations such as unions are comprised of individuals who \u201chave a right to organize into parties ... for the purpose of advancing causes in which they believe.\u201d <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 252 (1946). Thus, as well as having petitioning rights of its own, the defendant shared the taxpayers\u2019 interests to seek a preliminary injunction against the town, as presumably, the defendant\u2019s involvement in the 2009 litigation was to obtain the organization\u2019s objective on behalf of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The \u201capparent purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute [is] to dispose expeditiously of meritless lawsuits that may chill petitioning activity.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 </em>Mass. at 166. Punishing organizations that support constitutionally protected petitioning activity would only serve to inhibit both individual and organizational rights of petitioning. See <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 157 (\u201cSuits directed against the attorneys who represent petitioning parties are just as likely to exert a chilling effect on petitioning activity as suits directed against the parties themselves\u201d). Doing so would also eliminate rights to petition granted by the statute to those who enlist public participation to effect consideration or review of an issue by a court of law, and would ultimately diminish discussion of legal issues in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Our conclusion is in accord with the reasons underlying the statute\u2019s enactment. The Legislature in 1994 enacted the anti-SLAPP statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, to counteract suits filed to \u201cintimidate opponents\u2019 exercise of rights of petitioning and speech.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 </em>Mass. at 161. The statute was intended to protect the right to petition the government for \u201cthe redress of grievances\u201d guaranteed by the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. at 334 &amp; n.9; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 549, quoting <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 </em>Mass. at 162 (\u201c[T]he Legislature intended to go beyond the \u2018typical\u2019 case by enacting \u2018very broad protection for petitioning activities\u2019 \u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Further, the origins of the statute lie in the Legislature\u2019s attempt to protect those who, \u201cwhen exercising their constitutional right to speak out against development projects or other matters of concern to them and their communities,\u201d would be stifled by lawsuits against them. <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. at 337. Finally, \u201cthe Legislature recognized that \u2018full participation by persons <em>and organizations </em>and robust discussion of issues before legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies and in other public fora are essential to the democratic process\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 161, quoting preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">b. <em>Two-part inquiry pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. </em>Having concluded that the statute applies to the defendant\u2019s actions, we turn to the well-established burden-shifting test established in the <em>Duracraft </em>decision. See 427 Mass. at 167-168. We review to determine whether, when the judge denied the special motion to dismiss, there was an abuse of discretion or an error of law. <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">First, the special movant must make a \u201cthreshold showing through the pleadings and affidavits that the claims against it are \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 167-168. \u201c[I]f the <em>only </em>conduct complained of is petitioning activity, then there can be no other \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for the claim\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122 (2002). The defendant has made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The town\u2019s claim against the defendant is primarily that it was involved in the 2009 litigation against the town, despite not being a named plaintiff in the suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to the town, the defendant abused process by supporting the ten taxpayers who brought the suit and by enlisting too few taxpayers required for the litigation, in addition to naming taxpayers in the suit who did not know they were parties. Underlying both of these allegations is the assertion that the defendant was using the courts to redress a wrong by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The record presents nothing to suggest that there is any substantial basis for the town\u2019s claims other than the protected petitioning activity; the act of engaging in litigation, albeit behind the scenes, provides the only basis for the town\u2019s complaint. The town\u2019s request for costs caused by litigating the appeals further supports our conclusion that there was no basis for the town\u2019s claim against the defendant other than the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Because the defendant has shown that the suit against it was based on protected petitioning activity, the burden of proof shifts to the town as the nonmoving party. See <em>id. </em>at 123. The town must show by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant\u2019s \u201cexercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and . . . [its] acts caused actual injury\u201d to the town.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. It has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">There is ample factual support for the premise that the 2009 litigation, as commenced, maintained, and controlled by the defendant, was initiated to redress grievances against the town. As detailed in the Attorney General\u2019s findings, the contractor who had been awarded the bid had committed fraud during the prebidding process. See <em>Fordyce, </em>457 Mass. at 252-253. A Superior Court judge, a single justice of the Appeals Court, and this court provided factual findings concerning the bidding process of the project in dispute. See <em>id. </em>Further, the town has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the 2009 litigation was deficient in the number of taxpayers bringing the suit. The record shows that the complaint was amended three times in order to substitute and add taxpayers, but nowhere shows a defective complaint, which could be disposed of by other procedural methods.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because of our conclusions regarding support of litigants seeking redress from the government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>and because the town did not meet its burden under the antiSLAPP statute, the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss should be allowed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">4. <em>Conclusion, </em>We remand the case for entry of an order granting the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss and for the award of its costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.

For example, providing litigation support in this case was a statement \u201cmade in connection with an issue\u201d being reviewed by the courts, and was \u201creasonably likely to encourage consideration or review\u201d by the court in response to the Attorney General\u2019s investigation.

However, we decline to equate a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, with a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ.

The Superior Court judge approved the defendant\u2019s motion to file an assented-to second amended complaint that substituted one plaintiff for another, its motion to file a third amended complaint that substituted two plaintiffs for one plaintiff, and the motion to file a fourth amended complaint that added one plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Because of our conclusion, we do not reach the secondary inquiry, whether the defendant\u2019s acts caused injury to the town.
