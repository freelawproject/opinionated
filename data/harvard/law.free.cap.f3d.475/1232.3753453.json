Prior to sentencing, the probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The PSI assigned a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), because Ivory had a pri- or conviction in Alabama for a crime of violence, second degree rape, which Ivory had pled guilty to. Ivory, who was 22 years old at the time of the prior offense, had engaged in sexual intercourse with a female who was less than 16 years old. The PSI further enhanced Ivory\u2019s base offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), because Ivory possessed ammunition and a firearm in connection with another felony offense, possession of cocaine. The PSI scored Ivory\u2019s criminal history at level VI. With an offense level of 24 and a criminal history score of VI, Ivory\u2019s resulting guideline range was 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-18\">Ivory filed objections to the PSI, arguing that his base offense level was improperly enhanced because the court erroneously determined that his prior Alabama conviction for second degree rape was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 4B1.2. He further argued that the PSI\u2019s recommendation of a four level enhancement based on the offense\u2019s connection with another felony offense was in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he did not admit to, and was not found guilty of, possession of a firearm or cocaine. The district court adopted the PSI and overruled both of Ivory\u2019s objections. The court found that Ivory\u2019s prior conviction for second degree rape conviction constituted a crime of violence as contemplated by \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). The court further found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Ivory did possess ammunition and a firearm in connection with possession of cocaine, which supported the recommended four-level enhancement. Ivory was then sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutively with the revocation of his supervised release, followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-19\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-20\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). The interpretation of Alabama\u2019s statute for second degree rape is a question of law and is also subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">We have not previously considered whether Alabama\u2019s statute for second degree rape constitutes a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 4B1.2. Because Ivory was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), his base offense level is governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. Section 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) provides that the base offense level for Ivory\u2019s conviction is 20 if \u201cthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1, the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d has the meaning given in \u00a7 4B1.2, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-6\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-7\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-8\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 clarifies that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-11\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes ... forcible sex offenses .... Other offenses are included as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e. expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives ... or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-13\">Ivory was convicted of second degree rape under Alabama law. A person commits the crime of second degree rape if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-14\">(1) Being 16 years old or older, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex less than 16 and more than 12 years old; provided, however, the actor is at least two years older than the member of the opposite sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-15\">(2) He or she engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex who is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally defective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1260-16\">Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-17\">We first examine whether \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d as specified in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), is an element of a second degree rape conviction under Alabama law. To do that we first review what is meant by the term \u201cphysical force\u201d and then examine our relevant precedent about the use of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-18\">In interpreting the term \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), we look first to the plain meaning of those words. <em>See United States v. Shenberg, </em>89 F.3d 1461, 1475 (11th Cir.1996) (noting that we give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>sentencing guidelines their plain meaning effect unless the language leads to a result contrary to legislative intent). We previously have noted that the plain meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d is \u2018\u201c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person\u2019 \u2018consisting in a physical act.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>673 (7th ed.1999)); <em>see also United States v. Nason, </em>269 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2001) (synthesizing various definitions to find that physical force includes any \u201cpower, violence, or pressure directed against another person\u2019s body\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Two of our recent decisions expressly have addressed whether state convictions involved the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d and are particularly instructive here. In <em>Griffith, </em>we considered whether a conviction for simple battery under Georgia law has \u201c \u2018as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\u2019 \u201d to merit a conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1341 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) (defining \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (forbidding a person who has been convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d from possessing a firearm). We noted that the Georgia battery statute has as an element \u201c \u2018physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1342 (quoting Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(l)). Based on the plain meaning of \u201cphysical force,\u201d we concluded that a simple battery conviction under Georgia law satisfied the physical force requirement of the ACCA because \u201c[a] person cannot make physical contact-particularly of an insulting or provoking nature-with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Similarly, a person cannot engage in nonconsensual sexual penetration with another without exerting some level of physical force. Indeed, in <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>we concluded that a statutory rape conviction under Kentucky law, wherein a minor cannot legally consent to the physical contact of sexual intercourse, involves the use of physical force and constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d at 1251. Kentucky\u2019s third degree rape statute is similar to Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(l). Under Kentucky law, a person is guilty if \u201c[b]eing twenty-one (21) years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person less than sixteen (16) years old.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 510.060(l)(b). The relevant guideline in <em>Chavarriyar-Me-jia </em>was the 2002 version of \u00a7 2L1.2, which provided that a crime of violence included any \u201coffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.1(B)(ii) (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">In examining in <em>Chavarriya-Mejia </em>whether statutory rape involves the \u201cuse of physical force,\u201d we first noted, \u201c[s]tatutory rape is a kind of battery: unlawful physical contact. Sexual offenses by adults against children inherently involve physical force against the children.\u201d <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d at 1251. We reasoned that the existence of consent-in-fact was irrelevant because \u201cthe law presumes that the physical contact aspects of statutory rape were not lawfully consented to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we concluded that statutory rape under Kentucky law, which proscribes sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen years old, inherently involves the use of force and is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">This Court in <em>Chavarriya-Mejia </em>also discussed the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (2002), which not only defined a crime of violence as an offense that has the use of physical force as an element, but also stated that crimes of violence include \u201cmurder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.1(B)(ii) (2002). In <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>this Court particularly noted the parenthetical \u201cincluding sexual abuse of a minor\u201d and also concluded that statutory rape involves an illegal sexual act against a minor and thus constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under the 2002 commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d at 1251. While this reasoning provided an additional basis for the conclusion in <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>the Court nonetheless initially determined that statutory rape was a crime of violence because it inherently involves the \u201cuse of physical force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">With this precedent in mind, we now turn to Alabama\u2019s statutory rape offense at issue here. Similar to Kentucky law, a person violates Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(l) by engaging in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex less than sixteen years old. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(1). Under Alabama\u2019s criminal code, a person under sixteen years old is deemed to be incapable of consent to sexual intercourse. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-70(e)(1). Accordingly, second degree rape under Alabama law is sexual intercourse with a person incapable of consenting to the act. A nonconsensual act of sexual penetration by its nature involves at least some level of physical force and pressure directed against another person\u2019s body. <em>See Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1342. Therefore, we conclude that a second degree rape conviction under Alabama law must involve the \u201cuse of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">Alternatively, and as an independent basis for our holding, we conclude that second degree rape of a minor, under Alabama law, at a minimum \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d as provided under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>Although our prior decision in <em>Ramsey v. INS, </em>55 F.3d 580 (11th Cir.1995), dealt with a different state law and involved a different definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d our analysis in that case provides helpful guidance. In <em>Ramsey, </em>we examined a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, which is a felony that \u201c \u2018by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u2019 \u201d 55 F.3d at 583 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16). In the present case, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) alternatively defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a crime that \u201cpresents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">In <em>Ramsey, </em>this Court determined that a conviction for <em>attempted </em>lewd assault, of a person less than sixteen years old under Florida law involves a \u201csubstantial risk that physical force may be used\u201d and thus constitutes a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. 55 F.3d at 583-84. This Court noted that \u201cRamsey was not convicted of the substantive offense, but rather of attempting to commit an act in violation of\u2019 the Florida law prohibiting lewd assault on a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 583. Under the Florida lewd assault statute analyzed in <em>Ramsey, </em>lewd assault on a minor included any person who \u201c[h]andles, fondles, or assaults any child under the age of 16 years in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent manner ... without committing the crime of sexual battery ....\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(1) (1993). In <em>Ramsey, </em>we concluded that even though a lewd assault violation, and certainly an attempted lewd assault violation, could occur without the use of physical force, the offense conduct still involved a \u201csubstantial risk that physical force may be used against the victim in the course of committing the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">After <em>Ramsey, </em>we extended Ramsey\u2019s reasoning and concluded in <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899 (11th Cir.1999), that a conviction for lewd assault against a minor involves \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury\u201d and constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). 175 F.3d at 905 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>Rutherford, </em>we discussed <em>Ramsey\u2019s </em>conclusion that attempted lewd assault involved \u201c \u2018a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the victim.\u2019 \u201d 175 F.3d at 905 (quoting <em>Ramsey, </em>55 F.3d at 583). We then stated that there is not a substantial difference in the definition of a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and the definition of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d at 905. In reaching this conclusion, this Court in <em>Rutherford </em>relied on <em>United States v. Coronado-Cervantes, </em>154 F.3d 1242, 1244 (10th Cir.1998). In <em>Coronado-Cervantes, </em>the Tenth Circuit noted the different definitions of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (\u201ca substantial risk that physical force may be used\u201d) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 (\u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury\u201d), but concluded that a decision under one code section should control the other. <em>Coronado-Cervantes, </em>154 F.3d at 1244. The <em>Coronado-Cervantes </em>Court thus determined that it should follow its previous holding that attempted sexual abuse of a minor was a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, and it ultimately found that a sexual offense involving a minor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Coronado-Cervantes, </em>154 F.3d at 1244; <em>see also Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d at 905 (relying on <em>Coronado-Cervantes).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">In light of <em>Ramsey </em>and <em>Rutherford, </em>second degree rape under Alabama law involves significantly more physical contact than attempted lewd assault under Florida law required; there must be sexual intercourse with a minor under Alabama law, and not merely attempted handling or fon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>dling, as with attempted lewd assault. Accordingly, the commission of second degree rape by a nonconsensual act of sexual penetration poses an even greater risk of both physical force and physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1107, 163 L.Ed.2d 918 (2006), this Court concluded that even using the internet to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cpresents the possibility of an encounter that could result in \u2018a serious risk of physical injury to [the minor],\u2019 \u201d and thus constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. 418 F.3d at 1197 (citation omitted). In <em>Searcy, </em>we emphasized that sexual offenses against minors always present \u201c \u2018a, substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure a child\u2019s compliance with an adult\u2019s sexual demands,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018physical injury need not be [certain] for a crime to pose a serious risk of physical injury ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (quoting <em>United States v. Munro, </em>394 F.3d 865, 870 (10th Cir.2005)). Given the significant gap in age and maturity, an adult\u2019s conduct in actually engaging in sexual intercourse with a minor presents an even more serious risk that physical force will be used to coerce compliance and that physical injury will occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">Other circuits that have examined similar statutory sexual offense crimes are split in their analysis. Some circuits have concluded that statutory sexual offenses do not inherently qualify as crimes of violence without considering, along with the statutory definition, some other aggravating factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sawyers, </em>409 F.3d 732, 742 (6th Cir.) (holding that statutory rape in Tennessee did not inherently present a serious potential risk of physical injury), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005); <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>110 F.3d 382, 386 (7th Cir.1997) (declining to impose a <em>per se </em>rule that second degree assault under Wisconsin law prohibiting either sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 was a crime of violence). Other circuits go the other way and conclude that statutory sexual offenses do inherently involve a serious potential risk of physical injury, and therefore qualify as crimes of violence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Granbois, </em>376 F.3d 993, 995-96 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that engaging in sexual contact with a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(3) was <em>per se </em>a crime of violence); <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 289 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that taking indecent liberties with a child under North Carolina law categorically presented a serious risk of physical injury and was therefore a crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-13\">After carefully examining the language of Alabama\u2019s second degree rape statute, Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62, we conclude that the offense inherently poses a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>See Searcy, </em>418 F.3d at 1197; <em>Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d at 905; <em>Ramsey, </em>55 F.3d at 583-84. Consequently, it qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">For all of these reasons, we therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>affirm Ivory\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANO\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">.
