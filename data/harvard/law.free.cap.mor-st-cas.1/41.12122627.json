There was but one motion made, and that was for arrest of judgment, and for a new trial, which was treated by the court below simply as a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-12\">. Whether any offense is stated in the indictment, or whether the law is constitutional, are questions which only can arise upon a demurrer, or on a motion in arrest of judgment, neither of which courses was adopted by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The ground chiefly insisted on in support of the motion for a new trial, is newly discovered evidence, and it appears from the record that the newly discovered evidence was only cumulative.

The court will not hear or give sentence in a criminal case, where the punishment is corporal, unless the accused is present, or at least under recognizance; or unless his presence is waived.

That the offense is not sufficiently described.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">2d. That it is not alleged in the indictment that the said defendant is not an Indian; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">3d. That the act of the legislature creating this offense is in opposition to the articles of cession and agreement between the State ,of Georgia and the United States; hostile to the acts of Congress on this subject; at war with the Indian treaties which have been made since 1716 ; and in direct violation of the constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">1. With respect to the first ground, that the offense is not sufficiently charged\u2014formerly it was .said that the fullest description of an offense, where it even amounted to a legal definition, would not be sufficient without keeping close to the expressions of the statute\u20141 Chitty Cr. Law, 282. This ancient canon, however, is somewhat relaxed at the present day; for the present rule seems to be, that if the variations consist in the introduction or alteration of words purely superfluous and unnecessary, it will not be material, unless the alteration render the whole repugnant to the intent of the statute; in such case, the superfluous words cannot be rejected, 1 Chitty Cr. Law, 280. Now apply this rule to the description of the charge in the present case; the wmrds of the statute are, \u201c It shall not be lawful for any person, \u00e9tc., to make any settlement, or attempt to cultivate,\u201d etc. The charge in the indictment is, \u201c that the defendant did improve, clear, clean up, build houses, plant, cultivate and fence,\u201d etc. Here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>are several superfluous and unnecessary charges; yet I can see no repugnancy to the true intent and meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">2. It is not alleged in the indictment that the defendant is not an Indian, etc. It is laid down in Chitty\u2019s Cr. Law, 284, that if exceptions are stated in the enacting clause, it will be necessary to negative them, in order that the description of the crime may in all respects correspond with the statute ; but that when a statute contains provisos and exceptions in distinct clauses, it is not necessary to state in the indictment that the defendant does not come within the exceptions, or to negative the provisos it contains. Chitty Cr. Law. 283. In the case of King v. Jarvis, 1 Bur., 148, Lord Mansfield says, \u201cit is now settled, by the uniform course of authorities, that the qualifications be all negatively set out.\u201d In the present case, the exception is interwoven with the offense; the language is, \u201cIt shall not be lawful for any person or persons, <em>other than the aforesaid </em>Indians, to make any settlement, or attempt to cultivate,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Suppose the case had been against Susan Nabby, who, it seems, was the Indian proprietor of the land in question, could the prosecution have been successfully sustained without proving that Susan Nabby was a person other than Indian. I apprehend not. So, in the present case, it was necessary, before the state could fix the offense on the defendant, to prove that he was <em>other than an Indian. </em>And his not being an Indian being the very gist of the charge, and absolutely necessary so to be proven, I think it ought to have been so laid in the indictment. And for this defect in the indictment, the judgment below must be reversed. It is not necessary to decide the question raised by the third ground taken in the argument. We will, therefore, not attempt a pacification of the act in question with the several acts of Congress of the United States, nor awake from their slumbers the Indian treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Let the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-7\">Judges Turner, Cage, and Montgomery concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
