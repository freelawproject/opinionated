Miss. Rep., 208.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b36-5\">An indictment for stealing a negro man not called a slaye is insufficient. A trial and acquittal on an indictment for stealing a negro <em>man, </em>is no bar to a subsequent prosecution for stealing a negroman, <em>slave. </em>A conviction or acquittal, or an invalid indictment, is no bar to a second prosecution.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-6\">Turner, J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">It appears by the record, that at the October Term, 1823, of Pike circuit court, the defendant was indicted for stealing a negro man, on which charge he was tried on the plea of not guilty, and acquitted. At the same time he was also indicted for stealing one negro man, <em>slave, </em>named Emanuel, etc., of the goods and chattels of one William B. Heath, etc. On his arraignment, he pleaded a former acquittal for the same offense, to which the state replied <em>nid tiel </em>record of a former acquittal; and the court doubting the law, referred the case to this court, on the issue of <em>nul tid </em>record.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>It appears by the record that the district attorney appeared to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the first indictment, and informed the prisoner and his counsel, that he considered that indictment invalid, and had preferred another, and submitted to them, whether they would risk a trial on the first indictment\u2014whereupon the prisoner and his counsel would not move to quash the-first indictment, but claimed a trial by jury. A trial was had, and verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">I am of opinion that the first indictment was insufficient to warrant a conviction, and on which no sentence could have been passed against the prisoner. It charges the prisoner with hav-iig stolen a negro man, nowhere called a slave in the whole iidictment; and it is obvious that the attorney of the state ained at an indictment under the statute, for stealing a slave. Tie authorities summed up in the first volume of Chitty\u2019s Crim-iml Law, p. 453, etc., show clearly, that a conviction or acquit-talon an invalid indictment, cannot be pleaded in lieu of a second, on subsequent prosecution. Wherefore, let judgment be entered for the state, on the issue joined on the plea of <em>autrefois acqtit; </em>and it is ordered that the cause be remanded for further proeedings in the circuit court of said county of Pike.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
