Did the method of selection of the petit jury violate appellant\u2019s rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">II.

Was the trial, as a whole, fundamentally fair?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Green was presented and indicted on 24 September 1973. The docket entry of 28 September shows that Nanie Green was \u201csurety recognized in the amount of $2,000.00 for his appearance when notified.\u201d Green was arraigned on 3 October. The docket entries under that date read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u201cTraverser arraigned: Rule Plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">Plea \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 and prays a Jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">Trial set for Nov. 19,1973.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">(Select Jury in Clerks Office).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">Bail to continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The transcript contains a statement concerning the arraignment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">\u201cOn Wednesday, October 3, 1974, at 1:30 o\u2019clock, P.M., in the Circuit Court for Talbot County, at Easton, Maryland, before the Honorable Harry E. Clark, Judge, and with Sidney S. Campen, Jr., Esq., the State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County being present, Herman Green, the defendant, was brought into Court and was arraigned by the Clerk reading the indictment and asking the defendant as to his plea, and the defendant pleaded \u2018Not Guilty\u2019, and prayed a Jury trial. The date of November 19, 1974, was selected for the trial of said case, and the defendant was returned to the jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">There is no mention of the selection of a jury. The indictment came on for trial on 19 November. The docket entries under that date read: \u201cTrial before Judge James A. Wise, Ernest J. Gretzinger, Reporter. Jury impanelled and sworn, <em>viz: </em>. . . .\u201d There follows the name of each of the twelve jurors. The transcript of the trial contains the following notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">\u201c (The jury panel had previously been called over by the Clerk of the Court and all were present. Counsel, by stipulation, had selected the jurors they desired to try the case, and the said selected panel of jurors were called to their places in the Jury box.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">The transcript continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-14\">\u201cThe Court: Is the State ready, Mr. Campen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-15\">Mr. Campen [State\u2019s Attorney <em>ad interim </em>for Talbot County]: The State is prepared, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The Court: Is the defense ready?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">Mr. Stafford [Defense Counsel]: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">The Court: Mr. Green, is this panel as now seated in the jury box agreeable to you? Are you satisfied that they shall try this charge against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">The defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">(The traverser had been previously arraigned, pleaded not guilty and elected trial by jury) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">On the premise that he was not present when the twelve members of the jury who tried him were selected, Green claims reversible error. He argues that the selection of the jurors was a part of his trial, and that he had an absolute right to be present at all stages of the trial. Maryland Rule 775; <em>Brown v. State, </em>272 Md. 450; <em>State v. Saul, </em>258 Md. 100; <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26; <em>Saul v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 540. <em>See Smith and Nelson v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Whether the jury was, in fact, selected in the Clerk\u2019s office at some time prior to 19 November, and, if it was, how it was selected, and whether a judge and Green were present, cannot be ascertained from the record before us. In our consideration of an appeal, we must, of course, stay within the record. The record here is not adequate for a determination of the issue presented. Nor can we say, on the state of the record, that if Green was not present when the jury was selected, that he waived his presence. In the light of the little we know about what actually occurred, we would be loath to hold, in the circumstances existent, that Green waived a right he may have had to be present when the jury was selected merely by answering in the affirmative the court\u2019s question whether he was satisfied to have the jury he found in the box try the charge against him. All things considered, we believe that the resolution of the contention as it reaches us here is best left to post conviction procedures, under which there may be a plenary hearing to ascertain exactly what occurred. We observe, however, that we have serious doubt of the propriety of selecting a jury in the Clerk\u2019s office out of the presence of a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In arguing that there was a fatal variance between the allegations in the first count of the indictment and the proof adduced at trial, Green states the issue simply: \u201c[M]ay a person charged with forgery of a check be convicted on evidence showing at most forging of an endorsement to a check? \u201d The State concedes that Green .. is absolutely correct in his statement that he was charged with forging \u2018a certain check or bill of exchange.\u2019 \u201d It admits that \u201c[h]e is also correct in his evaluation of the evidence wherein it was conclusively proven that he had prepared the signature of Robert Thomas on the back of the check but had no part in the preparation of the handwriting on the face of the check.\u201d It agrees that Green\u2019s statement of the question .. precisely focuses the issue . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In the closing argument of the State\u2019s Attorney he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201cLastly counsel would have you believe that even though there was no endorsement or no proof that the defendant forged the face of this check, even though they made him put his name on the back, he had nothing to do with the face of it. I submit to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury that that is not necessary. The law is clear that any person who shall offer, make, forge or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made, forged or counterfeited, or willingly aid or assist in falsely making, forging, altering or counterfeiting any deed, document or affidavit or waiver of release or mechanic\u2019s lien, promissory note for the payment of money or property, and then the next word is important, endorsement or assignment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Green now claims that an endorsement is not part of the instrument upon which it is placed and an allegation that the instrument was forged is not sufficient to charge forgery of the endorsement. He points to Code, Art. 95B, \u00a7\u00a7 3-202, 3-413, 3-414, 3-417. The State acknowledges in its brief that authority is divided on the issue. It found no answer \u201cin any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>single opinion of Maryland\u2019s highest courts or in any local legislative source.\u201d Recognizing that \u201cFrom a commercial perspective, the primary signature and the endorsement are treated as two separate and distinct contracts and are, therefore, regarded as different \u2018instruments\u2019 \u201d, it urges us \u201cto regard the check or \u2018bill of exchange\u2019 as a \u2018single instrument\u2019 for the purposes of applying the Forgery Statute and to leave the Commercial Law in its proper realm where the \u2018separate contract\u2019 theory may be used to dispose of civil disputes in a purely commercial setting.\u201d We do not decide the issue because it is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">There is no question but that the first count of the indictment was sufficient on its face to charge that Green forged the check designated. So the indictment itself is not subject to attack. But the general rule is that matters essential to the charge must be proved as alleged in the indictment. <em>Love and Matthews v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 639, 642. We put it thus in <em>Benjamin v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 373, 375: \u201cIt is, of course, well settled that the evidence in a criminal case must not vary from those allegations in the indictment which are essential and material to the offense charged.\u201d When there is a material variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata, </em>the judgment must be reversed. <em>Melia and Shelhorse v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 354, 363. To preserve the point on appeal, however, it must be seasonably raised below. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 337, 349. It may be so raised by a timely motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>Butina v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 312, 319. The point then becomes a matter of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">At the close of evidence offered by the State, Green sought and was granted a judgment of acquittal as to the second and third counts of the indictment. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Green then testified in his own behalf. The defense rested and the State had no rebuttal. At that point in the trial, after inquiry by the court regarding instructions to the jur;, counsel made their closing arguments. The jury retired at 2:05 P.M., returned at 2:20 P.M. and rendered a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">It is firmly established that this Court may entertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>issue of the sufficiency of the evidence in a case tried before a jury <em>only </em>upon the denial by the lower court of a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of all the evidence. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450, 456. Green never moved for judgment of acquittal as to the first count of the indictment. Even if the motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of evidence offered by the State be deemed to include the first count, that motion was withdrawn by Green when he offered evidence. He did not renew the motion at the close of all the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the matter of the sufficiency of the evidence is not subject to our review on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The question of variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata </em>was not otherwise raised below. The short of it is that the court was not called upon to rule on the point and it simply was not tried and decided at the trial. Rule 1085. We note that defense counsel could have argued contrary to the State\u2019s view had he desired. But he put the matter of Green\u2019s guilt <em>vel non </em>to the jury thus: \u201c [S]o the question before you and you have to decide is that, if you find he did endorse the name of Robert Thomas on the back of that check, is whether he -did it with the intent to defraud somebody of $76.92.1 think the evidence is very weak in this case. I think it is entirely up to you people to decide first if he did endorse the name of Robert Thomas on the back of that check, and if he did, if he did it with the intent of defrauding somebody out of some money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The variance issue not being properly before us; we do not reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Green asserts: \u201cAlbeit inadvertently, the trial was fundamentally unfair to appellant; and he was denied due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He presents two bases for the assertion: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cLack of definition of issue to jury,\u201d and (2) \u201cStatement of State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Green sums up his argument with respect to the first basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201cIn point of absolute, objective fact, the jury was never accurately told what charges had been made against Appellant; was never advised of which charges he had been acquitted by the Court; and with what conduct he must be connected in order to find him guilty. Obviously, the jury felt that Appellant had committed some misconduct; but the record fails to disclose that they had any basis whatsoever for equating the facts which they heard to any conduct proscribed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">He centers on the absence of instructions to the jury by the court and couples that with the lack of arraignment before the jury, reference by the court to \u201cthis charge\u201d, reference by the prosecution in opening argument to \u201cforgery and uttering\u201d, failure of the trial judge to tell the jury that there had been a judicial acquittal of the second and third counts, the statement of defense counsel in argument that there was no evidence of uttering, when at the time that charge, in fact, was not before them, the assertion of the prosecutor in his closing argument that \u201cforgery of the check as alleged in the indictment was equivalent to forgery of an endorsement as referred to in the statute.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak_X\">We believe that the jury were sufficiently aware of what they were called upon to determine, that is, whether Green had forged a certain check. We first note that the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>instructions to the jury was largely the doing of defense counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the defense rested its case and the State indicated it had no rebuttal evidence, defense counsel began his closing argument. The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cThe Court: Wait just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">Mr. Stafford: I thought he waived his opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">The Court: They haven\u2019t been instructed. If anybody is urging \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">Mr. Stafford: I didn\u2019t want any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">The Court: Mr. Campen, do you want the jury . instructed at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">Mr. Campen: No, your Honor. We will allow the Court to instruct the jury if the Court wishes to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">The Court: It is the privilege of counsel to ask for instructions. I don\u2019t in this case insist on it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">Mr. Campen: I have no requests for instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">Mr. Stafford: Nor do I. You are also waiving opening argument, Mr. Campen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">Mr. Campen: I will defer to Mr. Stafford.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Defense counsel resumed his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">It is apparent that the desire of the defense not to have the jury charged by the court was a carefully considered trial tactic. In any event, the closing arguments of counsel adequately apprised the jury of the crime they were to consider. Defense counsel said: \u201c [Y]ou have just one question, as I see it, to decide today, and that is this, whether or not, on the 27th day of June 1973, in Talbot County, with intent then and there to defraud, that he [Green] feloniously did make, forge and counterfeit a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>check.\u201d He then reviewed the evidence on that charge. The State\u2019s Attorney said: \u201c [Y]ou recall at the outset of this case that I indicated to you I was going to produce several witnesses, five in fact, in order to show you that, in fact, Herman Green forged a certain draft drawn on the New Brick and Tile Company.\u201d He then reviewed the evidence so adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We do not believe, in the circumstances, that any of the matters Green now couples with the lack of jury instructions operated to prevent the jury from understanding what they were to determine. We conclude that the trial was not fundamentally unfair and that Green was not denied due process of law by \u201ca lack of definition of issue\u201d to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney concluded his argument in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201c1 am sure, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the endorsement in this case is, in fact, a forged endorsement by the defendant in the case, and I ask for a verdict of guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Green made no objection below. He now points to Ethical Consideration 7-24 under Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by Rule 1230. Canon 7 declares: \u201cA Lawyer Should Represent a Client Zealously Within the Bounds of the Law.\u201d E C 7-24 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cIn order to bring about just and informed decisions, evidentiary and procedural rules have been established by tribunals to permit the inclusion of relevant evidence and argument and the exclusion of all other considerations. The expression by a lawyer of his personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, as to the credibility of a witness, as to the culpability of a civil litigant, or as to the guilt or innocence of an accused is not a proper subject for argument to the trier of fact. It is improper as to factual matters because admissible evidence possessed by a lawyer should be presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>only as sworn testimony. It is improper as to all other matters because, were the rule otherwise, the silence of a lawyer on a given occasion could be construed unfavorably to his client. However, a lawyer may argue, on his analysis of the evidence, for any position or conclusion with respect to any of the foregoing matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We do not think the comment was misleading or so prejudicial to Green as to warrant reversal. Had the prosecutor couched the conclusion in terms of the evidence rather than his personal feelings it would have been perfectly proper. <em>See Witcher v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 426; <em>Ott v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 259; <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We conclude that the trial was neither fundamentally unfair nor was Green denied due process of law by the statement of the prosecutor. We observe again: \u201c \u2018 [A] defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one,\u2019 for there are no perfect trials.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States, </em>411 U. S. 223, 231-232; <em>Burnett v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 550, 554; <em>Shotkosky v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 492, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\n<em>Supplemental Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In appellant\u2019s brief are ten contentions set out at his direction. The 7th, with reference to the selection of the jury, is covered by our discussion of question I. The 6th and 10th concern the sufficiency of the evidence, which we have held under question II to be not properly before us. The 2nd and 9th, involving jury instructions, are disposed of under question III. The 1st \u2014 \u201cDid trial judge err by not letting the jury see the check? \u201d \u2014 and the 5th \u2014 \u201cDid the State err by not having Robert Thomas in court? \u201d \u2014 are based on a misapprehension of fact. The check was submitted to inspection by the jury. The State never asserted the existence of \u201cRobert Thomas\u201d and appellant knew no one of that name. The 4th claims error by the imposition of a sentence of 8 years. The sentence was within the maximum authorized by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 44 and there is no indication it was imposed by any unworthy motive. <em>Bieber v. State, </em>8 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>App. 522, 548. The 8th asks if the court erred in accepting a \u201chandwriting expert\u2019s report? \u201d Corporal Gary Girton of the Maryland State Police was accepted by the court as an expert in the analysis of questioned documents, including handwriting, after a thorough examination of his qualifications. The court did not abuse its discretion in so doing. The handwriting specimens received in evidence were properly admitted. <em>See Sutton v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 70, 73; <em>Spillers v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 643, 648. There was no evidence that the specimens were given involuntarily or otherwise illegally obtained. The 3rd and last to be considered asks if Green received adequate representation at the trial. He did not question his representation below and the matter' is not now before us. <em>White v. State, 17 </em>Md. App. 58, 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We hold that the <em>pro se </em>contentions afford no basis for reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-14\">. The indictment filed against Green consisted of three counts. The first count charged that Green falsely forged a certain check, the second count charged that he caused and procured the check to be forged, and the third count charged that he uttered the check, all in violation of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 44. At the close of evidence offered by the State, the State\u2019s Attorney moved to \u201cdismiss\u201d the third count. At a bench conference in the presence of Green it appeared that the defense sought a judgment of acquittal on both the second and third counts. After discussion the court said, \u201c. . . I shall grant the motion of acquittal on the second and third counts, and submit only the question of direct forgery to the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">. The motion may be made at the close of evidence offered by the State. If it is not then granted, \u201c. . . the accused may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so, but by so doing, he withdraws his motion.\u201d Maryland Rule 755 b.
