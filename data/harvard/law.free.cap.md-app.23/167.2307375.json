(Washington) for specific performance of divers building contracts and for monetary damages for breach of the contracts. The claims of each of the fifty-five individuals alleged, in essence, that each of the plaintiffs had entered into a written contract for the construction of a house at a specified price, and each had obtained a mortgage commitment from a financial institution designated by Washington. The plaintiffs further averred that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>subsequently received a letter from Washington which read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201c . . . [T]he lending institution named by us <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as being the lender designated to make you a first trust loan has informed us that due to present financial mortgage market conditions they will not consummate or make a loan to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Contract of Sale between you and the underwriters, Washington Homes, Inc. exercises its option to cancel and terminate said agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Each letter was accompanied by a check payable to the order of the respective plaintiff in an amount equal to the deposit previously made by the plaintiff. Four of the plaintiff-appellees, Paul R. and Mary June Ehler and Thomas L. and Patricia A. Krouse, \u201ccashed\u201d their refund checks. None of the other plaintiffs, however, did so. The plaintiffs, after obtaining mortgage commitment from other lending institutions, demanded that Washington perform in accordance with the contract of sale. Washington declined to do so and this litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The basis of the claim for breach is that, as a result of what the plaintiffs pereeive to be Washington\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs were required to incur \u201cdamages including but not limited to damages for the loss of the benefit of the contract, and the necessity of financing their homes at a higher interest rate.\u201d The Chancellor, as a result of a pretrial conference, ordered that the trial be bifurcated with the question of specific performance to be decided first, and the damage suits to be reserved for resolution at a later time. As of the date that this matter was heard on oral argument, the damage suits had not been litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Following a trial, Judge James C. Mitchell decreed specific performance of the contracts in each of the cases. Washing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ton entered a timely appeal to this Court, pursuant to the provisions of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-303 (c) (5). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cA party may appeal from any of the following interlocutory orders entered by a circuit court in a civil case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(c) an order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(5) For the sale, conveyance, or delivery of real or personal property or the payment of money, or the refusal to rescind or discharge such an order, unless the delivery or payment is directed to be made to a receiver appointed by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Of course, the right of appeal of the interlocutory orders set forth in Courts Art. \u00a7 12-303 is not affected by Md. Rule 605 a. <em>See Funger v. Mayor of Somerset, </em>244 Md. 141, 223 A. 2d 168 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Washington posted a supersedeas bond, Md. Rule 1017, as to the Ehlers and the Krouses, and this stayed the execution of those specific performance decrees. No such bond, however, was posted as to the other plaintiff-appellees. Six of the successful plaintiffs, after the entry of a decree, abandoned their rights, and those cases have been voluntarily dismissed. We are left, therefore, with forty-nine appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The appellees have filed a motion to dismiss Washington\u2019s appeal pursuant to Md. Rule 1035 b (7) on the ground that the specific performance litigation, with the exception of the cases of Ehler and Krouse, is moot. It is alleged in the motion, and candidly acknowledged on oral argument by Washington, that Washington had, in fact, complied with the decrees of the Circuit Court for Charles County in all cases except those of Ehler and Krouse. Washington stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>its argument that it complied with the specific performance decrees because the cost of posting supersedeas bonds, in all of the cases, was prohibitive. Notwithstanding full compliance with the decrees, Washington asserts that the matters are not moot, and even though the houses have been built, settlements had and the properties conveyed by Washington to forty-five of the appellees, we should, nevertheless, reverse the decrees and order the properties restored to Washington.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It appears to us, as a result of what we were told on oral argument, that Washington seeks to have us decide, at least tangentially, the issue of damages still pending before the trial court. It is equally apparent that Washington seeks to have the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Washington elected to comply with the court decrees rather than post supersedeas bonds. By their own actions they have mooted the issues. There is nothing remaining for this Court to decide as to forty-five of the appellees. This Court does not sit in order to decide abstract or moot questions of law. Md. Rule 1035 b (7). <em>See also Banner v. Home Sales Co., </em>201 Md. 425, 94 A. 2d 264 (1953): <em>Montgomery Co. v. Metropolitan Dis., </em>200 Md. 525, 92 A. 2d 350 (1952); <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 37 A. 2d 880 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Furthermore, we do not decide questions which have not been raised and decided by the trial court. Md. Rule 1085. Therefore, we shall refrain from commenting directly or indirectly upon the merits, if any, of the pending damage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The motion of appellees to dismiss Washington\u2019s appeal, as to all appellees except the Ehlers and the Krouses, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">We turn now to a discussion of the Ehler and Krouse cases. Washington contends that when they returned the deposits to Ehler and Krouse, and those persons accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and negotiated the checks, Washington\u2019s obligation under the Ehler and Krouse contracts ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The bill of complaint filed on behalf of the Ehlers states that after receiving notification on September 21, 1973 from Washington of the cancellation of the contract, the Ehlers obtained \u201cprior to October 4, 1973 a loan commitment, and forwarded the commitment, as well as the deposit check . . . to ... Washington. .. .\u201d The record, however, does not support their allegations. With respect to the testimony of Mr. Ehler,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the record states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201cQ. Did there come a time that Washington Homes wrote you a letter and you say returned your check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Q. Is that your check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">A. That is the check. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Q. And that is the check returning deposit to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">A. That is the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">Q. And you cashed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">A. Yes, I did. It is in my savings account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-14\">Q. So at the moment you have no deposit up at all with Washington Homes or anyone else for that matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-15\">A. No. According to them, I never did anyhow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-16\">Q. Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-17\">A. According to Mr. Harnett, it probably never had one anyhow. The way it looks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-18\">Q. But the contract in which you protected yourself, did call for a $500.00 deposit for you ' to put up with Washington Homes, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-19\">A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-20\">Q. And Washington Homes refunded that $500.00 deposit to you, did they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>A. They done it. I don\u2019t know if it was done legally, rightfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Q. But you took it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Mr. Krouse <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cQ. You received from Washington Homes the deposit check of a thousand dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">Q. That was remitted to you with the letter from Washington Homes notifying you of the cancellation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">A. Yes, sir, it was. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">Q. And you kept that deposit check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">A. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">Q. And you cashed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-15\">A. I put it in my savings account, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-16\">Q. So there is no consideration with Washington Homes at the moment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-17\">MR. LOYD: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgXh\">BY MR. NUSSBAUM:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-18\">Q. Does Mr. \u2014 Does Washington Homes have any of your money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-19\">A. Any of my money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-20\">Q. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-21\">A. Not to my knowledge, no, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">A prerequisite for specific performance is the existence of an enforceable contract. In <em>Tarses v. Miller Fruit &amp; Produce Co., </em>155 Md. 448, 142 A. 522 (1928), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[S]pecific performance will not be decreed of a contract which the parties [have] abandoned.\u201d 6 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 1140 (1962); 71 Am.Jur.2d <em>Specific Performance, </em>\u00a7 13 (1973). The issue here is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>cashing of the deposit checks by Ehler and Krouse operated as an accord and satisfaction. If an accord and satisfaction is found, the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the contract are discharged. If the contract was terminated, there can be no specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Mercantile T. </em>&amp; <em>D. Co. v. Rode, </em>137 Md. 362, 112 A. 574 (1921) quoted with approval 1 R.C.L. 195 where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cTo constitute an accord and satisfaction in law ... it is necessary that the offer of money be made in full satisfaction of the demand or claim of the creditor, and be accompanied by such acts or declarations as amount to a condition that if the money is accepted, it is to be in full satisfaction and \u25a0 of such a character that the creditor is bound to understand the offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Professor Corbin, in his treatise on the law of contracts (Vol. 6, \u00a7 1277) puts it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">\u201c . . . There must be accompanying expressions sufficient to make the creditor understand, or to make it unreasonable for him not to understand, that the performance is offered to him as full satisfaction of his claim and not otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">In <em>Palladi Realty Co. v. Ohlinger, </em>190 Md. 303, 58 A. 2d 125 (1948) the Court of Appeals considered a case involving facts similar to the case at bar. There Palladi, in a written contract with Ohlinger, agreed to sell to Ohlinger a property on West Hills Parkway in Baltimore County, Maryland, and to erect a house thereon. The contract reserved the right in Palladi to cancel the agreement if \u201cpresent prices for material\u201d and wages for labor \u201cincreased prior to the date of settlement.\u201d Palladi exercised the right because of increased costs. A letter was sent by Palladi to Ohlinger advising Ohlinger of the increase in the cost of building materials and the cancellation of the contract. The deposit money was returned to Ohlinger along with the letter. The letter was not answered by Ohlinger, and the check was not returned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Slightly less than one month later, Ohlinger filed a Bill of Complaint and requested specific performance of the contract. The check was endorsed by Ohlinger and delivered to the clerk of the court who, in turn, deposited it. Ultimately, the check was paid by the bank upon which it was drawn and charged to Palladi\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Six judges of the Court of Appeals heard the case and were unable to agree. Three judges were of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201c . . . [T]he use made of the check constituted an acceptance of the conditions upon which it was tendered, even though this was contrary to the intention of [Ohlinger]. The other three [were] equally firm in their view that the deposit of the check <em>in court </em>in the case in which [Ohlinger was] attempting to enforce the contract was not a tortious exercise of dominion over [Palladi\u2019s] money.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">None of the judges said that the acceptance of the check did not constitute an accord and satisfaction. The division of opinion in the <em>Palladi </em>case was centered around the manner in which the check was cashed. We glean from the above quoted language that had the check been cashed other than by the method employed, <em>i.e., </em>by endorsing it over to the clerk of the court, that the decision of the Court of Appeals would have been to the effect that the contract was terminated. It is only the peculiar manner in which Ohlinger negotiated the check, representing a deposit of the refund, that caused the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In the case now before us there was no endorsement of the check to the clerk of the court; rather the checks were deposited into the respective accounts of Ehler and Krouse. Both <em>Mercantile Trust v. Rode, supra, </em>and <em>Palladi Realty Co. v. Ohlinger, supra, </em>are in accord with 6 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 1279 (1962) wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">\u201cThe cashing, or the certification, of a check expressly sent in full settlement of a disputed claim, operates as an accord and satisfaction if, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the time, no word of dissent is sent to the party offering it in satisfaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>See also </em>15 S. Williston, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 1854 (3d ed. 1972) which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cAs a matter of law, the use or retention of the check by the. creditor, with knowledge of the condition, is regarded as an assent to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">It is indubitable that Washington sent letters of cancellation to the Ehlers and the Krouses in which it is explicit that Washington considered the contracts to be terminated. The letters were accompanied by checks expressly stated to be a refund of the deposit monies. In our view, when the Ehlers and the Krouses, who did not communicate immediately their dissatisfaction with the cancellation and refund, cashed the checks, they accepted the cancellation, and the contractual relationship between them and Washington was at an end. The contracts ceased to exist, and inasmuch as there were no contracts, there could be no breach and no consequent remedy of specific performance. The Chancellor erred in ordering specific performance, by Washington, as to the Ehlers and Krouses. We, therefore, reverse those two decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\n<em>All appeals except as to the Ehlers and the Krouses, dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\n<em>Decree ordering specific performance as to the Ehlers, reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\n<em>Decree ordering specific performance as to the Krouses, reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Washington Homes, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\">.

Washington acknowledges that it should be required to pay back to the appellees the purchase price. Washington would then be at liberty to sell the houses to the appellees, or to other purchasers, presumably at today\u2019s inflated prices. Just what effect the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>would have as to the present mortgages is not made clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-21\">.
