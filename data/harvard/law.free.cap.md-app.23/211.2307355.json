Evidence was adduced at trial from which the jury could have found the following facts:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">At approximately noon on December 13, 1972, Noel Corkran held up the Monument Street branch of the Provident Savings Bank in Baltimore and escaped (momentarily) with $2,568.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Corkran had known appellant during a period of about three weeks in Washington, D. C., where appellant lived; there the two men \u201cdrank together several times and also visited some girls together several times.\u201d They were again together in Baltimore on the evening before the robbery. On one occasion during the week prior to December 13 appellant was seen in Read\u2019s Drugstore on Monument Street, directly across from the Provident Savings Bank. Corkran and appellant were again together in the drugstore shortly before the robbery. At about the time Corkran entered the bank appellant hailed a cab and was double parked in front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of the bank when Corkran emerged and entered the back seat with appellant. As the cab moved off down the street Corkran was observed to hand \u201csomething\u201d to appellant. Remarkably, the two men were heard by the taxi driver to say nothing to one another during-the brief ride before the cab was stopped by police and they were arrested. An immediate search of appellant\u2019s person recovered $1,043.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">At trial appellant\u2019s defense was that his involvement in the crime did not extend beyond mere unwitting presence at the scene; that, to his surprise, he was handed a wad of bills by Corkran in the cab which he pocketed only after emphatically stating he did not want them; that he had not met Corkran until the night before the robbery at a bar, had merely accompanied him across town the following morning and was only obeying Corkran\u2019s instruction to hail a cab and wait outside the bank while Corkran accomplished \u201csome business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellant advances the somewhat imaginative, but ultimately specious argument, that while evidence of his prior actions including his acquaintance with Corkran \u201cmight conceivably be offered as proof of an accessory before the fact (had appellant been charged as such and the jury accordingly instructed) it is difficult to see how it assists in showing what Huff did during the time of the robbery.\u201d Even more directly he contends that his conduct after the robbery, including his acceptance of a portion of the money, was evidence of a separate offense (receiving) \u201cand cannot properly be used to bolster the evidence of Huff\u2019s participation in the robbery.\u201d Tibe result, he urges, is that we are left with his bare presence at or near the scene of the crime, and such presence is by all authority insufficient to make one a principal in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">It is, of course, settled that on an indictment charging one with a felony as a principal there can be no conviction on evidence showing he was merely an accessory, <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 278 (1967), but the principal differs from the accessory before the fact only in the requirement of presence, Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d ed. 1969) p. 658, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>fail to see why evidence of appellant\u2019s actions prior to the robbery may not properly shed light upon his intent in being present at the perpetration of the crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cA person is constructively present, hence guilty as a principal, if he is acting with the person who actually commits the deed in pursuance of a common design, and is aiding his associate, either by keeping watch or otherwise, or is so situated as to be able to- aid him, with a view, known to the other, to insure success in the accomplishment of the common enterprise.\u201d Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>(7th ed. 1967) p. 509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Appellant\u2019s prior association with Corkran, the fact that he was with him on the eve of the robbery and his presence in the immediate vicinity of the crime during the preceding week were evidence of his presence at the crime \u201cin pursuance of a common design\u201d or to aid his associate by keeping watch or otherwise. His behavior subsequent to the crime \u2014 his silent acceptance of the money in the taxi \u2014 was evidence of the same fact notwithstanding its relevance as well to the lesser offense of receiving. In <em>Foster v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 40 (1971), reversed on other grounds, <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388 (1971), Chief Judge Murphy, in discussing the meaning of accomplice participation, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201c. . . we think the trier of fact is entitled to take into consideration <em>all the attendant circumstances surrounding the presence of a witness at the crime scene </em>in determining whether the witness is an accomplice, [citations omitted] That a witness, alleged to be an accomplice, testifies to facts exculpating himself from any connection with or involvement in the crime does not mean that the jury is obliged to believe him. His relation to the crime is a question for determination by the jury where there is evidence, or rational inferences from evidence, from which the jury could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>conclude that the witness was an accomplice, [citations omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In <em>Foster </em>the \u201cattendant circumstances\u201d included the conduct of the alleged accomplice before and after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We conclude that the evidence showed directly or supported a rational inference of facts from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant participated, as a principal in the second degree, in the bank robbery. <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The counts charging appellant with armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, receiving stolen goods and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony were submitted to the jury in the form of a sheet listing \u201cpossible verdicts\u201d which indicated the order in which the charges were to be considered. Specifically the jury was instructed to consider conspiracy first, then armed robbery. Whether it found appellant guilty or not guilty on the latter count, it was to consider use of a handgun. On the other hand only upon a verdict of not guilty as to armed robbery was it to consider, lastly, the count of receiving stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">After deliberating some three hours the jury returned to announce that it had agreed on a verdict of guilty of receiving but was divided on the other counts. In a bench conference the court determined to inquire whether the jury felt it could still reach a verdict \u201cat least as to conspiracy\u201d or whether it was hopelessly divided. Questioning to this effect led the court to conclude, and both counsel concurred, that the conspiracy and armed robbery counts were intertwined in the jury\u2019s thinking and this confusion was the primary impediment to a final verdict on the two counts. The court thereupon instructed the jury, over defense objection, on the separate and distinct nature of the offenses, following this with a version of the <em>Allen </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Appellant contends that by omitting to instruct the jury at this time that a finding of guilty of receiving precluded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>finding of guilty of robbery the court coerced the jury \u201cto either return an improper, inconsistent verdict of guilty to both armed robbery and receiving stolen goods or to reverse itself and find the defendant guilty of armed robbery and not guilty of receiving stolen goods.\u201d In other words the jury was not advised \u201cthat a decision on the conspiracy charge, together with what had already been decided, would terminate the case.\u201d We disagree with appellant\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">First, there can be no question of the propriety of the court\u2019s initial inquiry whether the jury\u2019s division on conspiracy was insurmountable. When it then became apparent that the indecision on both the conspiracy and robbery counts reflected the jury\u2019s confusion as to the law separating the offenses, the court was clearly within its right in returning the jury to deliberation with the instruction to consider these offenses separately. The question is, then, whether it should have simultaneously reminded the jury what \u201chad already been decided\u201d and that a verdict of guilty as to receiving precluded a like verdict as to robbery. We think clearly not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The verdict on the receiving count was not, to begin with, a perfected verdict since the procedure of harkening had not yet taken place.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Givens v. State, </em>76 Md. 485 (1893) the Court of Appeals referred with approval to <em>Commonwealth v. Gibson, </em>2 Va. Cas. 70, where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201cit was held, that after the verdict is rendered by the jury and read in open court, it is the duty of the clerk to direct the jury to \u2018hearken to their verdict as the court hath recorded it, and if none of the jury express their dissent the verdict stands as recorded\u2019; that until the assent of the jury is expressed in this way, or by a poll, the jury has a right to retract; and <em>that the verdict is not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>perfected until after the jury has expressed their assent in one of these ways.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] <em>See also Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Moreover it is apparent, we think, that the combination of the jury\u2019s stated failure to reach a verdict on robbery <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> combined with a guilty verdict on receiving, left unremedied, would have meant an inconsistent verdict since, as the jury had been correctly instructed, it could find appellant guilty of receiving only if it found him not guilty of robbery. <em>See Heinze v. State, supra </em>at 617. On the other hand to send the jury back with the instruction, in effect, that reconsideration of its verdict on the receiving count was foreclosed would, for the same reason, tend to compel a finding of not guilty as to armed robbery. We think the court\u2019s reinstruction, rather than coercing the jury to reach an inconsistent verdict or to reverse itself, permitted it to achieve a free and final verdict as to <em>all </em>the counts submitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Appellant also perceives error in the court\u2019s response when the jury returned to the courtroom a second time with a request to the court to \u201cplease clarify the definition of armed robbery. Can a man be guilty of armed robbery if he is in the car but without a gun?\u201d The court instructed the jury again on the law of principals, in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cThe law has what we call principals in the first degree and principals in the second degree. They are both equally guilty. A principal in the first degree is the person who actually uses a gun to hold up a teller and take money from that teller. That person is the principal in the first degree. However, if there is another person who is either present on the scene, or even if not present on the scene, is so close in proximity to the bank so that that person is assisting the man in the bank with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the gun to perform the holdup by means of preventing surprise, helping him get away, or acting in a common, concerted way to achieve a concerted objective, then he would be what we call a principal in the second degree and he is just as guilty as the man who uses the gun inside the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201cThe matter of whether or not this defendant is a principal in the second degree <em>is a matter for the jury to determine. </em>The State contends that he is a principal in the second degree, that he did participate in the armed robbery even though he didn\u2019t use the gun. The defense says that he not only didn\u2019t participate, but that he wasn\u2019t there for any purpose in cooperation with the man inside the bank. I say to the jury, and I instruct the jury, that <em>if </em>they find from the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant was in that taxicab for the purpose of assisting Mr. Cocoran inside that bank to commit this armed robbery, <em>if </em>he was there to prevent surprise or to assist in the getaway of both of them, <em>if </em>you find beyond a reasonable doubt he was present there in order to achieve common goal for both of them, namely the robbery of that bank, then you should find the defendant guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon. But, mere presence at the scene of a crime without anything more is not enough by itself to make him a participant. So, in conclusion, you may determine from all of the facts whether or not you find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was present constructively in order to assist in that armed robbery. <em>If </em>you do, you should find him guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon. <em>If </em>you have a reasonable doubt in your mind as to any of these elements I have just spelled out, you should find him not guilty.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Appellant argues that this instruction incorporated \u201cthe facts of this case with the added assumption that the man in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the cab was in fact assisting the man in the bank\u201d and was thus tantamount to a directed verdict of guilty based on appellant\u2019s participation as a principal. We note, first, that no objection was raised below to the particular form of this instruction and absent a showing of plain error the matter is not properly before us. Maryland Rule 756 g. Second, we discern no material difference between this instruction and the one given earlier by the court on the same subject, as to which appellant also registered no objection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, we are satisfied that the court\u2019s references to the facts of the case were sufficiently hedged about with the hypothetical \u201cif\u201d and bracketed by the reminder that appellant\u2019s status as a principal <em>vel non </em>was \u201ca matter for the jury to determine,\u201d so as to foreclose the real possibility of prejudice. We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in the wording and detail of its instruction. <em>Mills v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 449 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Appellant cites as an additional instance of the court\u2019s coercion of the jury its refusal twice to permit the jury to be fed prior to sending it back for further deliberation. Some seven hours elapsed between the time the jury returned from lunch and the second and final time it was sent back to the jury room. At no time did the jury indicate to the court that it was hungry or that it was otherwise adversely affected by the length and circumstances of the deliberation. We find no support in the record for the view that the jury \u201cwas effectively instructed that it would receive no succor until it had reached a \u2018proper\u2019 verdict.\u201d The determination of when to interrupt jury deliberation for food or rest is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and that discretion was not abused here. <em>See Stewart v. State, supra </em>at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Appellant objects to certain questioning by the court of Noel Corkran, called as a defense witness, following his interrogation by the parties. The challenged questioning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cQ And you did so approach him [appellant] and did he in fact lead you to someone who would sell you drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">A No. He told me to ask somebody else in the bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Q Did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">Q Did you obtain drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">Q Heroin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">A Not in the bar, no. I had to leave the bar. Why I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">Q Heroin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">Q And then you fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">Q Tell the jury what firing means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-17\">A Means injecting drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">Q Into your vein?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-19\">A You put it in a cap or spoon or something, cook it, draw it up and inject into veins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-20\">Q And then you returned from wherever that was back to the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-21\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-22\">Q When you went and fired, was the Defendant with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-23\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-24\">Q Where did you fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-25\">MRS. BOTHE: I object to this line of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-26\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-27\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-28\">Q Where did you fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-29\">A In a shooting gallery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Q How far away? I don\u2019t need to know the address. How far away from the bar you returned to?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant argues that it was wrong <em>per se </em>for the trial judge to ask questions \u201cwhich tend to impeach the testimony of a witness,\u201d and that the resulting admission of testimony tending to show appellant\u2019s involvement in other criminal activity was also error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We note, however, with respect to the latter contention, that appellant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity, <em>i.e., </em>a drug transaction along with Corkran, had already been inquired into on cross-examination without defense objection. There the State asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cQ Didn\u2019t you and Mr. Huff go together on December 12th somewhere and buy drugs together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">A Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Q What time of day was that? When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">A In the evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">Q After you left the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">A Before we went to the bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">Q I thought you testified you met Mr. Huff at the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">A I did. I mean before I did any drinking in the bar I went in and he went in there. I told him I was going to get something, so I went and got drugs, fired, come back and started drinking again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">Q So, your testimony is you went up to a man you never met and asked him about buying drugs and left and bought drugs with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">A The thing is, this might be hard for you to understand, and isn\u2019t too many white people that go in the ghetto and the few that do go there and live in the ghetto and associate continually with black people have a lot better understanding of them than the people that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>don\u2019t. So, like you can usually recognize a person and same as anybody else you can recognize a person that have knowledge of such things and people that don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Appellant\u2019s objection, therefore, would appear to be that the detail of the court\u2019s questioning was unnecessary and inflammatory. We are inclined to agree that the court should have omitted inquiry into the type of drug and the mechanics of \u201cfiring.\u201d We note, on the other hand, that it was the witness who had first used the word \u201cfired,\u201d and the jury was entitled to at least a shorthand explanation of the term. Moreover we credit the court\u2019s explanation for the line of inquiry when he explained, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his [the witness\u2019s] drug situation. I\u2019m interested in his testimony he fired alone or \u2018we fired.\u2019 \u201d Corkran\u2019s previous testimony on this point was not entirely unambiguous and in view of the insistence by both men that appellant was an innocent bystander of the robbery, some inquiry by the court into the intimacy of their association on the evening beforehand was legitimate. While the court\u2019s questioning may have had the additional effect of somewhat impeaching Corkran\u2019s testimony (whose involvement with drugs, however, was also in evidence) we think it remained within the bounds of an effort to obtain a proper understanding and clarification of his testimony and to assure that the full facts were brought out. <em>See Jefferies v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 630 (1969); <em>King v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 385 (1972). A judge\u2019s right to ask questions is not confined to questions which have no possible bearing on credibility. <em>Madison v. State, </em>200 Md. 1, 12 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-16\">. At the close of testimony his motion for acquittal as to charges of attempted robbery, robbery, assault with intent to rob, assault and larceny was granted. Counts charging armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, receiving stolen goods and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony were submitted to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\">. Appellant concedes in his brief that despite his formulation of the third issue it must be treated, if at all, as an attack upon the sufficiency of the entire evidence rather than the evidence presented during the State\u2019s case in chief, inasmuch as appellant, by himself presenting evidence, withdrew his motion for judgment of acquittal previously made. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 755 (b); Martin v. State, 10 Md. App. 274 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-13\">. Corkran pleaded guilty to the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>. </em>Appellant\u2019s reliance on Pugh v. State, 271 Md. 701, 319 A. 2d 542 (1974) is thus misplaced since in Pugh the <em>trial judge </em>rendered an intentional verdict of not guilty which was <em>eo instante </em>perfected. The verdict of a jury in a criminal case, on the other hand, has no effect in law until it is recorded and finally accepted by the court, Heinze, <em>supra </em>at 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. Not to be confused with <em>jury silence </em>as to a charge, which is equivalent to a verdict of not guilty. <em>See </em>Stewart v. State, 4 Md.
