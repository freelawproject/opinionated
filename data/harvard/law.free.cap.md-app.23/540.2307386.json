Judge Matthew S. Evans, convicted Thurman Alexander Moore of rape (Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 461) and kidnapping of a child under the age of sixteen years (Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 338).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Briefly stated, the factual situation out of which the appellant\u2019s convictions arose began at approximately 5 P.M. on April 30, 1973. At that time the prosecutrix, then age eleven, was riding her bicycle in Clarksville, Howard County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> en route to her girlfriend\u2019s house. Moore stopped the automobile that he was operating and asked the young victim for directions to Ellicott City. After she had told him the route, he suggested that she get into the car and show him the way, and that he would then return her to Clarksville. When she demurred on the ground that she was not allowed to enter motor vehicles of strange persons, Moore told her to get into the car or he would \u201cslit her throat\u201d. The prosecutrix entered the vehicle and was driven to the vicinity of an abandoned farmhouse located off of a dirt road. The prosecutrix and Moore exited the car, and she walked in front of him toward some bushes. Michael H. Schultheis and his girlfriend, who were looking for property in Howard County, happened to be at the location where Moore parked his car. When Moore and the prosecutrix walked past Schultheis\u2019s car, Moore \u201csort of waved\u201d at Schultheis, and the prosecutrix looked \u201cscared\u201d. Schultheis\u2019s attention was focused on Moore and' the girl because Moore is a six foot tall black man and the prosecutrix a small, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>eleven-year old white child. After Moore and the prosecutrix had disappeared into the bushes, Schultheis sent his girlfriend to seek the police, and he flagged a truck and explained what he suspected. The driver of the truck parked in such a manner as to block egress of Moore\u2019s vehicle. The police arrived as Moore and the prosecutrix were exiting the bushes. In response to a policeman\u2019s question to the prosecutrix as to whether everything was all right, she said \u201cNo\u201d, and related to the officer that she had been ravished.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Appellant argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cThe evidence produced was not sufficient to support a finding of guilt under Article 27, Section 338 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and the lower court was in error when it failed to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the charge of kidnapping and when it improperly instructed the jury as to the nature of the kidnapping charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">A short history of the Maryland kidnapping law is necessary to a decision on this contention. IV W. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries, </em>* 219 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201c . . . <em>[K]id7iapping, </em>being the forcible abduction or stealing away of a man, woman, or child from their own country and sending them into another, was capital by the Jewish law; \u2014 \u2018He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\u2019 So, likewise, in the civil law the offense of spiriting away and stealing men and children, which was called <em>plagium </em>and the offenders <em>plagiarii, </em>was punished with death. This is unquestionably a very heinous crime, as it robs the king of his subjects, banishes a man from his country, and may in its consequences be productive of the most cruel and disagreeable hardships; therefore the common law of England <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>has punished it with fine, imprisonment, and pillory.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (1867) provides that the \u201c[inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England\u201d as it existed on July 4, 1776 whenever the common law has not been revised, amended, or repealed by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The first alteration in the common law definition of kidnapping occurred as the result of the enactment of ch. 138, \u00a7 4 [1809] Laws of Maryland. That law provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201c10th. Every person, his or her counsellors, aiders or abettors, who shall be duly convicted of the crime of kidnapping, and forcibly or fraudulently carrying, or causing to be carried out of this state, any free person, or any person entitled to freedom at or after a certain age, period or contingency, or of arresting and imprisoning any free person, or any person entitled to freedom at or after a certain age, period or contingency, knowing such person to be free, or entitled to their freedom, as aforesaid, with intent to have such person carried out of this state, shall be sentenced to undergo a confinement in the . . . penitentiary . . . for . . . not less than two nor more than ten years. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Subsequent changes thereafter occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 337 as it appeared at the time of the offense provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201cEvery person, his counsellors, aiders or abettors, who shall be convicted of the crime of kidnapping and forcibly or fraudulently carrying or causing to be carried out of or within this State any person, except in the case of a minor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by a parent thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>with intent to have such person carried out of or within this State, or with the intent to have such person concealed within the State or without the State, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be sentenced to death or to the penitentiary for not more than thirty years, in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In 1819 the legislature enacted a special statute relative to children under the age of sixteen years. At that time the General Assembly passed ch. 132, entitled \u201cAn Act to punish the offense of Kidnapping White Children\u201d. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\"><em>\u201cBe it, enacted, by the General Assembly of Maryland, </em>That every person, his or her counsellors, aiders or abettors, who shall be duly convicted of kidnapping, and forcibly or fraudulently stealing, taking or carrying away, any white child or children under the age of sixteen years, shall be sentenced to undergo a confinement in the penitentiary for a period of time not less than five years, nor more than twelve years, there to be treated as the law directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The racial aspect of the statute was deleted in 1888 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so that the law proscribed the \u201ctaking or carrying away\u201d, by means of force or fraud, <em>any </em>child.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Thereafter, the statute underwent a series of amendments <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which dealt with the prescribed penalty only. Laws 1935, ch. 284, added the death penalty for violation thereof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 338, the present successor to Laws 1819, ch. 132, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cEvery person, his counsellors, aiders or abettors, who shall be convicted of kidnapping and forcibly or fraudulently stealing, taking or carrying away any child under the age of sixteen years, except by a parent thereof, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be sentenced to death or to the penitentiary for not more than thirty years, in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Because \u00a7 338 does not contain the language found in \u00a7 337, <em>viz., </em>\u201ccarrying or causing to be carried out of or within this State,\u201d appellant postulates that the common law, as set forth above, in IV W. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>* 219, has not been changed, and that insofar as the kidnapping of a child under the age of sixteen is concerned, it is mandatory that the prosecution show that the victim was removed to another country. Moore argues that the failure to include the language \u201ccarried out of or within the State\u201d, in \u00a7 338, is a legislative oversight<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requiring reversal of the conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">When the General Assembly in 18\u00cd9 enacted ch. 132 it certainly was cognizant of its passage of the 1809 modification of common law kidnapping. The 1809 legislative modification changed the requirement that a person be shown to have been removed from the country to a showing that he was \u201ccarried out of this state\u201d. Significantly, removal from the State was not an element of the kidnapping of a child if the prosecution was instituted under ch. 132, [1819] Laws of Maryland. A cardinal principle of statutory construction is that if the legislature has \u201cintimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>163 F. 30, 32 (C.A.l, 1908). <em>See also Brocker Mfg. v. Mashburn, </em>17 Md. App. 327, 301 A. 2d 501 (1973). We think that the legislative intent was to create a special statute for the protection of children and to proscribe the forcible or fraudulent taking or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>carrying away of a child from his or her parent, custodian or guardian regardless of whether the child was asported beyond the territorial confines of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Although the legislature subsequently amended \u00a7 337 so as to embrace within the crime of kidnapping not only interstate, but intrastate forcible or fraudulent asportation of persons, it was not necessary to amend \u00a7 338 in a similar fashion. No amendment to \u00a7 338 was needed because the original enactment in 1819 of ch. 132, as we construe it, made it unlawful for anyone in this State to take by force or fraud any child under the age of sixteen years and to transport that child to any place within or without the State. Thus it is not necessary for the State to prove, under \u00a7 338, that the child was transported outside the geographical boundaries of Maryland. If the State evidences that the child was taken by force or fraud and then transported, by the accused, such a showing is sufficient to sustain the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Moore further argues that the State did not demonstrate the distance that the victim was transported. The record does reveal, however, that the child was forced by threat of serious bodily harm to enter Moore\u2019s vehicle and was then driven from Clarksville to another location. Appellant\u2019s contention is without merit. \u201cIt is the fact of asportation and not the distance which is controlling.\u201d R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7 at 177 (2d ed. 1953). In <em>State v. Ayres, </em>198 Kansas 467, 426 P. 2d 21 (1967), the Kansas Court held that a woman who was compelled at the point of a gun to leave her companion\u2019s car and enter the vehicle of an abductor was kidnapped even though the actual distance travelled was eleven feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Appellant also declares that \u00a7 338 and its ancestors are in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. We have so construed it. The purpose of \u00a7 338, as set forth above, is transpicuous and \u201cno rule of construction precludes giving a natural meaning\u201d to this legislation. Section 338 must, in the light of its history, be interpreted to effectuate its purpose. <em>Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, </em>343 U. S. 779, 72 S. Ct. 1011, 96 L.Ed.2d 1294 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">We hold that Judge Evans did not err in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>instruct the jury that in order for appellant to be convicted of violating \u00a7 338, the State was required to prove that the victim had been \u201ccarried out of the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Moore next claims that the kidnapping and rape charges merged. He propounds the view that his act of \u201ctransporting the girl [was] for one reason and that was the furtherance of rape or other sexual activity and not for the purpose of kidnapping.\u201d To bolster his argument, Moore relies upon <em>People v. Levy, </em>15 N.Y.2d 159, 256 N.Y.S.2d 793, 204 N.E.2d 842 (1965). In that case the court reversed a kidnapping conviction on the ground that the charge merged with a robbery conviction. The victims had been forced at gun point into the accused\u2019s vehicle which was driven aimlessly for twenty-seven blocks. The time consumed by the drive was twenty minutes. During that period the victims were robbed of jewelry and wallet. The Court of Appeals of New York held that the restraint on the victims was an integral part of the robbery. Similar holdings are found in <em>People v. Lombardi, </em>20 N.Y.2d 266, 282 N.Y.S.2d 519, 229 N.E.2d 206 (1967) and <em>People v. King, </em>26 A.D.2d 832, 273 N.Y.S.2d 925 (1966). This Court, speaking through Judge Thompson in <em>Rice v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 552, 267 A. 2d 261 (1970), rejected the New York rule on the basis of its conflict with \u201ca majority of the courts, 17 A.L.R.2d 1003 and . . . with the Maryland doctrine of merger . . . \u201d as set forth in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 565, 569, 244 A. 2d 452 (1968), wherein we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe true test of merger under the modern doctrine is whether one crime necessarily involves the other, <em>viz., </em>when the facts necessary to prove the lesser offense are essential ingredients in establishing the greater offense, the lesser offense is merged into the greater offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We decline to depart from our holding in <em>Rice, </em>and we again specifically reject the New York rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">In the instant case the asportation of the victim, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>appellant\u2019s having forced her into the vehicle, established the crime of kidnapping. It was a separate and distinct offense from the rape. The facts necessary to show the kidnapping were not \u201cessential ingredients\u201d of the rape. There was no merger, and the trial judge was correct in denying a requested instruction relative thereto. <em>Hunt v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 286, 278 A. 2d 637 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Next, Moore perceives error because Judge Evans \u201crefused to instruct the jury that their function was not that of seeking retribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">This alleged error arises as a result of the rebuttal argument to the jury by the State\u2019s Attorney. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cThe State of Maryland is everybody . . . you, is everybody . . . [the prosecutrix], and the purpose of the Criminal Law you requested . . . don\u2019t confuse this case with exact retribution, but don\u2019t consider it the protection of the victim, that\u2019s exactly the purpose that we\u2019re here. We live in a civilized society and one of the things that we give up is our right to take personal retribution, and we pass it on to the State, the State being all of us. When the State fails to exact sufficient restitution or retribution and the State fails to protect the victim of a crime, then we all lose faith and confidence in the system of administration of criminal justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">No objection was interposed at that time, but after the trial judge had completed his advisory instruction, appellant\u2019s counsel, at the bench, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201c . . . Mr. Kinlein [the State\u2019s Attorney] said in his final argument and I didn\u2019t object because I thought I\u2019d ask the Court for an additional instruction about retribution. I think that the purpose of the jury ought to be explained. It\u2019s not retribution, it\u2019s to find facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The trial judge declined to give an additional instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>on the ground that he had advised the jury that argument of counsel was just that, argument and not evidence. As we read the transcript of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s rebuttal argument, we are led to the conclusion that he was articulating the growth of criminal law. He was endeavoring to explain to the jury that when men organized into society they gave up certain things that they had previously reserved for themselves. One of the things that they surrendered to society was the seeking of personal retribution for an act done to the person or his relatives. While we think the argument of the State\u2019s Attorney to be an inarticulate explanation of the historical background of criminal law, and we further think that it would have been better had the trial judge granted the appellant\u2019s request for a clarifying instruction, we, nevertheless, do not perceive in this case reversible error because the judge refused to give that instruction. <em>See Wilhelm v. State, 212 </em>Md. 404, 326 A. 2d 707 (1974) wherein the Court of Appeals declined to upset a conviction on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s argument that the jury had an opportunity to do something to stop crime. The Court said that it must give due deference to the conclusion reached by the trial judge who \u201cheard the actual remarks \u2014 in the context in which they were made, in the trial arena \u2014 and who found no prejudice. The alleged improper remark \u2014 at best an introduction to a possible invocation of \u2018law and order,\u2019 or the commencement of an exhortation unto the jury \u2018to do their duty,\u2019 or the inception of an appeal for law enforcement \u2014 was but one sentence in the extensive proceedings, singularly made and unrepeated.\u201d We note that Judge Evans advised the jury, \u201cIt is your function to decide upon the truth of the testimony as given by the various witnesses .... <em>That is your sole responsibility. </em>. . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The judge further instructed the jury that its function was that of judge of the fact and law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We observe that the judge\u2019s instructions occurred posteriorly to the argument of counsel, and they elucidated the role of the jury. The instruction made clear to the jury their role in the case. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>have no reason to believe that the jury did not heed the trial judge\u2019s instructions, nor that the talesmen disobeyed their oath to \u201cwell and truly try and a true deliverance make . . . and a true verdict give according to the evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An accused is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 552, 267 A. 2d 190 (1970); <em>Boblits v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 391, 400, 256 A. 2d 187 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In the light of the overwhelming testimony of the culpability of the accused as presented in this case, the trial judge\u2019s declination to further instruct the jury, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 508, 275 A. 2d 184 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The victim testified that appellant had lowered her jeans and undergarments below her knees, and that he put his penis in her vagina; she felt it in her. The appellant here, and in the trial court, seems to rely heavily upon the fact that the victim testified that she did not <em>see </em>the penetration occur. We know of no rule of law that requires a rape victim to observe the entry of the male organ into her body. There was also testimony in this case that the young victim\u2019s undergarments exhibited a \u201cdark, reddish color stain on the underpants ... in the vicinity of the crotch region.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the victim\u2019s testimony, standing alone, if believed, is sufficient to sustain the conviction. <em>Estep v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 53, 286 A. 2d 187 (1972); <em>Crenshaw v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 361, 283 A. 2d 423 (1971); <em>Williams v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 350, 274 A. 2d 403 (1971); <em>Gunn v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 379, 243 A. 2d 15 (1968); <em>Lucas v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 590, 235 A. 2d 780 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Lastly, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence, over objection, a knife seized from the appellant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">At the time the appellant was apprehended he was approximately ninety yards from his parked motor vehicle. The vehicle was searched and a knife was found in the glove compartment. The knife, as we have noted, was admitted into evidence over objection. Appellant asserts that the admission of the knife was improper because it was the fruit of an illegal search. Furthermore, appellant says, it cannot be argued that the search was incident to an arrest. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); <em>Howell v. State, </em>271 Md. 378, 318 A. 2d 189 (1974). Officer Freund, of the Howard County Police Department, testified that he discovered the knife in the course of an \u201cinventory\u201d of the contents of the appellant\u2019s motor vehicle, but, on cross-examination, he said that he found the knife while he was \u201csearching\u201d the car. No matter how the officer classified his actions, he was processing the seized vehicle. It is indubitable that the motor vehicle was an instrumentality of the crime of kidnapping. Patently, the vehicle had been used for the asportation of the youthful victim. It was parked near an abandoned house, and it was visible to anyone in the area. There was no contention that the police had trespassed upon real property of appellant. In fact, there is a clear inference that appellant was a trespasser upon property of another, although the identity of that person is not revealed by the record. Knowing that the vehicle had been used in the kidnapping, the police had not only the right to seize it, but the duty to do so on the ground that it was evidence of the kidnapping. <em>Nasiriddin v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 479, 298 A. 2d 490 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Once the vehicle was \u201clegally in the hands of the police they had the right to process it to establish the <em>corpus delecti.\u201d Nasiriddin v. State, supra. </em>Just as the <em>Nasiriddin </em>automobile was the \u201cstriking vehicle\u201d in a \u201chit and run\u201d case, so the car in the instant case was the \u201casporting vehicle\u201d. The police could have examined the car for latent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>fingerprints of the victim. Although a search of a vehicle under certain circumstances may be constitutionally proscribed, <em>see e.g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <em>Howell v. State, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>such prohibition does not exist where, as here, the vehicle itself is itself an integral part of the crime, <em>viz., </em>the element of \u201ccarrying away\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">W. Ringel, <em>Searches </em>&amp; <em>Seizures, Arrests and Confessions </em>\u00a7 291.02 at 380 (1972) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cAlthough in <em>Harris v. U.S., </em>390 US 234 [88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968)] the Supreme Court did not reach the issue as to whether a vehicle seized as evidence of or as an instrumentality of a crime may be searched without a warrant, there is authority for such a warrantless search.

State, </em>238 Md. 528, 209 A. 2d 765 (1965), a rape and kidnapping case, upheld the search of a Cadillac in which the victim was transported. The Court said at 539-40:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c. . . [T]he automobile, according to the information previously given by [the victim] which the officers had reasonable cause to believe was true, had been used as an instrument in the perpetration of the alleged crime; . . . Where there has been a valid arrest, property found in connection with the arrest which tends to establish the commission of the crime charged may be held by the officers for evidence. <em>If the arrest is lawful, the seizure is lawful, if the property is of an evidentiary nature. . . . The automobile itself could have been offered in evidence at the trial. Having lawfully seized it, the police had a right to examine it after the seizure for evidence in connection with the crime.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted).
