Assume that a defendant, or his confederate, has an account at Bank A with only a nominal balance. On Monday, a check is written to the defendant in the amount of $100. The defendant immediately walks to Bank B, where he has an account and is known as a reliable customer, and cashes the check for $100. The check now in the hands of Bank B does not, of course, clear on that particular day and the defendant has created for himself $100 out of nothing. To keep the scheme afloat, a second check is drawn on Bank A on Tuesday. It then is cashed at Bank B and the cash is, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>redeposited at Bank A. The deposit covers the check written on Monday, which is just now clearing. Tuesday\u2019s check has not yet been covered. The scheme is repeated on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. At the end of the week, five $100 checks, totaling $500, have been written on Bank A. The five checks have been cashed at Bank B for $500. Four hundred dollars has been redeposited at Bank A to keep the scheme afloat. The remaining $100 is the profit of the \u201ckiting\u2019 operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"465\"

width=\"1158\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-26\">Like a juggler with three balls aloft but only two hands, the \u201ckiting\u201d operation, once begun, cannot stop, lest the uncovered ball \u201cbounce.\u201d Theoretically, the operation could go on indefinitely. In fact, the music always stops for one reason or another: Bank A spots the telltale signs of \u201ckiting\u201d and cancels the account upon which the checks are drawn; Bank B becomes suspicious and withdraws credit, refusing to cash any checks until they are cleared; the \u201ckiter\u201d is hit by a truck or leaves for Brazil. In our simplified model, the \u201cmusic stops\u201d on Friday. Bank B has already cashed its fifth $100 check. It will learn on Monday or Tuesday that Bank A has returned the check marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d Bank B will then be the victim of a false pretense as to that $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-27\">The crime of False Pretenses is simply stated in Art. 27, \u00a7 140:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-28\">Any person who shall by any false pretense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>obtain from any other person any chattel, money or valuable security, with intent to defraud any person of the same, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">As Chief Judge Orth pointed out for this Court in <em>Polisher v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 555, 560, 276 A. 2d 102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cThe false pretense is the crux of the crime. So the crime is committed when a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">1) by making a false representation of a past or existing fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">2) with intent to defraud; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">3) knowledge of its falsity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">4) obtains any chattel, money or valuable security from another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">5) who relies on the false representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">6) to his detriment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">See also <em>Smith v. State, </em>237 Md. 573, 207 A. 2d 493; <em>Tumminello v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 612, 272 A. 2d 77; <em>Lockhard v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 580, 240 A. 2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">In the example given, five false representations are in fact made by the \u201ckiter\u201d to Bank B, one on each day of the week. The false representation is as to an existing fact, to wit, that \u201cthere are funds in the account at the drawee bank to cover the check being presented for cashing\u201d (Element 1). In each, case, the \u201ckiter\u201d knows of the falsity of his representation (Element 3). In each case, Bank B relies upon the false representation (Element 5) and thereby parts with $100 (Element 4). These elements of the crime of false pretenses classically present no problem when applied to a \u201ckiting\u201d operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">The sixth element \u2014 detriment to the victim\u2014 is more troublesome. In the example given, it is clear that Bank B relied upon Friday\u2019s false representation to its ultimate detriment \u2014 the loss of the $100 (which had been paid out in cash) when the check relied upon was returned marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d The defendant-\u201ckiter\u201d typically makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the claim \u2014 on its surface deceptively attractive \u2014 that there was no ultimate detriment on the other four days and, therefore, no crime of false pretenses. His theory is that there was neither financial loss nor mental anguish to Bank B since money was on deposit at Bank A in time for the first four checks to clear. He reasons that Tuesday\u2019s successful false representation erases the detrimental effect of Monday\u2019s false representation, and so on through the weeks and months <em>ad infinitum. </em>The law, however, recognizes \u201cdetriment\u201d of a more subtle variety. On each of the days in question, Bank B, by relying upon the false representation, exposed itself to a hazard which it would not have assumed but for that reliance. On each day, it ran the risk that the \u201ckiter\u2019s\u201d scheme would go awry. That, according to the common law of false pretenses, is detriment enough. In 32 Am.Jur.2d, False Pretenses, \u00a7 38 \u201cInjury or prejudice resulting from transfer,\u201d it is said, at p. 200:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201c[T]he gravamen of the olfense is in the making of the false pretense with intent to defraud and thereby obtaining another\u2019s property. So it is not essential that the victim suffer a permanent loss or that he sustain a pecuniary loss. The offense is complete when money or property has been obtained by false representations, and it cannot be purged by subsequent restoration or repayment. Accordingly, where a person induces another, by means of false pretenses, to part with his property, he cannot defend against a charge of obtaining property by false pretenses by showing that the person who parted with his property had recovered in a civil action the value of the property, or by showing that the victim had recovered by other means or from other sources. Nor will the actual repayment of a loan obtained by false pretenses constitute a defense against a criminal prosecution for obtaining money by false pretenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">See <em>People v. Jones, </em>36 Cal. 2d 373, 224 P. 2d 353; <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Mills, </em>96 Ariz. 377, 396 P. 2d 5; <em>Pepper v. People, </em>75 Colo. 348, 225 P. 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Of similar import is Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Edition, 1969), at 313-314:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201c[T]here is no requirement of actual pecuniary loss on the part of the intended victim. If the false representation was with reference to the security given for money borrowed, or property purchased on credit, it is no defense to a charge of false pretenses that the debt has since been paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Equally troublesome, at first glance, is the second element \u2014 the \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d Two problems here raise their heads. A defendant-\u201ckiter\u201d will typically claim that, although he may have derived $100 in unearned profit from Monday\u2019s false representation, he derived no profit whatsoever from the four succeeding false representations. The $100 in each instance, according to his claim, went for the benevolent purpose of reimbursing his victim (via making a deposit in the drawee bank) for an earlier false representation. That sort of reasoning is specious in two regards. Initially, he does derive a benefit from each of the later false representations. He gets the benefit of Friday\u2019s $100 both when he satisfies Thursday\u2019s debt with that $100 and when he, thereby, covers the tracks of Thursday\u2019s criminality. It is, furthermore, no requirement of the law of false pretenses that the money received from another be applied to the taker\u2019s benefit. Chief Judge Orth made that very clear in <em>Polisher v. State, supra, </em>at 11 Md. App. 580-581:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cThe argument fails because \u2018[t]here is no doctrine of <em>lucri causa </em>in the field of false pretenses. It is accordingly immaterial that the defendant did not gain or intend to gain any personal benefit or advantage from obtaining the property from the victim.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>[2 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law </em>(Anderson Edition)] \u00a7 583, p. 309. \u2018[T]he defendant is responsible for his false pretense even though he did not personally gain any bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>fit from the goods which had been obtained thereby.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 585, p. 316. It is stated in Hochheimer, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2nd Ed. 1904), \u00a7 323, p. 356: \u2018It is sufficient that the thing has been confided to the offender, it being immaterial that he did not obtain it on his own account, nor for his own gain or benefit.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The defendant-\u201ckiter\u201d typically attempts to gainsay the \u201cintent to defraud\u201d in a second fashion. He claims (as does the appellant here) that the entire \u201ckiting\u201d scheme was simply a means by which he managed to \u201cborrow\u201d the money. He utterly disavows any intent to steal, that is, to keep the money permanently. He claims self-righteously that he is an honorable man and that he fully intends to pay back every cent, once his fortunes are in better repair. Despite its surface charm, the defense is unavailing. Instructive in this regard is Clark and Marshall\u2019s <em>Law of Crimes </em>(Wingersky Edition, 1958), at 823:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIf a person, however, obtains money or goods by false pretenses, he is none the less guilty because he intends to repay the money or pay for the goods, for \u2018an intent to defraud is consistent with an intent to undo the effect of the fraud if the offender should be able to do so.\u2019 That there is ability as well as intent to repay is no defense. Even an offer to repay or actual repayment is no defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">See <em>Commonwealth v. Schwartz, </em>92 Ky. 510, 18 S. W. 775; <em>People v. Oscar, </em>105 Mich. 704, 63 N. W. 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The same point is made in 32 Am.Jur.2d <em>False Pretenses, </em>\u00a7 33, \u201cIntent to defraud,\u201d at p. 197:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u201cIf the accused had the requisite intent, he may be guilty of the crime of obtaining money or property by false pretenses even though he may have intended to repay the money or restore the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>See also Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Edition, 1969), at 312-313:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cIt is now necessary to emphasize that an intent to repay will not necessarily prevent guilt of this crime. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">One who is asked to lend money or to sell goods on credit has a right to determine for himself whether he chooses to be a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor, and if he chooses to be the former he has a right to know about the security. One who has extended credit in reliance upon a mortgage on real estate which is falsely represented to be a first mortgage when in fact it is subject to a prior recorded mortgage for more than the land is worth, or is a mortgage upon property which the mortgagor does not own, has been defrauded even if the debtor has an intent to pay the debt. The lender intended to be a secured creditor but by reason of the false representation his position is for all practical purposes that of an unsecured creditor. There is an obvious and unreasonable <em>risk </em>of loss which has been forced upon him, without his knowledge or consent, by reason of the deceit. This risk which the creditor did not intend to assume was imposed upon him by the <em>intentional </em>act of the debtor, and this amounts to an intent to defraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">... If by reason of the false representation of the debtor, the creditor has assumed a substantially greater risk then would have been his if the debtor\u2019s statements had been true, this requirement of the crime is satisfied even if the security is not entirely worthless, or even if it may turn out to be adequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In the face of this law, the typical defendant-\u201ckiter\u2019s\u201d claim that his demonstrated pattern of regular repayments evidences his good faith and belies any \u201cintent to defraud\u201d becomes irrelevant. Also irrelevant becomes the claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>he would have \u201cmade good\u201d upon the last false representation, if some unforeseen circumstance beyond his control \u2014 the closing of an account by one bank or the withdrawal of credit by the other \u2014 had not frustrated his efforts to do so. The pattern, indeed, rather than demonstrating good faith is laid bare for what it is: the frantic necessity for the \u201ckiter\u201d to run faster and faster and \u201ckite\u201d larger and larger sums in a desperate effort to keep his artificial financial empire from collapsing and to derive, in the process, some continuing proceeds therefrom. The claim that \u201csome day it will all be made good\u201d is legally meaningless. As well might an embezzler claim that he had \u201cno intent to defraud\u201d the victimized bank, on the theory that the embezzler was only \u201cborrowing\u201d the money and had every honorable intention of returning it just as soon as his ship came in or his horse finished in the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>The Facts in this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Upon this legal framework, the guilt of the appellant, elusive enough while still in the briar patch of tangled and undifferentiated facts, becomes all too clear. The appellant, Drury R. Baskerville, was a 53-year-old teacher in the public schools of Baltimore. He was convicted by Judge Shirley B. Jones, sitting without a jury, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, upon three indictments, each charging false pretenses generally (as well as a violation of Section 142, the \u201cbad check statute\u201d specifically).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Although the appellant\u2019s house of cards did not crash down until the end of July, 1971, its cornerstone was laid at least as early as a year before. Delores Brenda Miller, a girlfriend of five years\u2019 standing, and Robert Allen Gantt, a substitute teacher at the appellant\u2019s school, were either willing pawns or intellectually inert putty in the hands of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Mrs. Miller had a personal checking account at the Maryland National Bank in which she normally kept a small balance in order to pay her household expenses. Mrs. Miller testified that \u201cmaybe a year, year and a half\u201d before July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1971, she began writing checks on this account to the appellant and in excess of the balance maintained by her in the account. She continued to use the account for her own personal purposes and would make deposits to cover such amounts. She relied exclusively on the appellant, however, to make appropriate deposits to cover the checks made payable to him. Incredibly, Mrs. Miller wrote the checks to the appellant because \u201cHe asked me to\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cQ. And would you tell the Court how you came about to write some checks for Mr. Baskerville?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">A. He asked me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">Q. All right. And would you tell us the circumstances under which he would ask you to write the checks? What would he tell you when you were writing the checks as to amount and number and everything of that sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">A. When he first asked me to write the checks for him there was no specific amount that he would ask for, but gradually as the check amounts increased I was asked to give certain amounts, put certain amounts on the checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">Q. All right. And did you have any idea what this was for at that time when you were writing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">A. Not really, no. Not really, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Mrs. Miller was either remarkably ingenuous or cunningly disingenuous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Miller, did there come a time when you ever had a discussion with Mr. Baskerville about why he was having you write these checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">A. Several times I attempted to discuss it with him, but I couldn\u2019t quite understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">Q. Would you explain to the Court what it was Mr. Baskerville told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">A. I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Q. Did Mr. Baskerville attempt to explain to you just why and what he was doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">A. I think he did, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Q. So that your testimony that you didn\u2019t know what was going on is simply because you were unable to understand it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">At times, multiple checks would be written at a single writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201cQ. And at the times he was there do you recall whether or not you would be writing one check or more than one check or on what type of basis it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">A. When it began it was maybe one or two, but I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly how many I would write at a time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">According to the records of the Maryland National Bank, over $71,000 passed through Mrs. Miller\u2019s account between April 1, 1971, and August 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">In May of 1971, Robert Allen Gantt opened a checking account at Maryland National because the appellant, a fellow teacher, asked him to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">\u201cQ. All right. And why did you open the account at Maryland National?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">A. Well, because like \u2014 well, at first Mr. Baskerville, you know, had asked me, you know, about opening up a checking account, so, you know, I went on and said okay. And then the first twenty dollars was deposited by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">The appellant furnished Gantt with the $20 with which the account was opened. During the ensuing four months, Gantt wrote a number of checks to the appellant and relied upon the appellant exclusively to make all of the deposits into the account. Gantt himself never made a single deposit. The checks made out to the appellant ranged in amount \u201cfrom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>about three hundred up to about maybe eight or nine hundred.\u201d When asked how often he wrote such checks, Gantt replied, \u201cIf I think correctly, I think it was maybe about two checks a day, you know, over a period of time.\u201d The explanation as to why he participated in such an exotic banking practice was, from the mouth of a college-trained school teacher, incredible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cA. Well, Mr. Baskerville, you know, had asked me, you know, about writing checks for him. At first I was skeptical about it, but then, you know, I figured by him, you know, being nice enough to just open the account for me, you know, well, you know, the best thing for me to do, you know, was to show him, you know, my appreciation and not thinking, you know, there was anything wrong about it, you know, like knowing, you know, that the checks, you know, were coming back and being paid also, I didn\u2019t have any \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t even bother about questioning him about it because I thought it was perfectly all right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The records of the Maryland National Bank revealed that approximately $31,000 passed through Gantt\u2019s account during the months of May, June and July, 1971. Between the two accounts, the cash flow for the several-month period was in the neighborhood of $102,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">When the appellant took the stand in his own defense (his credibility as a witness, if not as a public school teacher, was eroded by his acknowledgment that he had been convicted in Denver in 1953 of conspiracy, forgery and uttering and had served three years in Leavenworth), he revealed that Mrs. Miller\u2019s and Gantt\u2019s were not the only bank accounts he had operating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201cQ. . . . [F]irst of all, was Miss Miller\u2019s and Mr. Gantt\u2019s the only bank accounts you were running in this operation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Q. There were others, weren\u2019t there? How many others were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">A. Oh, periodically, I guess, three, four, maybe five other people at times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Richard T. Davis, a bank security officer at Maryland National, testified that he was alerted on June 9,1971, to the fact that the appellant, \u201cwho was related to many accounts at the Maryland National Bank, was making large unusual cash transactions.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Mr. Davis viewed the appellant \u201con many occasions making deposits to various accounts within Maryland National Bank,\u201d all but one of which \u201cwere those of other persons\u201d including Gantt and Mrs. Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Maryland National closed the accounts of Gantt and Mrs. Miller on August 2,1971, because, according to Mr. Davis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201cA. Between the dates of June 9th, 1971 and August the 2nd of 1971 I personally had been watching these accounts very closely as they had the indications of a kiting operation and I was, therefore, keeping close touch with our bookkeeping department to find out at what point during this kiting operation that Maryland National Bank would be on the black side of the credit line, so to speak, so we would not be injured by any loss. So, as soon as we were on this black side of this line then I cut off the accounts, and that was on August 2nd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Mr. Davis explained how this \u201ckiting\u201d operation varied from the more garden variety and was, therefore, more difficult to pin down with reasonable certainty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201cA. The term kiting operation refers to a manipulation of accounts, usually one established or two or more accounts established in different banks. The accounts are usually opened up with a small amount of money at first and they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>conducted in a very proper manner for an indefinite period of time or until the customer becomes known to tellers in various offices and obtains a reputation as being a good customer. Even though he may not be known by name, they see him on a daily basis and get to know his presence in the bank. And then after he gains the confidence- of the tellers in various banks he will go to one bank with a check, let\u2019s say in this case \u2014 well, let\u2019s use a different case being it\u2019s hypothetical. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">A. Mr. Smith opens an account in \u2018A\u2019 bank. And then he opens an account also in \u2018B\u2019 bank. Well, he would draw a check on \u2018A\u2019 bank in the sum of a thousand dollars and deposit it in \u2018B\u2019 bank and he would be known to the tellers in \u2018B\u2019 bank and would be given immediate credit, cash credit for that check. Then he would have the use of that money for a twenty-four hour period or until such time that he deposits a check drawn on \u2018B\u2019 bank into \u2018A\u2019 bank in a similar amount. So, therefore, there is very rarely in the average kiting operation any actual cash money being transacted. And in this particular instance, and the reason it took so long for us to determine just exactly what was going on, this was a very unique operation, whereas, the deposits being made into the accounts of Mr. Gantt and Miss Miller at Maryland National Bank were being done so in cash, however, the checks that were being drawn against these accounts were being taken to Equitable where they were being cashed and the person given cash and then right away he would fun the two-block period which came from Equitable Trust to our bank and deposited the cash money back. So, he had a continuous cash flow going through his account and, as I say, very unique. It was a very sophisticated kiting operation and one that has become quite a rarity in banking circles too, I might add. Did I describe adequately \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>MRS. O\u2019CONNOR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">MRS. BOTHE: Not by my standards . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The ax fell on July 27, 1971. On the preceding day, July 26, the appellant cashed three checks at the Equitable Trust Company. All three were drawn on the Maryland National Bank. Delores Miller had made out one of the checks to the appellant in the amount of $998. The check was dated July 22, 1971. Robert A. Gantt had made out a second check to the appellant in the amount of $996. It was dated July 20, 1971. Gantt had also made out another check, dated July 17, 1971, to the appellant in the amount of $978. When the checks were cashed on July 26, there were not sufficient funds in either the Miller or the Gantt account to cover the respective checks. Following his regular modus operandi, the appellant appeared again at the Equitable Trust Company on July 27 to cash additional checks. The cash he anticipated receiving would then have been deposited by him in the Miller and Gantt accounts at the Maryland National Bank to cover the three checks that had been cashed the day before and which had not yet cleared. For some reason not fully explained in the record, the Equitable Trust Company refused to extend further credit, for check cashing purposes, to the appellant on July 27. As the appellant explained it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cQ. Now, how often would you have to make deposits and cash checks in order to keep this going with the Gantt and Miller accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">A. Well, as I explained earlier, this would have to be done daily because if you cash the check today you would have to make the deposit in that account the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">Q. So, I take it that every single day you had to cash a check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">Q. And every single day you had to make a deposit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">A. Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">Q. Now, what happened that all this came to a halt with three checks that could not be \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>A. This was around about the latter part of July 1971. And she told me that they had said they didn\u2019t want to cash any more checks, you know, not to cash \u2014 they just wanted to call a halt to cashing any checks that I would bring in from that time, you know, on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Q. And as a result did they then refuse to cash some checks for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">A. That day, yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Q. Now, as a result of their having refused to cash the checks for you what happened with the Gantt and Miller accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">A. Well, I was unable to make the deposits in their accounts, you know, as explained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">As a result of the failure of the false representation on July 27, the \u201cworthless checks\u201d cashed on July 26 could not be covered. With respect to all three checks, Equitable had them returned by Maryland National marked \u201cnot sufficient funds.\u201d Only then did Equitable realize that it had been \u201ctaken\u201d to the tune of $2,972.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The three indictments on which the appellant was convicted relate to the passing of these three checks, respectively. The first count of each indictment charges false pretenses generally under \u00a7 140. The second count of each indictment charges a violation of \u00a7 142, the bad check statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The appellant\u2019s basic contention is that the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain his convictions. We have no difficulty in holding quite otherwise. In a case tried before the court without a jury, the test as to whether the trial judge was clearly erroneous in reaching a verdict of guilty on the evidence is whether the admissible evidence adduced at the trial either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of, the facts to be proved, from which she, as the trier of the fact, could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, /of the appellant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged, and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the witnesses. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450, 459, 247 A. 2d 731; <em>Metz v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 15, 23, 262 A. 2d 331; Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">With respect to each check, the appellant falsely represented to Equitable Trust that there was a sufficient balance in the accounts at Maryland National to cover such check. These misrepresentations were knowingly made by the appellant. Equitable Trust relied upon the representations and parted with $2,972 to its ultimate detriment. For reasons hereinbefore discussed, the appellant\u2019s self-serving declarations that he fully intended to \u201cpay the money back\u201d and that he was \u201conly borrowing it\u201d do not negate the last and critical element of \u201cintent to defraud\u201d on his part. <em>Clark and Marshall, supra, </em>823; 32 Am.Jur.2d, <em>False Pretenses, </em>\u00a7 33, \u201cIntent to defraud,\u201d p. 197; <em>Perkins, supra, </em>312-313.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The appellant\u2019s \u201cnon culpa mea\u201d is, moreover, as factually bizarre as it is legally untenable. The particular \u201cship\u201d which the appellant claimed to be expecting \u201cto come in\u201d was an anticipated promotion within the school system. The appellant was due to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree from Coppin State College in June, 1971. Once certified as a degree holder, the appellant would be paid for the next school year at the rate of approximately $10,000 per year. As a mere \u201cprovisional\u201d teacher without a degree, he was paid $6,100 per year. As he described his anticipated rise in station, \u201c[P]rior to that I had been a provisional teacher which, well, it\u2019s quite a difference between that and a tenure teacher with alleged qualifications.\u201d Having outstanding bills and anticipating a substantial raise, he acknowledged that he may have \u201cjumped the gun in some respects.\u201d The appellant did not seem to understand or was not willing to acknowledge that he would only begin to earn salary at the $10,000-a-year rate in September, 1971, that he would receive some part of his $4,000 raise with each ensuing paycheck over the course of the year, and that various deductions and taxes would be withheld. He insisted that he expected to receive a \u201clump sum\u201d of $4,000 in September with which he would close down the \u201ckiting\u201d operation so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that no one would be harmed. He never did successfully explain how he expected his anticipated salary increase to be paid a year in advance in a lump sum with no deductions. Judge Jones, as fact finder, did not share his uncritical optimism.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">With respect to the appellant\u2019s second contention that he should not have been convicted for violations of both \u00a7 140 and \u00a7 142, he wins at least a moral victory (the sentences were concurrent).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Flannigan v. State, </em>232 Md. 13, 191 A. 2d 591, made it very clear that where the false pretense is the passing of a worthless check, it is not proper to convict a defendant under both \u00a7 140 and \u00a7 142 for a single transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cApplying that test to the instant case, it is readily observed that a conviction under \u00a7 142 requires \u2018proof of a fact\u2019 (a worthless check) that \u00a7 140 does not necessarily require. However, a conviction under \u00a7 140, when a bad check is involved, does not require \u2018proof of a fact\u2019 that is not essential to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 142. Hence, we hold that appellant should not have been convicted on the fourth count. A holding to the contrary would mean that, when a worthless check is involved, a defendant could be subjected to a double sentence by the simple expedient of finding him guilty under both sections, even though but a single check was involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Cf. <em>Sutton v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 639, 236 A. 2d 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\"><em>Judgments as to the first count of indictments 2270, 2271 and 2273 charging false pretenses affirmed; judgments as to the second count \u25a0 of each indictment charging a violation of </em>\u00a7 <em>H2 reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
