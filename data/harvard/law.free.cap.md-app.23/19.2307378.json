The conviction of the appellant, Clyde George Dixon, by Judge James Macgill in the Circuit Court for Howard County for (1) driving while under the influence of drugs in contravention of Article 66<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>/2, Section 11-902 (a), and (2) possession of barbiturates, occasions a hard look at the particular \u201cinventory search\u201d relied upon in this case specifically and at the constitutional validity of the inventory-search rationale generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\n<em>The Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">But for the all-too-real discomfiture of the appellant, the misadventure that brought him to his present sad estate was vintage Buster Keaton. At 11 a.m. on November 6, 1972, he pulled innocently onto the parking lot adjacent to the Howard County Courthouse in Ellicott City and committed the fatal blunder of parking in a \u201cno parking space\u201d under the watchful eye of the Howard County Central Alarm headquarters. Thirty minutes later the episode was over, with the appellant in full custodial arrest, his car impounded and searched, and himself charged with the possession of barbiturates found in the course of that search. Juridically as well as botanically, \u201cgreat oaks from little acorns grow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The Courthouse and the Central Alarm headquarters occupy two sides of a common parking lot in Ellicott City. Immediately in front of Central Alarm, on November 6, 1972, were parked two large and mobile emergency generators. Beside (or perhaps between) the generators were three \u201cno parking spaces,\u201d also immediately in front of Central Alarm. John Earp \u2014 a dispatcher for Central Alarm \u2014 was watching from the open doorway of his headquarters, which was up one flight of stairs and commanded a good view of the parking lot, as the appellant initially moved onto and across that lot. The appellant attempted to back his car into one of the prohibited spaces, a move requiring a sharp left-hand turn because of the generators. In the course of the maneuver, the left front fender of the appellant\u2019s car struck one of the parked generators. The appellant, without any apparent undue effort, then simply pulled forward and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>renegotiated his way into an adjacent but also prohibited space. Earp called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Earp then accosted the appellant and reminded him that he had bumped the generator. The appellant replied that \u201cit didn\u2019t seem to be damaged too bad\u201d and, according to Earp, \u201cseemed to be indifferent to the fact.\u201d Dismissing the subject of the accosting, the appellant then asked Earp for and received directions to the jail, which was one floor below Central Alarm. Chagrined at the appellant\u2019s nonchalance, Earp then placed a second call to the police to inform them that the subject of the first call had \u201cleft my location and gone down to the jail.\u201d Earp positioned himself on a catwalk outside Central Alarm and maintained his vigil. Shortly thereafter, the appellant left the jail and started up the stairs to the parking lot level. Earp observed him \u201cstumble\u201d (but not fall) as he climbed the stairs. The appellant immediately regained his balance and walked across the parking lot toward the Courthouse. In going around a solid rank of parked cars, the appellant, still under Earp\u2019s surveillance, \u201cwalked into the back of a car parked right on the corner, at which time he \u2014 then he continued toward the Courthouse.\u201d Earp placed yet a third call to the police to keep them current on the appellant\u2019s movements. A few minutes later, Earp observed the appellant return from the Courthouse toward his car. A fourth call was placed to the police. Earp, now partially distracted by other duties, finally observed the appellant getting into his car and leaving the parking lot. Earp conceded that, generally speaking, the appellant \u201cseemed to be walking fairly normally\u201d and that nothing was unusual about his breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The only other witness in the case was Patrolman First Class Steven Greisz of the Howard County Police Department. He, with his partner, was on routine patrol north of Ellicott City when he received a radio dispatch that \u201ca parking violation\u201d had occurred \u201cin the Courthouse parking lot.\u201d When the officers arrived at the scene, the appellant had not yet returned to his vehicle. Instead of routinely writing out a ticket and leaving it under the windshield wiper, the officers ran a computerized check on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the car and \u201cfound it not to be stolen and so forth.\u201d The testimony is somewhat equivocal as to whether or not the officers deliberately waited for the parking violator to return to the scene of his violation rather than simply leave the ticket and move on. On cross-examination, Officer Greisz asserted that the appellant returned to his car before the writing of the warning ticket was completed. On direct examination, Officer Greisz characterized his attitude as, \u201cWhile we were there, hopefully awaiting the occupant or the driver to come to the car . . . .\u201d In any event, the appellant returned. Officer Greisz accosted him, \u201cSir, would this be by any chance your vehicle?\u201d The appellant acknowledged that the car belonged to his sister (who lived with him in Baltimore) but that he had been driving it. Upon demand, the appellant produced license and registration card, both of which were in good order. The officer served a warning ticket on the appellant for the parking violation and asked the appellant to move the car. The appellant got in the car and Officer Greisz, with his partner, ostensibly left the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">They moved, however, only so far as a contiguous \u201cback parking lot\u201d in order to maintain a discreet surveillance on the appellant. In the course of this move, they \u201clost him.\u201d The appellant had apparently walked back to the Courthouse. The officers immediately returned to the scene of the parking violation and soon located the appellant. Officer Greisz told him that if he did not move the car immediately, he would receive a ticket instead of a mere warning. The appellant, at this urging, then moved his car to the \u201cback parking lot.\u201d The officers followed him closely. Under their scrutiny, the appellant blundered again. He attempted to park in \u201ca striped area which is not a designated parking space\u201d instead of in a proper area which is \u201cdesignated by white lines in the back Courthouse parking lot.\u201d Officer Greisz \u201cadvised him that he had to park in a proper space, which he did at that time.\u201d The officers, ultimately mollified, drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Although the ultimate characterization of the appellant by Officer Greisz was an amalgam of observations made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>during this initial encounter and twenty minutes later at the time of the appellant\u2019s arrest, the bulk of the characterization refers to the appellant during the initial encounter. Officer Greisz summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cI observed, as I said, at the time of arrest and also at the time I issued Mr. Dixon his warning in the parking area down in front of Central Alarm headquarters, that his breath was apparently normal. There was no \u2014 I couldn\u2019t detect any odor of alcohol on his breath at that point. The color of his face was normal, his clothes were in an orderly fashion. His attitude during a majority of the, my confrontation with him, was polite and cooperative. He had, as far as I know, no unusual actions, no profanity or anything like this. He eyes were slightly bloodshot, his balance was fair<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his walk was fair. His turning ability was fair. His speech was slurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">As to the initial encounter, the bottom line is that the officers, after speaking with the appellant and after observing him drive his car, were satisfied to let the warning for the parking violation suffice. The.incident as far as they were concerned having ended, they drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Some twenty minutes later, the two officers were at the Golden Triangle Shopping Center at the intersection of Route 40 and Route 29 when a second of the calls, of the total of four dispatched by Earp to the police, caught up with them. Not comprehending that the initial complaint had come in four times and that they were still getting (and were yet to get)' Repetitions of the complaint which they had already handled, the officers- obviously surmised that the appellant was back down in the prohibited parking space in front of Central Alarm, from which they had driven him twenty minutes earlier. The officers hurried back to the Courthouse. As they climbed the steep hill of Court Avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>in their final approach to the Courthouse, yet a third of the original four complaints caught up with them. It was the one that informed them that the appellant had bumped into the generator. They concluded that this had happened as they were hurrying back to the scene. These two anachronisms were uppermost in the minds of the officers when they approached the Courthouse and \u201cobserved the car on the back parking lot in motion.\u201d They turned on their emergency lights, moved to the rear of the appellant\u2019s car and motioned for the appellant to stop. He stopped. Officer Greisz immediately advised the appellant \u201cthat I was placing him under arrest at this point for driving while intoxicated.\u201d Without another observation being made or another word being said, the appellant was removed from his vehicle. According to Officer Greisz, \u201cAt this point he was searched, a frisk search for weapons at that point, and advised he was under arrest. He was placed in the police vehicle and advised of his Miranda rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">A subsequent search of the appellant\u2019s automobile produced from the back seat two white tablets, which were analyzed and found to be controlled barbiturates. The critical character of that seizure is patent, since the two tablets were the gravamen of the possession charge, on which the appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of eighteen months. They were also indispensable exhibits in proving the charge of driving while under the influence of a drug, for which the appellant was sentenced to a term of six months to be served concurrently with the other sentence. We turn now to the legitimacy of that seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Search Incident and Carroll Doctrine Rationales Inapplicable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585 (1967); <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 454-455, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 2032, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 576 (1971), neither the search incident to a lawful arrest nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>so-called \u201cautomobile exception\u201d (the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine) need detain us long.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The search of the automobile cannot be legitimated as an incident of the appellant\u2019s arrest for several quite distinct reasons. At the very threshold of search incident theory, the search must be incident not merely to an arrest but to a <em>lawful </em>arrest. A violation of Article 66<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>/2, Section 11-902 (a), is a misdemeanor. A warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor is permitted only when the misdemeanor occurs in the presence of the arresting officer. When the officers returned to the Courthouse parking lot, they observed nothing but the appellant driving his automobile on the back parking lot of the Courthouse. Under our obligation to make an independent review of the evidence where constitutional issues are involved, we find as a constitutional fact that no probable cause existed to arrest the appellant for driving while intoxicated. Even permitting the officers their mistaken beliefs produced by the communications mix-up, we do not find that parking in a prohibited parking space or even bumping into a generator add up to probable cause to believe that the driver is intoxicated. Indeed, full personal observation of the appellant\u2019s speech and behavior some twenty minutes earlier had not led the officers to any such conclusion. Without a lawful arrest, there can be no constitutional search incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Even if the arrest had been lawful, however, the search was not \u201cessentially contemporaneous\u201d with the arrest. It occurred a short, but nevertheless significantly measurable, time thereafter. The unity of time was not satisfied. <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 U. S. 364, 84 S. Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964). The search was, furthermore, beyond the permitted search perimeter of <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). The State urges strenuously upon us <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U. S. 218, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), and <em>Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 U. S. 260, 94 S. Ct. 488, 38 L.Ed.2d 456 (1973), as legitimating a full search incident after a traffic arrest. The principle of <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Gustafson </em>is not here apposite. They dealt with the purpose of a search incident and not its geographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>range in space. They did not purport to alter, and indeed did not alter, the \u201cwingspan\u201d limitation of <em>Chimel, </em>whereunder a search incident is limited to that area within the lunge, within the reach, within the grasp of the arrestee \u2014 the area \u201cwhich may fairly be deemed to be an extension of his person\u201d \u2014 the area within which the arrestee might grab for weapons or destroy evidence. In the instant case, the appellant-arrestee was safely ensconced in the police car when the search of his own automobile took place some appreciable distance away \u2014 clearly beyond his \u201cwingspan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Nor may the State rely upon the so-called \u201cautomobile exception\u201d under <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925). Neither of the constitutional prerequisites \u2014 probable cause to believe that the automobile contained evidence of crime and exigent circumstances \u2014 was established. The State, indeed, eschewed all reliance upon \u201cautomobile exception\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\n<em>The Inventory Search as a Launching Pad for a Plain View Doctrine Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Before analyzing the \u201cinventory search\u201d in issue, it is initially necessary to place inventory searches generally in their proper analytical frame of reference. An inventory search of an automobile is not an automobile search within the meaning of the \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d Untold confusion has resulted from the mistaking of functional categories for analytical categories. Many examinations of the interior of an automobile, functionally speaking (that is, an inspection for some purpose or another of a vehicle that has four wheels and a motor), have nothing whatsoever to do with the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d analytically speaking. <em>Preston v. United States, supra, </em>involved the search of an automobile, but was a \u201csearch incident\u201d case and not an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d case, analytically speaking. And see <em>Howell v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 429, 306 A. 2d 554 (1973), reversed on factual insufficiency but preserving the frame of analysis in <em>Howell v. State, </em>271 Md. 378, 318 A. 2d 189 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 234, 88 S. Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968), involved the seizure of an incriminating item of evidence from an automobile but was a Plain View Doctrine case and not an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d case, analytically speaking. A similar dichotomy between the literal probing into an automobile, functionally speaking, and a Plain View Doctrine seizure, analytically speaking, occurred in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U. S. 433, 93 S. Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Conversely, all searches and seizures involving the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d (or preferably, the Carroll Doctrine), do not necessarily involve actual automobiles or other vehicles, in 'the functional sense. The search of suitcases and other moveable boxes, cartons and containers are \u201cautomobile exception\u201d (or Carroll Doctrine) cases, in the analytical sense, even though not involving automobiles or other vehicles, in the functional sense. <em>Waugh v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 682, 318 A. 2d 204 (1974); <em>People v. McKinnon, </em>103 Cal. Rptr. 897, 500 P. 2d 1097 (1972); <em>United States v. Valen, </em>479 F. 2d 467 (3rd Cir. 1973). The distinction was well illustrated by the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>when in Part II of its opinion it dealt with the search of the same automobile, in the literal and functional sense of the word, under three separate analyses \u2014 Part II-A applying a \u201csearch incident\u201d analysis to the search of the car, Part II-B applying an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d analysis to the search of the car and Part II-C applying a Plain View Doctrine analysis to the search of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Confusion would be avoided if lawyers and courts would remember that what triggers an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d analysis is not the presence of an internal combustion engine connected with a set of wheels but rather an argument based upon the conjoining of probable cause and exigent circumstances. A reverting to the older usage of \u201cCarroll Doctrine\u201d as the appropriate label for this recognized exception to the warrant requirement might avoid much of the confusion engendered by the word \u201cautomobile\u2019s\u201d having both a functional and an analytical connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>In terms then of constitutional significance, it becomes preeminently clear that an inventory search of an automobile is not an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d case. The inventory search, by definition, purports to be a mere listing of personal property and not a deliberate search for evidence. The \u201cautomobile exception\u201d search is a deliberate search for evidence. An inventory search is not based upon probable cause; an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d search must be based upon probable cause to believe that the automobile contains evidence of crime. The inventory search need not be based upon any exigency; the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d search is absolutely dependent upon the presence of exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">If an inventory search of an automobile is not an \u201cautomobile exception\u201d search, what then is it? Assuming for the moment that the making of an inventory is a legitimate excuse for intruding into the constitutionally protected area of a man\u2019s automobile, it is clear that that entry is a \u201cprior valid intrusion,\u201d one of the two necessary elements to bring into play the Plain View Doctrine. Once there has been a prior valid intrusion, if there is then an inadvertent spotting of evidence of crime in plain view, that evidence may be seized under the Plain View Doctrine. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra; Brown v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584, 292 A. 2d 762 (1972). A review of inventory searches, therefore, proceeds under a Plain View Doctrine analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>No Probable Cause to Believe Pills in Plain View Were Contraband</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Assuming again that the making of an inventory (if bona fide) is a legitimate excuse for intruding into the constitutionally protected area of a man\u2019s automobile, entry into the automobile in pursuit of that purpose would constitute a prior valid intrusion. And there is no question but that the two pills ultimately seized in this case were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>inadvertently spotted and that they were literally in plain view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cA. As I said, I was searching for valuable personal property, to keep for the defendant, so nothing would happen to it. There was nothing in the front area of the car. The vehicle had bucket seats.

Apparently he\u2019s been reading several cases of the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">THE COURT: Maybe he\u2019s heard counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Mr. Kroop: We\u2019ll object to that. Key words are coming out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">THE COURT: Well, just \u2014 I can\u2019t object to his using the language the rest of us use. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">A. On the back seat of the vehicle I observed two pills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">BY MR. HORVITZ:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">Q. And what, if anything, did you do with these pills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">A. I took the pills into my possession and placed them in an envelope at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">Q. And \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-16\">A. I\u2019m not sure if I placed them in the envelope then or at the station, but at any rate I confiscated the pills at that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">It is equally clear that Officer Greisz had no probable cause to believe that the pills were contraband, but nevertheless arbitrarily escalated his effort from the protective listing of personal property to an investigative \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for criminal evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-18\">\u201cQ. All right, now, these two pills, you had no idea what they were, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-19\">A. No. sir. no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Q. Of course, you told Judge Macgill the reason you went through the vehicle was for this client, the defendant\u2019s protection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">A. Yes, sir, it\u2019s our policy, in the police department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">Q. Right. I mean, you want to protect and secure everything that he had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">Q. Is that correct? And when you saw these two pills you had no more idea whether they were aspirin or sleeping pills or whatever, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">A. That\u2019s correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">Q. All right. Yet you took them out in an envelope for his security? Or did you take them out with the idea that you wanted to test them, to see if they were a prohibited drug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">A. Well, I recovered them, and after bringing them from the car I decided to have them tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">A. . . . The search was done as an inventory. It just so happened that I viewed the pills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">Q. Oh, I understand that, but you\u2019ve already told us that you took the pills, not for his safekeeping, but for the purpose of trying to obtain evidence to be used against this man in a court of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">It is beyond cavil that a prior valid intrusion will not in and of itself justify an indiscriminate seizure of all items that happen to be visually in plain view, but that probable cause must exist to believe that the items ultimately seized are, indeed, contraband or other evidence of crime. The point was dealt with by the three justices of the Supreme Court in <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U. S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969), who reached the Fourth Amendment issue in the case. In that case, Georgia law enforcement officers searched Stanley\u2019s home under a valid warrant authorizing them to search for evidence of illegal bookmaking. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>course of the search, the officers seized reels of film which were ultimately determined to be pornographic. The six-justice majority opinion dealt only with the First Amendment issue, whereunder the Georgia law proscribing the possession of obscene matter in the privacy of a home was held to be unconstitutional. Justices Stewart, Brennan and White concurred, reaching, however, the Fourth Amendment issue. They found the seizure of the reels of film to have been \u201cunwarranted and unconstitutional\u201d because they were not particularly described in the warrant and because, although the reels were literally in plain view, there was no probable cause to believe that they were contraband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cThis is not a case where agents in the course of a lawful search came upon contraband, criminal activity, or criminal evidence in plain view. For the record makes clear that the contents of the films could not be determined by mere inspection.\" <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U. S. at 571, 22 L.Ed.2d at 553 (concurring opinion by Steward, J.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">An excellent summary of the cases and authorities on this point is found in the opinion of Justice James N. Bloodworth for the Supreme Court of Alabama in <em>Shipman v. State, </em>282 So. 2d 700. In that case, several individuals were detained by the police because of the complaint of a store owner that they had been acting toward him essentially in an obstreperous manner. As one of the individuals was being accosted by the police, he was observed to transfer an object (clearly .not a weapon) from one part of his person into the top of his boot. JThe object was seized, under a plain view rationale, and dltimately determined to be heroin. The conviction was reversed because there was no probable cause to believe that the object seized, although sighted in plain view, was indeed contraband. The Court held, at 282 So. 2d 704:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThe reason for this rule is apparent. If the rule were otherwise, an officer, acting on mere groundless suspicion, could seize anything and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>everything belonging to an individual which happened to be in plain view on the prospect that on further investigation some of it might prove to have been stolen or to be contraband. It would open the door to unreasonable confiscation of a person\u2019s property while a minute examination of it is made in an effort to find something criminal. Such a practice would amount to the \u2018general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating -at last emerges\u2019 which was condemned in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra. </em>Ex post facto justification of a seizure made on mere groundless suspicion, is totally contrary to the basic tenets of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">For an item in plain view to be validly seized, the officer must possess some judgment at the time that the object to be seized is contraband and that judgment must be grounded upon probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In <em>State v. Elkins, </em>245 Or. 279, 422 P. 2d 250 (1966), an officer, as in the present case, seized pills which he did not know to be contraband but of which he was suspicious. The court there recognized that \u201cbefore the officer had the right to seize the implements of a crime committed in his presence . . . he must have reasonable grounds to believe that the article he has discovered is contraband and therefore a crime is being committed.\u201d After a thorough review of the applicable search and seizure law, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed the conviction, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cThe application of the above rules of law to the facts in the present case leaves only one result. The officer had no information from which it was reasonable to assume that the pills might be contraband. The conclusion to be drawn from the evidence was that the officer was acting on suspicion. It is not enough that the officer suspects in good faith, his suspicions must be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>In <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>16 U.S.C.M.A. 306, 36 C.M.R. 462 (1966), the Court of Military Appeals reversed a conviction for possession of a bottle of narcotics. The authorities had relied upon a plain view seizure. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cIt is with the seizure of the bottle that we are here concerned, and not with any antecedent search. The Government urges that such was reasonable under the circumstances, but we must disagree. Whether a seizure is reasonable depends upon the existence of probable cause for that action, [citations omitted] There must be facts and circumstances from which the probability of the item\u2019s contraband nature may be inferred \u2014 \u2018the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 [citations omitted] There is simply no basis shown on this record for any conclusion by Sergeant Lively that the seized bottle contained narcotics, or that accused was under its influence. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">For cases of similar import see <em>Armour v.

As Judge (now Chief Judge) Orth said for this Court in <em>Gardner v. State, </em>10 Md.

When a constitutional issue is involved, such ostensibly factual questions as whether a confession is voluntary, whether a consent to search is freely given, whether there is probable cause, whether a lineup is impermissibly suggestive, whether a piece of literature is obscene, etc., are ultimate, conclusionary, second-level facts arising out of a series of more physical and concrete first-level facts. Such constitutional facts \u2014 or mixed questions of law and fact \u2014 are of necessity subject to independent appellate determination. <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.

As we said in <em>Walker v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 684, 694-695, 280 A. 2d 260:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cWhere the resolution of a purely factual question is all that is involved, we, of necessity, give great weight to the finding of the hearing judge, and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless we find a clear abuse of discretion. [A constitutional decision,] however, be that decision made at a pretrial suppression hearing or while the jury is excused during the course of trial, is \u2018a mixed question of law and fact.\u2019 <em>Mulligan v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 429, 431, n. 1; <em>Barnhart v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 222, 224. It is, therefore, a situation \u2018where a conclusion of law as to a [constitutional] right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the [constitutional] question, to analyze the facts.\u2019 <em>Fiske v. Kansas, supra, </em>385. We accord \u2018an appropriate and substantial effect to [the trial court\u2019s] resolutions of conflicts in evidence as to the occurrence or non-occurrence of factual events and happenings . . . But . . . We cannot be precluded . . . from determining whether the circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>which the confession was made were such that its admission in evidence amounts to a denial of due process.\u2019 <em>Haynes v. Washington, supra, </em>515, 516. What we mean, therefore, when we say that we have the obligation to make an independent, reflective constitutional judgment on the facts whenever a claim of a constitutionally-protected right is involved is that, although we give great weight to the findings of the hearing judge as to specific, first-level facts (such as the time that an interrogation began, whether a meal was or was not served, whether a telephone call was requested, etc.) we must make our own independent judgment as to what to make of those facts; we must, in making that independent judgment, resolve for ourselves the ultimate, second-level fact \u2014 the existence or non-existence of [in this case, a bona fide inventory].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Indeed, in <em>Reagan v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 590, 244 A. 2d 623, we engaged, of necessity, in constitutional fact-finding in a situation where the same issues were before us as face us now. The trial judge had there found \u201cas a fact\u201d that there had been a bona fide inventory search. Making our own independent, reflective constitutional judgment, we \u201cfound\u201d otherwise, at 4 Md. App. 601:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201c[The trial judge] found that the search was reasonable under <em>St. Clair v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 605. We think the instant case is clearly distinguishable from <em>St. Clair, </em>where at the time the inventory was initiated, the police had no reason to suspect that the goods in the car did not belong to the arrestee and the sole purpose in removing the goods from the car was to inventory them in order to protect the presumed owner and the police from charge of loss. We recognized in our holding \u2018 * * * the difficulty likely to be encountered in distinguishing a <em>bona fide </em>inventory from a mere subterfuge to search.\u2019 In the circumstances of the instant case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>cannot say that the search of the appellant\u2019s car was a <em>bona fide </em>inventory and therefore reasonable under the holding in <em>St. Clair. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Taking then the first-level facts of \u201cwho, what, when and where\u201d as found by the trial judge and making our own independent, reflective judgment as to what to make of those facts \u2014 that is, making our own finding of the ultimate, second-level, constitutional fact \u2014 we cannot help but conclude that the officer\u2019s resort to an inventory rationale was a case more of investigative opportunism than of genuine solicitude for personal property. The necessity for impounding the car was not remotely demonstrated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s car, at the time of arrest, was on the parking lot of the Howard County Courthouse. It was still before noon on a working day. There was no apparent danger to the car or to its contents. The car, in turn, posed no irremediable danger to the flow of traffic. Either the appellant himself or one of the officers, within a few feet and within a few seconds, could have safely parked it, locked it and left it. The officer was asked why he called the tow truck. In view of the obvious and simple alternative of moving the car a few feet into a readily available parking space, the answer strikes us as disingenuous, \u201cIt was parked out here in the lane that runs through the Court House parking lot and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>obstructing traffic.\u201d It is simply not reasonable to tow a car away to avoid moving it to the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">There was no apparent reason why either the impounding or the inventorying was necessary in terms of protecting any personal property that might have been in the vehicle. The appellant himself could have been booked at the nearby stationhouse for the traffic violation and returned to his car well before the afternoon had waned. His sister, alternatively, could have been notified to come and pick it up. To have impounded the car and towed it away, under these circumstances, was a bizarre thing to do, explainable only as a subterfuge to search the car. We cannot credit the officer\u2019s representation that his sole purpose in searching the car before turning it over to the tow truck was to discover \u201cvaluable personal property, to keep for the defendant, so nothing would happen to it.\u201d As the officer acknowledged, easier alternatives were readily available and no explanation was offered as to why they might not have sufficed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201cQ. All right, so the answer is the keys were in your possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">A. Yes, sir, they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">Q. And it would have been very easily \u2014 easy for you to secure the vehicle by closing the windows and locking the doors, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">Q. Right. Also very easy for you, if you wanted to, you yourself to drive the car or have a tow truck pick it up, which you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">A. Yes, sir, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">Q. And you could have secured the entire contents of the vehicle and its trunk by merely locking \u2014 securing the windows and locking the doors, and keeping the key in safe keeping, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">A. Yes, sir, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">The search of the locked trunk tended to belie the securing-of-property-against-loss theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201cQ. Did you look into the trunk of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">A. I believe I did, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">Q. Uh-huh. The trunk was locked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">A. The trunk was locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">Q. Could you have gotten into that trunk without the key, without breaking it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">A. No, sir, I could not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Q. So whatever was in the trunk was also secured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">A. Yes, sir, it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Curiously, no inventory list was ever turned over to the appellant or produced in court. Apparently none was ever made. In terms of the officer\u2019s attentions, solicitude for personalty was easily cuckolded and lightly forgotten once the more attractive rival of the seizure of potentially incriminating evidence appeared in the field. In the light of such easy inconstancy of purpose, it is difficult to credit significantly the asserted initial commitment. As the officer acknowledged on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">\u201cQ. So you really didn\u2019t take it for his safekeeping? Correct? You took it as evidence, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">A. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">Our finding of the constitutional fact that this was not a bona fide inventory is, of course, fatal to the subsequent seizure. <em>Pigford v. United States, </em>273 A. 2d 837 (D.C.App. 1971); <em>Reagan v. State, supra. </em>And see Annotation, <em>Lawfulness of \u201cInventory Search\u201d of Motor Vehicle Impounded by Police, </em>48 A.L.R.3d 537, at 544:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">\u201cAn essential requirement to a valid inventory search is that the police must have acted in good faith in conducting the inventory, and must not have used the inventory procedure as a subterfuge for a warrantless search. It has therefore been held that where the conduct of the police was inconsistent with its contention that the search was conducted for inventory purposes, the search was unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The situation at bar bears an amazing parallel to that with which we dealt in <em>Kleinbart v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 183, 234 A. 2d 288. There, as here, the defendant was initially stopped for a traffic violation. There, as here, he was driving his sister\u2019s car. There, as here, he was charged with driving \u201cunder the influence.\u201d There, as here, the car and its contents were towed away. There, as here, the car was searched \u201cto protect the property.\u201d There, as here, the searching officer became suspicious about the property as he was checking it out. There, the property turned out to be stolen and the ultimate charge was grand larceny. The issue now before us was precisely the issue facing us in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cThe next question before us is whether, under the facts shown in the record of this case, the removal by Trooper Arnold of the property within the car and the trunk for the avowed purpose \u2018to protect the property\u2019 constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2 Md. App. 194.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In holding that the search of the car and the seizure of its contents were unconstitutional, we there found it significant that the defendant had only been arrested for a traffic violation, for which he was entitled to an immediate hearing or to be released on bond. We found it significant that the vehicle was in the hands of a selected bailee in whom the police had confidence. We found it significant that the police had the keys with which to lock the car. We found it significant that the sister, who owned the car, was not notified to pick it up. We found it significant that the searching officer discontinued his inventory once he found something suspicious. The observations there made by the court, speaking through Judge O\u2019Donnell, at 2 Md. App. 198-200, are remarkably appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201cThe facts upon which the court found in <em>St. Clair </em>that there was no \u2018unreasonable\u2019 search and seizure are clearly distinguishable, however, from the facts here in the record before us. Here, each of the Appellants was arrested for misdemeanors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>committed in Trooper Blazejak\u2019s presence, on which charges they were entitled to an immediate hearing or to be released from custody on giving bond or collateral (see Art. 66V2, Sec. 320 Ann. Code, 1967 Repl. Vol.); the vehicle was towed for storage, to a designated, selected bailee in whose ability to protect the vehicle the police must have had confidence; the car doors would lock \u2014 in fact, Trooper Arnold used the keys to lock the vehicle after removing most of its contents; it was parked in a well-lighted area of the service station; no effort was apparently made to contact Mrs. Smallwood, its registered owner, who lived nearby at Landover, in the same county; there is no showing why, if the avowed purpose was to take \u2018protective custody\u2019 of the property, it was not removed contemporaneously with the transportation of the Appellants from the scene of the arrests to the Marlboro Post . . . Trooper Arnold searched not only the trunk of the vehicle, but the suitcase in it (a fact inconsistent with \u2018protective custody\u2019) and while in the process of removing articles from the vehicle before he transported them to Marlboro \u2018to be inventoried,\u2019 suspected that they had been stolen; nor did Trooper Arnold remove <em>all </em>the contents of the vehicle. Corporal Ansell was required to return to the vehicle that evening \u2018to finish cleaning it out.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">Upon the facts in the record before us, we cannot conclude that the removal of the property from the vehicle and the search of its trunk and the suitcase therein by Trooper Arnold was reasonable and not in violation of the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In view of our disposition of the case on the search and seizure issue, it is unnecessary to deal with the two other contentions raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\">.
