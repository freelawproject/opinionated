Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) dealt with the right of the police to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d those whom the police deem to be \u201csuspicious persons\u201d. The Supreme Court said at 9-10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201cWe would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge that this question thrusts to the fore difficult and troublesome issues regarding a sensitive area of police activity. . . . Reflective of the tensions involved are the practical and constitutional arguments pressed with great vigor on both sides of the public debate over the power of the police \u2018to stop and frisk\u2019 \u2014 as it is sometimes euphemistically termed \u2014 suspicious persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The fabric of this case has been tailored to fit the pattern of the above-quoted portion of <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">The appellant, a juvenile, age 17, in company with two other juveniles, was observed by detectives of the Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>City Police Department, \u201cEscape and Apprehension Unit\u201d, crossing an intersection of Brentwood Avenue and Lanvale Street in Baltimore City. The observation occurred at approximately 9:45 A.M. on January 29, 1974. One of the three, not the appellant, was carrying a brown paper bag. A detective testified, \u201cOne of them looked familiar to us, as of a possible escapee.\u201d The detectives had in their automobiles a book with \u201cover five hundred photographs in it of individuals who are out of \u2014 or on escape.\u201d The three youths continued walking south on Brentwood Avenue toward Federal Street. The detectives \u201ctried to back up and make a right hand turn and go down the alley . . . [in order] to stop the individuals and check them out for identification and also to check our photographs because we thought one of them might be possibly an escapee.\u201d As the detectives approached the threesome, the juvenile who was carrying the paper bag ran. One officer stopped the appellant and a second youth. The other officer pursued the youth who had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The fleeing youth was apprehended, and the bag that he discarded during the course of his flight was recovered. The appellant produced no identification and in fact gave the police an alias.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police removed from the bag the contents thereof which proved to be a disassembled sawed-off shotgun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The three pieces of the gun were wrapped in a karate uniform. All three of the juveniles were arrested and transported to the police station. Approximately four hours later the appellant was searched and found to possess \u201cone hand-rolled cigarette\u201d containing what proved to be marihuana. Appellant also had in his possession one package of \u201ccigarette papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Appellant was charged in the Juvenile Court with \u201cunlawfully . . . [carrying] concealed on or about [his person] a dangerous or deadly weapon, to wit: a sawed-off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>shotgun.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was further charged with possessing a controlled dangerous substance, namely marihuana. At the outset of the delinquency hearing the State moved to dismiss the charge relating to carrying the shotgun because the appellant \u201cdid not at any time possess the shotgun.\u201d The charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel moved to suppress the evidence, <em>i.e., </em>the marihuana cigarette and the cigarette papers, on the ground that the arrest of the appellant was illegal, and hence the fruits of that arrest were unlawfully obtained. The judge denied the motion after finding that there was \u201cprobable cause for the [arresting] Officers to feel that a misdemeanor was being committed ... in [their] view.\u201d He assigned as reason therefor the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThe fact that he saw these young men, the fact that there was flight, the fact that there was found this sawed-off shotgun which in itself is a crime \u2014 the possession of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I am well aware of the fact that it was not found directly on this Respondent. He was charged with it. This was the charge placed that he was arrested for, and I think under the circumstances that have been described by the Officer the arrest was a lawful arrest. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>After being reminded by counsel for the appellant that there was no flight on the part of the appellant, the court responded, \u201cI know but they were all together, though. There was flight but the three of them were together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The shotgun was not offered into evidence, obviously because of the dismissal at the outset of the charge pertaining thereto, but the record makes it vividly clear that the gun was, nevertheless, displayed in the courtroom. We think the court erred in finding probable cause for the arrest of the appellant, and that the marihuana cigarette and cigarette papers should have been suppressed in the light of the illegality of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 230, 306 A. 2d 587 (1973) this Court considered a case wherein a police officer testified that he saw Gibbs and another male at about 11:30 in the morning standing on a street corner in \u201can area known to have a lot of assaults and robberies in the street, there\u2019s a lot of narcotics traffic in the area, there\u2019s a lot of crime, a high crime area.\u201d The arresting officer saw Gibbs and another male several times during the day. At about 3:45 P.M. he approached them. By that time a third male had joined Gibbs and his companion. When the officer alighted from an unmarked police vehicle and started toward the trio, two of them ran. Gibbs had his back turned and apparently did not see the officer. The officer asked Gibbs for identification. Gibbs did not have any and tried to run, but the officer grabbed his arm, frisked him, and found a fully loaded .22 caliber revolver in Gibbs\u2019s pocket. Judge Moylan, speaking for the Court in <em>Gibbs, supra, </em>pointed out that <em>Terry, supra, </em>and <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U. S. 40, 88 S. Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) allowed \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, but he noted that the arresting officer in <em>Gibbs </em>\u201carticulated absolutely nothing as to what crime or type of crime he reasonably suspected the appellant of having engaged in, of then engaging in, or of being about to engage in.\u201d Judge Moylan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201c . . . It is neither criminal nor quasi-criminal to stand around or to loaf about on a street corner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>particularly in broad daylight. Officer Stewart\u2019s predicate for the \u2018stop\u2019 was palpably \u2018nothing more substantial than [an] inarticulate hunch\u2019 or \u2018his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion,\u2019 condemned by <em>Terry </em>as inadequate. The \u2018stop\u2019 was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In <em>Sibron, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Harlan, in a concurring opinion, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201c . . .In the first place, although association with known criminals may, I think, properly be a factor contributing to the suspiciousness of circumstances, it does not, entirely by itself, create suspicion adequate to support a stop. There must be something at least in the activities of the person being observed or in his surroundings that affirmatively suggests particular criminal activity, completed, current, or intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Although the detective in the instant case stated that the appellant and the other two juveniles were in a high crime area that was replete with narcotics traffic and armed robberies which have \u201cbeen occurring with sawed-off shotguns and handguns\u201d, our independent review of the record fails to disclose that the appellant evidenced any conduct that would justify a \u201cstop\u201d within the meaning of <em>Terry, Sibron </em>and <em>Gibbs, supra. </em>It is no crime, of course, for three youths to walk on a sidewalk at 9:45 A.M. It is no crime to carry a paper bag. Such an occurrence, which we think to be an everyday happening, does not give rise to a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that any particular criminal activity has been completed, is afoot, or is contemplated. Nor does the fact that the detective \u201cthought one of them [not the appellant] might be possibly an escapee\u201d elevate his inchoate hunch to the level of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201c . . . [T]he police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. . . . Anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction. . . . And simple \u2018good faith\u2019 on the part of the arresting officer is not enough.\u201d <em>Terry, supra </em>at 21-22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><em>See also Gibbs, supra </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The arresting officer in the case at bar, in all probability acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d, but as noted in <em>Terry, </em>that is not a sufficient basis for the stop and subsequent search. Notwithstanding whatever basis the officer may have had for stopping the youth who fled, the stopping of appellant was a transgression of his Fourth Amendment rights. Under the holdings of <em>Terry, Sibron </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">.
