Burkart, </em>266 Md. 631, 647, 296 A. 2d 403 (1972). If such evidence does exist in the record, the matter is considered to be \u201cfairly debatable\u201d, and the courts may not substitute their judgment for that of the board which is presumed to exercise a degree of expertise in \u2022 zoning. <em>Agneslane Inc. v. Lucas, </em>247 Md. 612, 233 A. 2d 757 (1967); <em>Board v. Oak Hill Farms, </em>232 Md. 274, 192 A. 2d 761 (1963); <em>Largo Civic Ass\u2019n v. Pr. Geo\u2019s Co., </em>21 Md. App. 76, 90, 318 A. 2d 834 (1974). On the other hand, where the action of the board is not supported by substantial evidence the board\u2019s decision cannot be said to be \u201cfairly debatable\u201d. Under those circumstances the board\u2019s finding falls into the category of being arbitrary, capricious and a denial of due process of law. <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Horn, </em>266 Md. 280, 283, 292 A. 2d 77, 78-79 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>With that background firmly in mind, we now consider the instant appeal. Nelson Neuman is the owner of property known as 4616 Curtis Avenue in Baltimore City. The land is improved by a two story building. The lot upon which the building has been erected is 87 feet long and 21 feet wide. The building measurements are approximately 60 feet by 21 feet. The first floor of the building has been used since 1968 or 1970 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the repair and maintenance of tractors <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that are over IV2 ton capacity. Prue Scott rents the property from Neuman, and he is the actual operator of the business that is conducted on the premises. Scott testified before the board that he owns the tractors upon which the maintenance is performed at the site, they are five in number, and he rents some of them to others for use in hauling trailers and uses some of them himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Prior to the enactment of a comprehensive zoning ordinance on April 20, 1971, now known as Ordinance 1051, the Neuman property was in a second commercial use district. The repair of motor vehicles was permitted under that zoning classification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore adopted Ordinance 1051, after years of study, the instant property was rezoned to a classification known as a B-2-2 zoning district.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A motor vehicle repair or maintenance business is not a permitted use in an area that is zoned B-2, and if Neuman is to be allowed to continue the use of the property for motor vehicle repair and maintenance, it may only be on the basis that such use lawfully existed prior to the adoption of Ordinance 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Recognizing that Ordinance 1051 would result in a number of properties being placed in the non-conforming use category, the Mayor and City Council of the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Baltimore provided in \u00a7 8.0-1 of the Ordinance that \u201c[a]ny non-conforming use or structure, or any non-complying structure, may be continued, subject to the regulations of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Neuman made application to be allowed to continue the use of his property for tractor maintenance and repair as a non-conforming use. The City zoning enforcement officer denied the application, as he was bound to do under Ordinance 1051, and Neuman appealed to the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals. There were two separate hearings before the Board. At the first hearing twelve protestants, including elected public officials, appeared. Several other elected officials communicated their objections, in writing, to the Board. Although the protestants were vocal and adamant in their opposition to the use of the Neuman property for tractor maintenance and repair, the testimony of Neuman, Scott and the protestants leads to the inescapable conclusion that the Neuman building had been used for that purpose prior to April 20, 1971, the date of the adoption of Ordinance 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Section 8.0-7c of Ordinance 1051 confers upon the Board the authority to determine, after public notice and hearing, whether a non-conforming use does, in fact, exist. In the case now before us, the Board, by a vote of two pro and three contra,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> adopted a resolution in which the Board found that the proposed \u201cuse is in violation of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.\u201d The Board denied the Neuman application. Neuman appealed to the Baltimore City Court where the judge remanded the case to the Board for the purpose of having the Board make a specific finding as to the existence <em>vel non </em>of a non-conforming use, and whether \u201c . . . there can be a lawful non-conforming use without a permit for said use being issued.\u201d At the re-hearing, the testimony was limited to the quoted proposition put to the Board by the hearing judge. The Board then held that \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>possible that a lawful, non-conforming use can exist without a permit,\u201d but the Board decided, by a vote of two pro and two contra<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \u201cfrom the facts adduced at the public hearing a non-conforming use did \u201cnot, in fact, exist.\u201d Neuman again appealed to the Baltimore City Court where the judge, after argument, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">\u201c. .. [L]ooking at the record, I cannot say that the record is wanting or is not legally sufficient to sustain [the Board\u2019s] finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">It is not for me to substitute my judgment for the Board if, indeed, there is sufficient evidence before the Board to undergird its position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">I find as a fact that there is sufficient evidence, and therefore, the decision of the Zoning Board will be affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We have carefully reviewed the transcripts of the testimony presented to the Board at the hearing and the re-hearing. Our perusal of those transcripts fails to disclose even a scintilla of evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that a non-conforming use did not exist. The protestants objected to the traffic, noise and pollution that the business generated in their neighborhood, but they did not contradict Neuman\u2019s evidence of the existence of a non-conforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">It is crystal clear that the Board acted not only without \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d, but without any evidence, to support its findings, and its decision should have been reversed by the hearing judge. Zoning should never be allowed or disallowed on the basis of a plebiscite of the neighborhood. <em>Mont. Co. Council v. Scrimgeour, </em>211 Md. 306, 127 A. 2d 528 (1956); <em>Mayor and Council v. Cotler, </em>230 Md. 335, 187 A. 2d 94 (1963). That, however, is what seems to have happened in this case. The action taken by the Board was arbitrary, capricious and denied Neuman due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">In its brief and on oral argument the City asserts that because Neuman did not obtain a certificate of occupancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>for the use of the building for motor vehicle repair and maintenance that the use is \u201cunlawful\u201d, Baltimore City Code, art. 30, \u00a7 46 (1966), and no valid non-conforming use may be predicated upon an unlawful use. The City states that even if a non-conforming use is held to have existed prior to the adoption of Ordinance 1051, Neuman is not entitled to continue such use because, from its inception, it is invalid for lack of a permit. This interesting question, while posed to the Board by the hearing judge, and answered by that body, was, nevertheless, not disclosed by the record to have been presented to the court and decided by it. It is not properly before us, and we decline to consider it. Md. Rule 1085. <em>See Ramsey v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>18 Md. App. 385, 308 A. 2d 217 (1973); <em>Little v. Duncan, </em>14 Md.
