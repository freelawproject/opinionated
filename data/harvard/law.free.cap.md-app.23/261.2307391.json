Thomas, then age 65, was pulling a lawn mower when he hurt his back. The injury, which occurred on May 25, 1970, led Thomas to file a claim under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Md. Ann. Code art. 101. The County raised the issue of \u201capportionment\u201d and impleaded the Subsequent Injury Fund as a party. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, in a \u201cSupplemental Award of Compensation\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that Thomas had \u201csustained a permanent partial disability under \u2018Other Cases\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amounting to <em>607c </em>industrial loss of use of his body as a result of the injury to the lumbosacral area . . . and . . . 4091 of such disability is reasonably attributable to his accidental injury on May 25, 1970, and 209r thereof is due to a pre-existing disease and/or disability . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Commission went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cTechnically the claimant is permanently totally disabled. However, <em>a progressive condition subsequent to the accidental injury is making the claimant permanently totally disabled, i.e., </em>arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. This case differs from the Rhyhardt (sic) case (Maryland Appellate Report, Vol. 12 page 649) as in this case the condition was not aggravated, accerbated (sic) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>nor precipitated by the accidental injury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Thomas, asserting that the findings of the Commission were inconsistent, requested a rehearing. He argued that if he were \u201ctechnically . . . permanently totally disabled\u201d, the award patently should have been for a lOO'it industrial loss of use of the body and not just <em>607c </em>as found by the Commission. The Commission, obviously unmoved by that argument, affirmed its previous order. Thomas then appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, assigning as his reason that the award of the Commission should be reversed, the same contentions he made at the rehearing before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After his appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County had been perfected, Thomas moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 610. The court denied the motion on the basis that the date for determining the prior impairment of the claimant \u201cwas the date of the injury and not the date of the hearing before the Commission.\u201d Thereafter, the matter was heard <em>de novo, </em>apparently on the record made before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, before a different judge. The court affirmed the Commission, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201c. .. [Thomas] is not entitled, under Section 66 [Md. Ann. Code art. 101] dealing with \u2018permanent disability due to combined effects of impairment, and subsequent injury\u2019, to an award from the \u2018Subsequent Injury Fund\u2019 based on disability due to \u2018impairment\u2019 of 80 per cent as of the date of the hearing before the Commission, when the evidence proves that the claimant\u2019s disability due to \u2018impairment\u2019 as of the date of the industrial accident was 40 per cent only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">It is readily apparent that the court and the Commission were of the opinion that the \u201cimpairment\u201d referred to in Md. Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 66 (1) is to be calculated as of the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of the subsequent accidental injury. Section 66 (1) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201c\u00a7 66. Subsequent Injury Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">(1) <em>Permanent disability or death due to combined effects of impairment and subsequent injury; reimbursement for supplemental allowance payments made under </em>\u00a7 <em>36. </em>\u2014 Whenever an employee who has a permanent impairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition, which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to his employment, incurs subsequent disability by reason of a personal injury, for which compensation is required by this article resulting in permanent partial or permanent total disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall be liable only for the compensation payable under this article for such injury. However, in addition to such compensation to which the employer or his insurance carrier is liable, and after the completion of payments therefor provided by this article, the employee shall be entitled to receive and shall be paid additional compensation from a special fund to be known as the \u2018Subsequent Injury Fund\u2019 created for such purpose, in the manner described hereafter in this section, it being the intent of this section to make the total payments to which such employee shall become entitled equal to the compensation that would be due for the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury resulting in permanent total disability or a substantially greater permanent partial disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Benefits from the Subsequent Injury Fund hereunder shall not be payable unless the combined effects resulting from a previous impairment and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>subsequent accidental injury result in a permanent disability exceeding 50 per centum (50%) of the body as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We have stated that the purpose of \u00a7 66 (1) is to dissuade employers from refusing to hire handicapped individuals. In order to accomplish that purpose the section limits the liability of the employer in the event that a previously handicapped employee sustains a subsequent occupational injury which though not of itself disabling, nevertheless, when coupled with the prior impairment, renders the employee permanently disabled, \u201cthus exposing the employer to liability for the cumulative effect of the prior and subsequent injuries.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, 250 </em>Md. 306, 242 A. 2d 506 (1968). Under the provisions of <em>\u00a7 </em>66 (1) the employer is liable only for compensation payable to the employee as the result of the subsequent injury, and \u201cthe Fund [is] obligated to pay the rest.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md. App. 369, 372, n. 2, 274 A. 2d 870 (1971), <em>aff'd mem., </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A. 2d 444 (1971). <em>See also Dent v. Cahill, </em>18 Md. App. 117, 305 A. 2d 233 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Fund suggests that the Maryland statute is \u201csimilar\u201d to that of the State of Florida. The Florida law, Fla. Stat., Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 440.49 (4) (b) (1973), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cAs used in this subsection, permanent physical impairment means any permanent condition due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to employment and which was known to the employer prior to the occurrence of the subsequent injury or occupational disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The Florida statute makes it manifest that the impairment must be \u201cknown to the employer\u201d prior to employment. Maryland, however, has no such employer knowledge provision in its Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and we do not think this Court should, by judicial fiat, amend \u00a7 66 (1) by appending thereto words of qualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>similar to those appearing in the Florida law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proper \u201cjudicial function is that of interpretation; it does not include the power of amendment under the guise of interpretation.\u201d <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379, 57 S. Ct. 578, 81 L. Ed. 703 (1937).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the Fund desires amendment of the statute, it should seek that amendment through the legislative process and not through the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In <em>Subsequent Inj. Fund v. Rinehart, </em>12 Md. App. 649, 280 A. 2d 298 (1971) we considered the application of \u00a7 66 (1) to an employee who sustained a head injury and who died within a ten month span from \u201ca malignant brain tumor.\u201d The Fund argued \u201cthat there was no pre-existing impairment of which the decedent or anyone else was <em>aware </em>at the time, and that the decedent had not experienced, <em>before the injury, </em>any hindrance to his employment, and reason[ed] that the disease was not one contemplated under \u00a7 66(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Judge Powers, speaking for this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201c. . . [T]he trial judge was correct in ruling, . . . that as a matter of law the decedent, at the time of the injury, had a permanent impairment due to disease which was likely to be a hindrance to his employment, and his death was due in part to that impairment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">After noting that \u00a7 66 (1) is directed toward a \u201csomewhat different social and economic public policy\u201d than \u00a7 36 (7), Judge Powers stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201c. . . When an employee sustains an accidental injury in the course of his employment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>such injury, combining with a pre-existing \u2018permanent impairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition, which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to his employment\u2019, contributes to his death, or contributes to a disability which is greater than 50% of the body as a whole, it is the declared intent of \u00a7 66 (1) \u2018to make the total payments to which such employee shall become entitled equal to the compensation that would be due for the combined effects of the impairment and the subsequent injury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Fund in the instant case, while stating that it does not desire an overruling of <em>Rinehart, supra, </em>nevertheless seeks that result. If we were to follow the reasoning of the Fund, the Commission and the trial court, we would have to hold that \u00a7 66 (1) is to be applied in a restrictive and narrow manner. But, as we said in <em>Board of Co. Comm\u2019rs. v. Fleming, </em>13 Md. App. 261, 282 A. 2d 512 (1971), \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to be as liberally construed in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. . . .\u201d <em>See Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard v. Hempfield, </em>206 Md. 589, 112 A. 2d 488 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The Fund asks us to read \u00a7 66 (1) to mean that only that degree of prior impairment existing at the moment that the subsequent accidental injury occurs, may be considered in apportioning an award under \u00a7 66 (1). If that were the case, the <em>Rinehart </em>decision would have been different. There the fact finder would have had to determine what, if any, industrial impairment Rinehart had prior to the time he fell and hurt his head. The answer to that question would be that there was no measurable degree of impairment because while the claimant had a malignant brain tumor, it was not evident. As we read \u00a7 66 (1) and <em>Rinehart, supra, </em>it is immaterial whether the \u201cprevious accident or disease or . . . congenital condition\u201d was apparent at the time of the accidental injury. The Maryland law is that the employee is entitled to receive from'his employer or its insurance carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that percentage of disability, if any, resulting directly from the accident, and he is further entitled to receive from the Fund that percentage of disability representing the combined effect of the accidental injury and any \u201cimpairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition\u201d, less the percentage of disability arising from the current accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We observe nothing within the ambit of \u00a7 66 (1) which narrows the scope of that social remedial legislation to the confines sought by the Fund. We expressly reaffirm the holding of <em>Rinehart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">There was, of course, evidence before the trial court which would entitle the court to conclude that Thomas had a permanent partial disability of 60% of his body, notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s statement that Thomas was \u201c[technically permanently totally disabled.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As we said in <em>Dent v. Cahill, supra </em>at 127:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cUnder the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 36 (1) (a) the Commission, as the original fact finder, is required to determine permanent total disability upon the facts of each particular case. On appeal to the trial court, the court in a non-jury trial, or the jury if there be a jury trial, may disagree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the facts and arrive at a different conclusion, <em>Richard F. Kline, Inc. v. Grosh, </em>[245 Md. 236, 226 A. 2d 147 (1967)] subject to the caveat that the decisions of the Commission are <em>prima facie </em>correct, Md. Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 56 (c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Our review of the record in the instant case indicates that the trial judge predicated his decision upon a finding of that degree of impairment existing at the time of the subsequent injury. The rule is that the disability resulting from the combination of the previous impairment and the subsequent injury is to be evaluated as of the time the claimant attains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>maximum improvement of the subsequent injury. We reverse the decision of the trial court and remand with instructions that it, on the evidence before it, determine Thomas\u2019s disability in the light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The County advised us on oral argument that it accepts liability for the payment of 40% permanent partial disability \u201cunder Other Cases\u201d and expresses no opinion as to the propriety, <em>vel non, </em>of the Fund\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Subsequent Injury Fund.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">. The original \u201cAward of Compensation\u201d, passed on August 5, 1970, determined that Thomas had sustained an accidental injury arising out of his employment and was entitled to temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\">. Md. Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 36 (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. One state, New York, has followed the approach suggested by the Fund, and has read into its second injury statute a requirement of employer knowledge. Zyla v. A.D. Juilliard &amp; Co., 277 App. Div. 604, 102 N.Y.S.2d 255 (1951). This approach has been subjected to scholarly criticism. Professor Larson notes in his treatise that the employer knowledge requirement was \u201cengrafted upon the statute by judicial construction,\u201d and states that a \u201creason for disapproving the New York rule is that... it involves one of those distinctions that consume far more litigation time and cost than the policy at stake is worth.\u201d A.
