J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">On 9 January 1973 an indictment was filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against WALTER EDWARD BROADWAY <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging him in the first count with robbery with a deadly weapon and in eight other counts with related offenses, including under the ninth count that he unlawfully used a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. When the indictment came on for trial on 10 April 1973, Broadway filed a motion to dismiss it. The ground for the motion was that he was 17 years of age on 6 December 1972, the date of the commission of the crimes. He claimed that the juvenile court had original jurisdiction over him, and had not waived it. Upon a hearing on the motion, at which it was stipulated that Broadway was born on 10 November 1955, the motion was denied. Broadway noted an appeal from the denial, but dismissed it on 11 May 1973. He was tried before a jury and on 14 September 1973 was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>guilty under the first and ninth counts. Upon receipt of a pre-sentence report he was sentenced on 16 October to 11 years on the robbery conviction and to a consecutive sentence of 5 years on the handgun violation. He filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Broadway\u2019s first two contentions attack the propriety of the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Chapter 514, Acts 1972, \u00a7 1, effective 1 July 1972, codified as Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3), designated an additional exemption in the general law to the exclusive original jurisdiction of a juvenile court. It provided that the court does not have jurisdiction over \u201cA proceeding involving a child who has reached his sixteenth birthday, alleged to have done an act in violation of \u00a7 488 of Article 27 concerning the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon, unless an order removing the proceeding to the juvenile court has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 594A of Article 27.\u201d Chapter 772, Acts 1973, effective 1 July 1973, amended the exemption to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201cA proceeding involving a child who has reached his sixteenth birthday, alleged to have done an act which, if committed by an adult, would be punishable by \u00a7 488 of Article 27 as robbery with a deadly weapon, unless an order removing the proceeding to the juvenile court has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 594A of Article 27.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The exemption now appears in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Courts Art.) as \u00a7 3-808 (4) in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201cThe court does not have jurisdiction over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">(4) A child 16 years or older alleged to have committed the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon, unless an order removing the proceeding to the juvenile court has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 594A of Article 27.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Revisor says in his note: \u201cParagraph (4) reflects the change made by ch. 772, Acts of 1973, clarifying the language concerning jurisdiction over the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Broadway first argues, as he argued below, that the exemption as in effect at the time he was indicted was \u201cso uncertain, incomplete, or conflicting\u201d that it cannot be executed and must be \u201cdeclared inoperative and void.\u201d The premise of this argument is that Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 488 does not create a substantive crime but only authorizes a penalty for the common law crime of robbery more severe when the robbery is committed with a deadly weapon than when it is not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He cites as authority for the premise the decisions of this Court \u2014 <em>McChan v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 311, 315; <em>Parker v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 167, 197; <em>Barnes v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 144, 146; <em>Jones v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 608, 613; <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 407, 413. Therefore, he posits, he could not have been \u201calleged to have done an act in violation of \u00a7 488 of Article 27\u201d because the statute creates no offense to be violated. It follows that the exemption is meaningless and the juvenile court had exclusive original jurisdiction over him which it did not waive. Thus, he claims, the indictment was improperly returned, he cannot be tried under it, and it should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The argument gave the lower court no pause, and it gives us none. The court below found the clear legislative intent to have been that a child of 16 years or older, alleged to have committed the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon, is without the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. We are in complete agreement. It may be that the statute as originally enacted could have been more artfully drafted, but the legislative intent, as obviously demonstrated by the subsequent clarifying amendments, was clear and unambiguous. We note that all presumptions favor the constitutionality of a duly enacted statute, and it will not be declared unconstitutional unless it plainly contravenes the federal or state constitution. <em>Woodell v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 433. We said in <em>Bacheller v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 626, 632: \u201cThe formulation of statutory language is, at best, an inexact exercise vulnerable to varying degrees of doubt and ambiguity. Therefore, the enunciation of the meaning and ambit of a specific statute by judicial construction strives to ascertain and define the legislative intent and purpose, and upon making of a determination of the legislative meaning the efficacy of the statute is more clearly and precisely promulgated.\u201d As indicated, we have no doubt here of the legislative intent and purpose. We hold that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. See <em>Anderson v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Broadway\u2019s second contention <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> follows the rationale of our decision in <em>Matter of Trader, </em>20 Md. App. 1. Under the public general law an order waiving juvenile jurisdiction is interlocutory and not immediately appealable. Under the public local law applicable to Montgomery County such an order is final and immediately appealable. We held the public general law to be void because the differences between the public general law and the public local law mounted up to an invidious discrimination violative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>equal protection clause of the constitution. The Court of Appeals on grant of certiorari to this Court did not see it that way on the record submitted. It said: \u201cSince no evidence was adduced in the proceedings below to demonstrate the lack of a reasonable basis for the statutory distinction, and since the difference in treatment is not so irrational as to be invidiously discriminatory on its face, we hold on the record in Trader\u2019s case that he was not denied equal protection of the laws by reason of the provisions of \u00a7 3-817 of the public general law declaring that a waiver is interlocutory.\u201d <em>Matter of Trader, </em>272 Md. 364. In its <em>Trader </em>opinion the Court of Appeals decided three other cases spinning off of our <em>Trader </em>holding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of them, <em>State v. Stokes, </em>is determinative of Broadway\u2019s contention. We give its factual posture in the words of the Court of Appeals, <em>Matter of Trader, </em>272 Md., at 375, 376:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201cAppellee Stokes was charged with armed robbery in the Criminal Court of Baltimore; he was then 16 years old. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \u00a7 3-808(4) of the public general law, excluding a child 16 years or older from the juvenile jurisdiction of the court, was unconstitutional because no similar provision exempted children from treatment as juveniles under the Montgomery County law. The court (Liss, J.), relying principally upon <em>Matter of Trader, supra, </em>granted the motion to dismiss, holding \u00a7 3-808(4) violative of the equal protection clause. * * * The court concluded as a matter of constitutional law \u2018that whenever any substantial right or privilege is granted to a juvenile in Montgomery County, all other juveniles in the State are entitled to the same right or privilege.\u2019 The State appealed the dismissal of Stokes\u2019 indictment to the Court of Special Appeals; we granted certiorari prior to decision by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Special Appeals upon the State\u2019s petition seeking our review of the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The Court of Appeals said, at 401, 402:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cAs in <em>Matter of Trader, </em>the record before us in <em>Stokes </em>contains no evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that no state of facts conceivable exists to justify the treatment of a 16-year-old child who commits armed robbery as an adult offender under the public general law while requiring a similarly situated child under the Montgomery County law to he waived before becoming subject to criminal prosecution. Nothing in <em>Long v. Robinson </em>[316 F. Supp. 22 (D. Md. 1970), affirmed in <em>Long and Robinson, </em>436 F. 2d 1116 (4th Cir. 1971)] compels such a result and we reject the notion espoused by the trial judge in <em>Stokes </em>\u2018that whenever any substantial right or privilege is granted to a juvenile in Montgomery County, all other juveniles in the State are entitled to the same right or privilege.\u2019 The difference in treatment afforded 16-year-old armed robbers by the two laws is not, on its face, so irrational and invidiously discriminatory as to constitute a denial of the equal protection clause, particularly in view of the reverse waiver provisions contained in the public general law. In the absence of the requisite showing of unconstitutionality by the party attacking the legislative classification, it cannot be said that it does not rest upon <em>any </em>reasonable basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">As in <em>Stokes, </em>the requisite showing of unconstitutionality by the party attacking the legislative classification was here absent. We hold that the court below did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">By ch. 13, Acts 1972 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the General Assembly devised a scheme to curb the commission of violent crimes involving the use of handguns.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To effectuate its declared policy <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it met the problem in two ways. First, it attempted to curtail the ready accessibility of handguns, and second, it discouraged the use of them in the commission of crimes. With respect to the first, it made the wearing, carrying, or transporting of handguns a misdemeanor and fixed penalties to be imposed upon conviction of the misdemeanor. Code, Art. 27, <em>\u00a7 </em>36B (b). Subsection (b) provided, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cAny person who shall wear, carry, or transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, upon or about his person, and any person who shall wear, carry or knowingly transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, in any vehicle traveling upon the public roads, highways, waterways, or airways or upon roads or parking lots generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>' used .by the public in this State shall be guilty of a - misdemeanor; and it shall be a rebuttable - presumption that the person is knowingly transporting-the handgun;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It also empowered the seizure and forfeiture of handguns, \u00a7 3.6C, and as an aid thereto, authorized a \u201climited search\u201d in the nature of a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, \u00a7 36D. It authorized -the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police to. issue -permit's to carry handguns, carefully 'spelling out the conditions under\u2019which such .permits could be issued, and designated those, persons authorized to- wear' or carry a handgun without a permit, \u00a7 36\u00c9. -, - .</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">With respect to the second way the General Assembly attempted to effectuate its declared policy, it created the separate offense of using a handgun in the commission of certain- crimes. and specified a mandatory sentence. See <em>Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 291. Section 36B (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\"Any person who shall us'e a handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence .as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, shall be guilty of a. separate misdemeanor and on' conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of . said felony or misdemeanor; be sentenced to the Maryland Division of Correction for -a term of not less than -five <em>nor more </em>than fifteen years, and it is mandatory upon the court to impose no less than the minimum sentence of five years.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Finally, the General Assembly expressly pre-empted the right of regulation in such matters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">As we have indicated, Broadway was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon and with violation of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (d). The victim of the robbery was George VanDuzer, in charge of the 4:00 to 11:00 p.m. shift at a gas station. He testified that shortly after 11:00 p.m. on 6 December 1972 he was sitting at his desk in the station sorting the money collected during the shift. Two men were at the cigarette machine and complained that it was hot working. When VanDuzer said he had nothing to do with the machine, one of the men pointed a chrome plated revolver at him and told the other man to take the money. The other man, positively identified in court by VanDuzer as Broadway, took the money. Both men fled. The testimony of VanDuzer was legally sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the felony of robbery with a deadly weapon and the criminal agency of Broadway therein as a principal in the first degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 598, 603-604; <em>Ham v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 474, 479; <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 407, 412-414; <em>Agresti v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 278, 280-281. VanDuzer was the only eyewitness to the robbery, and there was no evidence adduced to show that the handgun described by him was ever in the actual possession of Broadway or that Broadway had actual possession of a handgun used in the commission of the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">(u)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Broadway bases his third and final contention on a construction of \u00a7 36B (d). He claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cIn order to convict a person of violation. of Article 27, Section 36B (d) the State must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that the appellant personally used a handgun while committing a crime of violence.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">He presented the point below in moving for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence offered by the State. He renewed the motion at the close of all the evidence. The motion was denied. The point goes to the sufficiency of the evidence and was preserved for appellate review by the motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 593; Rule 755; <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The crime created by \u00a7 36B (d) is designated a misdemeanor. At common law all participants in misdemeanors are principals. 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 104.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This rule is the law of Maryland. <em>Agresti v. State, supra, </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It was shown, as we have indicated, that Broadway was a principal in the first degree in the commission of the robbery. It was established that a handgun was used in the commission of that felony. The handgun used was in the actual possession of a co-perpetrator of the robbery, who, it is clear from the evidence, also committed the separate misdemeanor proscribed by \u00a7 36B (d). Broadway would be a principal with respect to that misdemeanor if he participated in it, abetted it, or procured it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We do not construe \u00a7 36B (d) as does Broadway. We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>nothing in subsection (d) to indicate that the Legislature intended that a handgun be in the \u201cpersonal possession\u201d of a person to bring him within the ambit of its prohibitions. In its detailed and comprehensive legislative scheme, the General Assembly made clear that possession was an element of the misdemeanor created by \u00a7 36B (d), for it specified that the weapon worn, carried, or transported, whether concealed or open, be \u201cupon or about his person\u201d or \u201cin any vehicle\u201d traveling on certain roads.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But no such phrase appears in subsection (d). There the prohibition is against the \u201cuse\u201d of a handgun. We think it obvious, for example, that a person who gives a handgun to another, or obtains one for him, for use in the commission of the crime, abets the misdemeanor, and as an abettor is a principal subject to the provisions of the statute. We think it equally obvious, for further example, that a person who hires another to commit the crime with a handgun, or importunes another to commit it, procures the misdemeanor, and as a procurer or inciter is a principal subject to the provisions of the statute. Here, however, there is no evidence sufficient to show that Broadway was an abettor or procurer in the frame of reference discussed, so the question is, therefore, whether he \u201cparticipated\u201d in the misdemeanor in the light of the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is correct that Broadway was not shown to have a handgun in his personal possession during the commission of the robbery. But he stole the money under its threat. He \u201cused\u201d the weapon to commit the robbery as effectively as if he personally held it. Just as Broadway\u2019s companion in the robbery stole the money even though he did not personally take it, Broadway used the gun in the commission of the robbery even though he did not personally hold it. To say in such circumstances that Broadway was not a participant in the use of the handgun in the commission of the robbery would be to circumvent the declared policy of the Legislature and render impotent in no small measure its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>carefully designated scheme to effectuate that policy. We find that Broadway was a participant in the misdemeanor , proscribed by \u00a7 36B (d). As a participant he was a principal. As a principal he was chargeable with the misdemeanor and. punishable for its commission. We hold that the court below did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-12\">.
