The memorandum then recites that a requested dispositional hearing was held on the same date which resulted in the master\u2019s recommendation that appellant be committed to \u201cBoys\u2019 Village.\u201d An order was attached to the recommendation to be signed by a judge of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division of Juvenile Causes. Appellant filed exceptions on the same day of the hearing and recommendations by the master, April 4,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Chronologically, the event next appearing in the record occurred four days later on April 8, 1974, when the \u201cOrder of Commitment\u201d pursuant to the recommendations was signed by the Judge. The \u201cOrder of Commitment\u201d recited that \u201cit has been <em>duly adjudged after hearing </em>before . . . Judge of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes, that <em>[the juvenile by name] </em>is a delinquent child and is by reason thereof in need of care and treatment.\u201d [Emphasis added]. The juvenile was then committed to the authorities of Boys\u2019 Village \u201cto be kept and detained under [their] care and custody . . . .\u201d The <em>de novo </em>hearing was not held, however, until May 3, 1974. It is a strange proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>indeed <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where judgment is rendered before the hearing is held.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The Premature Order</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Md. Rule 908 e 2 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cThe petitioner or any party may file written exceptions to the master\u2019s findings or recommendations or any part thereof within five (5) days after the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">In the <em>Matter of Anderson, Epps, Smith and Brady, </em>20 Md. App. 31,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we vacated an order approving the findings and recommendations of a master which was entered before the time for exceptions had expired. The State attempts to distinguish our holding there by arguing that when appellant filed the exceptions on the first day, the remainder of the five day period had no further \u201clegal significance\u201d for appellant, and the judge should have been permitted to act on the master\u2019s findings. While that statement at first appears technically correct the State overlooks the \u201clegal significance\u201d of the filing of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Md. Rule 908 e 3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u201cIf, within the specified time, exceptions are filed, the judge shall hear the <em>entire matter </em>or such specific matters as set forth in the exceptions <em>de novo.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">The meaning given <em>de novo </em>by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>is \u201cAnew; afresh; a second time.\u201d Appellant therefore, is not an \u201cadjudicated delinquent\u201d until the <em>de novo </em>hearing is held and judgment properly rendered by the court. Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s precipitous execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>order pursuant to the master\u2019s recommendation, appellant remains an \u201calleged delinquent\u201d until the requisite hearing is held. While the court in a proper case may <em>detain </em>the juvenile, pending his \u201ctrial of new\u201d just as he could have been <em>detained </em>before the master\u2019s hearing, due to appellant\u2019s continued status as an \u201calleged delinquent,\u201d that detention may not ordinarily be in a facility to which children who have been adjudicated delinquent are committed. The only exception is when adequate facilities have not been established for such detainees <em>and </em>it appears \u201cthat public safety and protection reasonably require detention.\u201d Courts Art., \u00a7 3-823. The record here establishes neither of the conditions necessary for detention of an \u201calleged\u201d delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Questionable detention notwithstanding, we repeat for emphasis that appellant was surely entitled to a hearing before the court rendered its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Failure To Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although the commitment order recited that it was \u201cadjudged after hearing,\u201d no hearing was held until May 3, 1974. Appellant did not appear on that date although his counsel did. His absence was explained by the court and affirmed by counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Reddick, I do not see the Respondent present here today, and my understanding of the posture of the case is, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that \u2014 and I received \u2014 My Bailiff just gave me a memorandum from Mr. John L. Herman of the Probation Department. Memorandum of todays date saying that this Respondent was tried on this charge on April 4, 1974 before Master Rifman. He was found delinquent and committed by the master to Boys Village; that an exception was filed and that the matter was set for hearing before me on todays date, but, that on April the sixth, 1974 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Respondent escaped from Boys Village and remains as an escapee, whereabouts unknown at this time.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that he did not waive his right to a trial <em>de novo </em>is totally disingenuous. As stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter dissenting in <em>Eisler v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 189, 192 a court \u201ccan entertain a case and decide it only if there is a litigant before-it against whom the court may enforce its decision.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument that there is no evidence of notice to appellant of the date and place of hearing is belied by his counsel\u2019s presence at the hearing. Following the guidance of the Supreme Court of the United State we find it \u201cclearly within [the] discretion [of the hearing judge] to refuse to hear a criminal case in error, unless the convicted party, suing out the writ, is where he can be made to respond to any judgment [the court] may render.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>94 U. S. 97. Although juvenile causes are held in the Circuit Court, and are not a \u201ccriminal case in error\u201d the reasoning remains valid. It woyld be perfectly ridiculous to permit the right to a hearing to remain 'open until appellant chose to appear, notwithstanding the possibility of lost witnesses, and dimmed recollections during the period of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The order of commitment is vacated; however, the <em>de novo </em>hearing has been waived by appellant. Upon remand the court is enjoined peremptorily to confirm, modify or remand the master\u2019s findings and recommendations as if no exceptions had been filed within the prescribed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\n<em>Order of April 8, 197U approving the finding and recommendation of the master vacated; case remanded with direction to Juvenile Judge to enter a new order in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-12\">. \u201cNo, No! \u201d said the queen. \u201cSentence first \u2014 verdict afterwards.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense! \u201d said Alice loudly. \u201cThe idea of having the sentence first! \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\"><em>Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, </em>Chap. 12, p. 187.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-14\">.
