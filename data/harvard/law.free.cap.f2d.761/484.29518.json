The complaint alleges a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, <em>et seq., </em>and also sets forth a pendent common law claim alleging a conspiracy to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s contractual rights and business expectancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-21\">In their motions to dismiss or for summary judgment, defendants argued that their acts were protected under the <em>Noerr-Pen-nington </em>doctrine, that plaintiff failed to allege injury to competition and therefore has not stated a cause of action under the Sherman Act, and that plaintiff\u2019s interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>commerce allegations are insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction. This Court, agreeing with the District Court that an interlocutory appeal might advance materially the ultimate determination of this litigation, certified all the foregoing issues for review. We now conclude that defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss or for summary judgment should have been granted, since defendants are correct that their acts are protected under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine and also that the complaint does not allege an injury to competition. In view of our holding with respect to those two issues, we do not address the question of whether the \u201caffecting commerce\u201d jurisdictional test has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In February 1982, plaintiff Razorback Ready Mix Concrete Co., Inc. (Razorback), entered into a contract for the sale of its entire business to Razorback Quality Concrete Company. The sale was made contingent upon the issuance of certain tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds by Pulaski County, Arkansas. The bond issue in question was scheduled to be sold to the general public on or about May 12, 1982. Most of the proceeds from the bond issue were to be used to pay off Razorback\u2019s corporate debt, with the remainder of the proceeds to be used for expansion of the business and for the purchase of new equipment to be used in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Defendants are competitors of Razorback in the ready-mix concrete business. They made their opposition to this bond issue known to the local official who was about to approve it, the county judge, who nevertheless entered an order on April 20, 1982 authorizing the issuance of the bonds. Defendants thereupon filed suit challenging the judge\u2019s authority to issue the bonds. They also filed an appeal of his order to the Circuit Court for Pulaski County. Defendants were joined in their suit by six members of the Pulaski County Quorum Court, which is the legislative body for Pulaski County. The suit alleged that the proposed bond issue violated several provisions of the Arkansas Constitution. It also alleged that the bond issue was not proposed in good faith for a proper purpose, and that the county judge had acted unreasonably and oppressively in authorizing the bond issue to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">As a result of defendants\u2019 actions, the bonds were never issued and Razorback, unable to meet its financial obligations, went into bankruptcy in June 1982. The business thereafter was sold in bankruptcy to a third party and remains in operation to the present as a vendor of ready-mix concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Defendants contend that the legal action they took to block the bond issue was privileged under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The import of the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, which was formulated in the cases of <em>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961) and <em>United Mine Workers v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965), is to immunize from antitrust scrutiny attempts to induce the passage or enforcement of law or to solicit governmental action even though the result of such activities is to cause injury to others. This immunity derives from basic First Amendment principles and extends not only to attempts to influence legislative and executive functions but also to \u201cthe use of administrative or judicial processes.\u201d <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, </em>410 U.S. 366, 380, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 1031, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\"><em>Noerr </em>left open the possibility that the political process may be so abused that efforts to influence the government are mere \u201cshams\u201d intended to cover anti-competitive activity. <em>See </em>365 U.S. at 140, 81 S.Ct. at 531. The \u201csham exception\u201d was later confirmed in <em>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 511-16, 92 S.Ct. 609, 612-15, 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>L.Ed.2d 642 (1972). Based on <em>California Motor, </em>the \u201csham exception\u201d is a narrow one and applies only where the activity in question was not to influence government, but simply \u201cto deter competitors from making applications that would set the public decision-making apparatus into motion. Such a scheme, if proven, would be embraced by the sham exception since ... it involved \u2018nothing more than\u2019 a direct restraint on competitors.\u201d Handler, M., <em>Twenty-Five Years of Antitrust </em>(Twenty-Fifth Annual Antitrust Review), 73 Colum. L.Rev. 415, 436-37 (1973) (quoting <em>Noerr, </em>365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. at 533). Subsequent decisions confirm that the \u201csham exception\u201d is applicable when the activity in question corrupts governmental processes to such an extent that it constitutes access-barring conduct of the sort described in <em>California Motor. See Woods Exploration &amp; Producing Company v. Aluminum Company of America, </em>438 F.2d 1286, 1296-98 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1047, 92 S.Ct. 701, 30 L.Ed.2d 736 (1972); <em>see also Israel v. Baxter Laboratories, </em>466 F.2d 272, 278-79 (D.C.Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><em>Chest Hill Co. v. Guttman, </em>1981-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 64,417 (S.D.Ohio May 29, 1981), contains what we find to be a clear and accurate exposition of the law in this area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Furthermore, it is clear that a defendant\u2019s invocation of adjudicative process to press legitimate claims is protected even though its purpose in doing so is to eliminate competition. <em>Noerr, supra, </em>365 U.S. at 140 [81 S.Ct. at 531]; <em>Pennington, supra, </em>381 U.S. at 669 [85 S.Ct. at 1592]. The constitutional right of petition, of which the right of access to the courts is but a part, would be seriously undermined if mere improper purpose in bringing a suit \u2014 such as a desire to eliminate or injure a competitor by requiring it to defend an otherwise meritorious action \u2014 gave rise to antitrust liability. <em>Id. </em>It is only where a defendant\u2019s resort to the courts is accompanied or characterized by illegal and reprehensible practices such as perjury, fraud, conspiracy with or bribery of government decision makers, or misrepresentation, or is so clearly baseless as to amount to an abuse of process, that the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>cloak of immunity provides no protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aln-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 75,054.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Razorback argues that it has alleged that the litigation undertaken by defendants was a \u201csham,\u201d that whether the \u201csham exception\u201d applies is purely a question of fact, that the facts are not yet sufficiently developed to permit resolution of the issue, and that the District Court therefore was correct in denying the motions to dismiss or for summary judgment on this ground. We hold, however, that as a matter of law the \u201csham exception\u201d to the <em>Noerr-Pen-nington </em>doctrine is inapplicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Our review of the cases convinces us that the key to the \u201csham exception\u201d is an improper interference with governmental processes. We think it is clear that the institution of a single lawsuit and a related appeal, which is the conduct that defendants herein are charged with, does not give rise to a cause of action under the antitrust laws absent allegations that the lawsuit involves serious misconduct similar to the access-barring abuses described in <em>California Motor. Cf. Hydro-Tech Corporation v. Sundstrand Corporation, </em>673 F.2d 1171, 1177 (10th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">As this Court recognized in <em>First American Title Company of South Dakota v. South Dakota Land Title Association, </em>714 F.2d 1439 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 709, 79 L.Ed.2d 173 (1984), \u201c \u2018[t]he right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition\u2019; accordingly, groups do not violate the Sherman Act by \u2018us[ing] the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts to advocate their causes and points of view respecting resolution of their business and economic interests <em>vis-a-vis </em>their competitiors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1447 (quoting <em>California Motor Transport, </em>404 U.S. at 510-11, 92 S.Ct. at 611-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Here Razorback sought a substantial boon from local government \u2014 the issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of industrial revenue bonds for its benefit. It should not have been surprised that its competitors would resort to the use of the courts to prevent it from gaining what they undoubtedly regarded as an unfair competitive advantage in the form of low-cost financing at the expense of the public fisc. Defendants\u2019 motive may have been selfish or altruistic or mixed; that is immaterial. Regardless of motive, defendants\u2019 actions are clearly within the ambit of First Amendment protection and of <em>Noerr-Pen-nington </em>immunity from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Alternatively, Razorback\u2019s amended complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action under the Sherman Act. Razorback alleges that defendants filed a \u201csham\u201d lawsuit and appeal to challenge the bond issue, knowing that \u201cthe natural and probable consequence of their action would be to cause [Razorback] financial injury, loss of business, and/or to force [Razorback] out of business, thereby eliminating a competitor and further expanding their potential markets.\u201d Amended Complaint If 16, D\u00e9signated Record (D.R.) at 133. Razorback further alleges that as a direct and proximate result of defendants\u2019 \u201csham\u201d litigation, Razorback suffered injury to the extent of at least $700,000. <em>See id. </em>H 17, D.R. at 133. The question presented is whether Razorback has alleged an injury to competition as distinguished from injury to itself. We believe that it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The antitrust laws exist for \u201c \u2018the protection of <em>competition, </em>not <em>competitors.\u2019 \u201d See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, </em>429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977) (quoting <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 1521, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962)). Thus, as this Court recently has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">to maintain a private antitrust action, a party must do more than claim improper motive and some causal connection between its injury and the defendants\u2019 ac-tivity____ Rather, the party must demonstrate that it has suffered the type of injury Congress has intended \u2018to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\"><em>Henke Enterprises v. Hy-Vee Food Stores, </em>749 F.2d 488, 489 (8th Cir.1984) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, </em>457 U.S. 465, 483, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 2550, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">The injury complained of by Razorback is that it was deprived of the benefits that would have accrued to it from the county\u2019s issuance of industrial revenue bonds. This deprivation occurred because of the actions taken by defendants to block the bond issue. Giving a liberal construction to the amended complaint, it alleges a conspiracy to stop the bond issue and thereby to harm or eliminate Razorback as a competitor. Even as thus construed, the amended complaint does not, we believe, allege a <em>per se </em>violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, and thus Razorback is not relieved from the requirement of pleading and proving injury to competition. <em>See Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., </em>578 F.2d 1256 (8th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">The amended complaint does not include an allegation of the relevant market or of any actual anticompetitive effects within the relevant market. Razorback does not even allege that it has been eliminated as a competitor; to the contrary, it appears to be conceded that Razorback\u2019s ready-mix concrete business (although under different ownership) remains a going concern. Accordingly, because Razorback failed to allege in its amended complaint that defendants\u2019 conduct had any adverse effect on competition, defendants are entitled to dismissal of Razorback\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">Defendants\u2019 actions are immune from antitrust challenge by reason of the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. Alternatively) the amended complaint fails to state a claim under the antitrust laws. Accordingly, the order of the District Court is vacat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ed with directions that defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss or for summary judgment with respect to Razorback\u2019s Sherman Act claim be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\">. We note that diversity of citizenship among the parties to this case does not exist. Therefore, with respect to Razorback\u2019s pendent common law claim, which is not before this Court, the District Court must exercise its discretion in a determination of whether or not jurisdiction over that claim should be retained. <em>See Curtis v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, </em>754 F.2d 781, 784-87 (8th Cir.1985); <em>see also Koke v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>620 F.2d 1340, 1345-47 (8th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
