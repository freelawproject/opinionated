We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-19\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"afa-dedup-0\">On February 4, 1983, Christopher Stene-man was arrested in the Bangkok, Thailand airport as he attempted to leave the country with 1.2 kilograms of heroin in a false-bottom suitcase. Steneman subsequently pleaded guilty in a Thai court to a charge of sale and possession of heroin with intent to smuggle. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Thailand, but his sentence was reduced to twenty-five years because of his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1530-20\">After Steneman was arrested, he was interrogated by Thai and American drug enforcement officers, and he implicated two other men \u2014 James Sines and Rodney Rojas<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 in a plot to smuggle heroin out of Thailand. According to Steneman, Sines offered him $10,000 and a truck if Stene-man would travel to Thailand with Sines and return with a suitcase full of heroin; financed Steneman\u2019s trip to Thailand and planned his airplane routing; travelled on the same flight as Steneman from Los An-geles to Bangkok; rendezvoused with Steneman in Chiang Mai, a city 300 miles north of Bangkok; and introduced him to the individuals who supplied him with the heroin. Steneman agreed to testify against Sines and Rojas in exchange for the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>States government\u2019s promise that it would attempt to have him transferred to an American prison,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that it would not prosecute him for his drug offense when he returned to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-4\">Sines was arrested by United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents on May 11, 1983. He was charged in a five-count indictment with conspiracy to import heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 963, conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (1982), two counts of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3) (1982), and use of a communication facility to commit a felony, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-5\">On June 23, 1983, the United States moved under Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503 (1982) to take a videotaped deposition of Steneman for use in its case against Sines, claiming that Steneman qualified as an unavailable witness because of his lengthy prison sentence in Thailand and because of the Thai government\u2019s unwillingness to permit him to be brought to the United States to testify. The district court granted the United States\u2019 motion over Sines\u2019s objection on July 13, 1983, but made its order provisional upon receipt of an affidavit from the government confirming that Steneman would be unavailable for Sines\u2019s trial. No such affidavit was ever filed. However, the issue of Steneman\u2019s unavailability was raised again in a hearing on August 18, 1983, and the district court accepted the prosecution\u2019s representation that the Thai government would not permit Steneman to leave Thailand to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-6\">Steneman was deposed in prison in Bangkok on August 24, 1983. Sines\u2019s attorney attended and participated extensively, but Sines did not attend, apparently out of concern that he would be arrested by Thai authorities based upon Steneman\u2019s statements. The district court ultimately granted the government\u2019s motion for admission of Steneman\u2019s deposition into evidence on November 15, 1983, over Sines\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-10\">On May 12, 1983 \u2014 one day after Sines\u2019s arrest and one week before his indictment \u2014 government agents conducted a search of Sines\u2019s residence, a silver trailer located in Scottsdale, Arizona, and seized various documents and other property of Sines, including his passport. On December 12, 1983, Sines moved under Fed.R. Crim.P. 41(e) to require the United States to return the documents and property it had seized, claiming that there was no probable cause for his trailer to be searched, that the warrant authorizing the search constituted an impermissible general warrant, and that the agents executing the search warrant exceeded its scope and conducted a general exploratory search of the premises. The district court granted Sines\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-11\">On December 13, 1983, Sines entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) to the first count of his indictment: conspiracy to import heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 963. Sines reserved the right to appeal, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court\u2019s rulings concerning the taking and admission of Steneman\u2019s videotaped deposition and concerning the issuance and execution of the search warrant for Sines\u2019s trailer. He now appeals on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-13\">Sines raises essentially five separate challenges to the district court\u2019s rulings. He claims that: (1) the taking of Stene-man\u2019s deposition violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503, because the United States failed to demonstrate prior to the deposition that Steneman was \u201cunavailable\u201d; (2) the conduct of Steneman\u2019s deposition violated the procedural requirements imposed by Rule 15 and section 3503; (3) the district court\u2019s admission of Steneman\u2019s deposition into evidence violated Rule 15 and section 3503; (4) the taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>and admission of Steneman\u2019s deposition violated his constitutional rights of confrontation and to effective assistance of counsel; and (5) the district court\u2019s failure to order the government to return Sines\u2019s passport after seizing it from his trailer violated his rights under the fourth amendment. None of these claims provides a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-4\">\n<em>A. Requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AD7I\">The United States moved to depose Steneman in Thailand and later moved to admit his deposition into evidence under both Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503. These two provisions have an interconnected legislative history,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and as a result, they impose similar, although not identical, procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-5\">Both provisions authorize the taking of a deposition \u201c[wjhenever due to exceptional circumstances ... it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a); Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a). Both require \u201c[t]he party at whose instance [the] deposition is to be taken [to] give to every party reasonable written notice of [its] time and place.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3503(b); Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(b). Both provide that \u201c[a] defendant not in custody shall have the right to be present at the examination,\u201d and that \u201c[w]henever a deposition is taken at the instance of the government ... the court may direct that the expenses of travel and subsistence of the defendant and his attorney for attendance ... shall be paid by the government.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(b)-(c); Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(b)-(c). Finally, both provisions state that a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure, absent good cause shown, to appear [at a deposition] after notice and tender of expenses ... shall constitute a waiver of [his] right [to be present] and of any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based upon that right.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(b); Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-9\">However, there are two significant differences between Rule 15 and section 3503. First, section 3503, unlike Rule 15, requires that the Attorney General or his designee must certify \u201cthat [the underlying] legal proceeding is against a person ... believed to have participated in an <em>organized criminal activity\u201d </em>before any order for the taking of a deposition will be issued. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a) (emphasis added). Second, the two provisions impose different requirements for the admission of a deposition into evidence once it has been taken. Rule 15 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1532-10\">At the trial or upon any hearing, a part or all of a deposition, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used as substantive evidence <em>if the witness is unavailable, as unavailability is defined in Rule 804(a) of the Federal Rules of </em>Evidence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1532-12\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(e) (emphasis added). Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a) provides that a witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d for a given hearing, if he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>... is absent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been <em>unable to procure his attendance ...by process or other reasonable </em>means____ [and] if his ... absence is [not] due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his statement for the purpose of preventing [him] from attending or testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1533-7\">Fed.R.Evid. 804(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-8\">In contrast, section 3503 authorizes the admission of depositions into evidence in a broader set of situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1533-9\">At the trial or upon any hearing, a part or all of a deposition, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used if it appears: ... <em>that the witness is out of the United States, </em>unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition <em>... or that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpena.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1533-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-11\">\n<em>B. Challenges To Deposing Steneman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-12\">The district court authorized the taking of Steneman\u2019s deposition under both Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and section 3503. Sines maintains that the United States failed to make an adequate showing under the terms of either provision that Steneman would be \u201cunavailable\u201d for trial prior to the granting of its motion to depose Steneman in Thailand. Sines contends that because the government failed to explore \u201call possible avenues to obtain Steneman for trial,\u201d the district court should never have authorized the taking of Steneman\u2019s deposition under Rule 15 or section 3503.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-13\">Sines\u2019s argument confuses the prerequisites for <em>taking </em>a deposition under Rule 15 and section 3503 with the prerequisites for <em>admitting </em>a deposition into evidence under those provisions. The two provisions do not require any conclusive showing of \u201cunavailability\u201d before a deposition can be taken in a criminal case. They only require that\u2019the trial court find that \u201cdue to exceptional circumstances ... it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness ... be taken and preserved\u201d for possible use at trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a); Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a). If the party taking the deposition seeks to introduce it as evidence at trial, he will have to demonstrate at that time that the deponent is unavailable. It would be unreasonable and undesirable to require the government to assert with certainty that a witness will be unavailable for trial months ahead of time, simply to obtain authorization to take his deposition. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4026 (\u201cThe standards governing the taking of a deposition [under section 3503] are not the same as the standards for using such deposition at trial.\u201d); H.Rep. No. 247, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1975, 674 (under Rule 15, \u201c[a] deposition, once it is taken, is not automatically admissible at trial____ It may only be used at trial if the witness is [then] una-vailable____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-16\">In the present case, it was clear by the time the United States moved to take Steneman\u2019s deposition that he would likely be incarcerated in Thailand for a significant number of years and would not be permitted to leave that country to testify against Sines. The district court confirmed this fact in its August 18, 1983 hearing, six days before Steneman\u2019s deposition occurred. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that Steneman\u2019s situation amounted to \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and that it would be \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d for the government to be permitted to take his deposition so that it would be in a position to utilize his testimony at trial, if necessary. <em>See Furlow v. United States, </em>644 F.2d 764, 767 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 871, 102 S.Ct. 340, 70 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>588 F.2d 1235, 1241 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 947, 99 S.Ct. 1426, 59 L.Ed.2d 636 (1979); <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>534 F.2d 202, 204 (9th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>Sines also contends that Steneman\u2019s deposition could not have been authorized under section 3503, because the United States failed to submit any certification to the district court that Sines was \u201cbelieved to have participated in an organized criminal activity,\u201d as is required under section 3503(a). The United States responds that such certification can take many forms, and that it has satisfied the requirement through the specific charges that it included in Sines\u2019s indictment. <em>See United States v. Singleton, </em>460 F.2d 1148, 1153 (2d Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 984, 93 S.Ct. 1506, 36 L.Ed.2d 180 (1973). We need not decide this issue in light of our ruling that the taking of Steneman\u2019s deposition was authorized under Rule 15. <em>See United States v. Tunnell, </em>667 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">\n<em>C. Challenges to the Conduct of Stene-man\u2019s Deposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">Sines contends that the conduct of Steneman\u2019s deposition violated the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 15 and section 3503 on a number of grounds. None of these challenges has any merit. Sines argues first that the government failed to provide written notice of the time and place of the deposition, as required under Rule 15(b) and section 3503(b). Although the record is unclear as to whether formal notice was provided, Sines\u2019s attorney was fully aware of the scheduling of Steneman\u2019s deposition, had his travel expenses for attending the deposition fully subsidized by the government, and actively participated throughout the course of the deposition. Therefore, regardless of whether Rule 15\u2019s and section 3503\u2019s written notice requirements were completely satisfied, no prejudice resulted to Sines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">Sines also contends that the United States and its agents did not cooperate with his counsel to arrange a meeting with Steneman prior to the deposition. Nothing in Rule 15 or section 3503 requires the government to assist the defendant and his counsel in such a manner. All that these provisions require is that the government permit the defendant and his attorney to attend the deposition itself, and that the government subsidize the defendant\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s transportation costs and expenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503; Fed.R.Crim.P. 15; <em>United States v. King, </em>552 F.2d 833, 842 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 966, 97 S.Ct. 1646, 52 L.Ed.2d 357 (1977). As this court stated in a case similar to the present one involving the depositions of two unindicted co-conspirators who were incarcerated in Japan for smuggling narcotics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-8\">Appellants complain of an inability to interview the deponents prior to the examination, yet such an interview is not an absolute right____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1534-10\"><em>King, </em>552 F.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-11\">Finally, Sines contends that under Rule 15 and section 3503, the government was required to obtain safe passage for him out of Thailand so that he could attend Steneman\u2019s deposition. There is no basis in either provision for this claim. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503; Fed.R.Crim.P. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-12\">\n<em>D. Challenges To The Admission of Steneman\u2019s Deposition Into Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-13\">Sines argues that the district court\u2019s admission of Steneman\u2019s deposition into evidence violated both.Rule 15 and section 3503, because the government failed to make a sufficient showing that Steneman was \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify at trial. Sines contends that the government was required to exhaust all possible means at its disposal to secure the attendance of Steneman at trial. He notes that although a subpoena was prepared for Steneman, it was never actually served because of information the government allegedly received through \u201cinformal\u201d channels. The United States maintains that it was notified by Thai officials that the subpoena would not be honored, and therefore determined that service of the subpoena would be \u201ca meaningless gesture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-14\">Under Rule 15, for Steneman\u2019s deposition to be admitted into evidence, the government was required to demonstrate that Steneman would be \u201cabsent\u201d from Sines\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>trial and that the United States, as \u201cthe proponent of his statement^] ha[d] been <em>unable to procure his attendance ...by process or other reasonable means.\u201d </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(e); Fed.R.Evid. 804(a)(5) (emphasis added). The prosecutor represented to the district court that after a series of contacts through various diplomatic channels, the Thai government had clearly indicated its unwillingness to permit Steneman to leave Thailand to testify. Although it would have been vastly preferable for the prosecution to submit affidavits precisely delineating the United States government\u2019s efforts to obtain Steneman\u2019s presence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the government\u2019s attempts in this regard were sufficient to establish Steneman\u2019s unavailability for purposes of Rule 15. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>735 F.2d 1200, 1202-03 (9th Cir.1984) (ruling that \u201cthe prosecution [had] made all reasonable efforts to produce\u201d its witness, the United States ambassador to Italy, when it called the ambassador and was told that \u201che was tied up in diplomatic matters of extreme sensitivity\u201d); <em>Furlow v. United States, </em>644 F.2d at 767; <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>588 F.2d at 1241. Therefore, the district properly admitted Steneman\u2019s deposition into evidence in Sines\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">\n<em>E. Confrontation Clause and Right to Counsel Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">Sines claims that the taking and admission of Steneman\u2019s deposition violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, and his right to effective assistance of counsel, because he could not attend Steneman\u2019s deposition in Thailand. He claims that he was presented with a Hobson\u2019s choice: he could either forego attending the deposition, or attend and risk incarceration in Thailand. As a result, he claims that he was denied his chance to confront Steneman in person and to assist his attorney on cross-examination during the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-8\">These contentions are without merit. Sines was given the opportunity to attend Steneman\u2019s deposition, and chose not to attend. His decision, whether reasonable or not in light of the possibility that he might be arrested in Thailand on charges of narcotics trafficking, does not preclude the government from securing Steneman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-9\">Sines\u2019s ineffective assistance claims are not supported by the record. His attorney attended Steneman\u2019s deposition, took an active part in objecting to a number of the government\u2019s questions, and skillfuly cross-examined Steneman himself. Moreover, Sines\u2019s attorney was given an opportunity to contact Sines by telephone during breaks in the deposition. As a result, there is simply no basis for Sines\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffective [assistance of counsel] must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a fair result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-12\">Sines\u2019s confrontation clause claim is similarly without merit. The Supreme Court has identified the major purposes of the confrontation clause as: (1) ensuring that witnesses will testify under oath; (2) forcing witnesses to undergo cross-examination; and (3) permitting the jury to observe the demeanor of witnesses. <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970); <em>accord, Mancusi v. Stubbs, </em>408 U.S. 204, 213, 92 S.Ct. 2308, 2313, 33 L.Ed.2d 293 (1972). All three of these purposes were fulfilled when Steneman\u2019s videotaped deposition was taken with Sines\u2019s attorney present. <em>See United States v. King, </em>552 F.2d at 842 (focusing upon ability of defense counsel to investigate case, as opposed to defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-13\">Sines also argues that Steneman\u2019s testimony lacks the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>required by the confrontation clause, because Steneman was a confessed liar and was serving his own interests by testifying against Sines. However, courts are not expected to determine whether testimony bears sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d based upon their perceptions of the inherent reliability or unreliability of the deponent, but instead must make this determination based upon such guarantees of trustworthiness as the opportunity of the defendant\u2019s counsel to cross-examine, the administering of an oath to the deponent, and the jury\u2019s opportunity to observe his demeanor. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 73, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2542, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>735 F.2d at 1203 (\u201cdeposition bore sufficient indicia of reliability [sjince [defendant\u2019s] counsel had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine [the deponent] and availed himself of that opportunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">\n<em>F. Challenges Based Upon Sines\u2019s Rule 41(e) Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">Finally, Sines challenges the district court\u2019s partial denial of his motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) for return of illegally-seized evidence, based upon both the issuance and execution of the search warrant for his residential trailer. Sines claims that there was no probable cause to search his trailer, that the warrant issued was impermissibly \u201cgeneral\u201d in its terms, and that the law enforcement personnel who executed the warrant exceeded its permissible scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">Even if Sines\u2019s claims are valid, they do not require reversal of his conviction. At oral argument, Sines\u2019s counsel indicated that the only item seized from Sines\u2019s trailer that Sines seeks to suppress is his passport, which could be used to corroborate Steneman\u2019s testimony that he and Sines were in Thailand at the same time. However, Sines\u2019s passport was unnecessary to corroborate Steneman\u2019s testimony on this point, since the government also had hotel and airline records reflecting the dates when Sines had been in Thailand, as well as the testimony of two Thai hotel managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-10\">Moreover, the government did not even use Sines\u2019s passport in obtaining his conviction. When Sines changed his plea to nolo contendere on December 13, 1983, the district court requested the government to summarize all \u201cthe evidence ... that [it] would present in this matter against the defendant.\u201d The government indicated that it would present the videotaped Stene-man deposition, the hotel and airline records corroborating Steneman\u2019s testimony, the testimony of the two Thai hotel managers, the 1.2 kilograms of heroin seized from Steneman, and testimony by a chemist verifying that the substance seized from Steneman was heroin. The government did not even offer Sines\u2019s passport as evidence supporting his conviction, nor did the district court consider it in finding Sines guilty. Thus, Sines\u2019s passport was immaterial to his conviction, and as a result, even if the district court erred in partially denying Sines\u2019s Rule 41(e) motion, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v.

Prior to 1975, Rule 15 only authorized <em>defendants </em>to take depositions in criminal cases. In 1970, Congress enacted Title VI of the Organized Crime Control Act, which eventually became 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503, in an attempt to eliminate what it viewed as an omission in Rule 15. Section 3503 authorized the government to take depositions in cases in which the Attorney General or his designee certifies that the defendant \"is believed to have participated in an organized criminal activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a)(1982). It represented Congress' attempt to change Rule 15 in those cases where \"the need for the deposing of Government witnesses appear[ed] to be most acute\": those involving organized crime. H.Rep.

Yet at the time, Congress did not want to exclude the possibility that someday the Judicial Conference of the United States might decide to amend the rules of criminal procedure in order to \"adopt[ ] ... a broader approach.\" 116 Cong.Rec. 35293 (1970) (comments of Congressman Poff).</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-14\">In 1974, Rule 15 was amended (effective December 1, 1975) to expand the government\u2019s authority to take depositions to <em>all </em>criminal actions. The language used in the revised rule is borrowed in part from \u00a7 3503, except that there is no requirement that the government certify the case as involving organized crime figures. <em>See </em>Advisory Committee Note to Rule 15, 1974 Amendment; <em>United States v.
