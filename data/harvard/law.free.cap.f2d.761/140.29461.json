In substance, these amendments provide for the sale of a newly defined \u201cwine product\u201d in grocery stores, a practice not previously permitted in New York State. \u201cWine product,\u201d in turn, is defined as a low-alcohol beverage containing \u201cwine produced exclusively from grapes grown in New York State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In a comprehensive and thoughtful opinion, <em>see </em>601 F.Supp. 850, Judge Brieant held that New York\u2019s Wine Products Provisions were clearly violative of the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, and that they were not saved by Section 2 of the twenty-first amendment. In framing an injunction, he ordered the state, within 60 days, to elect either \u201c(1) to license and authorize sale of the wine product referred to in the statute without regard to the location where the grapes used therein were grown, or alternatively (2) revoke all licenses issued to grocery stores ... and forbid the further retail sale of the wine product for use off premises except in licensed package stores.\u201d If, within the allotted time, the state did not make an election, it would be deemed to have chosen option (1). Finally, the injunction was stayed pending appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">For substantially the reasons set forth in his opinion, we affirm Judge Brieant\u2019s holding that New York\u2019s Wine Product Provisions are unconstitutional. Such clearly protectionist measures are violative of the commerce clause and, in light of <em>Bacchus Imports Ltd. v. Dias, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3049, 82 L.Ed.2d 200 (1984), cannot be saved by Section 2 of the twenty-first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Finding, as we do, that the New York provisions so clearly run afoul of the Constitution, we cannot allow their enforcement to continue for even sixty days. Accordingly, the order of the district court is modified to strike sections (b) and (c) of that decree. Upon the issuance of this Court\u2019s mandate, the New York Liquor Authority shall revoke all licenses issued to grocery stores under the statute here at issue, and forbid further retail sale of the wine product for use off premises except in licensed package stores. If the New York Legislature wishes to allow the sale in grocery stores of all wine products, without regard to the origin of the grapes used therein, it may, of course, enact a statute so providing.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">So Ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
