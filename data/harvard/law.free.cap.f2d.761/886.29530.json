Telesea, <em>District Judge, </em>dismissing a pro se complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The appeal presents the question of whether a claim is stated under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) when the complaint alleges that a state prisoner was placed in isolation by state officials in violation of state law and without being afforded a prior hearing that conforms to the due process requirements enunciated in <em>Wolff v. McDonald, </em>418 U.S. 539 (1974). The district court held that <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527 (1981), required dismissal of the complaint because the state provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy. We disagree. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">For purposes of this appeal we accept as true the allegations set forth in the complaint. We summarize only those facts and prior proceedings believed necessary to an understanding of our rulings on the legal issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-19\">Appellant Emmanuel D. Patterson is, and at all times relevant to this action was, an inmate of the Attica Correctional Facility at Attica, New York. Appellees are Thomas A. Coughlin III, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Correctional Services; Harold J. Smith, the Commissioner of the Attica Correctional Facility; Charles P. Hernandez, Director of the Special Housing Review Board; and N. DeSantos, a Captain at Attica.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-20\">On April 9, 1982, a fight broke out between two other inmates at Attica. Appellant, who asserts that he was not involved in the altercation, was placed in the facility\u2019s Special Housing Unit (SHU). On April 12, appellant appeared before the Prison Adjustment Committee and was charged with \u201cAssault 1.5 and Interference with an employee 1.75\u201d. A Superintendent\u2019s Hearing was convened on April 16 to consider the charges but was adjourned until April 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-21\">Appellee DeSantos was the hearing officer at the April 20 hearing. The only wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ness who testified was the guard who claimed to be the subject of appellant\u2019s alleged assault. Appellant was not permitted to call any witnesses in his defense nor did DeSantos interview any such witnesses. Appellant was found guilty of both charges. He was sentenced to confinement in the SHU for sixty days and loss of sixty days \u201cgood time\u201d. Appellant appealed the decision at the Superintendent\u2019s Hearing to appellees Smith and Coughlin. On July 21, 1982, that decision was affirmed by the Housing Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">In the meanwhile, appellant filed an Article 78 proceeding in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Wyoming, in which he sought immediate release from the SHU and restoration of the sixty days good time. Just prior to his scheduled appearance in the Supreme Court, and shortly before his sixty-day sentence had been served,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was released from the SHU. A hearing was held in the Supreme Court on June 10, 1982. Appel-lees at that hearing were ordered to produce the record of the Superintendent\u2019s Hearing. That record was never produced. A second hearing was held in the Supreme Court on February 25, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">On March 4, 1983, the Supreme Court entered an Order of Stipulation dismissing appellant\u2019s petition with prejudice but ordering that appellees \u201cthrough their agents or employees not hold the [appellant] in confinement in Attica\u2019[s] Special Housing Unit because of the disposition issued at [appellant\u2019s] Superintendent\u2019s Proceeding of April 20, 1982 at the Attica Correctional Facility.\u201d The order specifically provided that appellees had stipulated to restore appellant\u2019s good time and to expunge any reference to the disciplinary proceeding from appellant\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">On or about April 6, 1983, appellant filed his pro se complaint, on a form used by prisoners who are not represented by counsel, in the District Court for the Western District of New York. At the same time, he moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel; on May 10, 1983, Judge Telesca granted the former, but denied the latter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">On August 15, 1983, appellees moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Apparently no documentary evidence ever was produced, despite the district court\u2019s order of August 1, 1983 requiring production of the record of the Superintendent\u2019s Hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court, treating the motion as one under Rule 12(b)(6), dismissed the complaint in a Memorandum Decision and Order dated December 5,1983 which in relevant part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-12\">\u201cIn the present case, plaintiff alleges that defendants failed to strictly comply with the procedures established in New York\u2019s Code of Rules and Regulations for Confinement in a Special Housing Unit. Because the procedures existed, but were allegedly not followed, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>meaningful predeprivation hearing was possible---- Plaintiff did seek redress pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Article 78 to force defendants to comply with the established procedures and thus, was given an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">As indicated above, we reverse and remand, for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Recovery under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) is premised upon a showing, first, that the defendant has denied the plaintiff a constitutional or federal statutory right and, second, that such denial was effected under color of state law. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150 (1970). Appellant here alleges a deprivation of his liberty interest and a denial of the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That the liberty interest at issue here is of constitutional dimension is not contested. <em>E.g., Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983); <em>Sher v. Coughlin, </em>739 F.2d 77, 81 (2 Cir.1984). Moreover, it is not claimed that the officials\u2019 conduct did not amount to \u201cstate action\u201d, which is a prerequisite to finding a constitutional violation, or that it did not occur under color of state law. The only issue presented for our decision, therefore, is whether, upon the facts alleged in the complaint, there has been a denial of constitutionally-mandated procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">In its simplest formulation, due process requires an opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965); <em>Giglio v. Dunn, </em>732 F.2d 1133, 1135 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 328 (1984). Determining precisely the process that is due, however, is more complicated than this simple statement might suggest. The level of procedural safeguards that must be afforded before the government may deprive an individual of a protected interest is determined by reference to (1) the private interest at stake, (2) the risk of error inherent in the use of one form of procedure over another, and (3) the interest of the government. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). <em>See also Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1494 (1985); <em>Hewitt v. Helms, supra, </em>459 U.S. at 473. Thus, a tenured public employee is guaranteed notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the evidence in the employer\u2019s favor and an opportunity to present \u201chis side of the story\u201d <em>before </em>his employment is terminated. <em>Loudermill, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 1495. Moreover, a formal postdeprivation evidentiary hearing must be provided before the employee\u2019s loss may become final. <em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 1496.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">The procedural safeguards that are required when an individual\u2019s liberty is at stake must at least equal those required before he may be deprived of his property, even when the individual\u2019s liberty already is curtailed by the fact of being incarcerated in a correctional facility. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974). Thus, an inmate who is facing prison disciplinary charges that could result in punitive segregation is entitled, at a minimum, to advance written notice of the charges against him and of the evidence available to the factfinder. He must be permitted to marshal the facts and prepare his defense. A written record of the proceedings must be kept. The inmate must be allowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 564-66; <em>McCann v. Coughlin, </em>698 F.2d 112, 120-21 (2 Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">In <em>Hewitt v. Helms, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that administrative segregation of a prison inmate \u2014 where the inmate posed a threat to the safety of other inmates and prison employees and where an investigation into the charges against the inmate was continuing \u2014 required only \u201can informal, non-adversary review of the information supporting respondent\u2019s administrative confinement, including whatever statement respondent wished to submit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>within a reasonable time after confining him to administrative segregation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472. Where, as here, the state can show no such compelling interest, and the sole purpose of the confinement is punishment, the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test tips in favor of the inmate\u2019s liberty interest. The state, therefore, is required to provide the procedures required by <em>Wolff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">In the instant case, appellees \u201cconcede[ ] that the [appellant] was placed in SHU and deprived of his liberty after a Superintendent\u2019s Proceeding which failed in certain particulars to conform to the requirements of procedural due process established in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539 (1974).\u201d Appellees argue, despite the conceded infirmities in the predeprivation hearing, that no due process violation resulted from the hearing officer\u2019s failure to follow the state\u2019s own rules, which conform to the requirements set forth in <em>Wolff. </em>The district court held that \u201c[b]ecause the procedures existed, but were allegedly not followed, no meaningful predeprivation hearing was possible.\u201d Appellees urge this proposition on appeal. They further urge that the Article 78 postdeprivation remedy, the mere threat of which resulted in appellees stipulating to appellant\u2019s release after 65 days confinement, was sufficient to satisfy due process. Appellees place heavy reliance on <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527 (1981). We fail to see either the logic of appellees\u2019 argument or the connection between the instant case and <em>Parratt </em>or the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3194 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Although a state employee\u2019s failure to conform to state law does not in itself violate the Constitution and is not alone actionable under \u00a7 1983, <em>Davis v. Scherer, </em>468 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3019 (1984); <em>Pollnow v. Glennon, 151 </em>F.2d 496, 501 (2 Cir.1985), the state regulation that was violated in the instant case merely reiterated what already was <em>required </em>by the Constitution. It has long been settled that unconstitutional conduct that <em>also </em>violates state law is still actionable under \u00a7 1983, <em>e.g., Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 187 (1961); <em>Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 109-11 (1945) (plurality opinion); <em>United States v. Classic, </em>313 U.S. 299, 326 (1941); <em>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Los Angeles, </em>227 U.S. 278, 282-85 (1913), and that exhaustion of state tort and administrative remedies is not required. <em>Monroe, supra, </em>365 U.S. at 183; <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">Allegations of procedural due process violations by certain individual government employees, as opposed to direct challenges to state procedures or the lack thereof, have long been accepted as constituting state action and forming the basis for a claim under the civil rights statutes. <em>See, e.g., Monroe, supra, </em>365 U.S. at 172; <em>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>227 U.S. at 278, 282-85; <em>Mansell v. Saunders, </em>372 F.2d 573, 576 (5 Cir.1967).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The requirements of the due process clauses are directed specifically to the federal and state governments. They require the promulgation of laws and regulations providing for regular procedures which the government must follow before it may deprive an individual of life, liberty or property. The execution of those laws and regulations also must conform to due process; otherwise the due process clause, with its guarantees of regular and predictable procedures, becomes a cipher. It is beyond cavil that due process requires more than the mere <em>promulgation </em>of laws and regulations which, if followed, would preserve the most fundamental of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-16\">In <em>Parratt, </em>the Supreme Court based its decision, in part, on the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>\u201cthe deprivation occurred as a result of the unauthorized failure of agents of the State to follow established state procedure.\u201d <em>Parratt, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 543. Appellees here argue, based on this statement, that no predeprivation hearing was possible in the instant case because the procedures provided for by the state were not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">First, appellees, and the district court, apparently confuse the deprivation of a liberty interest with the denial of the constitutional right to procedural safeguards which is implicated by that interest. It must be remembered that the Constitution does not prohibit deprivations of liberty per se. The Constitution prohibits deprivations of liberty <em>without due process. </em>The denial of a constitutionally-sound predeprivation hearing is a separate and distinct injury from the loss of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Second, although the denial of due process may have been \u201cunauthorized\u201d, the deprivation of liberty at issue here does <em>not </em>appear to have been \u201cunauthorized\u201d as that term is meant by <em>Parratt. Hudson v. Palmer, supra, </em>makes clear that the question of whether the deprivation of a protected interest was negligent or intentional is not of constitutional dimension. What does matter, however, is whether the conduct of the state\u2019s agent that resulted in the deprivation was such as to make the injury unforeseeable when viewed from the position of one who possesses the state-delegated authority to grant a hearing when circumstances and the Constitution so require. It is at least a question of fact whether the decision to place appellant in the SHU was made by \u201cofficials with final authority\u201d over that decision. <em>Burtnieks v. City of New York, </em>716 F.2d 982, 986 (2 Cir.1983). Unlike the deprivation of property that occurred in <em>Parratt, </em>here the responsible state officials who had the power to grant appellant a hearing obviously knew that appellant was in peril of being deprived of his liberty interest. In fact, he was <em>given </em>a hearing, albeit a deficient one. Thus, the deprivation of liberty was neither \u201crandom\u201d nor \u201cunauthorized\u201d. <em>See Loudermill v. Cleveland Board of Education, </em>721 F.2d 550, 562 (6 Cir.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1487 (1985); <em>Burtnieks, supra, </em>716 F.2d at 988-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Finally, <em>Parratt </em>did not alter the fundamental tenets of due process. <em>Parratt, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 544. Absent some exigency that requires summary action by the state, <em>e.g., Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., </em>339 U.S. 594 (1950); <em>North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, </em>211 U.S. 306 (1908), or circumstances that render a predeprivation hearing impossible as a practical matter as in <em>Parratt, </em>the opportunity to be heard <em>before </em>the state deprives an individual of life, liberty or property is still the \u201c \u2018root requirement\u2019 \u201d of the due process clause. <em>Loudermill, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 1493, <em>quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 379 (1972). It is abundantly clear that disciplinary segregation implicates a sufficiently strong liberty interest as to require notice of the charges and, as the word \u201chearing\u201d suggests, <em>some </em>opportunity to present a defense. <em>Wolff, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 563-72; <em>McCann v. Coughlin, supra, </em>698 F.2d at 121; <em>Powell v. Ward, supra, </em>542 F.2d at 104. The opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner has not been satisfied when the first such real opportunity is afforded after an inmate has already been in the SHU for 65 days. \u201cThe point is straightforward: the Due Process Clause provides that certain substantive rights \u2014 life, liberty, and property \u2014 cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures.\u201d <em>Loudermill, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 1493. Since appellant was denied such adequate procedures before punitively being deprived of his liberty, and since it was not impossible or impracticable to provide such procedures, the conclusion is inescapable that appellant was denied due process. <em>Parratt </em>and the other cases upon which appellees rely are not to the contrary. In those cases to which the reasoning of <em>Parratt </em>was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>plied to deprivations of liberty, the deprivation itself was \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d and a predeprivation hearing was impossible. <em>E.g., Thibodeaux v. Bordelon, </em>740 F.2d 329, 338 (5 Cir.1984); <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>720 F.2d 792, 795 (4 Cir.1983), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1168, 84 L.Ed.2d 320 (1985). <em>Parratt </em>and its progeny are inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">In view of our holding that an adequate prior hearing was required, a post-deprivation hearing, by way of an Article 78 proceeding or an action for damages in the Court of Claims, is inadequate, by definition, to meet the requirements of due process. This may be tautological, but it is a point that appears to have been missed by appellees and by the district court. Once a cause of action for a constitutional violation accrues, nothing that the state does subsequently can cut off the \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">To summarize: We hold that, on the facts alleged in the complaint, the deprivation of appellant\u2019s liberty was neither random nor unauthorized and, as such, the state, through its agents, was obligated to provide an adequate hearing <em>before </em>the decision to discipline appellant was made final. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\">. Appellant alleges that he was detained in the SHU for a total of 65 days \u2014 12 days while the Superintendent's Hearing was pending and 53 days of disciplinary detention. Since the Superintendent\u2019s Hearing was constitutionally deficient, as appellees concede, it is as if appellant never received a hearing at all. It therefore is unnecessary for us to determine whether the 12 days spent in the SHU before the hearing was unconstitutionally lengthy. <em>See Powell v. Ward, </em>542 F.2d 101, 103 (2 Cir.1976) (requiring disciplinary hearing within seven days of confinement in the SHU).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\">. On this appeal, appellant has been represented by able counsel appointed by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-13\">. In a letter dated June 28, 1983 addressed to Judge Telesca, appellees\u2019 counsel, an Assistant Attorney General for the State of New York, stated that the Attica Facility no longer maintained the records that the district court ordered to be produced because the state had expunged appellant\u2019s file pursuant to the Order of Stipulation entered in the state court in the Article 78 proceeding. We note that no explanation for the failure to produce the record in the state court in the Article 78 proceeding is found in the record on this appeal. The Assistant Attorney General stated in his letter to Judge Telesca, however, that copies might be available from other sources. We assume that, upon the remand which we are ordering, those copies will be produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b985-10\">.
