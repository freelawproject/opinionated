On October 12, 1988, United States District Judge Thomas P. Jackson dismissed the case for want of prosecution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-25\">Since Bomate filed this suit on March 2, 1982, she has dismissed her lawyers on five separate occasions and has been represented by nine different attorneys. Bomate\u2019s difficulties with counsel led to numerous postponements of discovery deadlines and the rescheduling of the trial. In April 1983, Ford moved for dismissal under Rule 41(b) for want of prosecution. The trial court denied the motion but warned Bo-mate and Mr. Schwartz, her counsel, that further delays would result in a dismissal with prejudice. In September 1983, Bo-mate fired Mr. Schwartz. On October 4, 1983, the trial court granted Schwartz\u2019s motion to withdraw, informed Bomate that she could proceed <em>pro se, </em>but again warned that further delays would not be tolerated. Despite these repeated warnings, Bomate did not appear for an October 6 pretrial hearing, thereby forcing further postponement of the trial. Ford again moved for dismissal for want of prosecution. Following a hearing at which Bomate appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>pro se, </em>the trial court granted Ford\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Dismissal for want of prosecution will be reversed only upon a finding of abuse of discretion. <em>Automated Datatron, Inc. v. Woodcock, </em>659 F.2d 1168, 1169 (D.C.Cir.1981). A Rule 41(b) dismissal is proper if, in view of the entire procedural history of the case, the litigant has not manifested reasonable diligence in pursuing the cause. <em>Cherry v. Brown-Frazier-Whitney, </em>548 F.2d 965, 969 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>Sheaffer v. Warehouse Employees Union, Local No. 730, </em>408 F.2d 204, 206 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 1996, 23 L.Ed.2d 449 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Review of the record in this case reveals repeated frustration of pretrial process caused by Bomate\u2019s continuous refusal to cooperate with her own lawyers. The trial court patiently postponed discovery deadlines and trial dates to accommodate Bomate\u2019s troubles with her counsel, but twice warned of the consequences of further delays. Bomate did not heed these admonitions. Instead, she fired her lawyers again and failed to comply with several material provisions of the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">As this court stated in <em>Woodcock, </em>\u201c[i]f district court judges are to discharge their heavy responsibilities effectively, their power to dismiss, in situations such as the one before us, must be more than theoretical.\u201d 659 F.2d at 1170. Although a less drastic sanction might have been entertained, we find that, because the trial court repeatedly warned Bomate and her counsel of the consequences of further delays, the dismissal for want of prosecution was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.; Kung v. FOM Investment Corp., </em>563 F.2d 1316, 1318 (9th Cir.1977). To hold otherwise would take from the trial court the broad discretion necessary to \u201csecure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination\u201d of civil cases. <em>See Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>1. The order granting Ford\u2019s Second Motion to Dismiss is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
