Mintzes, </em>733 F.2d 424 (6th Cir.1984). The Supreme Court of the United States granted respondent Mintzes\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our judgment and remanded the case for consideration in light of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reaffirm our earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-27\">Petitioner Wilson contended in seeking a writ of habeas corpus that the trial judge\u2019s failure to grant a continuance to allow him to retain substitute counsel when he expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of his counsel at trial deprived him of his sixth amendment right to counsel. We found that counsel\u2019s conduct at trial constituted good cause to warrant substitution of counsel and that Wilson was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s attempt to remove himself from the case in front of the jury and by his refusal to cross-examine the officer in charge of the investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The sixth amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auf-dedup-0\">While the plain language of the amendment simply guarantees a defendant \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence,\u201d such language encompasses a guarantee of the right to self-representation, <em>Faretta v.

Therefore, \u201c[w]hen a court unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>denies defendant counsel of choice, the denial can rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Birt, </em>725 F.2d at 592; <em>United States v.

Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 364, 101 S.Ct. 665, 667, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981), recognition of the right also reflects constitutional protection of the accused\u2019s free choice independent of these concerns. <em>See Flanagan v.

Ramey, </em>559 F.Supp. 60, 62 (E.D. Tenn.1981). When an accused seeks substitution of counsel in mid-trial, he must show good cause such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict with his attorney in order to warrant substitution. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>744 F.2d 905, 908 n. 2 (2d Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>714 F.2d 669, 673 (7th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 188 (3d Cir. 1982); <em>McKee v.

Evidence of unreasonable or arbitrary interference with an accused\u2019s right to counsel of his choice ordinarily mandates reversal without a showing of prejudice. <em>Linton, </em>656 F.2d at 211-12; <em>Phillips, </em>699 F.2d at 802. Such motions are directed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v.

Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the accused, on petition for writ of habeas corpus, claimed that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to obtain a psychiatric report and to present character witnesses. Counsel\u2019s competence was not questioned at trial and the accused proffered no motions for a continuance to obtain new counsel. In order to obtain relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>an accused must show first that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, <em>id. </em>at 2065, and second, that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the accused\u2019s defense. <em>Id. </em>at 2067. Ordinarily, in assessing prejudice \u201cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the fact-finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2069. However, when counsel labors under a conflict of interest prejudice may be presumed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">In those circumstances, counsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests____ Prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel \u201cactively represented conflicting interests\u201d and \u201cthat an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2607 (quoting <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the standards enunciated in <em>Strickland </em>are inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Application of the two-prong <em>Strickland </em>test to motions for substitution of counsel would require a defendant who cannot communicate with counsel, who is dissatisfied with counsel or whose defense is burdened by a conflict of interest to prove that counsel\u2019s conduct rises to the level of constitutional ineffectiveness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We know of no court which has placed such a burden on defendants, and find such a burden incompatible with the principles underlying the right to counsel of choice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">First, while ineffectiveness claims attack the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is challenged, <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2070, and are concerned with its reliability or objective fairness, <em>Cronic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2046, the right to counsel of choice \u201creflects constitutional protection of the defendant\u2019s free choice independent of concern for the objective fairness of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1056; <em>Burton, </em>584 F.2d at 489 n. 10 (\u201c[T]he right to choice of counsel is distinct from the right to adequate assistance of counsel. The fact that one is infringed does not indicate one way or the other whether the other is infringed.\u201d); <em>Gandy, </em>569 F.2d at 1326. Therefore, the <em>Strickland </em>test, which governs situations involving the effectiveness of counsel, should not be applied to cases involving the choice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Second, the <em>Strickland </em>test is incompatible not only with the nature of the right protected but with the context in which it is asserted. The performance/prejudice inquiry of <em>Strickland </em>is tailored to limit the availability of intrusive post-trial inquiry into attorney performance, <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066, since ineffectiveness claims inevitably arise subsequent to the proceeding\u2019s conclusion. However, in choice of counsel cases, the court is required to adjudicate the accused\u2019s rights at a time when the outcome of the proceeding remains in doubt. Therefore, our concern for limiting intrusive post-trial inquiry into attorney performance has little relevance in choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of counsel cases and does not require application of the <em>Strickland </em>standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Likewise, the fact that choice of counsel issues are raised at trial demonstrates both the appropriateness of the current standard set out in Part I B above, and the inappropriateness of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Strickland </em>requires consideration of the totality of the evidence to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2069. While such an inquiry is possible on review, a trial judge, faced by an accused's assertion of his right to counsel of his choice, would be unable to consider counsel\u2019s performance in light of all the evidence and could not thereby determine whether counsel\u2019s actions were prejudicial to the extent required to find a constitutional violation pursuant to <em>Strickland. </em>On the other hand, the test set out in <em>Linton, Burton, </em>and <em>Welty </em>entrusts the determination to the discretion of the trial judge and involves a balancing of the accused\u2019s rights with public interests in judicial efficiency. This approach allows inquiry into a variety of factors including the time in the proceeding at which the accused seeks new counsel and embodies a flexibility necessary to the variety of contexts in which such requests may arise. Therefore, we find the current approach to requests for substitution of counsel sound and decline to apply <em>Strickland </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">We also consider, in light of <em>Strickland, </em>whether, to be entitled to relief, an accused must establish that his defense was prejudiced by the trial judge\u2019s erroneous denial of his request for substitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">An evaluation of an alleged error in light of the evidence in a case frequently plays a role in disposing of a cas\u00e9 under the guise of either a prejudice inquiry as a prerequisite to establishing a constitutional violation, <em>Strickland, </em>or in finding an established constitutional error <em>de minimus </em>or harmless. <em>Chapman v. California </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Flanagan, </em>104 S.Ct. 1051, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>1056-57 (1984), the Court found it unnecessary to decide whether a defendant asserting denial of the right to counsel of choice must show prejudice to obtain reversal. However, the Court did note that, \u201cto the extent that the asserted right to counsel of one\u2019s choice is like, for example, the Sixth Amendment right to represent oneself[,] ... [ojbtaining reversal for violation of such a right does not require a showing of prejudice to the defense, since the right reflects constitutional protection of the defendant\u2019s free choice independent of concern for the objective fairness of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other circumstances, such as a denial of appointment of counsel as required by <em>Gideon </em>or denial of counsel\u2019s request to be replaced due to conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed. <em>Id. United States v. Celani, </em>748 F.2d 363, 366 (7th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, although \u201cthere is generally no basis for finding a Sixth Amendment violation unless the accused can show how specific errors of counsel undermined the reliability of the finding of guilt,\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2047 n. 26, such errors are cognizable without any showing of effect on the outcome of the proceeding when the right asserted is entitled to constitutional protection apart from the objective fairness of the proceeding. The prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>therefore, has no applicability to counsel of choice cases since, unlike the right to counsel of choice, \u201cthe right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2046.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The majority of courts have held that prejudice need not be shown when an accused is denied the right to counsel of his choice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>United States v.

As noted <em>supra </em>at 8, prejudice to the accused is but one factor to be considered by the trial judge and a continuance or substitution may properly be granted in the absence of prejudice and may properly be denied despite its presence. <em>Burton, </em>584 F.2d at 491 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We have concluded above that the right to counsel of choice, like the right to self-representation, is premised on respect for the individual and similarly is either respected or denied irrespective of the harmlessness or prejudicial nature of the error. <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 951 n. 8, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Requiring an accused to establish that he was prejudiced by a trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion for substitution would focus our attention on the result obtained by the substitution rather than on the accused\u2019s right to exercise such choice. Therefore, requiring a showing of prejudice would obliterate the heretofore recognized right of the accused to counsel of his choice, would reduce the balancing approach of <em>Linton </em>and <em>Burton </em>to a parroting of <em>Strickland, </em>and would lock the accused into his first selection of counsel unless he can prove conduct rising to the level of constitutional ineffectiveness. Therefore, having determined that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to respect Wilson\u2019s complaints regarding counsel, we decline to depart from precedent and will not require that an accused, improperly deprived of counsel of his choice, show prejudice resulting from the trial court\u2019s denial thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Application of a prejudice standard would not affect our disposition of this case, since we find that Wilson was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">First, the Court in <em>Strickland </em>reaffirmed that \u201cprejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2067. However, \u201c[prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel \u2018actively represented conflicting interests\u2019 and \u2018that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. at 345-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1716-19). While this presumption grew out of multiple representation cases, prejudice has also been presumed when counsel\u2019s interests conflict with his client\u2019s interests. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Zepp, </em>748 F.2d 125, 139 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Whiteside v. Scurr, </em>744 F.2d 1323, 1330 (8th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Cancilla, </em>725 F.2d 867, 870 (2d Cir.1984). <em>See United States v. Barnes, </em>662 F.2d 777, 782 n. 8 (D.C.Cir. 1980). Although \u201c[t]his conflict must cause some lapse in representation contrary to the defendant\u2019s interests ... such lapse need not rise to the level of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Cuyler, </em>723 F.2d 1077, 1086 (3d Cir.1983). In our initial disposition of this case, this panel unanimously found that counsel\u2019s decision to continue his battle of wits with the trial judge rather than attend to his client\u2019s case constituted \u201can irreconcilable conflict between the interests of defense counsel and petitioner which prejudiced petitioner\u2019s case____\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>733 F.2d at 428. As a result of this conflict, counsel stated before the jury that he no longer was Wilson\u2019s counsel and he subsequently refused to cross-examine the witness who was on the stand during the initial confrontation between counsel and the trial judge. It is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>counsel\u2019s loyalty to his own interests rather than those of his client adversely affected his performance in terms of appearance before the jury as well as his tactical conduct of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Second, in <em>Cronic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2047, the Court has reaffirmed that no specific showing of prejudice is required when an accused is deprived of his sixth amendment right to effective cross-examination. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). Prejudice need not be shown since denial of such a right is of such magnitude that \u201cno amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131, 88 S.Ct. 748, 749, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968) (quoting <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 3, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1246, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966)). If prejudice is presumed when a trial judge denies a defendant the right of cross-examination, reason dictates that such presumption be of equal force when a trial judge unreasonably refuses a defendant\u2019s request to remove counsel who flatly refuses to cross-examine a witness because of his running feud with the judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, even if a showing of prejudice were a prerequisite to reversal, the conflict of interest between counsel and client along with counsel\u2019s flat refusal to cross-examine a witness require a presumption of prejudice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We establish no novel right or theory of constitutional law, but rely on tried and true principles as old as the document we expound. The Court has recognized that \u201cSixth Amendment deprivations are subject to the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation____\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>449 U.S. at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 667. The accused has demonstrated that his right to choose the counsel to present his defense was unconstitutionally abridged. Therefore, having concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary and unreasonable, we hold that appropriate respect for Wilson\u2019s right of choice can be accorded only by directing the district court to grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-17\">. <em>Mintzes v.

Recognition of defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice developed in cases such as <em>Glasser </em>where a defendant objected to multiple representation of co-defendants. \"The accused under such circumstances has a special interest in representation by experienced counsel of his own choice in whom he can have the kind of confidence that grows from long-standing acquaintance____\" <em>United States v. Mardian, </em>546 F.2d 973, 980 (D.C.Cir.1976) (en <em>banc). </em>While the Court has emphatically rejected the notion that an accused has the right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship, <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 13-14, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1617-18, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983), the Court has not indicated that this rejection diminishes the accused\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel, right to conflict-free counsel, or right to counsel of choice. <em>See generally United States v.

The exchanges cited above indicate that although the prospect of retaining different counsel was raised, such prospect was quashed when the trial judge continued to ignore Wilson\u2019s complaints. The dissent argues that the issue in this case is whether Wilson\u2019s counsel was ineffective since this was the issue presented to the Michigan Court of Appeals. However, although the issue before the Michigan appellate court was phrased in terms of counsel\u2019s competency, the appellate court clearly recognized that at issue was whether the trial judge erred in not allowing Wilson to seek substitute counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-30\">The trial court asked the defendant twice if he was satisfied with counsel and both times received a negative answer. In <em>People v. Wilson, supra, </em>the Court held that a defendant was entitled to substitution of appointed counsel for \"good cause\u201d and where the judicial process would not be disrupted. While counsel in the instant case was retained, no less a standard would seem to apply. Further, <em>Wilson </em>also indicated that the application of this substitution standard was left to the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-31\">The appellate court did not speak in terms of ineffectiveness of counsel, nor did it cite Michigan case law, <em>People v. Garcia, </em>398 Mich. 250, 264, 247 N.W.2d 547 (1976) (citing <em>Beasley v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 687 (6th Cir.1974)), which sets out the standards for judging ineffectiveness. It would certainly be curious to adopt a construction of a state court\u2019s opinion which ascribes to that court the application of legal standards to which the court makes neither explicit nor implicit reference. In fact, the \"good cause\u201d standard for substitution of counsel cited in the passage above is consistent with that enunciated in Part I B of this opinion. These factors, gleaned from our study of the state court opinion, convince us that our analysis of this case pursuant to substitution of counsel cases interpreting the accused\u2019s sixth amendment right to choice of counsel is consistent with the trial record and prior dispositions of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. Wilson has not claimed that, and the parties have not argued whether, counsel was constitutionally ineffective.

I have a problem. I have been reversed three times for incompetence of Counsel. I don't know how to solve the question. Each one has to be handled on its own merits.

We note that in the recent case of <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983), the Supreme Court reviewed a trial court\u2019s denial of motions for continuances to obtain counsel of choice and for more preparation time. The court limited its inquiry to whether the trial judge abused his discretion and did not inquire whether counsel\u2019s conduct rose to the level of constitutional ineffectiveness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">. Further, the Court has indicated that stricter standards may appropriately be applied to sixth amendment claims not raised at trial. <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1718 (\"In order to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\">. The prejudice inquiry in this context, compared with the prejudice inquiry in <em>Strickland, </em>differs semantically rather than substantively. If the <em>Strickland </em>standard of prejudice were applied, our inquiry would be whether the accused was prejudiced by the actions of counsel, whereas if a prejudice requirement is applied to choice of counsel claims the inquiry is whether the accused was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for substitution. Both inquiries would likely be determined based on assessments of counsel\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">. The difference in the standards appears to be in the burden of establishing prejudice or harmless error. The harmless error rule requires \"the beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained,\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828, whereas in a prejudice inquiry \u201d[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068. Obviously, constitutional errors such as denial of effective assistance of counsel which require a showing of prejudice as a prerequisite to a finding of error can never be harmless. Although, in light of <em>Strickland, </em>we deal primarily with the requirement of prejudice, the Court has recognized that the right to be represented by counsel, like \"most constitutional rights, [is] subject to harmless error analysis ... unless the deprivation, by its very nature, cannot be harmless.\u201d <em>Rushen v. Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 104 S.Ct. 453, 455 n. 2, 78 L.Ed.2d 267 (1983). <em>See, </em>however, <em>Rushen, </em>104 S.Ct. at 461 (Stevens, J., concurring). <em>See also Moore v. Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 220, 232, 98 S.Ct. 458, 466, 54 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) (use of evidence obtained in derogation of right to counsel is subject to the harmless error rule); <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 54, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1982, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970) (no <em>per se </em>rule of reversal in late appointment of counsel cases); <em>Richardson v. Lucas, </em>741 F.2d 753, 757 (5th Cir.1984) (validity of waiver of right to counsel subject to harmless error rule). Likewise, the Court has recognized that a showing of prejudice is usually required. \"The premise of our prior cases is that the constitutional infringement identified has had or threatens some adverse effect upon the effectiveness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>counsel\u2019s representation or has produced some other prejudice to the defense. Absent such impact on the criminal proceeding, however, there is no basis for imposing a remedy in that proceeding, which can go forward with full recognition of the defendant's right to counsel and to a fair trial.\" <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 365, 101 S.Ct. 665, 668, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">. Likewise, \u201cthere are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error____\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827 (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Gideon, </em>right to counsel as example). <em>See Linton, </em>656 F.2d at 212.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\">. Since the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel is concerned with the objective fairness of the proceedings, a showing of prejudice may be appropriately required in such cases. <em>See Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616; <em>Cleven-ger, </em>733 F.2d at 1360-61. Cases such as <em>Morris v. Slappy </em>in which defendants seek continuances in order to obtain more time for counsel to prepare are premised on the theory that lack of adequate preparation time deprives the accused of the effective assistance of counsel. Since our concern in such cases is with the objective fairness of the proceeding, an inquiry into prejudice suffered by the accused is appropriate in reviewing rulings on such motions, although such inquiry would not be appropriate if the motion sought a change of counsel. <em>See United States v. Veatch, </em>674 F.2d 1217, 1226-27 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\">.

Mintzes, </em>733 F.2d 424, 425 (6th Cir.1984). When the Supreme Court vacated that judgment and remanded for our consideration in light of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the majority shifted ground away from the effective assistance issue and moved toward the Sixth Amendment denial of an accused\u2019s right to counsel of his choice. The majority now asserts that \u201cWilson has not claimed that, and the parties have not argued whether, counsel was constitutionally ineffective. The [state] trial judge, however, apparently believed that counsel\u2019s competency was implicated.\u201d Actually, the issue as presented to the Michigan Court of Appeals was whether the trial court erred in \u201cnot granting a mistrial or holding a full hearing on the competency issue.\u201d The same issue was stated in Wilson\u2019s petition filed in the district court as \u201cwhether the trial court erred in failing to hold a full evidentiary hearing on the matter of competency of defense counsel.\u201d Wilson\u2019s brief to this court reflects a similar shift in emphasis from that in the state court and in his habeas petition in the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Did the trial court err in failing to make further inquiry when the defendant expressed dissatisfaction with his retained counsel because of counsel\u2019s extremely inappropriate behavior during trial and in failing to declare a mistrial so.that defendant could obtain counsel of his own choosing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">A careful reading of the record convinces me that the issue presented to us is best analyzed in terms of ineffective assistance of counsel rather than deprivation of the right to counsel. Although both rights are part and parcel of the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, they address different concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">It must be remembered that counsel defending Wilson at the state trial was retained counsel, and until the intemperate outburst of the trial judge questioned counsel\u2019s competence, there had not been one suggestion by the defendant of his dissatisfaction with his attorney. The suggestion that Mr. Wilson might want other counsel was initiated by the trial court in a fit of pique when it apparently misunderstood the state of preparation of Mr. Patterson, Wilson\u2019s attorney. The trial court took Patterson\u2019s statement that he had not examined the court record as meaning that he was not familiar with the court record. It later appeared that the court record had been fully copied by his office and that he had twice carefully examined all parts of that record and those documents so copied even though he had not done so by examining the original documents. It is evident that the trial court was rankled by the reversal of two trials recently held before him on the grounds of incompetence of counsel, and was highly sensitive to any suggestion that defense counsel was not prepared. Defense counsel, Mr. Patterson, was equally rankled by what he considered unjustified accusations and challenges to his competency. This triggered the outburst which has been so thoroughly spread upon the record in the majority opinion, and I certainly share in the observation that the outburst was unseemly, although most of it was out of the hearing of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is evident to me, also, that while Mr. Wilson did express himself, after being prodded by the trial judge, as not being satisfied with trial counsel, his dissatisfaction was not so much with Patterson as with the events which had occurred the previous day and his concern about whether he would have a fair trial as a result of it. Thus the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">THE COURT: And you\u2019re satisfied with your lawyer, Mr. Wilson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">MR. PATTERSON: Let me make one last statement. I want to get this in the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">DEFENDANT WILSON: No. I made a statement that I wasn\u2019t satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">THE COURT: You\u2019re what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">DEFENDANT WILSON: I am not satisfied with the events that took place yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">THE COURT: You may not be satisfied \u2014 I\u2019m trying to protect your rights, Mr. Wilson. When I found out your lawyer, one, had never read the court file; two\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">MR. PATTERSON: Upstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">THE COURT: Upstairs, although he may have a complete copy in his office; he probably does have but I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">MR. PATTERSON: The Court\u2019s calling me a liar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">THE COURT: No, I\u2019m not calling you a liar; \u00cd said you have never read the original court file. You made that statement on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-17\">MR. PATTERSON: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-18\">THE COURT: And at that time I wanted to bring that to Mr. Wilson\u2019s attention because I think the minimum of any lawyer\u2019s preparation is to look at the court file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-19\">MR. PATTERSON: And I also indicated on the record yesterday, I had read our file and that I had read our file twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-20\">THE COURT: All right. This all took place outside the presence of the jury. The jury was not tainted in any way by the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>DEFENDANT WILSON: The jury saw what happened, what went on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aax-dedup-0\">THE COURT: The record will show\u2014 the jury heard some statements made by your lawyer, not by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">A fair reading of the record would indicate that it was the continuation of the trial itself in view of the circumstances, rather than unhappiness with Mr. Patterson, which evoked Wilson\u2019s response. It is significant that when the trial resumed the next day Patterson was still there to represent Wilson. As far as I know, after this final outburst between Mr. Patterson and the trial judge, which was out of the hearing of the jury, the trial settled down. Thereafter, Mr. Patterson is not charged with any dereliction of his duty nor do I find any allegation that he was guilty of any misconduct. As the Michigan Court of Appeals observed, Mr. Wilson was still represented by the same firm at the time the appeal was perfected to the Michigan Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Other than the outburst recited in the majority opinion, Mr. Patterson\u2019s representation of Mr. Wilson throughout the trial was skilled and aggressive and did not evidence any neglect or incompetence. Aside from the one witness whom he refused to cross-examine, Patterson appears to have examined the other government witnesses, to have called some witnesses of his own, and to have made a competent closing argument to the jury. Even at the height of his outbursts, Patterson was careful to move for a mistrial because of the court\u2019s perceived misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Michigan Court of Appeals carefully considered the precise issue presented to it and now to us \u2014 whether the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial or to hold a full hearing on the question of the competence of counsel. Because the court\u2019s analysis is instructivo, I quote it in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">Defendant next maintains that after the court raised the issue of defense counsel\u2019s competency and defendant indicated that he was not satisfied with his lawyer, it erred in not granting a mistrial or holding a full hearing on the competency issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">The granting of a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>People v. Talaga, </em>37 Mich.App. 100, 102, 194 N.W.2d 462 (1971), and the court\u2019s discretionary decision will not be set aside unless resulting prejudice to the defendant is demonstrated. A careful reading of this record demonstrates no prejudice to the defendant arising out of the court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial. The inflammatory exchange between the court and counsel occurred in substantial [sic] was resolved when counsel continued with the trial the following morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">However, the troublesome issue remains. The trial court asked the defendant twice if he was satisfied with counsel and both times received a negative answer. <em>In People v. Wilson, </em>397 Mich. 76, 243 N.W.2d 257 (1976), the Court held that a defendant was entitled to substitution of appointed counsel for \u201cgood cause\u201d and where the judicial process would not be disrupted. While counsel in the instant case was retained, no less a standard would seem to apply. Further, <em>Wilson </em>also indicated that the application of this substitution standard was left to the discretion of the court. Here, although the judge raised the competency issue and the defendant indicated his agreement with the court\u2019s seeming dissatisfaction with counsel, the following day the trial continued without either the court or defendant pursuing the concerns raised earlier in the proceedings. Thus, it would appear that both the court and the defendant had resolved their doubts in favor of counsel. We have reviewed the record and find that a skillful defense was conducted. It is noted that defendant is still represented by the same firm, proper briefs have been filed for his appeal, and oral argument was exceedingly well presented in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">Considering the lack of demonstrable prejudice to defendant\u2019s case by the court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on the issue of competency, we decline to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>aside the jury\u2019s decision where there was sufficient evidence to support their findings. We do so acknowledging that the court, in general, was abrasive, but noting that its conduct was not reserved for defendant and his attorney alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><em>People v. Wilson, </em>No. 77-613, slip op. at 2-3 (Mich.App. Nov. 8, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In <em>Beasley v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 687 (6th Cir.1974), our court abandoned the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard as a meaningful test of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in favor of the right to \u201ccounsel reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably effective assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696. The court then stated that \u201c[djefense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law and must conscientiously protect his client\u2019s interest, undeflected by conflicting considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Celebrezze went on to hold that under the facts, petitioner Beasley had not received effective assistance of counsel before and during trial because potentially exonerating defenses were not explored and were not developed. \u201cBecause Petitioner was represented by incompetent and ineffective counsel, his conviction cannot stand. Harmless error tests do not apply in regard to the deprivation of a procedural right so fundamental as the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In applying the test of <em>Beasley </em>to the present case, the performance of defense counsel during the unseemly outburst did not, in my opinion, conform to <em>Beasley\u2019s </em>standards. It was true that the record showed Patterson to have been generally competent and in fact to have been prepared for trial, and we are pointed to no defense which was neglected. On the other hand, his conduct during the outburst which extended even to comments in front of the jury, cannot be justified and in my opinion, and that of the rest of the panel, did not conform to that which would be expected of a \u201clawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law\u201d and who \u201cmust conscientiously protect his client\u2019s interest, undeflected by conflicting considerations.\u201d Having said as much, however, it is apparent that the remainder of the test in <em>Beasley </em>with respect to harmless error, has been considerably modified by <em>Strickland. </em>It is at this point where I disagree with the majority, although much of its comment is indeed well taken and is juris-prudentially sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The majority seems to analyze the conduct complained of as amounting to the attorney\u2019s abandonment, for his own interest, of the interest of his client. Once this is shown, the majority concludes that \u201c[t]he prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>therefore, has no applicability to counsel of choice cases since, unlike the right to counsel of choice, \u2018the right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.\u2019 <em>[United States v. </em>] <em>Cronic, </em>104 S.Ct. [2039, 2046 (1984)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Because counsel for the defendant was privately retained, because the question of a change of counsel was first suggested not by the defendant but by the court in a fit of pique, and because it is apparent upon the record that the defendant\u2019s unhappiness was not with his counsel but with the event itself and particularly with the court\u2019s outburst and its effect upon the jury, I believe that this case is best analyzed in terms of ineffective assistance. The outburst of Mr. Patterson was just that \u2014 ineffective assistance. The outburst amounted to attorney misconduct. It was not directed in anger at his client; indeed in the course of it, Mr. Patterson was careful to make motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The majority found as it did earlier that \u201c[fit is clear that counsel\u2019s loyalty to its own interest rather than those of his client adversely affected his performance in terms of appearance before the jury as well as his tactical conduct of the case.\u201d This is true only in the sense that any misconduct of defense counsel would be adverse to his client\u2019s best interest. There was no real conflict of interest apparent between the interest of Mr. Patterson and the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of Mr. Wilson. He possessed no loyalty to some other client. His ego had simply been bruised by the comments of the trial judge and he responded vehemently. At no time did he suggest that he was disaffected from the interest of his client or that his loyalty was otherwise directed. In fact, after court resumed the following day matters improved considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">It seems to me that this aspect of the appeal is very carefully addressed by Justice O\u2019Connor in <em>Strickland. </em>After observing that \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment,\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2067, Justice O\u2019Connor then goes on to discuss the question of presumption of prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">One type of actual ineffectiveness claim warrants a similar, though more limited, presumption of prejudice. In <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S., at 345-350, 90 S.Ct., at 1716-1719, the Court held that prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest. In those circumstances, counsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests. Given the obligation of counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and the ability of trial courts to make early inquiry in certain situations likely to give rise to conflicts, see, <em>e.g., </em>Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 44(c), it is reasonable for the criminal justice system to maintain a fairly rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of interest. Even so, the rule is not quite the <em>per se </em>rule of prejudice that exists for the Sixth Amendment claims mentioned above. Prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel \u201cactively represented conflicting interests\u201d and \u201cthat an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S., at 350, 348, 90 S.Ct., at 1719, 1718 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">Conflict of interest claims aside, <em>actual ineffectiveness claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are subject to a general requirement that the defendant affirmatively prove prejudice. </em>The government is not responsible for, and hence not able to prevent, attorney errors that will result in reversal of a conviction or sentence. Attorney errors come in an infinite variety and are as likely to be utterly harmless in a particular case as they are to be prejudicial. They cannot be classified according to likelihood of causing prejudice. Nor can they be defined with sufficient precision to inform defense attorneys correctly just what conduct to avoid. Representation is an art, and an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even brilliant in another. Even if a defendant shows that particular errors of counsel were unreasonable, therefore, the defendant must show that they actually had an adverse effect on the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">104 S.Ct. at 2067 (emphasis added). I, therefore, conclude that <em>Strickland </em>requires us to examine the record of the state proceedings in terms of whether the defendant has carried his burden of showing \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068. So viewing the case, I find myself more in accord with the conclusions of the Michigan Court of Appeals and of Judge Joiner in the District Court. By the time the trial had resumed and additional witnesses had been put on, the court and counsel had considerably cooled down. Mr. Patterson resumed his vigorous cross-examination of the witnesses, and he participated fully and aggressively in the remainder of the trial. There was nothing in the outburst which in fact reflected upon the guilt or innocence of Mr. Wilson. The outburst might even have produced considerable sympathy in the jury for the plight of Mr. Wilson. Certainly nothing the trial judge said was di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rected to the question of Mr. Wilson\u2019s guilt or innocence or even implied his involvement or fault in the fracas. Adequate precautionary instructions were given. The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I previously instructed you that the questions that the attorneys ask are not evidence, and the evidence is the answers supplied by the witnesses. Likewise, pri- or to starting this trial, I told you that an attorney had a duty to make objections, and then it is the duty of the Court to rule on the objections, and I wish to emphasize the conduct of the attorney for the other side should not reflect upon the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">You should decide this case not on what that attorney asks, what the attorney says, the attorneys\u2019 arguments, and questions, but, the case should be decided solely upon the testimony of the witnesses, and the six exhibits that have been admitted into the case, or seven exhibits that have been admitted into this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Have any members of the jury been prejudiced or biased because of the conduct, in any way, of the attorneys, during the course of this trial, either one side or the other, anything that the attorneys have done, that would effect your decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Would you all reach and decide this case solely upon the evidence, the testimony of the witnesses, not the arguments of the attorneys, and, certainly, the arguments are to direct your attention to the evidence, but the evidence, itself, that is what you are concerned with, and not the arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The defense made on behalf of Mr. Wilson although not successful was a logical one. It was his position that the complaining witness was a prostitute, that Mr. Wilson had purchased her favors, that she had voluntarily dispensed them but became perturbed when Mr. Wilson turned out to be $5.00 short of the specified fee. A competent witness was put on in support of that defense and a good argument was made. Under these circumstances, therefore, I would conclude that the defendant has not shown nor does the record show a reasonable probability that but for the unprofessional conduct of Mr. Patterson, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Although they did not possess at the time the standards articulated in <em>Strickland, </em>the Michigan Court of Appeals and the district court in their opinion clearly reflect substantially the same judgment. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
