Anderson appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his tort claim against the United States Postal Service for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">On April 29, 1981, Harry L. Anderson sent several of his original musical compositions from one Miami, Florida address to another by registered mail. Anderson declared the value of the package to be $75 and paid a $3.30 registration fee, which insured his package for $100. On the same day robbers held up a postal carrier and stole the mail, including Anderson\u2019s package. After making a written demand for indemnity, Anderson filed a complaint against the Postal Service for negligence seeking $800,000 in damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">The district court construed Anderson\u2019s complaint as a tort claim and as a claim for breach of the insurance contract. The court dismissed the tort claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, granted the Postal Service\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of contract damages and entered judgment in favor of Anderson for $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">Anderson appears to appeal only the dismissal of his tort claim and not the partial summary judgment for the Postal Service on the issue of contract damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">The district court properly treated Anderson\u2019s tort claim against the Postal Service as a suit against the United States. <em>See Sportique Fashions, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>597 F.2d 664, 665 (9th Cir.1979) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-19\">The Federal Tort Claims Act grants a waiver of sovereign immunity in certain cases. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b) the United States retains sovereign immunity for tort claims against it for \u201closs, miscarriage, or negligent transmission\u201d of the mails.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. United States Postal Service, </em>675 F.2d 756, 758 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam); <em>Sportique Fashions, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>597 F.2d at 665 (9th Cir.1979) (dictum). Therefore, Anderson\u2019s tort claim against the Postal Service for loss of his package during the robbery was barred by sovereign immunity and the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\">. Anderson originally filed in the Southern District of Florida and the action was later transferred to the Central District of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\">.
