(IFTS) and L.F.G., Inc. (LFG). During 1973 and 1974, IFTS and LFG were major shareholders of Simarloo Pty., Ltd., an Australian corporation. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, Simarloo realized capital gains on the sale of certain stock. Simarloo did not distribute this profit to its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-28\">The Commissioner determined that Si-marloo was a foreign personal holding company under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-556 for the 1973 fiscal year. Accordingly, pursuant to section 551(b), the Commissioner imputed to both IFTS and LFG their pro rata shares of Simarloo\u2019s undistributed income as dividends for the appropriate taxable years. This constructive distribution resulted in both IFTS and LFG being classified as domestic \u201cpersonal holding companies\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 542, and consequently be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>ing liable for the personal holding company tax under section 541. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.543-l(b). The Commissioner issued appellants notices of deficiency for the appropriate taxable years..</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">Appellants petitioned the Tax Court for review of these determinations. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner\u2019s position. <em>Mariani Frozen Foods, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>81 T.C. 448 (1983). In this court, appellants contend that the constructive dividends IFTS and LFG received from Simarloo under section 551(b) do not constitute dividends for purposes of determining whether IFTS and LFG qualified as personal holding companies under section 542. The transferees of LFG also argue that the statute of limitations bars the Commissioner\u2019s assessment against them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject both of these contentions for the reasons stated in the Tax Court\u2019s well-reasoned and comprehensive opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>81 T.C. at 486-90, 503-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1505-14\">. In the Tax Court, appellants raised four additional issues that they do not press on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1505-24\">. We find no merit in appellants\u2019 contention that the Tax Court erred in failing to consider the applicability of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 951(d). That statute has no relevance to the issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
