No. 98-473, \u00a7\u00a7 202-210, 98 Stat. 1837, 1976-1987 (codified at scattered sections of 18 U.S.C.). The Act provides that a defendant who has been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment shall be detained pending appeal unless the court finds \u201cthat the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released\u201d and \u201cthat the appeal is not for purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b). Here, we are required to interpret for the first time the meaning of the phrase <em>\u201ca </em>substantial question of law or fact likely to result in a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">Handy was indicted for conspiracy to import heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (1982), importation of heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960(a)(1), (b) (1982), and possession of heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (1982). She was admitted to bail pending trial upon execution of a $20,000 secured appearance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">Handy filed a motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence. She contended that the customs officers who strip searched her and discovered heroin had no \u201creal suspicion\u201d that she was engaged in the smuggling of narcotics. <em>See United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, </em>421 F.2d 876, 879 (9th Cir.1970). After conducting three days of hearings on Handy\u2019s suppression motion, the district court issued a written order denying the motion. Handy then stipulated to the facts, including possession of heroin, but reserved the right to challenge on appeal the admissibility of the evidence discovered as a result of the strip search. Shortly thereafter the district court convicted her following a trial on the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">The district court sentenced Handy to two concurrent 18-month terms of incarceration to be followed by a five-year period of probation and a special parole term. At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Handy\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that Handy was not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released, \u201cand that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay and does raise a substantial question of law.\u201d The court nevertheless denied bail on the ground that it did not view reversal to be \u201clikely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">Handy then moved this court to admit her to bail pending appeal on the same terms in effect prior to conviction. Because we conclude that the district court misconstrued the phrase \u201csubstantial question likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b) (1982), we grant Handy\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">The government contends that the disputed phrase plainly limits bail pending appeal to defendants who can demonstrate that they will probably prevail on appeal. Handy argues that, properly interpreted, \u201csubstantial\u201d defines the <em>level of merit </em>required in the question presented and \u201clikely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial\u201d defines the <em>type of question </em>that must be presented. The Third Circuit has recently adopted the view urged by Handy, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d 19 (3d Cir.1985), as has the Eleventh Circuit, <em>United States v. Giancola, </em>754 F.2d 898 (11th Cir.1985). We adopt that interpretation of the statute as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">The construction of the phrase suggested by the government is untenable for a number of reasons. First, the meaning the government would have us give the phrase is <em>precisely </em>the meaning the phrase would have if the word \u201csubstantial\u201d were deleted, i.e., if the statute limited bail to cases in which \u201cthe appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.\u201d A statute should be construed so as to avoid making any word superfluous. <em>Yamaguchi v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>706 F.2d 940, 946 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Mehrmanesh, </em>689 F.2d 822, 829 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">Second, Congress did not intend to limit bail pending appeal to cases in which the defendant can demonstrate at the outset of appellate proceedings that the appeal will probably result in reversal or an order for a new trial. The legislative history states that the purpose of the statute is to require \u201can affirmative finding that the chance for reversal is substantial.\u201d S.Rep. No. 98-225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 27, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3182, 3210. As we discuss further <em>infra, </em>a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>ing that the chance of reversal is substantial is, of course, very different from a showing that reversal is more likely than not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Finally, requiring the defendant to demonstrate to the district court that its ruling is likely to result in reversal is tantamount to requiring the district court to certify that it believes its ruling to be erroneous. Such an interpretation of the Act would make a mockery of the requirement of Fed.R.App.P. 9(b) that the application for bail be made in the first instance in the district court. We do not think Congress intended to invalidate that requirement <em>sub silentio </em>and thereby to vest exclusive authority over post-sentencing bail motions in appellate courts. In fact, the new version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141 adopted in the Act, <em>see </em>Bail Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 203, 98 Stat. 1981, makes it plain that such was not the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">For the above reasons, we reject the government\u2019s proposed construction of the statute. Like the Third and Eleventh Circuits, we find that the word \u201csubstantial\u201d defines the level of merit required in the question raised on appeal, while the phrase \u201clikely to result in reversal\u201d defines the type of question that must be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Next, we examine the closely related issue of how much merit there must be to a question in order for a court to find it to be a \u201csubstantial question.\u201d An excessively strict interpretation of the term could result in giving the statute precisely the effect we have already rejected. Fortunately the issue is hardly a new one for the courts; nor does it appear to be one of particular difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">Historically the phrase \u201csubstantial question\u201d has referred to questions that are \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d Included within this definition have been questions that are novel and not readily answerable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-9\">The question may be \u201csubstantial\u201d even though the judge or justice hearing the application for bail would affirm on the merits of the appeal. The question may be new and novel. It may present unique facts not plainly covered by the controlling precedents. It may involve important questions concerning the scope and meaning of decisions of the Supreme Court. The application of well-settled principles to the facts of the instant case may raise issues that are fairly debatable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\"><em>D'Aquino v. United States, </em>180 F.2d 271, 272 (11th Cir.1950) (Douglas, Circuit Justice). In <em>Herzog v. United States, </em>75 S.Ct. 349, 351, 99 L.Ed. 1299 (1955), Circuit Justice Douglas stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-12\">[T]he first consideration is the soundness of the errors alleged. Are they, or any of them, likely to command the respect of the appellate judges? It is not enough that I am unimpressed. I must decide whether there is a school of thought, a philosophical view, a technical argument, an analogy, an appeal to precedent or to reason commanding respect that might possibly prevail____ A question may nevertheless be \u201csubstantial\u201d ... if it is novel, or if there is a contrariety of views concerning it in the several circuits, or if the appellate court should give directions to its district judges on the question, or if in the interests of the administration of justice some clarification of an existing rule should be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\"><em>See also Williamson v. United States, </em>184 F.2d 280, 282 (2d Cir.1950) (Jackson, Circuit Justice) (\u201cIt is one thing to maintain that the Court of Appeals has given the right answer to a substantial question, but it is another thing to contend that there is no question which merits answer by the only Court invested with ultimate and nationwide authority in the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that a \u201csubstantial question\u201d is one that is \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d In <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), when discussing the level of merit required in a habeas appeal involving a death penalty, the Supreme Court noted that a \u201c \u2018substantial showing of the denial of [a] federal right,\u2019 \u201d 103 S.Ct. at 3394 (quoting <em>Stewart v. Beto, </em>454 F.2d 268, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number><em>nied, </em>406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1796, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972)), is \u201c \u2018something more than the absence of frivolity,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting Blackmun, <em>Allowance of In Forma Pau-peris Appeals in \u00a7 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases, </em>43 F.R.D. 343, 352 (8th Cir. 1967) )J The Court continued on to define a \u201csubstantial question\u201d as one that poses issues \u201c \u2018debatable among jurists of reason,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at n. 4 (quoting <em>Gordon v. Willis, </em>516 F.Supp. 911, 913 (N.D.Ga.1980)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">The first circuit to construe the term \u201csubstantial question\u201d in the Act we are considering \u2014 the Third Circuit \u2014 held that it should be given its historic meaning. In <em>Miller </em>the Third Circuit said that \u201csubstantial question\u201d is one that is \u201cfairly doubtful.\u201d 753 F.2d at 23. In our view, that definition is synonymous with \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">We recognize that all the cases we have discussed, other than <em>Miller </em>and <em>Giancola, </em>involve earlier rules or statutes or arose in different contexts. However, a review of the history of legislative enactments that preceded the adoption of the current statute and a consideration of that statute as a whole persuade us that giving \u201csubstantial question\u201d its well-established, customary meaning is fully consistent not only with precedent and logic but with the overall statutory scheme as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">Prior to 1956, Rule VI of the Rules of Criminal Appeal, 292 U.S. 663-64 (1934), allowed for bail only if the appeal presented a \u201csubstantial question.\u201d The \u201csubstantial question\u201d standard was abandoned when the Federal Rules were amended in 1956, <em>see </em>Amendment to Fed.R.Crim.P. 46(a)(2), 350 U.S. 1021 (1956). The new standard allowed for bail as long as an appeal presented a question that was not \u201cfrivolous.\u201d The 1956 amendment \u201cgreatly liberalized\u201d the earlier' rule. <em>Ward v. United States, </em>76 S.Ct. 1063, 1064-65, 1 L.Ed.2d 25 (1956) (Frankfurter, Circuit Justice). Subsequently the new rule was incorporated in the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (repealed October 23,1984). In 1984 the more liberal standard was in turn abandoned. In its place Congress once again adopted a \u201csubstantial question\u201d test. By reenacting the \u201csubstantial question\u201d standard, the Bail Reform Act of 1984 reintroduced the stricter standard that had been applicable prior to the adoption, in 1956, of the \u201cfrivolous\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>test. Some of the cases discussed above directly examine the stricter \u201csubstantial question\u201d requirement that has now once again been adopted. Others examine that phrase in other contexts. All reach similar conclusions as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">We do not think it necessary, in order to effectuate Congress\u2019 purpose, to ignore the cases that have previously defined the term \u201csubstantial question.\u201d It was after the term had been consistently construed in the manner we have described that Congress decided to incorporate it in the 1984 Act. Moreover, in that Act, in addition to readopting the stricter \u201csubstantial question\u201d standard, Congress made other significant changes, designed to toughen the law with respect to bail pending appeal. Most important were the following: (a) as discussed earlier, Congress added a new requirement that the question be of a type that, .if resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor, would be likely to result in reversal or a new trial; (b) Congress shifted the burden of proof from the government to the defendant. Each of the changes contained in the Bail Reform Act of 1984 makes it considerably more difficult for a defendant to be released on bail pending appeal. Viewing the changes as a whole, we have no doubt that Congress succeeded in accomplishing its basic<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purpose of tightening the standards for bail pending appeal. Accordingly, we see no need to define \u201csubstantial question\u201d in a manner contrary to that in which it has always previously been defined, even assuming we would have the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">We conclude that a \u201csubstantial question\u201d is one that is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d <em>D'Aquino v. United States, </em>180 F.2d at 272; <em>accord Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>103 S.Ct. at 3394 n. 4, or \u201cfairly doubtful,\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d at 23. \u201cIn short, a \u2018substantial question\u2019 is one of more substance than would be necessary to a finding that it was not frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Giancola, </em>754 F.2d at 901; <em>accord Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>103 S.Ct. at 3394; <em>Gardner v. Pogue, </em>558 F.2d 548, 551 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">To summarize, we adopt the interpretation of the 1984 Bail Act first set forth by the Third Circuit in <em>Miller. </em>As both the Third and Eleventh Circuits have stated, under the 1984 Bail Act a court must find the following to grant bail pending appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-8\">(1) that the defendant is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person in the community if released;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-9\">(2) that the appeal is not for purpose of delay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-10\">(3) that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-11\">(4) that if that substantial question is determined favorably to defendant on appeal, that decision is likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial of all counts on which imprisonment has been imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-12\"><em>Giancola, </em>754 F.2d at 901; <em>Miller, </em>753 F.2d at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\">The government does not challenge the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts and does not argue that Handy fails to present a \u201csubstantial question\u201d as that term was defined by the district court. The government\u2019s argument in this case goes solely to the legal meaning of the terms and phrases employed in the statute. In determining that the suppression question was \u201csubstantial,\u201d the district court applied, essentially, the traditional test we have described above. We therefore conclude that in applying that term the district court used the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">The district court found that Handy is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any person in the community if released and that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay. The government does not challenge these findings. Finally, it is clear that if the substantial question is determined favorably to Handy on appeal, that decision will likely result in an order for a new trial. The government does not even suggest that if the district court\u2019s ruling on the fourth amendment issue is found to be in error, the error would be harmless; the conviction after the trial on stipulated facts could not be affirmed if the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>formed the basis for the most crucial stipulation was illegally obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">In response to Handy\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal, the government contends that the district court correctly determined that it was without authority to grant bail unless it could conclude that its decision would likely be reversed. For all of the reasons we have set forth, we disagree. Since the government questions only the legal meaning of the statutory terms and phrases, since the district court applied the proper legal test in determining that a substantial question exists, since we find that the question presented is such that if error is found reversal is likely, and since there is no dispute that appellant meets the other conditions of eligibility for bail we remand to the district court for imposition of appropriate conditions of release in accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(c) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">. We also have had occasion to distinguish the meaning of the terms \"substantial\" and \u201cnot frivolous.\u201d In <em>Gardner v. Pogue, </em>558 F.2d 548 (9th Cir. 1977), we held that the \"substantial question\u201d test is stricter than the \"not frivolous\u201d test. We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-7\">The difference between the terms \"not frivolous\u201d and \"substantial\u201d is perhaps one of art. Certainly it is subject to subtle analysis. Nevertheless, the very fact that different words are used to describe the standards ... indicates that distinctions do exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 551.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">. In <em>Giancola, </em>the Eleventh Circuit stated that \"we agree with the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation, though we add ... observations of our own.\u201d 754 F.2d at 901. In its \"observations\u201d the Eleventh Circuit first commented on the Third Circuit\u2019s suggestion of an additional basis for finding a \"substantial question.\u201d The Third Circuit referred to a question that is \"novel, has not been decided by controlling precedent.\u201d The Eleventh Circuit suggested that, if viewed in isolation, such a standard might not be sufficient to separate substantial from non-substantial questions. <em>Id. </em>We agree with that observation and think the Third Circuit would also. We also agree with much of the remainder of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s observations. We agree that: (a) \"[A] \u2018substantial question' is one of more substance than would be necessary to a finding that it was not frivolous,\u201d <em>id.; </em>(b) \u201c[T]here are no blanket categories for what questions do or not constitute \u2018substantial\u2019 ones,\u201d <em>id) </em>and (c) \u201cWhether a question is \u2018substantial\u2019 must be determined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d <em>id. </em>There is one observation, however, we do not endorse because it might, if re'ad literally, be viewed as modifying <em>Miller. </em>In its \"observations\u201d the Eleventh Circuit suggests that a substantial question is a \"close\" one. <em>Id. </em>That is the observation that is singled out by our colleague and forms the basis for his dissenting opinion. If the observation was intended by the Eleventh Circuit as a modification of the <em>Miller </em>\"fairly debatable\u201d test, as our dissenting colleague suggests it was, we reject it, since we believe the Third Circuit formulation to be more consistent with the statute and long standing precedent. If the observation was intended by the Eleventh Circuit only as an explanation, we reject it since it confuses rather than clarifies the <em>Miller </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1378-6\">FARRIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANW\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial question\u201d as one that is merely \u201cfairly doubtful\u201d or \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d I would instead adopt the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s statement that a \u201csubstantial question\u201d is \u201ca \u2018close\u2019 question or one that very well could be decided the other way.\u201d <em>United States v. Giancola, </em>754 F.2d 898, 901 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">When Congress enacted the District of Columbia Code provision on which the 1984 Bail Reform Act was later modeled, Congress intended release on bail pending appeal to be limited to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 186 (1970), quoted in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d 19, 22 (3d Cir. 1985). This presumption against bail pending appeal was based on the fact that 1) the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cis presumably correct in law\u201d; 2) the sentencing judge has already made a determination that the defendant is dangerous to the person or property of others; 3) release after a conviction \u201cdestroys whatever deterrent effect remains in the criminal law\u201d; and 4) release pending appeal was not meant to be used as an opportunity to demonstrate a basis for reducing a sentence after the conviction has been affirmed. H.R.Rep. No. 907 at 186-87. A \u201cclose question\u201d standard would further the presumption against bail and restrict bail pending appeal to the extent Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">The cases cited by the majority in support of its definition of \u201csubstantial question\u201d are inapplicable because they rely on a presumption in favor of bail \u2014 \u201cthe presumption that the [Senate Judiciary] Committee wishe[d] to eliminate in section 3143.\u201d S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. at 26 (1983), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3182, 3209. For example, the majority quotes extensively from <em>D\u2019Aquino v. United States, </em>180 F.2d 271 (9th Cir.1950) (Douglas, Circuit Justice), and borrows from it the definition of a \u201csubstantial question\u201d as one that is \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d But <em>D\u2019Aquino </em>proceeds from the premise that \u201c[i]t has long been a principle of federal law that bail after conviction and pending appeal is a remedy normally available to a prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. That view is now invalid in light of Congress\u2019 stated intent that bail pending appeal should be available only under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and that there is a \u201cpresumption of detention\u201d pending appeal. Because <em>D \u2019Aquino </em>relies on an obsolete presumption against detention in reaching its conclusion that a \u201csubstantial question\u201d is one that is \u201cplainly not frivolous,\u201d <em>id., </em>and Congress has clearly indicated its intention that the new standard is to be higher than \u201cnonfrivolous,\u201d it is inappropriate to rely on <em>D Aquino </em>to interpret the 1984 Bail Reform Act. Similarly, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Herzog v. United States, </em>75 S.Ct. 349, 99 L.Ed. 1299 (1955) (Douglas, Circuit Justice), is misplaced because <em>Herzog </em>was based on the premise that \u201c[djoubts whether [bail pending appeal] should be granted or denied should always be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Finally, while the majority places reliance on the more recent formulation of \u201csubstantial question\u201d set out in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3394, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), that case and the authority it in turn relied on were decided in the context of a habeas proceeding, where \u201cdoubts should be resolved in favor of the petitioner.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Willis, </em>516 F.Supp. 911, 912 (N.D.Ga.1980), cited in <em>Barefoot, </em>103 S.Ct. at 3394 n. 4. Again, the presumption in the cases on which the majority relies \u2014 including <em>Gardner v. Pogue, </em>558 F.2d 548 (9th Cir.1977) \u2014 is exactly the opposite under the 1984 Bail Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">The majority notes that prior to 1956, \u201csubstantial question\u201d was defined as \u201cfairly debatable\u201d or \u201cfairly doubtful.\u201d The term \u201csubstantial question\u201d was dropped when the statutory standard for bail was eased in 1966, but the term reemerged in 1984. The majority\u2019s argument turns on the crucial inference that when Congress re-employed the term \u201csubstantial question\u201d in 1984, it also intended to reintroduce the pre-1956 interpretations of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">This would be an entirely reasonable reading of legislative intent, if it were not for the fact that the 1984 Act was undis-putably intended to place sharp restrictions on the availability of bail pending appeal. To adopt wholesale the pre-1956 interpretations of substantial question as \u201cfairly debatable\u201d would thwart Congress\u2019 manifest intention to restrict bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">The majority addresses this objection by arguing that Congress was able to restrict the availability of bail through <em>other </em>measures in the Act \u2014 by adding the requirement that a question be of a type \u201clikely to result in reversal,\u201d and shifting the burden of proof to the defendant \u2014 and that these measures alone were sufficient to accomplish Congress\u2019 basic purpose of tightening the availability of bail. However, questions raised on appeal nearly always are of a type \u201clikely to result in reversal.\u201d Therefore, the only hurdle that a defendant must realistically overcome is to carry his burden of showing that a \u201cfairly debatable\u201d question exists. This hurdle, in my opinion, would not restrict bail pending appeal to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as Congress intended. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 186 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">I therefore would adopt the approach of the Eleventh Circuit, which not only recognizes that a \u201c \u2018substantial question\u2019 is one of more substance than would be necessary to a finding that it was not frivolous,\u201d <em>Giancola, </em>754 F.2d at 901, but must further be \u201ca \u2018close\u2019 question or one that very well could be decided the other way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, I would not affirm the district court\u2019s use of a \u201cfairly debatable\u201d standard, but would reverse and remand to permit the district court to determine whether Handy has presented a \u201cclose\u201d question. The district court could then grant or deny bail accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
