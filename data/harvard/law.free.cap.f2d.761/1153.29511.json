The EPA sought damages and injunc-tive relief, claiming that the companies had exceeded the allowable emission levels of vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride under the manual vent valve and relief valve regulations published at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 61.-64(a)(3), 61.65(a) (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court ruled that the regulations had been promulgated in excess of the EPA\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act (\u201cAct\u201d) \u00a7 112, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412 (1982), and therefore dismissed the complaints for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the substantive validity of the regulations, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-17\">In 1970, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to authorize the Administrator of the EPA to promulgate national \u201cemission standards\u201d for hazardous air pollutants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Pub.L. No. 91-604, \u00a7 112(b)(1)(B), 84 Stat. 1685 (1970) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1)(B) (1982)). Section 112 directed the Administrator to publish a list of hazardous air pollutants and to prescribe for each an emission standard affording an ample margin for safety. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1)(A), (B). Emission standards limit the amount of hazardous air pollutants that can be discharged into the environment. Unlike \u201cwork practice standards,\u201d emission standards do not tell companies how to discharge \u2014 they only say how much. Under the 1970 amendments, the EPA was permitted to promulgate only emission standards, not work practice standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">As with most congressional delegations of lawmaking by rule, the Act left it to the Administrator to pour content into these relatively broad concepts. The statute was and is clear about one thing, however: an emission standard is subject to judicial review only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and only if the petition for review is filed within sixty days of the Administrator\u2019s action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Given this limited forum for judicial relief, the statute further contains a preclusive review provision, which states that any \u201c[ajction of the Administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1) shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7607(b)(2). In the present case, the Administrator\u2019s \u201caction\u201d occurred on October 20, 1976, when the vinyl and polyvinyl chloride regulations were promulgated. <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. 46,564 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellees, however, did not challenge the substantive validity of the regulations until 1983, when they filed their motions to dismiss in the present enforcement actions. At least on its face, then, section 307(b) divested the district court of jurisdiction to pass on the substantive validity of these regulations over five years after they should have been contested, if at all. <em>Luckie v. EPA, </em>752 F.2d 454, 456-57 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Borden, Inc., </em>572 F.Supp. 684, 690-91 (D.Mass.1983); <em>see Lubrizol Corp. v. Train, </em>547 F.2d 310, 311-19 (6th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">Our inquiry might have ended here were it not for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 98 S.Ct. 566, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978). In <em>Adamo Wrecking, </em>the Court held that, despite the clear language of section 307(b), a criminal defendant charged with violating an EPA emission standard under section 113(c) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(c)(1)(C), could challenge the Administrator\u2019s designation of the regulation as an emission standard. 434 U.S. at 284-85. Seizing this opening for judicial review, the court below ruled that the vinyl and polyvinyl regulations are emission standards in name only. 576 F.Supp. 80, 86 (M.D.La.1983). In the district court\u2019s view, the regulations, rather than merely pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>scribing a numerical limit for relief valve discharges of vinyl chloride, instead required compliance with specific work practices. The court reasoned that, since the determination of whether a discharge \u201ccould not have been avoided\u201d turned on the companies\u2019 compliance or noncompliance with certain work practices, the regulation could not fairly be termed an emission standard solely by virtue of its \u201cno discharge\u201d requirement. Since the agency lacked authority to promulgate work practice standards at the time these regulations were promulgated,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court held the regulations to be invalid and hence dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\"><em>Adamo Wrecking, </em>however, does not control this case. To the contrary, the Court rested its holding in <em>Adamo </em>on the nature of a criminal prosecution and the attendant unfairness that would result from disallowing a district court to assess the validity of a regulation whose violation would incur the possibility of severe fines and imprisonment. The Court\u2019s opinion implicitly acknowledged that, had it not been for the totality of the Act\u2019s structure with regard to criminal enforcement proceedings, the clear language of section 307(b) would have compelled a finding that Congress intended to divest the federal courts of jurisdiction over section 112 challenges in all enforcement proceedings, criminal as well as civil. <em>See Adamo Wrecking, </em>434 U.S. at 284, 98 S.Ct. at 572. The Court\u2019s <em>ratio decidendi </em>was unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-9\"><em>Since Congress chose to attach these stringent [criminal] sanctions </em>to the violation of an emission standard, in contrast to the violation of various other kinds of orders that might be issued by the Administrator, it is crucial to determine whether the Administrator\u2019s mere designation of a regulation as an \u2018emission standard\u2019 is conclusive as to its character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 283, 98 S.Ct. at 572 (emphasis added). In addition, faced with an admittedly unclear indication of the congressional intent underlying section 307(b)\u2019s preclusive effect in criminal prosecutions, the Court further relied on \u201cthe familiar rule that, \u2018where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 98 S.Ct. at 572-73 (citations omitted). Neither rationale is applicable in the context of civil proceedings. In light of section 307(b)\u2019s clear language and Congress\u2019s manifest intent to avoid protracted and inconsistent adjudications over the validity of EPA emission standards,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we would be remiss to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>narrow holding of <em>Adamo Wrecking </em>to bulldoze the statute\u2019s jurisdictional limitations in civil enforcement proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944) (upholding previous attempt by Congress, in the context of criminal enforcement proceedings, to require that the validity of regulatory action be challenged in a particular court at a particular time).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Moreover, even if <em>Adamo Wrecking </em>were applicable to the case at hand, we would at most be allowed to inquire whether the regulations constitute emission standards on their face.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Assuming for the moment that this limited inquiry is warranted, we take heed of the Court\u2019s cautionary words in <em>Adamo </em>Wrecking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-6\">We are aware of the possible dangers that flow from this interpretation; district courts will be importuned, under the guise of making a determination as to whether a regulation is an \u201cemission standard,\u201d to engage in judicial review in a manner that is precluded by \u00a7 307(b)(2) of the Act. This they may not do. The narrow inquiry to be addressed by the court in a criminal prosecution is not whether the Administrator has complied with appropriate procedures in promulgating the regulation in question, or whether the particular regulation is arbitrary, capricious, or supported by the administrative record. Nor is the court to pursue any of the other familiar inquiries which arise in the course of an administrative review proceeding. The question is only whether the regulation which the defendant is alleged to have violated is on its face an \u201cemission standard\u201d within the broad limits of the congressional meaning of that term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">434 U.S. at 285, 98 S.Ct. at 573. In answering this question, we have no trouble labeling the regulations as emission rather than work practice standards since each sets a \u201cno discharge\u201d cap on the amount of vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride that can be emitted. Where the regulations can be violated only by transgressions of this purely numerical discharge requirement, it cannot be said that the regulations are not on their face emission standards, or, more to the point, that the Administrator\u2019s characterization of them as such is unreasonable, <em>see, e.g., Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, </em>412 U.S. 94, 121, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 2095, 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>L.Ed.2d 772 (1973); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>PPG Industries v. Harrison, </em>660 F.2d 628, 633 (5th Cir.1981). <em>Accord Luckie, </em>752 F.2d at 456-57; <em>Borden, </em>572 F.Supp. at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Thus, to the extent section 307(b) requires us to determine as a preliminary matter whether these EPA regulations are emission standards, we hold for purposes of that jurisdictional inquiry that they are. The district court was consequently without jurisdiction to pass on the substantive validity of sections 61.64(a)(3) and 61.65(a) under the Clean Air Act, and the government, <em>qua </em>cleaner, may press its suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">. The language of \u00a7 61.64(a)(3) and \u00a7 61.65(a) is identical except as to the substance being discharged (\"polyvinyl chloride\u201d versus \u201cvinyl chloride\u201d) and the type of valve involved (\"manual vent valve\u201d versus \u201crelief valve\u201d). The latter provision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-10\">(a) <em>Relief valve discharge. </em>Except for an emergency relief discharge, there is to be no discharge to the atmosphere from any relief valve on any equipment in vinyl chloride service.

As defined in the 1970 amendments, \u201c[t]he term \u2018hazardous air pollutant\u2019 means an air pollutant to which no ambient air quality standard is applicable and which in the judgment of the Administrator may cause, or contribute to, an increase in mortality\u201d or serious disease. Pub.L. No. 91-604, \u00a7 112, 84 Stat. 1685 (1970). While the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments altered that definition, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1), vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride were listed as hazardous air pollutants at the time of appellants' alleged violations between 1977 and 1982, 40 Fed.Reg. 59,477 (1975), and they remain listed as such, 41 Fed.Reg. 46,564 (1977) (codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.60 (1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">.

While the Administrator can now promulgate a \"design, equipment, work practice or operational standard\u201d as well as an emission standard, work practice standards promulgated prior to the effective date of the 1977 amendments are invalid for being in excess of the Administrator\u2019s authority under the Act. <em>PPG Indus. v.

In <em>RSR Corp., </em>we examined the effect of \u00a7 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\"OSHA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f) (1982), which constitutes the exclusive vehicle for pre-enforcement review of standards promulgated under OSHA, but which does not speak to the preclu-sive effect of that act on a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear regulatory challenges that arise in the context of OSHA enforcement proceedings. We stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-12\">when an employer has participated in the rulemaking and pre-enforcement review of an OSHA regulation and could have then asserted either a substantive or procedural challenge to its validity, but did not, and has no excuse for its failure to do so, we will not entertain the challenge in an enforcement proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">747 F.2d at 302. <em>A fortiori, </em>to the extent we discerned that Congress intended to foreclose judicial review under the circumstances of <em>RSR Corp., </em>there is little room for doubt regarding congressional intent where, as here, the relevant statute speaks not only to the existence and nature of pre-enforcement review but also to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>non-existence of enforcement-CMW-review. <em>Compare, e.g., Shell Oil Co. v.

Concurring in <em>Adamo Wrecking, </em>Justice Powell expressed concern over the due process implications of section 307(b)'s jurisdictional limitations, at least in the context of a criminal prosecution. 434 U.S. at 289-91, 98 S.Ct. at 575-76 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>see also id. </em>at 293 n.*, 98 S.Ct. at 577 n.* (Stewart, J., dissenting). Like the Court in <em>Adamo Wrecking, </em>we are not presented with any challenge based on the due process theory that section 307(b) affords interested parties inadequate notice. <em>See Harrison v.

Appellees have not raised the issue, and indeed they would probably lack standing to do so, since each of the three companies was on actual notice and participated in the comment proceedings that accompanied the promulgation of these regulations. <em>Cf.
