Appellants sought review of a determination that they owed the Government some $27,000 because they had fraudulently overstated claims to reimbursement for services rendered under Part B of the Medicare program. The district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We note jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">Appellant Klein operates a diagnostic laboratory, the Alvarado Internal Medical Group, Inc. Klein and the laboratory perform services for individuals enrolled in Part B of the Medicare program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395j-1395x (1982). In the early 1970\u2019s, appellants qualified as- medical providers under Part B and for several years submitted claims to various private insurance carriers for reimbursement for medical services provided to Klein\u2019s patients and to users of the laboratory services. Apparently, because Klein received payment for the bills submitted, the insurance carriers approved these bills as reasonable and the medical services as necessary. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u; <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. 201, 203, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 1652, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-14\">On July 14,1976, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through local Part B insurance carriers, initiated an investigation of appellants\u2019 Part B Medicare billings from 1972 through August 1976. On December 18, 1976, the Part B insurance carriers notified appellants that they had been instructed by the Secretary to withhold payments on future Part B claims until completion of the investigation. The carriers asserted that they were proceeding under the regulations which authorize them to suspend payments, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.370-.373 (1982) (describing suspension procedure).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 17, 1976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>the government secured a federal grand jury indictment against appellants,. nine other doctors, and two other medical corporations for numerous violations of sections 287 (making false claims), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the Government), and 1001 (making false statements) of Title 18. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 287, 371, 1001 (1982). These criminal charges stemmed from appellants\u2019 submission of allegedly fraudulent claims for reimbursement under Part B of the Medicare program. In September of 1977, following a jury trial, appellants were acquitted on all eleven of the charges against them. Despite this acquittal, in December, 1978, the Secretary demanded reimbursement from appellant Klein ($10,687.67) and from appellant Alvarado Clinic ($37,277.31) for \u201coverpayments, damages, and costs\u201d in connection with the investigation of appellants\u2019 billing practices between 1972 and 1976. The Secretary also threatened a lawsuit by the U.S. Attorney under the False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 231 (1982), to recover interest, double damages and penalties. Appellants resisted these collection efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">The Secretary continued the suspension of payments to appellants, instituted in December, 1976, for the next five years, even though appellants were acquitted on the fraud charges, continued to perform services for persons insured under Part B, and continued to submit claims to the carriers based on those services. Indeed, appellants allege that the Secretary notified their patients that appellants\u2019 claims were under investigation, and required appellants to continue to accept Medicare claims for payment for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">As a result of the Secretary\u2019s conduct, substantial monies accumulated in appellants\u2019 suspended Medicare account. In March, 1981, the Secretary informed appellants that as a result of the investigation of their reimbursement claims, the insurance carriers and the Secretary had determined that appellants had filed false claims between 1972 and 1976 in the amount of $26,737.56. Consequently, in April, 1981, the Secretary ordered the $22,177.95 that had accumulated in appellants\u2019 suspended Medicare account transferred to the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund in partial satisfaction of the $26,737.56 debt owed to the Trust Fund on the allegedly fraudulent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">Appellants sought review of the Secretary\u2019s determination, with the insurance carriers, of the amount and existence of appellants\u2019 debt to the Trust Fund. The Secretary and the insurance carriers informed appellants that the only review available was by an employee of the carrier and that there was no provision for judicial review of that employee\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1895u(b)(8)(C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.820 (1981); <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 202-03, 102 S.Ct. at 1651-52. Appellants argued that the decision that they had submitted false claims and owed substantial sums to the Part B Trust Fund was subject, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3), to review by the Secretary in an administrative hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant sought judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision under the same section. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>The Regional Director of the Medicare Program insisted that section 1395u governed and that a hearing before the insurance carrier was appellants\u2019 only remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">Appellants subsequently filed suit in district court pursuant to the provisions for judicial review set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3). The Secretary moved for dismissal of the suit on the grounds that the district court had no jurisdiction and, even if it did, appellants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by refusing a hearing before the insurance carrier. The district court agreed that appellants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and dismissed the complaint. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">We must determine whether the investigation of appellants\u2019 Part B Medicare billings was instituted pursuant to the insurance carrier oversight provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u described in <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 202, 102 S.Ct. at 1651, or under the Secretary\u2019s power to investigate and correct fraud in the Medicare Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d). If the former provision governs the investigation of appellants, they are not entitled to judicial review and the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain their suit. <em>See Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 2018 n. 4, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (dicta); <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 206-08, 102 S.Ct. 1653-54; <em>Schweiker v. McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 102 S.Ct. 1665, 72 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). If the latter provision governs, appellants are entitled to an administrative hearing and judicial review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982) and we must then determine if appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by declining the Secretary\u2019s offer of review by the insurance carrier.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-15\">\n<em>Section 1395u</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-16\">A. <em>Purpose and Structure of Section 1395u.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-17\">Section 1395u allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with private insurance carriers for the administration of claims and payments under Part B of the Medicare program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The principal purpose of the section is to allow the Secretary to take advantage of the experience and efficiency of the private insurance industry to process and pay claims under the Part B Medicare program. <em>See Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 202, 102 S.Ct. at 1651.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-18\">Because of the limited nature of the private carrier\u2019s involvement in the Part B program, section 1395u provides only an abbreviated review of a carrier\u2019s processing and payment of claims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-19\">If the carrier determines that a claim meets all Part B coverage criteria such as medical necessity and reasonable costs, the carrier pays the claim out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>the federal funds____ If the carrier decides that reimbursement in full is not warranted, the statute and the regulations designate an appeal procedure available to dissatisfied claimants. All may request a \u201creview determination,\u201d which is a <em>de novo </em>written review hearing before a carrier employee different from the one who initially decided the claim. Claimants who remain dissatisfied and whose appeal involves more than $100 then may petition for an oral hearing before a hearing officer designated by the carrier. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395a(b)(e)(C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.820 (1980). Unless the carrier or the hearing officer decides to reopen the proceeding, the hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal and binding upon all parties to the hear-ing____\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.835. <em>Neither the statute nor the Secretary\u2019s regulations make further provision for review of hearing officer decisions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-7\"><em>Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 202-03, 102 S.Ct. at 1651-52 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). These provisions for a hearing on overpayment claims before an employee of the Part B Medicare insurance carrier, set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.801-.872, were intended to afford \u201ca determination concerning the amount of benefits under Part B where claims will probably be for ... small[ ] amounts____\u201d 456 U.S. at 208 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. at 1654 n. 11 (quoting S.Rep. No. 89-404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 54-55). Such carrier hearings were instituted to \u201cavoid overloading the courts with quite minor matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 102 S.Ct. 1655. The premise of this limited review procedure, therefore, is that it will address frequent but minor complaints regarding individual bills, often for relatively small amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-12\">B. <em>Section 1395u Is Not Applicable To This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-13\">In July, 1976, the Secretary of Health and Human Services ordered an investigation of appellants\u2019 billing practices; in December of that year, the Secretary instructed the Part B Medicare insurance carriers to suspend payments to appellant pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.370-.373. Appellant was given no opportunity to contest the suspension. The regulations provide for a unilateral suspension of payments only where there is \u201creliable evidence that the circumstances giving rise to the need for a suspension of payments involves fraud or willful misrepresentation.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371(b). The fact that the investigation of appellants involved an effort to uncover Medicare fraud is confirmed by the indictment of appellants on fraud charges in late 1976. Thus the instant proceedings did not stem from a refusal by a carrier to reimburse appellants for specific services because the services were not medically necessary or reasonably priced. <em>See United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 202-03, 102 S.Ct. at 1651-52 (discussing carrier hearing provisions where price of service is in dispute). Instead, payments to appellants for unchallenged claims were withheld because of questions about past claims now under challenge for which payments had already been made to appellants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>we cannot reasonably view the proceedings against appellants as a simple claim review like that described in <em>United States v. Erika, </em>authorized by the carrier review provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.800-.872.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">We find it significant to disposition of the instant case that section 1395u does not authorize carriers to investigate and correct abuse of the Medicare program or fraud in Part B billing practices (except to the extent that the fraud reveals itself in a claim for services that are not medically necessary or reasonably priced). Section 1395u contemplates the insurance carrier addressing each claim for reimbursement for services and either approving the claim and making the payment or rejecting the claim and refusing payment in whole or in part. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.803 (determination of claims by carriers).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">In the case at hand, it was not the carrier, but the Secretary, who determined that the bills should not be paid. The carrier was ordered by the Secretary to withhold the payments long after the carrier had already determined that each individual claim met the criteria for coverage under Part B. The carrier was ordered to transfer to the Trust Fund the funds the Secretary had ordered withheld from appellants. The Secretary\u2019s order was not made because of objections to current claims but because the Secretary sought recoupment for amounts already paid for earlier claims that she asserted were fraudulent. An agency within the Secretary\u2019s department, the Health Care Financing Administration, made the determination of fraud <em>after </em>appellant\u2019s acquittal in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">The limited review procedures established by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C), and approved in <em>United States v. Erika, </em>456 U.S. 201, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982), and <em>Schweiker v. McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 102 S.Ct. 1665, 72 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), are intended to apply to carrier reimbursement determinations on a claim by claim basis, as each claim is presented. <em>See Kechijian v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 1, 5-6 &amp; nn. 7 &amp; 8 (1st Cir.1980). The procedures utilized by the Secretary in this case were not section 1395u procedures, nor can it be said that the Secretary\u2019s actions were of the type contemplated by Congress to be undertaken pursuant to section 1395u.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-14\">\n<em>Section 1395y</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-15\">A. <em>The Purpose and Structure of Section 1395y.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-16\">Section 1395y(d), by contrast, grants the Secretary power to investigate and correct fraud and other abuses of the Medicare program. Subsection (d)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1403-17\">No payment may be made under this subchapter with respect to any item or services furnished to an individual by a person where the Secretary determines under this subsection that such person\u2014 (A) has knowingly and wilfully made, or caused to be made, any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in an application for payment under this subchapter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(l). Subsection (d)(2) authorizes the Secretary to suspend payments to a service provider involved in such allegedly fraudulent transactions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395y(d)(2). As the legislative history of section 1395y(d) indicates, the purpose and scope of the section was to provide the Secretary with power to investigate and correct fraud in the Medicare Program.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>This grant of investigative power was further supplemented by a grant of authority to the Secretary to suspend payments to a service provider implicated in such abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s determinations of fraud or excess billing are explicitly subject to judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">B. <em>Section 1395y Is Applicable To This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">Several aspects of section 1395y(d) are important in determining the nature of the proceeding against appellant in this case. First, section 1395y(d) is the source of the Secretary\u2019s authority to police abuses in all parts of the Medicare program, including Part B. It is also the only source of statutory authority for suspending payments of future claims to approved Medicare service providers. Finally, section 1395y(d) contemplates action by the Secretary on a larger scale than rejection of individual claims submitted by service providers on a claim by claim basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-10\">The abuses that Congress intended to correct by enacting section 1395y(d) and the procedures for correcting these abuses describe quite precisely the very type of allegations of wrongdoing and action undertaken by the Secretary with respect to appellants. Only section 1395y(d) of Title 42 authorizes the kind of fraud investigation and suspension of payments initiated by the Secretary here. The procedures utilized by the Secretary are unlike anything authorized by the carrier provisions of section 1395u and its implementing regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We presume regularity on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>of the Secretary and accordingly conclude that the proceedings against appellants were authorized by and conducted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">C. <em>Judicial Review Is Available Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">Section 1395y(d)(3) provides that any person who is dissatisfied with the Secretary\u2019s determination under this section is entitled to notice and a hearing from the Secretary and to judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s post-hearing decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this case the Secretary made a determination that appellants had made false statements and had overbilled, a determination within her authority under section 1395y(d)(l)(A) &amp; (B). Therefore, appellants are entitled to notice and hearing under section 1395y(a), (d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-16\">The Secretary\u2019s mistaken view that she can proceed under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.370-.373 and thereby avoid judicial review cannot change this result. To be sure, those regulations appear to implement section 1395u and, thus, proceedings under them would not normally be subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>The regulations are for reviews of <em>carriers </em>and contemplate procedures entirely different from those followed by the Secretary in this case. Moreover, unilateral supervision of payments under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371(b) requires evidence of fraud or willful misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>Since appellants were acquitted of fraud charges brought by the Secretary in criminal proceedings, this regulation provides scant support for the continued suspension of payments. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, as shown above, the suspensions here were not initiated by the <em>carriers </em>but by the Secretary. The Secretary treats the case as involving recoupment of payments for multiple fraudulent claims. The Secretary\u2019s determinations of fraud, however, are expressly made subject to judicial review by section 1395y(d). Fraud, civil or criminal, is a serious charge. The Secretary cannot avoid judicial review by simply asserting that she is proceeding under a section that does not provide for judicial review. Such an interpretation would make section 1395y superfluous. Congress quite properly intended that persons accused of fraud have access to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">The district court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction to hear appellants\u2019 complaint. <em>See Kechijian v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1980); <em>Eisenberg v. Mathews, </em>420 F.Supp. 1274 (E.D.Pa.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">\n<em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0p\">The district court dismissed appellants\u2019 suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Section 1395y(d)(3), through section 405(g), imposes a statutory requirement that a claimant exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial review, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3); <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 766, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2467, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). Section 1395y(d)(3) also provides for an administrative hearing by the Secretary to result in a \u201cfinal decision\u201d which is <em>then </em>subject to judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">In this case, however, the Regional Director of the Medicare Program informed appellants unequivocally that they were not entitled to review of their claim by the Secretary. The carrier review procedure offered appellants was not equivalent to the administrative review envisioned by section 405(b), made applicable through section 1395y(d)(3). Under these circumstances, we find the language of the Supreme Court in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi </em>applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-11\">Once a [claimant] has presented his or her claim at a sufficiently high level of review to satisfy the Secretary\u2019s administrative needs, further exhaustion would not merely be futile for the applicant, but would also be a commitment of administrative resources unsupported by any administrative or judicial interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">422 U.S. at 765-66, 95 S.Ct. at 2466-67. <em>See also Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976) (Secretary waived exhaustion requirement by stipulating that claims could be denied on their merits); <em>Lopez v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1489, 1500-03 (9th Cir.1984) (exhaustion futile when Secretary refuses to follow the law). The Secretary cannot complain of failure to exhaust administrative remedies when she refuses to provide the appropriate ones. <em>See Lopez, </em>725 F.2d at 1503. Accordingly, we find that appellants exhausted their administrative remedies before they filed suit in district court. We hold that the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>tary\u2019s decision that appellants had submitted false claims and owed some $27,000 to the Part B Trust Fund was a determination of fraud within section 1395y(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Appellants are entitled to the review procedures outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3). We reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 action and remand to the district court with direction to return the case to the Secretary for a hearing in compliance with section 1395y(d)(3). If appellants remain dissatisfied after the Secretary issues a final decision, appellants may seek judicial review of the merits of that decision under section 1395y(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">We deny the petition for rehearing. The opinion filed December 20, 1983 is withdrawn and this opinion substituted in its stead. No further petitions for rehearing will be entertained. REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">. The Supreme Court recently described the procedures for administering services and paying claims under the Part B program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-11\">Part B of the Medicare program ... is a federally subsidized, voluntary health insurance system for persons who are 65 or older or who are disabled. The companion Part A Medicare program covers institutional health costs such as hospital expenses.

The Secretary argues that she was not reducing future payments, but rather merely applying those future payments to reduce the overpayment. The fact remains, however, that the Secretary took money to which appellants were clearly entitled for current approved claims to satisfy the Secretary's <em>ex parte </em>conclusion of overpayment of earlier claims that she contends were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">In a normal recoupment, the Secretary would bring suit in federal court to recover the money allegedly overpaid. We have recognized jurisdiction over such cases. <em>See United States v. California Care Corp., </em>709 F.2d 1241, 1245-47 (9th Cir.1983). The Secretary chose to bypass this judicial avenue by ordering a third party, the carrier, to transfer an amount equivalent to the allegedly overpaid funds to satisfy the debt. This avenue was only possible because the Secretary required appellant to remain in the program and withheld payment on the claims until the amounts accumulated to a level that would satisfy the alleged overpayment. Normally the one fallback for a citizen subjected to extra-judicial executive action is that the action can be enforced only through the judicial process. <em>See generally </em>Hart, <em>The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, </em>66 Harv.L.Rev. 1362 (1953). The methods employed by the Secretary in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>have allowed her to avoid some form of judicial review before taking the funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1403-10\">.

The legislative history of section 1395y(d) notes this new grant of authority specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6N\"><em>Present law does not provide authority for the Secretary to withhold future payments for services furnished by an institutional provider of services, a physician, or any other supplier who either abuses the program or endangers the health of beneficiaries, although payment for past or current claims may be withheld on an individual basis </em>where the services are not reasonable or necessary for treatment of illness or injury or where the supplier fails to provide the necessary payment information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-8\">Your committee believes it important to protect the medicare, medicaid, and maternal and child health programs and their beneficiaries from those suppliers of services who have made a practice of furnishing inferior or harmful supplies or services, engaging in fraudulent activities, or consistently overcharging for their services. Such protection is not now provided under the law. For example, if a physician is found guilty of fraud in connection with the furnishing of services to a medicare beneficiary, there is no authority under present law to bar payment on his subsequent claims so long as the physician remains legally authorized to practice. States can, and some do, bar from medicaid providers who abuse the program, but they are not now required to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-12\">\n<em>Under your committee's bill, the Secretary would be given authority to terminate or suspend payments under the medicare program for services rendered by any supplier of health and medical services found to be guilty of program abuses.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 5085.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1404-14\">. The Secretary argues that the legislative history of section 1395y(d) recognizes that the authority to withhold payments is not subject to judicial review based on a portion of the Committee report quoted <em>supra </em>note 8. That portion of the report states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-15\">It is not intended that this provision would in any way change the Secretary\u2019s present right to withhold payment where necessary payment information is not provided. Nor would the supplier of services be entitled to a hearing or judicial review with respect to payments withheld under such existing authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1086. We find this language inapplicable to this case; the Secretary\u2019s actions in this case are not the withholding of payments because the necessary payment information was not provided, for the carrier made the determination that adequate information existed and paid the claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">. We note that the regulations adopted by the Secretary to implement section 1395y(d) speak of determinations of fraud by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), as was done in this case. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 420.100-.120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>(1983). By contrast, sections 405.370-.373, adopted (apparently) to implement section 1395u, <em>but see Kechijian v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1980) (discussed in note 11, <em>infra), </em>speak of determinations by the carrier. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1405-8\">. The First Circuit considered a similar issue in <em>Kechijian v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1980). In <em>Kechijian </em>the <em>carrier </em>made a determination of overpayment because of the doctor\u2019s alleged overutilization of certain medications; no allegations of fraud were made. Acting pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.370-.373, the carrier suspended payments and stated it intended to withhold payments to compensate for the overcharge. The court found judicial review available under section 1395y(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">We disagree with the First Circuit to the extent that it found that the regulations served to implement section 1395y(d)(3), for as the Secretary points out in her petition for rehearing, these regulations were adopted before the enactment of section 1395y. We express no view, however, as to whether section 1395y(d)(3) subjects an action properly taken under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.370-.373 to review to the extent that the action falls within the terms of section 1395y(d)(l) or to the extent that the Constitution may require. <em>See infra </em>note 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">. Section 1395y(d)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-11\">Any person furnishing services described in paragraph (1) who is dissatisfied with a determination made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be entitled to a reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon by the Secretary to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(d)(3) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-13\">Section 405(g) provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-14\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such de-cisi\u00f3n by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or such further time as the Secretary may allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1405-19\">. Technically, section 1395y(d) secures for appellants judicial review of only the Secretary\u2019s determination of fraud or overbilling. Section 1395y(d) does not appear to provide for review of the action taken in offsetting the money withheld against the money owed. Since review of the former will secure review of the latter, we need not consider whether such a preclusion of review would be unconstitutional, <em>see Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 211 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. at 1655 n. 14, nor whether mandamus jurisdiction would exist over the latter issue, <em>see Drennan v. Harris, </em>606 F.2d 846, 850 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1405-20\">. The Secretary argues, for the first time in her petition for rehearing, that her actions in this case were an exercise of the common law right of recoupment. <em>See Drennan v. Harris, </em>606 F.2d 846, 849 (9th Cir.1977); <em>Szekely v. Florida Medical Association, </em>517 F.2d 345 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-21\"><em>Drennan </em>was in many respects similar to the case at hand; a physician sought judicial review of a determination to recoup overpayments. The determination of overpayment in <em>Drennan, </em>however, was made by the <em>carrier </em>and not by the Secretary. Thus, the proceedings appeared to be under section 1395u and not 1395y(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-22\">Furthermore, although we dismissed the complaint in <em>Drennan </em>for lack of jurisdiction, we ordered the district court to transfer the case to the Court of Claims. We were unaware at the time, however, that the Court of Claims would subsequently dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Drennan v. United States, </em>No. 88-80 C (Ct.Cl. August 27, 1982). We recognized that our refusal to entertain Drennan\u2019s constitutional claims would likely be unconstitutional if no court had jurisdiction to hear them. <em>See </em>606 F.2d at 85; <em>see also Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 109, 97 S.Ct. 980, 986, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977) (access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>courts essential to decision of constitutional questions); <em>United States v. California Care Corp., </em>709 F.2d 1241, 1247 (9th Cir.1983) (to deny jurisdiction over action to reimburse over-payments \"would create substantial due process problems\u201d); <em>Association of Home Health Agencies v. Schweiker, </em>690 F.2d 932, 939 &amp; n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\"Every court that has considered the issue agreed that section 405(h) should be read so as to permit <em>some </em>avenue of <em>constitutional </em>claims\u201d (emphasis in original) (and cases cited therein)). Thus, we denied jurisdiction in <em>Drennan </em>only because we thought the Claims Court would have jurisdiction. For this reason, <em>Drennan </em>is of doubtful validity today. <em>See generally, </em>Hart, <em>The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, </em>66 Harv.L.Rev. 1362 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
