GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Charles J. Smith appeals an order of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. A claim by Smith for disability insurance benefits had been denied by an administrative law judge of the Social Security Administration. Smith failed to timely appeal the denial but later requested the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration to review the AU\u2019s decision. The Appeals Council dismissed his untimely request for review. Smith then sought review in federal court of the denial of his claim. As Smith did not obtain a final decision of the agency that would allow judicial review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">In 1982, Charles J. Smith applied for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. After the claim was denied both initially and upon reconsideration, a full evidentiary hearing was held before an administrative law judge of the Social Security Administration, who determined that Smith was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. A notice attached to the ALJ\u2019s decision, which was dated March 31, 1983, informed Smith that if he wished to appeal the decision, it was necessary to request review by the Appeals Council within sixty days of his receipt of the decision (presumed to be five days from the date of the decision). On June 20, 1983, well after the sixty-day period, Smith filed a request for an Appeals Council review. His later letter of June 28 to the Appeals Council explained that he had assumed that his lawyer was handling the request for review, although he also admitted that he had received a letter from his lawyer on May 26, 1983, telling him that he should retain someone else to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">The Appeals Council found that since Smith knew within the sixty-day period that his former lawyer was no longer acting on his behalf and yet had failed to request review within that time, there was no good cause to justify extending the filing deadline. Thus, it dismissed his untimely request for review. Smith then filed a complaint in federal court, claiming that all administrative remedies had been exhausted, and, therefore, seeking review of the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint. While it discussed with approval the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233 (11th Cir. 1983), in which an untimely request for review was held to be final for purposes of appeal, it nonetheless stated that under <em>Sheehan v. Secretary, </em>593 F.2d 323, 326 (8th Cir.1979), the order of the Appeals Council was <em>not </em>a final decision for purposes of appeal and, thus, that it lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction to consider Smith\u2019s claim. Smith argues on appeal that since <em>Sheehan </em>did not adequately distinguish a' request for review from a request to reopen a case, the reasoning of that case should be rejected for that of <em>Bloodsworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The basic question before us is whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider Smith\u2019s claim. Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act provides for judicial review of claims arising under Title II of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). Further, section 205(h) limits judicial review to the procedures laid out in the Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1982). Thus, whether the district court had jurisdiction depends on whether the actions taken by the Social Security Administration here amounted to a \u201cfinal decision of the Secretary.\u201d As we stated in <em>Sheehan, </em>\u201cUnder the statutory scheme contained in \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and (h), the presence of a final decision is not only essential to determine when judicial intervention is proper but also to determine whether it is possible.\u201d 593 F.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Smith argues that since the Appeals Council \u201cterminated his claim\u201d and since he \u201chas no other remedy but to pursue this claim by judicial review,\u201d it follows that he has exhausted all administrative review procedures and, thus, that the decision of the Appeals Council must be viewed as a final decision. However, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 766, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2467, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">The requirement [of a final decision] is * * * something more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion. * * * The term \u201cfinal decision\u201d is not only left undefined by the Act, but its meaning is left to the Secretary to flesh out by regulation. * * The statutory scheme is thus one in which the Secretary may specify such requirements for exhaustion as he deems serve his own interests in effective and efficient administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Thus, whether Smith has exhausted the administrative procedures depends not solely on the current remedies available to him, but, rather, on whether he has met the requirements specified by the Secretary. <em>See Sheehan, </em>593 F.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Here, it is evident that Smith did not meet the specified requirements. The Appeals Council may dismiss a request for review if it is not filed within the stated time. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.971 (1984). Such dismissal is binding and not subject to further review. <em>Id. </em>404.972. Such action does not address the merits of the claim, and thus cannot be considered appealable, as can the Appeals Council\u2019s decisions and denials of <em>timely </em>requests for review. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.981. As we stated in <em>Sheehan, </em>\u201cIf the claimant may obtain review in this situation [late filing of an appeal] the Secretary\u2019s orderly procedures for processing disability claims mean little or nothing. If claimant may avoid the timely exhaustion of remedies requirement, any claimant could belatedly appeal his claim at any time and always obtain district court review of an AU\u2019s decision.\u201d 593 F.2d at 326-27. Rather, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977), precludes such disregard of administration procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ape-dedup-0\">[A]n interpetation that would allow a claimant judicial review simply by filing \u2014 and being denied \u2014 a petition to reopen his claim would frustrate the congressional purpose, plainly evidenced in \u00a7 205(g), to impose a 60-day limitation upon judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision on the initial claim for benefits. 20 CFR \u00a7 404.951 (1976). Congress\u2019 determination so to limit judicial review to the original decision denying benefits is a policy choice obviously designed to forestall repetitive or belated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>litigation of stale eligibility claims. Our duty, of course, is to respect that choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">430 U.S. at 108, 97 S.Ct. at 986, <em>quoted in Sheehan, </em>593 F.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Smith argues, however, that <em>Sanders </em>addresses only the agency\u2019s refusal to <em>reopen </em>cases \u2014 not a refusal to grant a request for <em>review. </em>He urges that we adopt the reasoning of <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233 (11th Cir.1983), where the court stated that \u201cthe eighth circuit\u2019s conclusion [in <em>Sheehan </em>] was reached without substantial analysis of the distinction between review and reopening of a case.\u201d 703 F.2d at 1239. <em>Sheehan </em>is the law of the circuit and we are compelled to follow it. Should we determine that <em>Sheehan </em>should be reexamined, we could suggest en banc consideration. We are satisfied, however, that <em>Shee-han </em>was properly decided and that reason fully supports its application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The court in <em>Bloodsworth </em>reasoned that while a \u201creopening procedure is in the nature of a bonus opportunity\u201d and thus is due \u201ca greater degree of judicial deference * * <em>* </em>than is appropriate where judicial review exists as a matter of statutory right,\u201d 703 F.2d at 1328, a dismissal, in contrast, is like a determination on the merits by the Appeals Council: \u201cBoth are equally final and both trigger a right to review by the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. The court apparently reached the latter conclusion by reading 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.981 (which establishes a right to review by the district court) to include both timely and untimely dismissals. It is clear from 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.971-72, however, that only timely dismissals are appealable as a matter of right. <em>See Dietsch v. Schweiker, </em>700 F.2d 865, 867 (2d Cir.1983) (citing <em>Sheehan, </em>593 F.2d at 326). Untimely requests will be heard by the Appeals Council only if it deems extending the filing deadline is warranted by \u201cgood cause.\u201d Thus, the Appeals Council\u2019s discretionary action in hearing an untimely request for review is as much a \u201cbonus opportunity\u201d as is reopening. The distinction that <em>Bloodsworth </em>drew is untenable and must be rejected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Though the holding of <em>Sheehan </em>may, at times, lead to harsh results (a fact we acknowledged in <em>Sheehan </em>itself), we believe the provisions of the Social Security Act and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Salfi </em>and <em>Sanders </em>compelled the conclusion we reached there and uphold today.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">We conclude that the Appeals Council\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s untimely request for review was not a final action for purposes of review under section 205(g). Thus, the district court properly concluded it did not have jurisdiction to hear Smith\u2019s claim. We affirm the dismissal of Smith\u2019s petition by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-18\">. The Honorable G. Thomas Eisele, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. In reaching its conclusion, the <em>Bloodsworth </em>court relied on <em>Langford v. Flemming, </em>276 F.2d 215 (5th Cir.1960) (administrative decision declining to extend time and review merits was final), as \"controlling authority.\u201d 703 F.2d at 1236. In <em>Sheehan, </em>we rejected <em>Langford </em>in reversing the district court which had relied on that case. Further, we believe that the Supreme Court in <em>Sanders </em>effectively overruled <em>Langford. See Giacone v. Schweiker, </em>656 F.2d 1238, 1243 n. 6 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Peterson v. Califano, </em>631 F.2d 628, 630 n. 3 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. Smith also appears to raise the question of the constitutionality of the administrative procedures involved here, when he asserts in the concluding paragraph of his brief that the Secretary\u2019s position \"certainly does not comport to comply with due process in that it would be fundamentally unfair to preclude an individual from being able to challenge a finding, in this case a lack of good cause, by obtaining a judicial review of the circumstances surrounding whether or not good cause existed.\u201d However, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Mathews v. El-dridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), which involved the constitutionality of the procedures under which Social Security disability benefit payments could be terminated: \"All that is necessary is that the procedures be tailored, in light of the decision to be made, to 'the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard,\u2019 <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>[397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970)], * * * to insure that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 96 S.Ct. at 909 (citation omitted). Since under the procedures outlined above Smith was provided such an opportunity, his argument that due process has not been afforded must be rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
