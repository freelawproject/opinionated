The court held that the government\u2019s position in litigation was not substantially justified so that a fee award to plaintiffs was proper. Because we disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion, we reverse. We also dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal concerning the amount and calculation of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">This case represents the final chapter in a lengthy series of actions concerning federal housing subsidies. Because the issue \u25a0before us is a limited one \u2014 whether the district court\u2019s award of fees was proper \u2014 a brief review of the facts will suffice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The complete factual and procedural history of the underlying actions has been exhaustively covered in a number of prior opinions. <em>See Dubose v. Pierce, </em>579 F.Supp. 937, 941-46 (D.Conn.1984) <em>(Dubose V); Dubose v. Harris, </em>82 F.R.D. 582, 583-85 (D.Conn.1979) <em>(Dubose IV); Dubose v. Harris, </em>434 F.Supp. 227, 228-30 (D.Conn. 1977) <em>(Dubose III)) Dubose v. Hills, </em>22 Fed.R.Serv.2d 476, 477 (D.Conn.1976) <em>(Dubose II)) Dubose v. Hills, </em>405 F.Supp. 1277, 1280-82 (D.Conn.1975) <em>(Dubose I), modified on other grounds, </em>420 F.Supp. 399 (D.Conn.1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Section 236 of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1 (1982), provides for financial assistance to owners of low income housing projects. In 1974 Congress modified this program through passage of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCDA), Pub.L. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 633. Among the changes instituted by HCDA was the addition of \u00a7 1715z-1(f)(3)(A) (1976), <em>repealed by </em>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-35, \u00a7 322(f)(7), 95 Stat. 403. Section 1715z-l(f)(3)(A) amended HCDA\u2019s operating subsidy program to allow the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make \u201cadditional assistance payments to the project owner in an amount up to the amount by which the sum of the cost of utilities and local property taxes exceeds the initial operating expense level.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1(f)(3)(A) (1976). These payments were intended to protect tenants in low income housing from rent boosts that would otherwise result from increases in property taxes and utility costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">This subsidy program was not implemented. Instead, HUD allowed owners to pass cost increases along to tenants as higher rents. The Secretary believed that implementation of the program was discretionary and that the agency could choose to use its funds in other ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">The underlying action followed. In 1975 Judge Blumenfeld granted the tenants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction ordering the Secretary to implement the program. <em>Dubose I, </em>405 F.Supp. at 1292-93. Rather than appealing that decision, HUD concentrated its opposition on projects other than those covered by the injunction. In May 1976, after additional suits were filed, the court certified a statewide class of project-plaintiffs and ordered HUD to pay subsidies to all projects in Connecticut. <em>Dubose II, </em>22 Fed.R.Serv.2d at 477-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">In June 1976, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued a permanent injunction ordering HUD to pay the subsidies for nationwide housing projects. <em>Underwood v. Hills, </em>414 F.Supp. 526, 532 (D.D.C.1976). That injunction was stayed by the Supreme Court pending appeal. 429 U.S. 892, 97 S.Ct. 250, 50 L.Ed.2d 175 (1976) (action of whole Court). In 1977 the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in two related cases, <em>Harris v. Abrams </em>and <em>Harris v. Ross, </em>431 U.S. 928, 97 S.Ct. 2630, 53 L.Ed.2d 243 (1977). <em>See Abrams v. Hills, </em>547 F.2d 1062 (9th Cir.1976), <em>vacated sub nom. Pierce v. Abrams, </em>455 U.S. 1010, 102 S.Ct. 1700, 72 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982), and <em>Ross v. Community Services, Inc., </em>405 F.Supp. 831 (D.Md.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>544 F.2d 514 (4th Cir.1976), <em>vacated sub nom. Pierce v. Ross, </em>455 U.S. 1010, 102 S.Ct. 1700, 72 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Before those cases could be heard, the parties in the related actions agreed to a settlement. Under this agreement, HUD was to pay into the <em>Underwood </em>Court a settlement fund from which eligible tenants were to receive retroactive tax and utility cost subsidy payments. <em>See </em>Stipulation for Settlement, <em>reprinted as </em>Appendix to <em>Dubose IV, </em>82 F.R.D. at 592-605 (Stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>lation). The Stipulation also required that the underlying cases were to remain active until settlement administration was completed. Stipulation, 82 F.R.D. at 598 \u00b6 17. This settlement was approved by the Connecticut district court. <em>Dubose IV, </em>82 F.R.D. at 588-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">During the settlement administration process, the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1982) (EAJA), was passed. The relevant provision of EAJA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-6\">[ejxcept as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party ... fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action ... brought by or against the United States ..., unless the court finds that the position of the United States was <em>substantially justified </em>or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The plaintiffs in both the Connecticut action and in certain California actions moved for fees pursuant to section 2412(d)(1)(A). Both courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that the government had failed to establish either of the statutory defenses to the awarding of fees. <em>Du-bose V, </em>579 F.Supp. at 948-52; <em>Underwood v. Pierce, </em>547 F.Supp. 256, 261-64 (C.D.Cal. 1982), <em>appeal pending </em>No. 83-5773 (9th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">In the instant case, Judge Blumenfeld held that HUD\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under EAJA. The court noted that the fact that the government was not ultimately successful would not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that HUD\u2019s position was unjustified. Instead, the court evaluated the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the agency\u2019s litigation position. The court held that \u201cHUD\u2019s position was not merely unreasonable but had no justifiable basis,\u201d <em>Dubose V, </em>579 F.Supp. at 950, and that the government\u2019s assertion that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d made an award unjust, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), was similarly unavailing. HUD insisted that because the settlement agreement barred payment of attorneys\u2019 fees from the fund, which was the only possible source of fees at the time, any award of fees was thereby barred. The court rejected this argument, holding that an award of fees was proper under EAJA despite the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Because we believe that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified, we reverse the judgment of the district court. We therefore need not consider the effect of the settlement agreement provision that barred the use of the fund for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">The district court\u2019s determination that HUD\u2019s position was not plausible should be viewed as a conclusion of law, <em>Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d 539, 563 (D.C. Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984), and subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Boudin v. Thomas, </em>732 F.2d 1107, 1117 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">The definition of \u201cposition\u201d under EAJA is settled in this Circuit. In <em>Boudin </em>we determined that the term refers to the government\u2019s position in litigation rather than its actions during the underlying administrative proceedings. <em>Boudin, </em>732 F.2d at 1115-16. Therefore, we may consider only HUD\u2019s litigating posture in our examination of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">The government bears the burden of proving that its action as a litigant was substantially justified. <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Watt, </em>722 F.2d 1081, 1087 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 557; <em>Ellis v. United States, </em>711 F.2d 1571, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Dougherty v. Lehman, </em>711 F.2d 555, 561-62 (3d Cir.1983); H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. 10, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4953, 4984, 4989. \u201cThe test of whether or not a Government action is substantially justified is essentially one of reasonableness. Where the Government can show that its case had a reasonable basis both in law and fact, no award will be made.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 10, 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4989. <em>See also Environmental Defense Fund, 722 </em>F.2d at 1085; <em>Tyler Business Services, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>695 F.2d 73, 76 (4th Cir.1982) (absence of rational explanation for gap in proof results in finding of absence of justification).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Plaintiffs prevailed in the underlying action in the district court because the court rejected Secretary Hills\u2019 claim that her refusal to implement the operating subsidy program was a valid exercise of discretion. <em>Dubose I, </em>405 F.Supp. at 1288-92. HUD\u2019s litigation position was premised on its belief that, under the National Housing Act, the agency had discretion to choose the ways in which it would implement national housing policy. In support of its position, HUD relied on <em>Pennsylvania v. Lynn, </em>501 F.2d 848 (D.C.Cir.1974). In <em>Lynn </em>the D.C.Circuit held that Secretary Romney had discretion to terminate a number of housing programs and that he had not abused his discretion in so doing, because he believed that the legislative purposes were not served by these programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Secretary Hills, defendant\u2019s predecessor, argued before the district court that she had discretion as to the implementation of the operating subsidy program based on the language and legislative history of the Act and on Congress\u2019 subsequent funding decisions. She also argued that her lawful discretion over the allocation of her contract authority permitted her to refuse to fund the operating subsidies. We are concerned not only with the substantive accuracy of this position as viewed by hindsight, but also with the agency\u2019s legal justification for its actions throughout the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">We are convinced that HUD has borne its burden of proving that its litigation position, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, was not unreasonable. Our analysis of this \u201cborderline\u201d case is aided by our examination of the factors developed by the <em>Spencer </em>Court. <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1486 n. 11 (10th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 105, 83 L.Ed.2d 49 (1984); <em>Foley Construction Co. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>716 F.2d 1202, 1204 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984). These factors are: the clarity of the governing law, the foreseeable length and complexity of the litigation and the consistency of the government\u2019s position. <em>Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 559-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">1. <em>Clarity of the Governing Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">The government\u2019s position must be evaluated according to the legal justification for its posture throughout the litigation rather than by hindsight after later judicial interpretations of the issues involved. <em>See Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>733 F.2d 892, 895 (Fed.Cir.1984). At the time the underlying action was filed, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Lynn, </em>the only judicial guidance available, offered no hint of the ultimate outcome of the subsequent cases. In preparing its litigation stance the government relied on arguments similar to those which had succeeded in <em>Lynn. </em>The district court admitted that it initially found <em>Lynn </em>to be relevant. <em>Dubose V, </em>579 F.Supp. at 950-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">The district court\u2019s reevaluation of its earlier view of the justification for the government\u2019s position ignores the requirement that we consider HUD\u2019s perspective as the agency developed its trial and appeal strategy. The factors that the court later found persuasive in distinguishing <em>Lynn </em>were not so obvious at that stage. The governing law, to the extent that it existed, did not mandate HUD\u2019s surrender early in the litigation. Although HUD\u2019s position became more questionable as adverse trial and appeal decisions accumulated, we cannot say that the tally ever became so one-sided as to render HUD\u2019s position clearly unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">Thus, the first of the <em>Spencer </em>factors, the clarity of the governing law, tilts in favor of HUD. <em>See Cornelia v. Schweiker, </em>741 F.2d 170, 172 (8th Cir.1984) (where all legal issues were questions of first impression in circuit, agency\u2019s action in seeking clarification from courts was reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>able); <em>Boudin, </em>732 F.2d at 1116 (law on issue in question was not clear at time of suit; government\u2019s position was reasonable). Cf<em>. Hoang Ha v. Schweiker, </em>707 F.2d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir.1983) (case previously decided, adverse to government\u2019s position, is factor in assessing reasonableness, but cases from other circuits are not conclusive); <em>Wyandotte Savings Bank v. NLRB, </em>682 F.2d 119, 120 (6th Cir.1982) (fact that government\u2019s position was contrary to prior Sixth Circuit precedent did not mean that it was not substantially justified; fees denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">2. <em>Foreseeable Length and Complexity of Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The <em>Spencer </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">Sensitivity to the central objective of the Act \u2014 reduction of the deterrents to challenges of unreasonable government conduct \u2014 thus suggests that, in categories of cases in which substantial investments of effort and money commonly are required to prosecute suits to their ultimate conclusions, the government should be obliged to make an especially strong showing that its persistence in litigation was justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">712 F.2d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">This factor adds little to our analysis. While this litigation has certainly been long and complex, spanning some ten years and several circuits, we find no indication that the government\u2019s behavior deterred aggrieved tenants from filing suits. Indeed, the government paid the subsidies that were ordered in the December 1975 and May 1976 injunctions until operation of the May 1976 injunction was stayed by this Court. <em>See Dubose III, </em>434 F.Supp. at 230; <em>see also </em>429 U.S. 1085, 97 S.Ct. 1092, 51 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (action by whole court refusing to vacate stay issued by Second Circuit).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Moreover, simple reliance on the length of the litigation in this case is deceptive. The settlement negotiations and fee motions have been proceeding since 1977. Neither of these developments was foreseeable at the outset of the litigation. We find no reason to include this case in the category described by the <em>Spencer </em>Court. Hence we decline to impose on HUD the burden of making an \u201cespecially strong showing\u201d of justification merely because the litigation has been long-lived. We conclude that, at most, this factor provides little benefit to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">We note also that the foreseeable complexity of the litigation is closely tied to the first factor, the clarity of the governing law. Where, as here, the government\u2019s position appeared at first to be supported by persuasive case law, the government should not be penalized for defending a suit which becomes long, complex and eventually unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">3. <em>Consistency of the Government\u2019s Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">The <em>Spencer </em>Court suggested that where the government acts to single out one private party as the victim of an inconsistent interpretation, the government\u2019s unpredictability should be penalized. <em>Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 560-61. Here, by contrast, the plaintiffs cannot argue that they were \u201csubjected to <em>atypically </em>harsh treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. It has been clear throughout the history of this litigation that the Secretary had no intention of paying <em>any </em>operating subsidies unless those payments were made in response to court orders. This factor, then, clearly supports a denial of legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">In sum, the <em>Spencer </em>factors alone demonstrate that HUD\u2019s litigation position was substantially justified. But we need not rely exclusively on those factors. Additional considerations lead to the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">The district court also refused to credit either the stays issued by this Court and the Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of <em>certiorari </em>in two related cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>suggesting that those events were \u201ctoo opaque\u201d to lend credence to a conclusion that HUD\u2019s position was justified. As to the former, the court found no indication that the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of a stay indicated any view as to the merits; our subsequent issuance of .a stay was dismissed with the suggestion that we \u201chad little choice but to grant one.\u201d <em>Dubose V, </em>579 F.Supp. at 950. And as to the latter, the court suggested that the Supreme Court might have granted <em>certiorari </em>in those two cases, both of which had ruled against the government, in order to affirm the lower court\u2019s rejection of HUD\u2019s position. <em>Id. </em>We reject this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">\u201cA court in staying the action of a lower court ... must take into account factors such as irreparable harm and probability of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Paccar, Inc., </em>424 U.S. 1301, 1305, 96 S.Ct. 845, 847, 47 L.Ed.2d 67 (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice, 1976) (granting motion to vacate stay; citing <em>O\u2019Brien v. Brown, </em>409 U.S. 1, 3, 92 S.Ct. 2718, 2719, 34 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972) (per curiam)). In this Circuit, in addition to considering the harm to the parties and the public interest, a court must find that the movant has demonstrated \u201ca substantial possibility, although less than a likelihood, of success.\u201d <em>Hayes v. City University of New York, </em>503 F.Supp. 946, 963 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Hayes v. Human Resources Administration, </em>648 F.2d 110 (2d Cir.1981). <em>See also In re Turner, </em>309 F.2d 69, 72 (2d Cir.1962). We find it unlikely that these criteria were overlooked by this Court simply because the Supreme Court had already acted. We see both stays as indicative of the courts\u2019 view that the government\u2019s position was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The same is true of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of <em>certiorari. </em>Although the outcome of the Court\u2019s examination of this situation was left forever in limbo by the settlement, we do not believe that the district court\u2019s interpretation is the only plausible one. We believe that it is equally probable that the Court granted <em>certiorari </em>not to affirm but to reverse the lower court decisions. The district court cited its previous opinion as support for its conclusion that HUD\u2019s conduct was \u201cunreasonable [and] had no justifiable basis.\u201d <em>Dubose V, </em>579 F.Supp. at 950. However, the court\u2019s prior opinion has little bearing on the instant determination because the first conclusion was not \u201cmade with an intent to resolve EAJA questions.\u201d <em>Cinciarelli v. Reagan, </em>729 F.2d 801, 806 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Similarly, the district court's suggestion that the numerous adverse rulings in the lower courts should lead to a different result does not convince us to overlook the many factors supporting our conclusion, particularly in light of the stays and grant of <em>certiorari </em>discussed above. Nor does the court\u2019s suggestion that the government\u2019s participation in the settlement represented an admission that the litigation was unjustified merit much analysis. Speculation as to the agency\u2019s intent in settling adds little to our analysis. A holding that an agency\u2019s decision to settle an appeal on terms favorable to the claimant undercuts the agency\u2019s justification of its litigation position would discourage future settlements, a factor we should not lightly disregard. A litigation position that was justified, for EAJA purposes, before a settlement should not later lose its justification as a result of the settlement. After all, policy reasons quite apart from the merits of the dispute may, in the last analysis, dictate a premature termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judgment of the district court and hold that the government has carried its burden of proving that its litigation position was substantially justified. In view of this determination, we need not reach the issue of whether the settlement agreement provision barring an award of fees from the fund affects a fee award under EAJA. We also need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal concerning the amount and calculation of fees. The cross-appeal is dismissed. We remand to the district court for entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>of an order dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">.
