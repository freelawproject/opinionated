CAMPBELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Plaintiff William Kazmaier appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. 593 F.Supp. 390. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Kazmaier claims the exclusive right to call himself \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man.\u201d He therefore objects to a commercial produced for defendant New England Ford Dealers\u2019 Association (\u201cNEFDA\u201d) by NEF-DA\u2019s advertising firm, Hill, Holliday, Connors and Cosmopulos, Inc. (\u201cHill, Holli-day\u201d), that refers to defendant John Wooten as \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man.\u201d Kaz-maier filed suit on May 18, 1984 alleging that by telecasting the commercial; defendants misappropriated or unfairly used his trade name, committed unfair or deceptive trade practices in contravention of Mass. Gen.Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, maliciously interfered with his business expectations, and acted negligently. Kazmaier also claimed that defendant Ford Motor Company acted negligently in not preventing NEFDA from airing the commercial, was vicariously liable for NEFDA\u2019s acts, and violated Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A. Kazmaier sought injunctive relief<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and damages of $8 million, and requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">On May 23, 1984, Kazmaier moved for a temporary restraining order enjoining the continued use of the advertisement in question. After oral argument, the district court denied the motion. At the court\u2019s suggestion, defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court then granted, dismissing all of Kazmaier\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">At the heart of the court\u2019s rejection of the claims was its conclusion that Kazmaier was not entitled to exclusive use of the phrase \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man.\u201d It ruled that because Kazmaier had never registered \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d as a trade name, the question of its protecta-bility was governed by Massachusetts common law. The court went on to hold that, even assuming Kazmaier had established secondary meaning in the descriptive title, his rights in the name did not prevent Wooten\u2019s also using it, since Wooten sufficiently distinguished himself from Kazmaier in the commercial and so avoided any likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">We affirm the granting of summary judgment. While infringement and unfair competition cases often present factual issues that render summary judgment inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>propriate, this is not invariably so. <em>Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp., </em>657 F.2d 482, 486 (1st Cir. 1981). <em>See also B &amp; L Sales Associates v. H. Daroff &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>421 F.2d 352 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 952, 90 S.Ct. 1873, 26 L.Ed.2d 292 (1970); <em>Beef/Eater Restaurants, Inc. v.

Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976) (citation omitted). We conclude that summary judgment was warranted here because \u201cthe facts upon which appellant relied to support his allegation[s] were not susceptible of the interpretation which he sought to give them[. Thus,] appellees met their burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Manego v. Cape Cod Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>692 F.2d 174, 177 (1st Cir.1982) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We deal separately with each of Kazmaier\u2019s alleged causes of action beginning with the critical trade name infringement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">A. <em>Trade Name Infringement</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9\">Under Massachusetts law, a purely descriptive phrase will be protected as a common law trade name if it has attained a secondary meaning. <em>Professional Economics, Inc. v. Professional Economic Services, Inc., </em>12 Mass.App. 70, 421 N.E.2d 1221 (1981). <em>See S.S. Kresge Co. v. United Factory Outlet, Inc., </em>598 F.2d 694 (1st Cir.1979), <em>aff'd on rehearing, </em>634 F.2d 1 (1980). <em>See also Union Oyster House v. Hi Ho Oyster House, </em>316 Mass. 543, 55 N.E.2d 942 (1944); J. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 11.5 (1973) (descriptive marks). But the protection afforded to such a descriptive mark falls short of giving the original user the <em>exclusive </em>right to use it. That user may not prevent others from using the same descriptive phrase so long as the others sufficiently distinguish their product or service so \u201cthat a reasonably intelligent and careful person would not be misled.\u201d <em>Union Oyster House, </em>316 Mass. at 546, 55 N.E.2d at 944. <em>See C.A. Briggs Co. v. National Wafer Co., </em>215 Mass. 100, 103, 102 N.E. 87, 88 (1913) (\u201c[W]hile the use of [\u201cBoston Wafers\u201d] cannot be absolutely prohibited, it may be restrained unless accompanied with sufficient explanations or precautions to prevent confusion with the goods of the original manufacturer or vendor.\u201d); <em>American Waltham Watch Co. v. United States Watch Co., </em>173 Mass. 85, 86, 53 N.E. 141, 142 (1899) (although \u201cWalt-ham\u201d on plaintiff\u2019s watches had secondary meaning, defendant was entitled to use the word \u201cWaltham\u201d in connection with its watches if there was \u201csome accompanying statement which shall distinguish clearly its watches from those made by the plaintiff.\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 11.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Applying the above principles, we examine Kazmaier\u2019s contention that the following triable issues exist with respect to his common law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> trade name claims: whether \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d is a descriptive or a generic<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> name; whether it carries a secondary meaning; who enjoys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the secondary meaning, if one exists; and whether Wooten sufficiently distinguished himself from Kazmaier to avoid public confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">All but one of the above issues were resolved by the district court in Kazmaier\u2019s favor for purposes of summary judgment. The court expressly assumed that \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d is a descriptive phrase, not a generic one, and that Kazmaier had established a prior secondary meaning. The only one of the above issues that the district court resolved <em>against </em>Kazmaier was whether Wooten sufficiently distinguished his identity in the commercial to avoid public confusion. Normally such an issue would be for the trier of fact, but we agree with the court below that its resolution in the instant situation is so clear as to warrant a ruling that, as a matter of law, an inference of possible confusion cannot reasonably be drawn from these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It is uncontroverted that in the commercial forming the basis of Kazmaier\u2019s complaint, Wooten was introduced as \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man, John Wooten\u201d and appeared on-screen, readily recognizable, during most of the film. Where, as here, the persons subject to potential confusion have easily distinguishable names and likenesses, we find it hard to imagine a more effective way of distinguishing one from the other than to state his name and present his likeness, as was done in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Kazmaier suggests that use of this descriptive phrase by anyone except the original user is inappropriate as, by its very nature, it can be applied to only one individual and draws its value from the implicit singularity of its object, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man.\u201d Under this view, use by anyone except Kazmaier necessarily re-suits in confusion, given the name\u2019s implication of uniqueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">This argument, however, flies in the face of established Massachusetts law. <em>See, e.g., Union Oyster House, </em>316 Mass. at 544-45, 55 N.E.2d at 943 (\u201cno one can altogether appropriate to himself any part of the English language, and ... when, through accustomed use in association with a person or his product and by common understanding in the market, words forming part of the language have come to mean, if used alone, him or his product, a competitor may nevertheless use them, if he accompanies their use with something which will adequately show that the first person or his product is not meant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The argument also makes little sense in this context. \u201cThe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d is a boast rather than an objective representation. No one is likely to believe that either Kazmaier or Wooten has scoured the world over for competitors for the title, met all challenges, and won, in actual fact, the title \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man.\u201d It is scarcely to be assumed that only one individual would venture to use the title and that anyone using the title is the sole source of goods and services pertaining to the title. <em>Cf. </em>J. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11.19, 11.19(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">In sum, the public would not be confused by Wooten\u2019s use of this label whatever its prior association with Kazmaier given Wooten\u2019s use of the title explicitly in conjunction with his own name and likeness, nor could the public be misled by the singularity of the title given its inherent implausibility. We therefore agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to trade name infringement, and that defendants were en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>titled to summary judgment as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">B. <em>Section 93A Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The question in an action based on Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A is \u201cdid [defendants] do anything unfair or deceptive?\u201d <em>Professional Economics, Inc. v. Professional Economic Services, Inc., </em>12 Mass.App. 70, 80, 421 N.E.2d 1221, 1227 (1981). A practice may be \u201cdeceptive\u201d under chapter 93A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if it \u201ccould reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he otherwise would have acted.\u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. v. Attorney General, </em>380 Mass. 762, 777, 407 N.E.2d 297, 301 (1980) (quoting <em>Lowell Gas Co. v. Attorney General, </em>377 Mass. 37, 51, 385 N.E.2d 240, 249 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Beyond considerations of \u201cdeception,\u201d Massachusetts courts consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyA\">(1) whether the practice ... is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of fairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\"><em>Id. See also PMP Associates, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., </em>366 Mass. 593, 596, 321 N.E.2d 915, 917 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We see nothing possibly unfair or deceptive in the situation here. Kazmaier himself was not deceived. And, as discussed in section A, <em>supra, </em>the commercial\u2019s audience would not have confused Wooten for Kazmaier, since the claim to be \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d was accompanied by Wooten\u2019s name and likeness. Indeed, even supposing the audience mixed the two up, it is hard to see how its conduct would have been materially affected. The audience\u2019s preferences in automobiles, or its compulsion to buy or not buy, would scarcely be altered by any mistake as to the identity of the strong man unsuecess-fully attempting to hold back an accelerating Ford Tempo.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Kazmaier has premised his chapter 93A claim solely on the allegedly deceptive aspects of defendants\u2019 use of his alleged trade name and has not pleaded any independent wrong cognizable under chapter 93A. Because defendants were within their rights to use the contested title and in any case could not have \u201cdeceived\u201d anyone for purposes of chapter 93A, and because, even under the harshest view of defendants\u2019 actions, their conduct was \u201cnot within any recognized conception of unfairness, [was] neither immoral, unethical, oppressive nor unscrupulous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 596, 321 N.E. at 918, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kazmaier\u2019s chapter 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">C. <em>Malicious Interference with Business Expectations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">Kazmaier claims that defendants unlawfully interfered with his business expectations in that the commercial spoiled contract negotiations he was then conducting with the United States Football League. To state a claim for the tort of interference with contractual relations in Massachusetts, the plaintiff must establish that defendants committed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">(1) intentional and wilful acts (2) calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs in their lawful business, (3) done with the unlawful purpose to cause such damage and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the defendant, (which constitutes malice), and (4) actual damage and loss resulting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-14\"><em>Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. v. Wnuk, </em>9 Mass.App. 506, 509, 402 N.E.2d 1069, 1072 (1980) (quoting <em>Walker v. Cronin, </em>107 Mass. 555, 562 (1871)). Kazmaier seems to be complaining of interference with prospective business opportunities, which is \u201ca recognized extension of the more typical tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in Massachusetts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201c[o]ne who interferes with another\u2019s prospective contractual relation ... is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation, whether the interference consists of (a) inducing or otherwise causing a third person not to enter into or continue the prospective relation or (b) preventing the other from acquiring or continuing the prospective relation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><em>Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. v. Wnuk, </em>9 Mass.App. at 509 n. 3, 402 N.E.2d at 1072 n. 3 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 766B (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Kazmaier fails to state a claim under this theory because \u201cit is an essential element of the tort that the defendant act without justifiable cause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 510, 402 N.E. at 1072, and no reasonable jury could find that defendants acted without right or justifiable cause and therefore with the requisite malice. It would be completely unreasonable to find that defendants engaged in the expensive process of producing and airing a television commercial simply to frustrate Kazmaier\u2019s business endeavors. And we have already held that defendants acted legally and fairly in using the phrase \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man\u201d in their commercial for purposes of promoting their product. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Kazmaier\u2019s tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">D. <em>Unfair Competition Claim of \u201cPalming Off\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It is established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">under Massachusetts law a plaintiff claiming unfair competition may show <em>either </em>\u201cpalming off\u201d <em>or </em>that the features of the product in question have acquired a secondary meaning such that confusion as to its source is likely to arise if defendant is allowed to copy them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\"><em>Pic Design Corp. v. Bearings Specialty Co., </em>436 F.2d 804, 807 (1st Cir.1971) (emphasis in original). Because the latter claim is foreclosed by our earlier holding, <em>see </em>section A, <em>supra, </em>we are solely concerned with the former, <em>i.e., </em>Kazmaier\u2019s contention that defendants were attempting to \u201cpalm off\u201d Wooten as Kazmaier.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\u201cPalming off\u201d is defined as \u201can attempt by one person to induce customers to believe that his products are actually those of another.\u201d <em>Remco Industries v. Toyomenka, Inc., </em>286 F.Supp. 948, 954 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>397 F.2d 977 (2d Cir.1968). <em>See Pic Design, </em>436 F.2d at 807 n. 3. As was discussed in section A, <em>supra, </em>defendants did not attempt to induce anyone into thinking that \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man, John Wooten\u201d was \u201cthe World\u2019s Strongest Man, William Kazmaier.\u201d They used Wooten\u2019s name and image prominently in the commercial, thereby sufficiently distinguishing Wooten from Kazmaier for purposes of this claim as well as the trade name appropriation and infringement claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-14\">. According to the uncontested affidavit of Dennis Farrington, Vice President/Management Supervisor at Hill, Holliday, the commercial became obsolete as of September 30, 1984, when the new model Fords were introduced, and would not be \"aired in any form after that date.\" Kazmaier's prayer for injunctive relief is therefore moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"><em>. </em>In addition to the common law trade name claims, Kazmaier argues on appeal a purported statutory claim under Mass.Gen.Laws, ch. 110B. This argument is unavailing. First, Kazmaier did not plead such a claim below. Second, the only provision of chapter 110B affording relief to unregistered marks such as Kazmaier's, section 12, is inapposite as it authorizes only in-junctive relief, a moot issue. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>Thus, we view Kazmaier\u2019s claim as exclusively one for damages controlled by Massachusetts common law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-12\">.
