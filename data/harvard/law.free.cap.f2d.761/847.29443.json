Carter, Judge, found that International Air Bahama (\u201cIAB\u201d), a subsidiary of Icelandair/Flugleidir (\u201cIcelandair\u201d), had breached its contractual obligations in respect to appellee pilots and flight engineers, former IAB employees, by terminating them in contravention of provisions set forth in an IAB Operations Manual. The district court then pierced IAB\u2019s corporate veil, holding Icelandair responsible for the damages. On appeal, Icelandair claims that, because appellees were employees at will, their terminations do not create a cause of action, notwithstanding any breach of provisions set forth in the IAB Operations Manual; that there was no breach of the IAB Operations Manual in any event; that the corporate veils of IAB and its holding company should not have been pierced; that, in any event, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act; and, as a last resort, that damages and prejudgment interest were improperly calculated or imposed. We affirm, except as to damages for allegedly lost fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Icelandair, an Icelandic corporation, known in Iceland as Flugleidir, H.F., provides passenger and air cargo service between Iceland, the United States, and Luxembourg. IAB, a corporation under the laws of the Bahama Islands, provided passenger air service between Europe and the Bahamas, flying occasionally into New York. In 1969, Icelandair acquired IAB through a wholly owned Bahamian holding company, Hekla Holdings, Ltd.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of the acquisition, Icelandair obtained four of the seven seats on IAB\u2019s board of directors, its chief executive officer also became chief executive officer for IAB, reporting directly to the Icelandair executive committee. In addition, Icelandair paid the salaries of IAB\u2019s director of operations and all other IAB officers and executives, Icelandair assumed all accounting, administrative, marketing and sales functions for IAB, and IAB crew members received identification cards describing them as Icelandair employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">In 1968 and 1969, appellees became employees of IAB in connection with IAB\u2019s passenger routes; six of them served as pilots and five as flight engineers. Their service to IAB, however, was not limited to passenger service flights. In 1977, as part of a joint venture with Air India and Seaboard World Airways, Inc., Icelandair agreed to supply flight crews for Air India cargo flights from London to Bombay and other points in India, and from India to Tokyo. Thereafter, until March 1, 1983, Icelandair executed its part of the venture through IAB, which supplied Air India with flight crews whose members were IAB employees listed on the same seniority roster with IAB passenger flight crews.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">On October 1, 1980, four of the appellee pilots were discharged without severance pay; on December 1, 1980, the other two appellee pilots and all of the appellee flight engineers were discharged although with severance pay. As of the date appellees were discharged, all of the retained pilots and flight engineers for both IAB\u2019s passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>ger operations and the Air India cargo flights had less seniority than the discharged appellees. IAB ended its passenger service on May 18, 1981, discontinued supplying crews for Air India cargo service on March 1,1983, and, indeed, ceased doing business altogether during the pendency of this appeal and moved for dismissal as a party appellant, a motion which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Although the terms of employment of the appellees are in dispute, both parties agree that each appellee, when first hired, signed an employment agreement that covered a term of years and recited obligations to work full-time for IAB and to repay a proportionate amount of training expenses should the employee unilaterally terminate employment before the specified term. These employment agreements, however, did not set forth any of the other terms and conditions of employment. The district court found that,, once on the job, appellees discussed their desire for a written employment contract with IAB\u2019s CEO and its director of operations, but on each occasion were advised that no agreement was needed, \u201csince all the terms and conditions of employment were contained in the Operations Manual,\u201d which,, they were assured, guaranteed their seniority, job security, and retirement rights. The court further found, in findings that are not seriously contested on appeal, that appellees\u2019 superiors at IAB, as well as the officials of Icelandair, conducted themselves as if the rules and regulations in the Operations Manual were binding on IAB in that changes in terms and conditions of employment obtained through negotiations were thereafter included in the Operations Manual. The Operations Manual, as revised and as in effect on the dates of appellees\u2019 discharges, provided expressly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">[seniority shall be the sole factor for determining demotions, transfers or termination caused by job elimination or force reduction when the senior employee is qualified to perform the available work or can be adequately trained in a reasonable or practical period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATV\">IAB Operations Manual, at 1-3-21 (Jan. 1, 1979). While the Operations Manual directed that pilots be retired at age sixty, it also provided that pilots employed prior to January 1, 1977, be allowed to remain in the cockpit until age sixty-three, provided they passed first class physical examinations at four-month intervals. The retirement age for flight engineers was set at age sixty-five.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Prior to appellees\u2019 discharges, IAB adhered strictly to the seniority provisions set out in the Operations Manual. At some point in time, however, Icelandair directed IAB to give preference to Icelanders and Bahamians in filling job vacancies, causing some concern to appellees, who were subsequently assured by Tedd Hope, IAB\u2019s director of operations, that IAB would \u201cfollow the policies outlined in the Operations Manual\u201d and that Sigurdur Helgason, the CEO of Icelandair and IAB, had given Hope assurances that the jobs of all present crew members were safe. Even at trial, Helgason agreed that \u201cthe operations manual guides the company\u2019s operations,\u201d a statement in accord with his personal assurance to appellee William E. McDonald, and with his statements in several memoranda to Hope.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Nevertheless, as the district court found, sometime in 1979, because IAB and Icelan-dair had an excess of crews, the union representing Icelandair employees mounted pressure on Icelandair to replace non-Icelandic employees at affiliated companies with Icelandic nationals. Helgason sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>gested to Hope that some of IAB\u2019s American pilots be terminated by imposing a rule requiring termination of pilots at age sixty. At trial, Icelandair attempted to justify such a rule on the basis of section 2.1.7.1 of the Standards and Practices set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which had been adopted by the Bahamas in 1977 and which provides that a contracting state, having issued a pilot\u2019s license, shall not permit the holder thereof to act as a pilot in command after his sixtieth birthday. Appellees\u2019 licenses, however, had been issued by Iceland or the United States, not by the Bahamian government. Moreover, Iceland itself had filed an exception to the ICAO Standards and Practices that would postpone retirement for pilots flying Iceland-registered aircraft until age\u2019 sixty-three. Hope had known about the ICAO standards when the Operations Manual had been revised, and yet had told appellees on numerous occasions that they could fly until age sixty-three. Indeed, the Bahamian government had never issued regulations or instructions requiring IAB to adhere to the ICAO standards, and appellees Gorrill and Bacon piloted IAB passenger flights for over a year after attaining age sixty. Helgason nevertheless ordered Hope to impose the age sixty rule, and on September 30, 1980, the four appellee pilots who had attained age sixty were discharged. According to Hope\u2019s testimony, the other appellees, none of whom had reached sixty, were terminated to provide work for Icelandic nationals without affecting Bahamian personnel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Icelandair\u2019s first argument is that, under the law of New York, because appellees were employees at will, their terminations do not create a cause of action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The argument is not without plausibility, since New York has long held that employment for an indefinite term is terminable at the will of either party at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. <em>See, e.g., Parker v. Borock, </em>5 N.Y.2d 156, 159, 156 N.E.2d 297, 298, 182 N.Y.S.2d 577, 579 (1959). Despite sharp criticism, this rule has generally maintained its vitality, although not without substantial qualification. For example, in <em>Murphy v. American Home Products Corp., </em>58 N.Y.2d 293, 305, 448 N.E.2d 86, 91, 461 N.Y.S.2d 232, 237 (1983), over Judge Meyer\u2019s ringing dissent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a six-member majority of the New York Court of Appeals reaffirmed the rule only after reciting its exceptions: \u201cabsent a constitutionally impermissible purpose, a statutory proscription, or an express limitation in the individual contract of employment, an employer\u2019s right at any time to terminate an employment at will remains unimpaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">In stating that the at-will discharge rule does not apply where there is \u201can express limitation in the individual contract of employment,\u201d the <em>Murphy </em>court followed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>holding in <em>Weiner v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 N.Y.2d 458, 443 N.E.2d 441, 457 N.Y.S.2d 193 (1982), in which it established the \u201cexpress limitation\u201d qualification to the \u201cat-will\u201d discharge rule. In <em>Weiner, </em>an employer\u2019s otherwise absolute right to discharge an employee hired for a term of indefinite duration was held, as a matter of New York contract law, to be subject to an express limitation on that right set forth only in a company personnel handbook. Rejecting the proposition that an employee\u2019s freedom to quit his employment at will is conclusive of whether, as a matter of mutuality, an employer could, in turn, terminate at will, the court found such reciprocity to be unnecessary where a promis-sor has received valid consideration taking the form of benefit to the promissor or detriment to the promisee. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 443 N.E.2d at 444, 457 N.Y.S.2d at 196. The court went on to find, on the facts before it, that a promise could be made out from the employer\u2019s representations and assurances that employees would be discharged only for \u201cjust and sufficient cause\u201d and only after rehabilitative efforts had failed as set forth in the company handbook on personnel policies and procedures. The court further found that consideration sufficient to bind the employer to that promise could be made out from the service that the employee had begun or rendered, and from the employee\u2019s detrimental reliance on a promise that had induced him to leave a former employer. <em>Id. </em>at 465-67, 443 N.E.2d at 445-46, 457 N.Y.S.2d at 197-98. The court noted that the case originally adopting the at-will discharge rule, <em>Martin v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>148 N.Y. 117, 42 N.E. 416 (1895), afforded the rule \u201cno greater status than that of a rebut-table presumption\u201d that a trier of fact might find was overcome on a review of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahj-dedup-0\">the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d of the parties, \u201cincluding their writings\u201d [citation omitted] and their antecedent negotiations. Moreover, ... it is not [an employer\u2019s] subjective intent, nor \u201cany single act, phrase or other expression\u201d, but \u201cthe totality of all of these, given the attendant circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the objectives they were striving to attain\u201d, which will control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKb_\"><em>Weiner, </em>57 N.Y.2d at 466-67, 443 N.E.2d at 446, 457 N.Y.S.2d at 198. In <em>Weiner, </em>then, the highest court of New York indicated that the \u201cexpress limitation\u201d exception to the at-will discharge rule defined in <em>Murphy, supra, </em>is a context-sensitive exception the validity of which must be determined by a trier of fact from the actions of both employer and employee in relation to a writing that is alleged to constitute an express limitation on an employer\u2019s right of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The district court, following <em>Weiner, </em>considered the totality of circumstances in this case and found the Operations Manual at issue here binding on IAB, and we agree. The Operations .Manual, as previously mentioned, expressly provides that seniority be the sole factor where terminations stemming from job elimination or force reduction must be made, and that employees with appellees\u2019 seniority obtain a conditional entitlement to defer retirement past the age of sixty. Given the \u201cexpress limitations\u201d on IAB\u2019s right to discharge appellees, the district court found a binding contract from the actions of the parties with respect to those provisions. As the district court stated, appellees received \u201crepeated oral and written assurances from the employer that the Operations Manual contained the terms and conditions of employment and was controlling.\u201d In return, appellees continued to render their services to appellants, thereby satisfying the requirement of valid consideration under the limited standard established in <em>Weiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Icelandair argues, however, that New York courts follow <em>Weiner </em>only in cases that present the four factual circumstances occurring in <em>Weiner: </em>(1) the employee was induced to leave his prior job with the assurance that he would not be dismissed without just cause; (2) the employee was assured in an employment application that he would not be dismissed without just cause; (3) the employee had rejected other job offers in reliance on such assurances; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>and (4) the personnel manual involved expressly stated that dismissal would be only for just cause and only after steps toward rehabilitation of the employee had been taken and had failed. Such an argument must fail. If <em>Weiner </em>stands for anything, it stands for the proposition that the merits of a claim alleging breach of an employment contract are not to be determined by application of a formula or checklist; instead, the totality of facts giving rise to the claim must be considered. Neither of the cases cited by appellants in support of its argument that <em>Weiner </em>should be confined to its facts, <em>Utas v. Power Authority of New York, </em>96 A.D.2d 940, 466 N.Y.S.2d 390, <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>61 N.Y.2d 601, 459 N.E.2d 1291, 471 N.Y.S,2d 1029 (1983), and <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Westchester Community Service Council, Inc., </em>96 A.D.2d 885, 466 N.Y.S.2d 41 (1983), contains an express statement that <em>Weiner </em>is to be so confined. We therefore conclude, considering the absence of such language in <em>Murphy, supra, </em>that those cases reflect the understandable tendency of a lower court to avoid unauthorized <em>expansions </em>of the <em>Weiner </em>exception to the at-will discharge rule. Moreover, in <em>Tiranno v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>99 A.D.2d 675, 472 N.Y.S.2d 49 (1984), the Fourth Department, following both <em>Weiner, supra, </em>and <em>Murphy, supra, </em>held that a triable issue of fact existed concerning whether, under the totality of circumstances, a company personnel manual required an employer to have \u201cgood cause\u201d to terminate an employee even where the employment is of indefinite duration. <em>Id. </em>at 675, 472 N.Y.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">As for Icelandair\u2019s observation that ap-pellees were \u201cnotified in writing\u201d of the \u201cchange in policy\u201d destroying their seniority rights, we agree with appellees that this comes close to paltering with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The district court\u2019s determination to pierce Icelandair\u2019s corporate veil is soundly based. Its findings that Icelandair dominated IAB and effectuated appellees\u2019 discharges are not seriously attacked on appeal as clearly erroneous. Nor can they be, since it was the resolution of Icelandair\u2019s board that directed IAB to give employment preferences to Icelanders and Bahamians, as well as Icelandair\u2019s CEO who directed the firing of the appellees, and Icelandair employees who effectuated ap-pellees\u2019 discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">While New York is reluctant to pierce corporate veils, a parent may be held liable for the acts of its subsidiary under the principles of <em>Lowendahl v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>247 A.D. 144, 157, 287 N.Y.S. 62, 76, <em>aff'd, </em>272 N.Y. 360, 6 N.E.2d 56 (1936):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">1. Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete domination, not only of finances but of policy and business practice <em>in respect to the transaction attacked </em>[emphasis added] so that the corporate entity as to this transaction had <em>at the time </em>[emphasis in original] no separate mind, will or existence of its own; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">2. Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or a dishonest and unjust act in contravention of plaintiff\u2019s legal rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-11\">3. The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury or unjust loss complained of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">The domination required by <em>Lowendahl </em>need not be complete as to every detail but must only be \u201ccomplete ... in respect to the transaction attacked.\u201d Nor is it necessary to show that termination of employment constituted \u201cfraud\u201d upon appellees. Though it comes very close' to that in this case it is enough under <em>Lowendahl </em>if it is a \u201cfraud or wrong.\u201d Icelandair\u2019s control over IAB was used as <em>Lowendahl </em>states, \u201cto perpetrate the violation of a ... positive legal duty or a dishonest or unjust act in contravention of plaintiff\u2019s legal rights.\u201d <em>See Astrocom Electronics Inc. v. Lafayette Radio Electronics Corp., </em>63 A.D.2d 765, 766, 404 N.Y.S.2d 742, 744 (1978). Moreover, to suggest that the corporate status of IAB is somehow significant falls with little grace when in fact IAB was permitted to discontinue its existence while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>this action was pending and after the briefs were written. In sum, we find that the obligations of the erstwhile IAB must be assumed by its neglectful parent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The futility of Icelandair\u2019s arguments reaches its depths in the claim, made for the first time on appeal, that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Icelandair points out that the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188 (1982), establishes an administrative arbitration procedure for the settlement of employment disputes between employees and \u201ccarriers by air.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 184. Icelandair argues that because this arbitration procedure is the mandatory and exclusive method for settling employee claims concerning terms and conditions of employment, including claims of wrongful discharge, <em>see Andrews v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co., </em>406 U.S. 320, 323-26, 92 S.Ct. 1562, 1564-66, 32 L.Ed.2d 95 (1972), the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this case, <em>Jackson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>717 F.2d 1045, 1054-55 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1000, 79 L.Ed.2d 233 (1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Icelandair relies on section 1.3.7 of the Operations Manual, entitled \u201cPersonnel Procedures \u2014 Grievance Procedures,\u201d to support its claim that the Operations Manual itself contemplated exclusive administrative procedures for the settlement of employee grievances. This provision, according to Icelandair, was not made a part of the record in the district court, apparently because counsel for appellants in the district court was so confident of winning on other grounds that it saw fit not to mention the argument. While this is surely one of the lamest excuses to be made recently in an appellant\u2019s brief, we need not reject it on any doctrine of waiver, particularly since the argument is jurisdictional. We note instead that, under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184, a board of adjustment is an agency to be created by a \u201ccarrier and ... its employees, acting through their representatives,\u201d and that IAB\u2019s employees were \u201cnot unionized\u201d and had no \u201crepresentative.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, as noted, IAB itself is now nonexistent for purposes of Railway Labor Act jurisdiction or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Icelandair\u2019s remaining arguments are that the district court should not have awarded damages incurred beyond May 18, 1981, the date that IAB ceased its passenger operations; that two of the pilots were not entitled to damages after having reached sixty-three years of age; and that the court incorrectly calculated appellees\u2019 fringe benefits and prejudgment interest. The short answer to the claim for disallowing damages incurred after the cessation of IAB passenger operations is that IAB is liable in damages for its cargo as well as its passenger operations. As previously described, IAB employees made up the flight crews for Air India\u2019s cargo flights until March 1, 1983, almost two years beyond the date that IAB discontinued its passenger flights. At least three IAB crew members continued to staff Air India cargo flights after appellees were terminated, and all revenues earned by Icelandair from its Air India venture passed first through IAB. We therefore find unpersua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>sive Icelandair\u2019s attempt to find significance in the date IAB\u2019s passenger operations ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Judge Carter\u2019s award of damages through March 1, 1983, to appellees Gorrill and Bacon was based on an Operations Manual provision permitting pilots flying company aircraft of U.S. registry to work until age sixty-five. Although the aircraft used in the Air India operation were of U.S. registry, Icelandair points out that the provision of the IAB Operations Manual at issue here applied only to \u201ccompany aircraft\u201d of U.S. registry, and argues that \u201ccompany aircraft\u201d was intended to refer only to IAB aircraft. This argument is unavailing; given the nature of IAB\u2019s cargo flight operations, under any reasonable construction of the Operations Manual, the aircraft flown by IAB crews for Air India\u2019s cargo flights were \u201ccompany aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">On review of this case, we find troublesome only the district court\u2019s finding that appellees\u2019 fringe benefits, including health and life insurance coverage and sick pay, were worth at least 10% of their gross salary. Appellees did obtain fringe benefits, but at trial no testimony was offered one way or the other to quantify them, although the 10% computation apparently comports with a recent United States Department of Transportation study. <em>See </em>Financial and Cost Analysis Division, Office of Economic Analysis, Civil Aeronautics Board, <em>Recent Trends in Airline Cost Elements </em>\u2014 U.S. <em>Certified Route Carriers by Group, </em>Table 16 (Jan. 27, 1984). It is argued that appellees did not have to prove with mathematical certainty the exact value of their fringe benefits; we think, however, that there must be at least some expert testimony to support the 10% figure, and therefore reverse and remand as to this one point for purposes of taking additional testimony if appellees do not wish to waive the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Judge Carter\u2019s calculation of prejudgment interest running from December 15, 1981, and January 15, 1982, is from a \u201csingle reasonable intermediate date\u201d within N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 5001(b) (McKinney 1963). As such, and given the 9% rate then in effect, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5004 (McKinney Supp. 1964-84), the court\u2019s assessment of prejudgment interest is a reasonable exercise of trial court discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Judgment affirmed except as to fringe benefits, as to which it is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\">.

The district court discredited the only two Witnesses produced at trial by Icelandair, finding that one, a senior vice president of marketing, had no knowledge of the facts involved in the controversy and therefore could give no relevant information, and that the other, Helga-son, gave evasive and often nonresponsive and untruthful answers to be rejected as lacking credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">. We pass over the question whether New York, Florida, Bahamian, or some other law governs, for the parties are in agreement that the law of New York is controlling, the district court treated it as such, and the case has been briefed and argued as though New York law controls. Moreover, New York law is probably more favorable to appellants than the law of any other potentially governing jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b945-14\">.

Initially, one might easily question whether either IAB or Icelandair would be proper parties for an action under the RLA. On examination, however, both would seem amenable to such an action. IAB directed its operations from New York and conducted periodic flights to and from New York; in addition, its accounting as well as its payroll disbursements emanated from New York. Icelandair directed its Western Hemisphere operations out of New York. <em>Cf. </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (under RLA, \"commerce\u201d refers, inter alia, to commerce between any state and any foreign nation); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 181 (Railway Labor Act to apply to \"every common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"A5Q\">.
