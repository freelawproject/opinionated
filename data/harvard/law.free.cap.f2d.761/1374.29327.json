Dawes, and David F. Dawes, the principals of Pizza of Hawaii, Inc. (Pizza), in 1977. On September 25, 1980, Shakey\u2019s filed suit in the U.S. District Court against Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes, seeking injunctive relief and damages for breach of contract and trademark infringement. (Civ. No. 80-0517). On September 31, Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes executed an instrument purporting to assign their interests in the dealer agreement to Pizza. The following day, Pizza filed a chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court. (Bk. No. 80-00629). The filing stayed further proceedings against Pizza (but not against Pizza\u2019s principals) pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 362, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1469-21\">Shakey\u2019s filed a request for relief from the automatic stay so that it could join Pizza as a defendant in the civil case. (Bk. Adv. No. 80-0078). On November 12, the bankruptcy court denied the request for relief, but entered an order which stated that it would \u201cnot entertain a plan of reorganization under the provisions of Chapter XI until such time as the question of the termination of the franchise has been litigated in Civil No. 80-0517, currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-22\">Shakey\u2019s then proceeded with its case against Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes in the district court. In May of 1982, Shakey\u2019s became aware that Pizza was purportedly violating Shakey\u2019s contractual and trademark rights. Therefore, Shakey\u2019s amended its complaint to include these new violations. Arguing that the amended complaint affected Pizza\u2019s estate, Pizza successfully petitioned the district court for leave to intervene and to transfer the civil case to the bankruptcy court as an adversary proceeding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on July 13, 1982. (Bk. Adv. No. 82-0136).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>On May 4, 1983, Pizza filed its first amended plan of reorganization, and on May 20, 1983, its first amended disclosure statement. On May 24, 1983, the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the disclosure statement and effectively vacating its order of November 12, 1980, in which it had indicated that it would not entertain a plan of reorganization until the civil case had been terminated. The bankruptcy court confirmed Pizza\u2019s plan on June 29,1983. The next day, the bankruptcy court remanded Adv. No. 82-0136 to the district court as Civ. No. 80-0517, where it is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Shakey\u2019s appealed the order confirming the plan to the district court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arguing that the plan was not feasible because it did not make sufficient provision for the enormous debt that Pizza would owe Shakey\u2019s if the district court found Pizza liable in the civil case. Pizza argued in defense that Sha-key\u2019s did not have standing to object to the plan because Shakey\u2019s had not filed a formal proof of claim in the bankruptcy court covering the damages sued for in the civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">The district court, 40 B.R. 1014, ruled that although Shakey\u2019s had not filed a formal proof of claim, the documents Shakey\u2019s filed in the bankruptcy court while the civil case was pending in that court (July 13, 1982, to June 30, 1983), together with its active participation in the bankruptcy case, constituted an amendable informal proof of claim. Consequently, the district court remanded, ordering the bankruptcy court to grant Shakey\u2019s leave to file a formal proof of claim. The district court also ordered the bankruptcy court to estimate the value of Shakey\u2019s claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because waiting for the ultimate resolution of Shakey\u2019s civil claim would unduly delay Pizza\u2019s reorganization. Finally, the district court vacated the plan, directing the bankruptcy court to reconsider the plan\u2019s feasibility in light of the estimated value of Shakey\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-10\">Pizza appealed to this court, arguing that the district court improperly granted Sha-key\u2019s leave to amend and, consequently, improperly vacated the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-12\">I. Whether this court has jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order vacat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>ing the plan, remanding this matter to the bankruptcy court to permit Shakey\u2019s to amend its informal proof of claim, and directing the bankruptcy court to estimate the value of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">II. Whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling that Shakey\u2019s had established an amendable informal proof of claim when the bankruptcy court had not ruled on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\">III. Whether Shakey\u2019s actions and the documents Shakey\u2019s filed in the bankruptcy court constitute an amendable informal proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">IV. Whether the plan is not feasible and, therefore, cannot be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AmL\">In <em>Diamond National Corp. v. Lee, </em>333 F.2d 517, 528 (9th Cir.1964), we indicated that it is within the district court\u2019s discretion whether to consider issues not presented to the bankruptcy court. <em>Cf. Abex Corp. v. Ski\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 513, 516 (9th Cir.1984) (although rule that circuit court should not consider arguments appellant failed to raise in district court is discretionary, it may be dispensed with altogether if issue is purely legal and central to case). Consequently, we review the district court\u2019s decision to consider whether Shakey\u2019s had established an amendable informal proof of claim under an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-9\">Because we are in as good a position as the district court to review the findings of the bankruptcy court, we independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., In re Mellor, </em>734 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1984); <em>In re Comer, </em>723 F.2d 737, 739 (9th Cir.1984); <em>In re Bialac, </em>712 F.2d 426, 429 (9th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 426, 429 (9th Cir.1984). The issue whether the documents a creditor filed, considered in conjunction with the creditor\u2019s conduct, constitute an amendable informal proof of claim is one of law, which we review de novo. <em>In re Sambo\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 811, 815 (9th Cir. 1985). The issue whether a plan is feasible \u2014 is not likely to be followed by liquidation or further reorganization \u2014 is one of fact, which we review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United Properties, Inc. v. Emporium Department Stores, Inc., </em>379 F.2d 55, 63-64 (8th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-14\">I. This court has jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order vacating the plan, remanding this matter to the bankruptcy court to permit Shakey\u2019s to amend its informal proof of claim, and directing the bankruptcy court to estimate the value of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-15\">Before we address the merits of this appeal, we must determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction. Although neither party raised the issue, a federal court must determine sua sponte its proper jurisdiction. <em>In re Martinez, </em>721 F.2d 262, 264 (9th Cir.1983). Section 158(d) of Title 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>gives this court jurisdiction to hear appeals \u201cfrom all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees\u201d entered by a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel on appeal from a bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-353, \u00a7 104(a), 98 Stat. 333, 341 (to be codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158). Interlocutory orders are not ap-pealable as of right. They may be reviewed at the discretion of the district courts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), but they are not appealable to the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). <em>See In re King City Transit Mix, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 1065, 1066 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>In re Mason, </em>709 F.2d 1313, 1315 (9th Cir.1983); <em>In re Rubin, </em>693 F.2d 73, 76 (9th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">Pizza appeals from an order of the district court that reverses the bankruptcy court\u2019s order confirming Pizza\u2019s plan, remands to permit Shakey\u2019s to amend its informal proof of claim, and directs the bankruptcy court to estimate the value of that claim. The jurisdictional question, then, is a simple one: is this order final or interlocutory?</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-5\">We recently addressed the issue of our jurisdiction to review a similar order in <em>In re Sambo\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 811 (9th Cir.1985). In <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>the creditor first moved in the bankruptcy court for leave to amend what she characterized as an informal proof of claim. The bankruptcy court denied the motion and the creditor appealed to the district court. The district court reversed the bankruptcy court and granted the creditor fifteen days in which to file an amended proof of claim. The debtor then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">We found that we had jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order reversing the bankruptcy court and granting leave to amend. <em>Id. </em>at 813-15. In reaching this conclusion, we agreed with the Third and Eighth Circuits that \u201c \u2018when the bankruptcy court issues what is indisputably a final order, and the district court issues an order affirming or reversing, the district court\u2019s order is also a final order ____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814 (quoting <em>In re Marin Motor Oil, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 445, 449 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1207, 103 S.Ct. 1196, 75 L.Ed.2d 440 (1983), and citing <em>In re Bestmann, </em>720 F.2d 484, 485-86 (8th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-13\">In the instant case, the district court was reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s order confirming Pizza\u2019s proposed plan. Of all the possible orders in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case \u2014 except, perhaps, an order closing or dismissing the case \u2014 the order confirming a plan most nearly fits the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of a final order as one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). Consequently, the district court\u2019s order vacating the plan is also final for purposes of appeal and we have jurisdiction to review it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 815; <em>see In re Madison Hotel Associates, </em>749 F.2d 410, 426-27 (7th Cir.1984) (without discussing jurisdiction, Seventh Circuit reviewed district court\u2019s order reversing bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation of chapter 11 plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>II. The district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Shakey\u2019s had established an amendable informal proof of claim when the bankruptcy court had not ruled on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">Shakey\u2019s appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order confirming the plan on feasibility grounds. Pizza argued in defense that Shakey\u2019s failure to file a proof of claim deprived it of standing to appeal the order confirming the plan. The district court concluded that the documents Sha-key\u2019s filed, together with Shakey\u2019s active participation in the bankruptcy proceedings, constituted an informal proof of claim and remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court to permit Shakey\u2019s to amend its informal claim with a formal document. Pizza, the party that raised the issue before the district court, now argues that the district court improperly decided the issue because the bankruptcy court had not yet ruled on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">The Bankruptcy Rule pertaining to the district court\u2019s role in reviewing bankruptcy court orders does not shed any light on this question. Rule 8013 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7\">On an appeal the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel may affirm, modify, or reverse a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, order, or decree or remand with instructions for further proceedings. Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1473-7\">Bankr.Rule 8013 (1983). However, case law interpreting the Bankruptcy Rules is more helpful. In a case involving former Bankruptcy Rule 810,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which is essentially identical to new Rule 8013, we held that the district court acted properly in considering an issue not raised in the bankruptcy court. <em>In re Walsh Construction, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 1325, 1329 (9th Cir.1982). We noted in <em>Walsh </em>that under former General Order 47,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> any issue presented by the record could be raised before the district court, even if it was not presented to the bankruptcy court. Although Bankruptcy Rule 810 replaced General Order 47, we reasoned that this principle still applied where the issue did not raise facts outside the record. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we concluded that because the petitioner\u2019s objection \u201cgoes to matters within the record and was raised in the district court, it is properly before this court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-12\">We reaffirmed the propriety of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s consideration of issues not raised before the bankruptcy court in <em>In re Verco Industries, </em>704 F.2d 1134 (9th Cir.1983). In <em>Verco, </em>the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) sua sponte raised and decided an issue on which the bankruptcy court had not ruled. The losing party appealed to this court, arguing that the BAP was precluded from deciding the issue because the prevailing party had not raised it in the bankruptcy court. We found \u201cno merit\u201d in the argument: \u201cThe bankruptcy panel clearly addressed and decided the issue, and it became part of the record on appeal. Fed.R.App.P. 10(a). The bankruptcy panel having considered the issue, we may review it on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-13\">Because Rule 8013 is essentially identical to former Rule 810, our decisions in <em>Walsh </em>and <em>Verco </em>support the district court\u2019s power to consider any issue presented by the record even if the issue was not presented to the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>Nonetheless, Pizza argues that the district court in the instant case improperly looked outside the record to reach its decision that Shakey\u2019s had established an amendable informal proof of claim. This argument is also meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\">In deciding the proof of claim issue, the district court relied on three types of evidence: the pleadings Shakey\u2019s had filed in the civil case which was transferred to the bankruptcy court on July 13, 1982, and kept pending in that court until June 30, 1983; the other documents Shakey\u2019s filed with the bankruptcy court before May 14, 1982, the date the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan; and Shakey\u2019s active participation in the bankruptcy proceedings as revealed by the transcript of the bankruptcy court hearing to confirm the plan. The district court\u2019s consideration of these three sources of information was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">First, the bankruptcy court had transferred the civil case back to the district court by the time that Shakey\u2019s appealed the order confirming the plan. Therefore, all of the pleadings filed in that case were within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. In addition, copies of Shakey\u2019s complaint in the civil case, the dealer agreements between Shakey\u2019s and Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes, and the document assigning Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes\u2019 interests to Pizza were attached as exhibits to a document that Shakey\u2019s had designated part of the record on appeal. Moreover, Pizza itself specifically requested that various documents it filed in the civil ease be included in the record on appeal to the district court. Therefore, the district court properly considered these documents filed in the civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">Second, the district court properly considered documents that Shakey\u2019s filed in the bankruptcy court prior to May 14, 1983. Shakey\u2019s had designated the following documents to be part of the record on appeal: Objection to Adequacy of Debtor\u2019s Disclosure Statement; Motion to Continue Hearing on Approval of Debtor\u2019s Plan of Reorganization and Memorandum in Support of Motion; Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Continue; and Objection to Confirmation of Debtor\u2019s Plan of Reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-9\">Third, the district court properly considered Shakey\u2019s active participation in the bankruptcy proceedings as shown by the transcript of the bankruptcy court hearing to confirm the plan. Pizza itself had designated the transcript of the hearing to be part of the record on appeal. Shakey\u2019s had also designated transcripts of the pretrial hearing on its Complaint for Relief From Stay and the hearing on its Motion to Continue Hearing on Approval of Debtor\u2019s Plan of Reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-10\">In conclusion, the record presented the proof of claim issue and the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">III. Shakey\u2019s actions and the documents Shakey\u2019s filed in the bankruptcy court constitute an amendable informal proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-12\">Our reeent decision in <em>In re Sambo\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 811 (9th Cir. 1985), governs this issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>the debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. While the automatic stay was in effect, the creditor in <em>Sambo\u2019s </em>filed a wrongful death suit in a U.S. District Court. The debtor and the creditor then joined in a motion requesting the district court to transfer the case to the bankruptcy court. The district court denied the motion, and instead entered an order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>missing the case without prejudice to the creditor to petition to reinstate the action to pursue any matter unresolved by the bankruptcy court after the stay was dissolved. But the creditor never filed a formal proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Rather, after the date for filing had passed, she moved in the bankruptcy court for leave to amend what she characterized as an informal proof of claim established within the filing period. The bankruptcy court denied her motion, but the district court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-5\">On appeal, we affirmed the district court in light of our \u201clong-established liberal policy toward amendment of proofs of claim.\u201d <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 816. <em>See Sun Basin Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 48, 49 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam); <em>In re Franciscan Vineyards, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 181, 182 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 915, 100 S.Ct. 1274, 63 L.Ed.2d 598 (1980). After examining the complaint the creditor filed in the U.S. District Court, the creditor\u2019s correspondence with debtor\u2019s counsel, and her joint motion with the debtor to transfer the case to the bankruptcy court, we found that these documents established an informal proof of claim because they \u201cstate an explicit demand showing the nature and amount of the claim against the estate, and evidence an intent to hold the debtor liable.\u201d <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-8\">The documents Shakey\u2019s filed in the instant chapter 11 case also establish an informal proof of claim. In its complaint for relief from the automatic stay, Shakey\u2019s stated its desire to join the debtor as a defendant in the civil case, clearly evidencing its intent to hold the estate liable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, the documents attached as exhibits to the complaint for relief from the automatic stay detail the nature and contingent amount of the claim. Exhibit A is the complaint Shakey\u2019s filed in the civil case, requesting $58,335.23 in unpaid dealer fees, damages for unfair competition, treble damages for trademark infringement, an injunction against Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes (and Pizza via Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes\u2019 assignment), attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-9\">Although the complaint thus describes the nature of Shakey\u2019s claim, it does not quantify the damages requested \u2014 the amount of Shakey\u2019s claim \u2014 except for the $58,335 in dealer fees. Yet, because the violations were ongoing and proof of injury would require extensive evidentiary presentation, Shakey\u2019s simply could not be more specific in its request for damages. We agree with the district court that \u201c[t]he adversary matter contained all of the necessary prerequisites to advise the bankruptcy court of Shakey\u2019s claim.\u201d Because the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the adversary action for many months, all parties to the bankruptcy were well informed of its nature and scope.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>In sum, the request for relief from the automatic stay, together with the other documents Shakey\u2019s filed, sufficiently \u201cstate an explicit demand showing the nature and amount of the claim against the estate, and evidence an intent to hold the debtor liable.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 816. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order remanding the matter to the district court to permit Shakey\u2019s to amend its informal proof of claim with a formal document and directing the bankruptcy court to estimate the value of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-4\">IV. The plan is not feasible and, therefore, cannot be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-5\">Section 1129(a)(ll) requires as a condition of confirmation that the bankruptcy court find that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-6\">Confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(ll) (1982). \u201cThe purpose of section 1129(a)(ll) is to prevent confirmation of visionary schemes which promise creditors and equity security holders more under a proposed plan than the debtor can possibly attain after confirmation.\u201d 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>f 1129.-02[11] at 1129-34 (15th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-8\">The bankruptcy court confirmed Pizza\u2019s plan, finding that the plan was feasible. The district court, however, reasoned that \u201c[wjithout the benefit of an estimate of Shakey\u2019s claim, the bankruptcy court could not have adequately judged the plan\u2019s feasibility,\u201d and remanded to the bankruptcy court \u201cto determine the plan\u2019s feasibility in light of the estimate.\u201d We agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of feasibility was clearly erroneous because the plan failed to provide for the possibility that Shakey\u2019s would recover a large judgment in the civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-11\">Pizza estimated the plan\u2019s cash requirements at $291,295.99, divided as follows: (1) cash disbursements at plan confirmation of $209,795.99; (2) working capital of $50,-000.00; and (3) conversion costs of $31,-500.00. The estimation does not make any provision for the possibility of Shakey\u2019s recovering a large verdict. But the plan states that if Shakey\u2019s claim is finally determined in Shakey\u2019s favor, then \u201cthere shall be no further distributions to claimants in the class to which [Shakey\u2019s] claim belongs, or to junior classes of claimants, until [Shakey\u2019s] has received the money or property to which it would have been entitled from the date of confirmation of this Plan, had its claim initially been allowed in the amount finally determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-12\">Shakey\u2019s is requesting a minimum of $58,335.23 in damages, over one-fourth of the plan\u2019s estimated cash disbursements. If Shakey\u2019s recovers even this minimal amount, it would mean that Pizza would be unable to pay one-fourth of its claims under the plan. Moreover, under the plan, what ultimately happens to Pizza and its payments to its other creditors depends entirely on the timing of Shakey\u2019s recovery. If the civil case is terminated after all of Pizza\u2019s cash has been paid out to its other creditors, then Shakey\u2019s would probably force Pizza into chapter 7 to collect on its claim. Until the bankruptcy court has estimated the value of Shakey\u2019s claim, it is impossible to determine whether $291,-295.99 is sufficient to effectuate the plan and enable Pizza to continue in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-13\">In conclusion, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order vacating the plan and remanding to the bankruptcy court to reconsider the plan\u2019s feasibility in light of its estimate of Shakey\u2019s claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1469-17\">.

Pizza devotes a great deal of its brief to arguing that Shakey\u2019s should have requested the bankruptcy court, pursuant to Bankr.Rule 906 (1973), to extend the time in which it could file a proof of claim. But this argument misses the point of the district court's holding. The district court found that Shakey\u2019s <em>had established a proof of claim, </em>albeit an informal one, within the filing period. The district court remanded to permit Shakey\u2019s <em>to amend </em>that proof of claim with a formal document, not to file a proof of claim for the first time. As discussed <em>infra, </em>Ninth Circuit case law supports a creditor\u2019s right to establish an informal proof of claim within the filing period and amend the proof of claim with a formal document at a later date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1475-6\">. Other documents Shakey\u2019s filed in the bankruptcy court also evidence Shakey\u2019s intent to hold Pizza liable. In Shakey\u2019s Objections to Adequacy of Debtor\u2019s Disclosure Statement, Shakey\u2019s stated that if Shakey\u2019s prevails in its civil case, Pizza \"might be responsible for the pre-petition fees and assessments which total over $58,000 plus attorney\u2019s fees [and] post petition fees and assessments, or have to forfeit all of its post petition profits under a trademark infringement and unfair competition claim which is part of the lawsuit.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1475-7\">. In its objection to confirmation of the plan, Shakey\u2019s clearly states that if the district court determines that Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes\u2019 assignment to Pizza is valid, then Pizza will be liable for all of the damages Shakey\u2019s seeks against Leibert, Dawes, and Dawes. On the other hand, if the assignment is not valid, Sha-key\u2019s argues that Pizza would then be subject to an injunction preventing it from selling pizza products within a 30 mile radius of any Sha-key\u2019s location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">. Counsel for Pizza implied at oral argument that Shakey\u2019s intentionally failed to file a proof of claim to gain some undue advantage. But counsel was unable to specify any advantage that Shakey\u2019s would gain by its failure to file\u2014 Shakey\u2019s certainly was not trying to unfairly surprise the parties to the bankruptcy by bringing its claim to the bankruptcy court\u2019s attention at a late date. On the contrary, it is logical to assume that Shakey\u2019s did not file a proof of claim in justifiable reliance on the bankruptcy court\u2019s order stating that it would not entertain a plan of reorganization until the civil case had been terminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1476-9\">.
