Collins) in the damages portion of a bifurcated bench trial, holding Wilco Marsh Buggies and Draglines, Inc., et al. (Wilco) liable for damages of $1,113,660.11 for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 3,482,785 (\u2019785 patent). 561 F.Supp. 512, 217 USPQ 1302 (E.D.La.1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) has already affirmed the judgment of the district court, holding the Kori Corporation et al. (Kori) \u2019785 patent valid and infringed, 708 F.2d 151, 219 USPQ 286 (5th Cir.1983), and on Wilco\u2019s motion, has transferred the damages portion of the bifurcated proceedings to this court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">Kori Corporation is an exclusive sub-licensee under the \u2019785 patent. The \u2019785 patent was originally issued to Huey J. Rivet on October 22, 1974, for an invention entitled \u201cAmphibious Marsh Craft.\u201d Rivet subsequently granted Louis J. Woodson, whose family owns Kori Corporation, an exclusive license under the \u2019785 patent. Woodson then granted an exclusive sub-license to Kori Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">The \u2019785 patent concerns an improved pontoon-type endless-track amphibious vehicle which will operate in swamps. The patented improvement relates primarily to the vehicle\u2019s ability to carry heavy equipment through obstruction-ridden, tree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>stump-studded swamps. Previously, marsh craft of this type were suited only for hauling equipment through open marshes, frequently broke down, and required the use of huge timber mats (\u201cmatting\u201d) to support earthmovers in order to clear away tree stumps when it was necessary to venture into the swamps. The marsh craft developed by Rivet was structurally stronger and more watertight than earlier marsh craft, and was capable of traversing stump-dotted swampland without matting or preclearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Robert J. Wilson, Sr., learned the design details of the Rivet pontoon when he worked for Rivet during 1974 as a contract welder. After completion of his welding contract with Rivet, Wilson began building Rivet-type pontoons for defendant Wilco Marsh Buggies and Draglines, Inc., a corporation formed and owned by his three sons, defendants-appellants John M. Wilson, Sr., Dean R. Wilson, and Robert J. Wilson, Jr. Wilco bought a Rivet craft, obtained a copy of the \u2019785 patent, and began making and selling a vehicle strikingly similar to the Rivet amphibious marsh craft manufactured by Kori.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Rivet, Woodson, and Kori filed this suit against Wilco and the Wilson brothers, seeking injunctive relief and damages for patent infringement. The district court issued separate decisions on the issues of liability and damages. In its liability decision, the district court held that the \u2019785 patent was valid and infringed, and that the defendants, by actively inducing infringement of the \u2019785 patent, were liable as infringers. 561 F.Supp. at 521-22. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on June 27, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>Decision Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">After its initial decision on liability, the district court issued its separate memorandum opinion on damages on August 30, 1982, deciding four issues: pecuniary damages, prejudgment interest, attorney fees, and exemplary damages. 561 F.Supp. at 523, 217 USPQ at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The district court awarded Kori pecuniary damages of $516,803.30, calculating damages on the basis of profits lost because of defendants\u2019 sales of infringing units for use outside the United States and profits lost on rental of infringing units within the United States. Lost profits were calculated at $379,497, based on defendants\u2019 sale of six machines. The court also determined that lost rental profits amounted to $137,311.30, based on the defendants\u2019 profits for 4850 hours rental at a profit of $28.31 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The district court concluded that prejudgment interest should not be awarded because the record was not clear with regard to the date or dates from which interest should run. However, the court noted that it would consider the fact that plaintiffs should be compensated for the delay in receiving the lost profits owed to them in determining whether to impose exemplary damages. The court also awarded plaintiffs $50,000.00 in attorney fees and $28,-943.51 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Finally, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, the district court doubled the pecuniary damage award to $1,033,616.60. The court found that defendants willfully and deliberately infringed, having copied the essential parts of the amphibious craft, knowing it to be patented, and having no good faith belief that the patent was invalid. The court noted that the defendants willfully copied the invention of the \u2019785 patent without soliciting the advice of counsel, and only sought the advice of a qualified patent attorney after plaintiffs had brought suit to enforce the patent. In determining the amount of exemplary damages, the court considered the fact that the actual pecuniary damages it had calculated were not \u201csufficient to fully compensate plaintiffs,\u201d and included the portion of damages which the court found it had been unable to determine exactly, including prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">In pertinent part, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 provides that \u201cthe court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement but in no event less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>a reasonable royalty for the use of the invention by the infringer____\u201d In <em>Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., </em>377 U.S. 476, 507, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 1543, 12 L.Ed.2d 457, 141 USPQ 681, 694 (1964), the Supreme Court said that a patent holder\u2019s damages</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">have been said to constitute \u201cthe difference between his pecuniary condition after the infringement, and what his condition would have been if the infringement had not occurred.\u201d ... The question to be asked in determining damages is \u201chow much had the Patent Holder and Licensee suffered by the infringement. And that question [is] primarily: had the Infringer not infringed, what would Patent Holder-Licensee have made?\u201d ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0n\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\"><em>See also General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., </em>461 U.S. 648, 103 S.Ct. 2058, 76 L.Ed.2d 211, 217 USPQ 1185 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The district court found that Wilco built at least twelve infringing machines. Kori sought to base damages on the profit derived from Wilco\u2019s sale of six of these machines, as well as profits from Wilco\u2019s rental of other infringing units. Wilco contended that a reasonable royalty was the appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">\n<em>Reasonable Royalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aa3P\">Wilco\u2019s argument that Kori is entitled only to a reasonable royalty is grounded on the assertion, based on the district court\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 8, that Kori Corporation is merely a non-exclusive licensee. Finding of Fact No. 8, in the district court\u2019s liability opinion, reads: \u201cPlaintiff Kori Corporation ... is named as a non-exclusive sub-licensee under the patent in suit.\u201d 561 F.Supp. at 515. However, counsel for Wil-co stipulated to the fact that Kori Corporation was an \u201cexclusive sub-licensee\u201d in a pre-trial order. Moreover, in its damages opinion, the district court indicated that Rivet had granted an \u201cexclusive license to Louis Woodson and Kori Corporation.\u201d 561 F.Supp. at 524, 217 USPQ at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The record before this court on appeal includes all original papers filed in the district court, including pre-trial orders. Fed.R.App.P. 10(a), United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Rule 11. The district court\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 8, that Kori is a \u201cnon-exclusive sub-licensee,\u201d is either a \u201cslip of the pen\u201d or is clearly erroneous. Wilco\u2019s argument that a reasonable royalty is the proper measure of damages is therefore based on an erroneous assumption. Kori is entitled to be compensated on the basis of its ability to exploit the patent. <em>See Bio-Rad Laboratories v. Nicolet Instrument Corp., </em>739 F.2d 604, 616, 222 USPQ 654, 663 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">\n<em>Lost Profits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">When a patent holder would have made the sale of a product \u201cbut for\u201d the infringement, the award of his lost profits is proper. <em>Paper Converting Machine Co. v. Magna Graphics Corp., </em>745 F.2d 11, 21, 223 USPQ 591, 598 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Bio-Rad, </em>739 F.2d at 616, 222 USPQ at 663. Moreover, when the parties involved in an action are the only suppliers in the market, lost profits are a particularly appropriate measure of damages. <em>Lam, Inc. v. JohnsManville Corp., </em>718 F.2d 1056, 1065, 1068, 219 USPQ 670, 675, 678 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">The district court found that Kori would have sold or rented the machines built by Wilco were it not for Wilco\u2019s infringement. Although Wilco argued that there were non-infringing substitutes available, the district court\u2019s conclusion was based on findings that Wilco \u201cdirectly competed\u201d for the sale of these machines with Kori, and that \u201cfrom a buyer\u2019s perspective, the only acceptable substitute for the patented Kori machines were the infringing machines.\u201d 561 F.Supp. at 526, 217 USPQ at 1306. The court therefore properly awarded damages based on Kori\u2019s lost profits for the infringing sales and rentals of Wilco\u2019s machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">In proving damages, the patent owner\u2019s burden of proof is not absolute, but rather one of reasonable probability. <em>Lam, Inc. v. Johns-Manville, </em>718 F.2d at 1065, 219 USPQ at 675. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>is free to use its discretion in choosing a method for calculating damages, as long as the measure of damages is just and reasonable. <em>Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Co., </em>282 U.S. 555, 563, 51 S.Ct. 248, 250, 75 L.Ed. 544 (1931); <em>Paper Converting, </em>745 F.2d at 22, 223 USPQ at 599; <em>Lam, Inc. v. Johns-Manville, </em>718 F.2d at 1065, 219 USPQ at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The district court accepted Kori\u2019s expert\u2019s calculations of Wilco\u2019s profits of $379,497 on the six infringing machines. The court also awarded Kori its lost profits of $137,311.30 calculated on the basis of Wilco\u2019s rental of infringing machines. Wil-co does not dispute these figures, but instead challenges the propriety of using its (Wilco\u2019s) profits to estimate Kori\u2019s lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The district court found evidence of Wil-eo\u2019s profits to be a reasonable estimate of the profits Kori would have earned had it made the sales. <em>Kori, </em>561 F.Supp. at 528, 217 USPQ at 1307-08. <em>See also </em>561 F.Supp. at 530, 217 USPQ at 1309. Wilco asserts that this finding amounted to an award of their (Wilco\u2019s) profits <em>per se. </em>Kori contends, however, that the district court used Wilco\u2019s profits only as a \u201cyardstick\u201d to measure Kori\u2019s lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Prior to 1946, the patent laws provided for recovery of both the patentee\u2019s damages and the infringer\u2019s profits. R.S. 4921 provided that \u201cthe \u2022 complainant shall be entitled to recover, <em>in addition </em>to the profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the damages the complainant has sustained thereby ...\u201d (emphasis added). This arguably implied that the successful plaintiff would have been placed in a better position than he would have been if the infringer had not infringed because, in addition to being able to recover his own damages (thereby placing him in the position he would have been without the infringement), the old statute allowed the patentee to force the infringer to \u201cdisgorge\u201d any profits the defendant may have earned as well. The 1946 amendment to the damages provisions effectively eliminated this double recovery. After the 1946 amendment (Act of August 1, 1946, ch. 726, 60 Stat. 778, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 70), R.S. 4921 provided that \u201cthe complainant shall be entitled to recover general damages which shall be due compensation for making, using, or selling the invention, not less than a reasonable royalty therefor____\u201d However, the omission of the language providing for recovery of the infringer\u2019s profits should not be construed to mean that an infringer\u2019s profits cannot be considered in estimating plaintiff\u2019s damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The legislative history of the 1946 amendments clearly indicates that one of its purposes was to eliminate the necessity of the traditional accounting to determine the infringer\u2019s profits in all damages determinations, and to deter the use of such proceedings by successful patentees to harass the infringer. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1587, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946), adopted as the report of the Senate Committee on Patents, S.Rep. No. 1503, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946), at 2; <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Congressional Service (1946) at 1386-87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">The object of the bill is to make the basis of recovery in patent-infringement suits general damages, that is, any damages the complainant can prove, not less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest from the time infringement occurred, rather than profits and damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">Although the bill would not preclude the recovery of profits as an element of damages, yet by making it unnecessary to have proceedings before masters and empowering equity courts to assess general damages irrespective of profits, the measure represents legislation which in the judgment of the committee is long overdue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>However, evidence of an infringer\u2019s profits may be relevant to the amount of patentee\u2019s damages in certain circumstances. Here, where the patentee can establish that he would have made the sales of the patented products, but for the fact that the infringer made them, the infringer\u2019s profits were properly looked at for comparison purposes with the patentee\u2019s proof of his lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">By the Patent Act of 1952, the former provisions of R.S. 4919 and 4921 relating to damages were combined in \u00a7 284. <em>See </em>the Reviser\u2019s Note reproduced in 35 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 284 and P.J. Federico\u2019s \u201cCommentary on the New Patent Act\u201d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>Aro, </em>supra, the Supreme Court cited three cases in support of its statement that \u201cit is clear that under the present statute only damages are recoverable.\u201d 377 U.S. at 506, 84 S.Ct. at 1542, 141 USPQ at 694. In the first case, <em>Ric-Wil Co. v. E.B. Kaiser Co., </em>179 F.2d 401, 407, 84 USPQ 121, 126-27 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 U.S. 958, 70 S.Ct. 981, 94 L.Ed. 1369, 85 USPQ 526 (1950), the Seventh Circuit noted that \u201cprofits realized by an infringer are not recoverable as such.\u201d However, said the court: \u201c \u2018General damages\u2019 is a broad term which no doubt may include numerous elements depending upon the circumstances of the case. And whether an infringer\u2019s profits is an element of such damages depends upon the facts of each individual case.\u201d In the second case cited by the Court, <em>Livesay Window Co. v. Livesay Industries, Inc., </em>251 F.2d 469, 472, 116 USPQ 167, 169 (5th Cir.1958), the Fifth Circuit said: \u201cProfits, as such, are not recovered____ The profit is but the true measure of that which infringement has taken from the patent owner____\u201d The master in the <em>Livesay </em>case calculated damages by ascertaining the total dollar sales of the infringer, multiplying that by licensee-claimant\u2019s profit rates, and then adding a 6 percent royalty which the licensee was paying the patentee. Defendant-infringer\u2019s contention that the award should have been limited to a reasonable royalty was rejected. Similarly, in the third case cited, <em>Laskowitz v. Marie Designer, Inc., </em>119 F.Supp. 541, 555, 100 USPQ 367, 376 (S.D.Cal.1954), the district court conceded that \u201c[t]he profits of the infringer may be the measure, when no other is adequate. ... In ascertaining damages, the object has always been to approximate, as nearly as possible, the <em>actual loss </em>suffered by the patentee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Thus, although the Court in <em>Aro </em>said that only \u201cdamages\u201d are recoverable under the patent statute, the legislative history of the 1946 amendments and the cases cited in <em>Aro </em>show that, under proper circumstances, an infringer\u2019s profits may be considered in establishing a patent holder\u2019s general damages, that is, \u201cdamages adequate to compensate for the infringement.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">In the present case, the district court considered evidence submitted by Kori which indicated that Kori\u2019s percentage gain on the sale and rental of infringing units would have been substantially similar to Wilco\u2019s percentage gain, and also considered evidence that Kori would have had lower overhead expenses. Rather than increase its estimate of Kori\u2019s lost profits based on Kori\u2019s possibly lower overhead expenses, the court found in Wilco\u2019s profit margin a reasonable approximation of Kori\u2019s lost profits. Thus, although Kori is not entitled to an award of Wilco\u2019s profits <em>per se, </em>the district court did not err in this case in using Wilco\u2019s profits to estimate Kori\u2019s lost profits. Wilco is not entitled to any higher level of certainty in calculation of Kori\u2019s lost profits. Fundamental principles of justice require us to throw any risk of uncertainty upon the wrongdoer rather than upon the injured party. <em>Story Parchment, </em>282 U.S. at 563, 51 S.Ct. at 250. Considering that the court did not use its full discretionary authority in increasing the amount of the damage award, we conclude that the court\u2019s overall determination was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">Finally, Wilco contends that the district court erred in calculating damages based on the entire cost of the amphibious marsh craft, rather than on the portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the machines that includes the patented pontoon structure. The district court applied the \u201centire market value rule\u201d and declined to apportion the damages between the value of the unpatented and patented features of the machines sold and rented. In <em>Paper Converting, </em>this court explained the \u201centire market value rule\u201d as allowing \u201cthe recovery of damages based on the value of an entire apparatus containing several features, even though only one feature is patented.\u201d 745 F.2d at 22, 223 USPQ at 599. The United States Court of Claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated that under the \u201centire market value rule\u201d it is the \u201cfinancial and marketing dependence on the patented item under standard marketing procedures\u201d which determines whether the non-patented features of a machine should be included in calculating compensation for infringement. <em>Leesona Corp. v. United States, </em>599 F.2d 958, 974, 220 Ct.Cl. 234, 202 USPQ 424, 439 (1979). The ultimate determining factor is whether the patentee or its licensee can normally anticipate the sale of the unpa-tented components together with the patented components. <em>Paper Converting, </em>745 F.2d at 23, 223 USPQ at 599; <em>Tektronix, Inc. v. United States, </em>552 F.2d 343, 351, 213 Ct.Cl. 257, 193 USPQ 385, 393 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The district court found \u201cno evidence that the unpatented heavy uppers [of the amphibious marsh craft] have been or could be used independently of the patented pontoon structure.\u201d 561 F.Supp. at 530, 217 USPQ at 1309. Kori would therefore have normally anticipated the sale of an entire machine, including both the patented and unpatented components. Accordingly, the district court properly awarded damages based on the entire market value of the infringing machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>Exemplary Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7T\">In pertinent part, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 provides: \u201c[T]he court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed.\u201d The district court determined that defendants\u2019 infringement was willful and doubled its award of pecuniary damages to $1,033,616.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">A finding of willful infringement is a finding of fact. Our review, therefore, is limited to deciding whether that finding is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Central Soya Co. v. Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., </em>723 F.2d 1573, 1577, 220 USPQ 490, 493 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Underwater Devices, Inc. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., </em>717 F.2d 1380, 1389, 219 USPQ 569, 576 (Fed.Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The finding of willful infringement in this case was based on defendants\u2019 failure \u201cto establish good faith reliance upon an authoritative opinion of invalidity\u201d from counsel before beginning to manufacture the infringing units. 561 F.Supp. at 533, 217 USPQ at 1311. Wilco argues that a letter sent to Marine Contractors Company, a potential customer, by their original defense counsel in this infringement suit constitutes \u201cconfirmation by counsel of the invalidity of the [\u2019785] patent prior to the infringing sales and rentals for which plaintiff seeks damages.\u201d The letter was written after this infringement suit was commenced by Kori, recounts that Wilco has challenged the validity of Kori\u2019s patent in the litigation, and included a statement by Wilco\u2019s counsel that says \u201cI have every reason to believe that the validity of the aforesaid patent cannot be maintained and that it will be declared to be null and void by the court handling the litigation.\u201d Such a conclusory account of defense counsel\u2019s aspirations for winning an infringement suit without any supporting reasons does not amount to an \u201cauthoritative opinion\u201d upon which a good faith reliance on invalidity may be founded. <em>Central Soya, </em>723 F.2d at 1577, 220 USPQ at 492. The district court considered this evidence and concluded that Wilco had willfully infringed, with no good faith belief that the patent was invalid. Wilco has failed to show that the district court\u2019s finding of willful in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>fringement was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, it did not abuse its discretion in doubling the pecuniary damage award as exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>Attorney Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cThe court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. Having found this to be a case of willful infringement, the district court\u2019s discretionary award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $78,943.51 was proper. No showing has been made that the award was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\n<em>Liability of Individual Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Wilco appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to dismiss the case against the individual defendants. In a memorandum opinion denying the motion, the court held the individual defendants jointly liable for damages with the corporate defendant for inducing infringement. <em>See also </em>the district court\u2019s published liability opinion, 561 F.Supp. at 522 (Conclusion of Law No. 23). The court relied on the Fifth Circuit decision in <em>Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. Baby\u2019s Formula Service, Inc., </em>402 F.2d 19, 23, 159 USPQ 328, 331 (5th Cir.1968), holding the individual defendants liable because they controlled and directed the acts of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The district court\u2019s decision denying Wilco\u2019s motion to dismiss was part of its original decision on liability. The Fifth Circuit has already affirmed the district court\u2019s liability decision in all respects. 708 F.2d at 156, 219 USPQ at 289. Issues decided at an earlier stage of litigation, either explicitly or by necessary inference from the disposition, constitute the law of the case. <em>See </em>1 J. MOORE, FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00b6 0.404[1], n. 15 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The law of the case doctrine is that courts should generally \u201crefuse to reopen what has been decided.\u201d <em>Messenger v. Anderson, </em>225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S.Ct. 739, 740, 56 L.Ed. 1152 (1912). The doctrine precludes our reconsideration of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s liability decision unless one of three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exists: the evidence in a subsequent trial was substantially different; controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to such issues; or the decision was clearly erroneous, and would work a substantial injustice. <em>Central Soya, </em>723 F.2d at 1580, 220 USPQ at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Wilco has presented no evidence that any of the three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exists in this case. The decision of the Fifth Circuit holding the individual defendants liable therefore stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">The decision of the district court on the accounting is in all respects <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-14\">. The F.Supp. report cited includes both the findings of fact and conclusions of law on both liability and damages and the memorandum opinion on damages only.

Triplex Co., </em>298 U.S. 448, 451, 56 S.Ct. 792, 793, 80 L.Ed. 1274, 29 USPQ 306, 308 (1936), where the Court also said, \u201cwhat the infringer makes is profits.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">.
