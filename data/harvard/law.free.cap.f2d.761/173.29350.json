(Joe) Burford, Inc. (\u201cBurford\u201d), a West Virginia mining corporation, delinquent reclamation fees and prejudgment interest on those fees pursuant to section 402 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the \u201cAct\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government for reclamation fees but refused to award the prejudgment interest imposed by the applicable regulation. The government appeals, arguing that the refusal to award prejudgment interest constitutes reversible error under the facts of this case. We agree and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 <em>et seq., </em>was enacted by the 95th Congress and signed into law on August 3, 1977. The purpose of the Act is to \u201cestablish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1202(a). In furtherance of this objective, the Act establishes an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund administered by the Secretary of the Interior and funded by reclamation fees imposed on coal mining operators. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231. Monies accumulated in the fund are earmarked for several projects, including the \u201creclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by past coal mining ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1231(c)(1). The reclamation fees are calculated on a per-ton of coal produced basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(a), and these fees \u201cshall be paid no later than thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1232(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The Secretary of the Interior has been given broad authority to promulgate rules and regulations required to implement and administer the provisions of the Act. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1242(a). One of these regulations, at issue here, is 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d). That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">The reclamation fee payment for each calendar quarter shall be paid no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter. Delinquent payments are subject to interest at the rate of 1 percent per month, or any part thereof, on any amount due ... [Interest shall begin in [sic] accrue on the 31st day following the end of the calendar quarter and will run until the date of payment, or until judgment is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action to compel payment of debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The purpose of the regulation is to provide \u201ca financial inducement for operators to comply with the statutory requirement to make timely payments of reclamation fees.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 7305 (Feb. 21, 1978). The procedure for fee collection has been amended numerous times, but the requirement of interest on late payments has always been included. This regulation, in its various forms, has never been challenged in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Burford is a West Virginia corporation which conducts surface coal mining operations in Randolph County, West Virginia. In 1982, the government filed a collection action against Burford, alleging a failure to pay the appropriate reclamation fees required by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(b). The government\u2019s complaint requested the reclamation fees plus prejudgment interest at the rate prescribed in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d). At the time the suit was instituted, the accumulated interest amounted to approximately one-half the fees due.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">In 1984, the government moved for, and the district court granted, summary judgment on the uncontested grounds that Bur-ford was a coal operator during the specified calendar quarters, that it produced and sold coal, and that the reclamation fees due had not been paid. The district court\u2019s judgment did not, however, award the government the prejudgment interest due pursuant to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d). Instead, recovery was limited to reclamation fees and \u201cpost judgment statutory interest calculated as is provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 ...\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government immediately filed a motion to amend the judgment to include the prejudgment interest. Two days later, the district court denied the motion and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(e) provides that \u201cAny portion of the reclamation fee not properly or promptly paid pursuant to this section shall be recoverable, with <em>statutory </em>interest, from coal mine operators, in any court of competent jurisdiction [sic] any action at law to compel payment of debts.\u201d (Emphasis added by court). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 makes no provision for prejudgment interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">We note at the outset that the validity of regulation 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d) has not been challenged by Burford either in the court below or in this Court. This concession makes it unnecessary to decide the government\u2019s jurisdictional argument. <em>Compare Commonwealth of Virginia v. Watt, </em>741 F.2d 37 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 379, 83 L.Ed.2d 315 (1984), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 983, 83 L.Ed.2d 984 (1985), <em>with Holmes Limestone Co. v. Andrus, </em>655 F.2d 732 (6th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 995, 102 S.Ct. 2280, 72 L.Ed.2d 1292 (1982). We therefore take a different approach in deciding this case. In our view, the district court misconstrued the refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ence to \u201cstatutory interest\u201d in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(e) by limiting the government to the post judgment interest available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. The lower court\u2019s construction ignores the broad authority given to the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations to implement the collection provisions of the Act. Moreover, refusal to award prejudgment interest on delinquent reclamation fees jeopardizes the Congressional program to revitalize abandoned mine land by restricting the Secretary\u2019s ability to assure timely collection of reclamation fees. The regulation in question, 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d), was duly promulgated and has the force of law. It has not been contested. We think it was error not to enforce its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons we reverse the decision of the district court and we remand this matter with instructions to award the government the appropriate interest, including prejudgment interest pursuant to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"ai-dedup-0\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\">.
