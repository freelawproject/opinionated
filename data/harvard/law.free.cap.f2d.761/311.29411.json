The District Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint because it found that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead facts establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction. The court ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to plead actual notice as required to establish jurisdiction over their citizen suit claims under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 <em>et seq. </em>and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 <em>et seq., </em>and that they could not bring suit under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 <em>et seq., </em>because that Act did not create a private cause of action. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm but remand with leave to amend on the notice issues, and reverse and remand on the private cause of action question.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The plaintiffs alleged that the environment near Bumpass Cove had been contaminated, including the water they used for drinking and household purposes, and that their health and property were threatened with serious danger as a result of the storage, use and disposal of toxic waste at the Bumpass Cove Landfill. The landfill was leased and operated by defendant Waste Resources Corporation of Tennessee. Bumpass Cove Development owned the landfill site until 1979, and the site is currently owned by defendants McDonald, Phillips and Witherspoon, who were also stockholders in Bumpass Cove Development. The defendants also include a large number of corporations which contracted to dispose of their hazardous waste at Bum-pass Cove.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Plaintiffs brought a class action on behalf of essentially everyone residing or doing business near the Bumpass Cove landfill, alleging economic damage and damage to health and safety and seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive and other equitable relief on a variety of state and federal theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b), the District Court referred the motion to a Magistrate, and the court on March 20, 1984, affirmed and adopted the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation dismissing the five federal counts in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and also dismissing the remaining state law counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Counts one and three of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seek damages under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 <em>et seq., </em>and Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 <em>et seq. </em>The complaint apparently attempts to aver that plaintiffs have an implied private right for damages under these statutes, since it is alleged that the plaintiffs belong to the class protected by the statutes. See Appendix at 36, 38. The magistrate dismissed these counts, holding that under <em>Middlesex City Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers, </em>453 U.S. 1, 15, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2623, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981), the citizen suit provisions of RCRA and FWPCA are the exclusive jurisdictional avenues for private plaintiffs and have eliminated all other implied rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Counts two and four of the complaint ask the court to enforce the provisions of RCRA and FWPCA and base jurisdiction squarely on the respective citizen suit provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972 and 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365. The magistrate agreed that the injunctive relief requested in these counts was authorized by the citizen suit statutes, but dismissed the counts because he found that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the statutory notice requirements. The magistrate reasoned that <em>Middlesex </em>had implicitly ruled that the sixty day notice provisions in citizen suit statutes are jurisdictional prerequisites because <em>Middlesex </em>clearly stated that there was no general federal jurisdiction outside these provisions and left intact a lower court ruling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>sixty day notice provision was jurisdictional. See Appendix, 63. He also found that constructive notice did not comply with the statute. Plaintiffs had alleged in counts two and four that \u201cthe administrator of the EPA, the state of Tennessee and defendants have been on notice of defendants\u2019 alleged violations of the Act for a. period of time exceeding 60 days, so that further notice would be meaningless,\u201d Appendix 37, 39, and stated generally that as a result of \u201cinformation supplied by employees and land contractors, governmental publications and proceedings, ... and complaints from private parties ... defendants have long been aware of problems caused by the migration of hazardous materials from Waste Resources land.\u201d Appendix, 34. The magistrate found that the purpose of the notice provisions is to give state and federal agencies a chance to investigate and act, and that the constructive notice alleged by the plaintiffs suffices only when there is an allegation that an attempt to secure administrative enforcement would have been futile. Finding that no such allegation had been made, he dismissed counts two and four. Appendix, 64-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The final federal count seeks relief under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 <em>et seq. </em>The plaintiffs alleged that they had \u201cincurred necessary response costs and taken necessary abatement action consistent with the national contingency plan as a result of defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct for which costs plaintiffs are entitled to reimbursement from the defendants.\u201d Appendix, 52-53. In dismissing this count, the magistrate reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">There is no citizens\u2019 suit provision under CERCLA. Apparently, such actions are to be brought pursuant to other citizen suit provisions such as those found in the FWPCA and RCRA. The undersigned is of the opinion that Congress did not intend to create a private right of action under CERCLA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Appendix, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">In summarily affirming the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, District Judge Thomas Hull merely noted that \u201cplaintiffs have not shown that they gave any of the alleged violators in this case notice as required by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b).\u201d Appendix, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">The RCRA and FWPCA citizen suit provisions provide that \u201cany citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf \u2014 (1) against any person ... who is alleged to be in violation\u201d of any permit, regulation, standard or order issued under the authority of the respective Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This liberal grant of standing to sue, however, is limited by subsequent provisions which restrict the type of relief available to injunctive and other equitable remedies. The RCRA and FWPCA provisions on relief provide, respectively, that the \u201cdistrict court shall have jurisdiction ... to enforce\u201d any order or regulation of the Administration, \u201cor to order the Administrator to perform such act or duty as the case may be,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972(a) (RCRA), and that \u201cThe District Courts shall have jurisdiction, ... to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>force ... an effluent standard or limitation, or such an order, or to order the Administrator to perform such act or duty, as the case may be, and to apply any appropriate civil penalties under section 1319(d) of this title.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a) (FWPCA). In <em>Middlesex City Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers, </em>453 U.S. 1, 18, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2625, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981), the Court found that Congress intended that private remedies in addition to those expressly provided in the FWPCA citizen suit statute should not be implied. The Court consequently refused to imply a private action for damages under FWPCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Under <em>Middlesex, </em>the District Court was clearly correct in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 counts for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972(a) and 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a), since neither of these provisions expressly permits a private action for damages. The District Court was also correct in conceding that injunctive relief is authorized by these statutes. <em>See Environmental Defense Fund v. Lamphier, </em>714 F.2d 331, 337 (4th Cir.1983). Moreover, the FWPCA citizen suit provision plainly allows private plaintiffs to seek the imposition of civil penalties where authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Although the RCRA and FWPCA citizen suit statutes allow private suits for injunc-tive relief, they also contain virtually identical notice provisions which limit the role of the private citizen suit by foreclosing private suit until the EPA has had an opportunity to act first. The FWCPA notice provision, for example, states in pertinent part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">No action may be commenced\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">(1) Under subsection (a)(1) of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">(A) prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation (i) to the Administrator, (ii) to the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and (iii) to any alleged violator of the standard, limitation, or or-der____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aaxl\">The District Court held that these provisions were jurisdictional in nature, affecting its power to adjudicate the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and accordingly dismissed the citizen suit counts because plaintiffs alleged only constructive notice and not the formal notice required by these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">We agree with the District Court in holding that compliance with the sixty day notice requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing suit against private defendants under the citizen suit provisions of RCRA and FWPCA. First, logical construction of the statute indicates that \u201cthe notice requirement is not a mere technical wrinkle of statutory drafting or formality to be waived by the federal courts.\u201d <em>Ada-Cascade Watch Co. v. Cascade Resource Recovery, </em>720 F.2d 897, 908 (6th Cir.1983) (Merritt, J., dissenting). The statutory language is clear in stating that <em>\u201c[N]o action may be commenced under subsection (a)(1) </em>of this section ... prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Both the RCRA and FWPCA citizen suit statutes contain a sole, explicit exception to the notice requirement which authorizes an action against the EPA Administrator immediately after notice is given when certain kinds of violations are alleged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>other instances, plaintiffs invoking these citizen suit provisions \u201cmust comply with specified procedures ..including \u201c60 days prior notice to potential defendants.\u201d <em>Middlesex, </em>453 U.S. at 14, 101 S.Ct. at 2623.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In addition, the legislative history shows that far from being a mere formality, prior notice was viewed by Congress as crucial in defining the proper role of the citizen suit. The citizen suit notice provisions were intended to give the EPA an opportunity to resolve issues regarding the interpretation of complex environmental standards by negotiation, unhindered by the threat of an impending private lawsuit. In reporting on the FWPCA notice provision, the Senate Committee on Public Works explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">In order to further encourage and provide for agency enforcement, the Committee has added a requirement that pri- or to filing a petition with the court, a citizen or group of citizens would first have to serve notice of intent to file such action on the Federal and State water pollution control agency and the alleged polluter____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">The Committee has provided a period of time after notice before a citizen may file an action against an alleged violator. The time between notice and filing of the action should give the administrative enforcement office an opportunity to act on the alleged violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">S. Rep. No. 92-414, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 81 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3668, 3745. (See also 1976 Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6238, 6307, where the RCRA notice provision is described as absolutely prohibiting suit under section (a)(1) prior to the expiration of the sixty day notice period.) Congress evidently believed that the filing of a private lawsuit hardens bargaining positions and leaves the Administrator with less room to maneuver, and that the private lawsuit should be a supplemental enforcement tool, rather than a substitute for agency enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In facilitating dispute resolution by EPA negotiation, these notice provisions reduce the volume of costly private litigation and allow the EPA to develop uniform interpretations of complex environmental standards. <em>Ada-Cascade Watch Co., </em>720 F.2d at 908-09 (Merritt, J., dissenting). <em>See also </em>Mashaw, Private Enforcement of Public Regulatory Provisions: The \u201cCitizen Suit,\u201d 4 Class Action Rep. 29 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Plaintiffs contend that although they did not allege actual notice, they did allege that constructive notice existed for the required sixty day period, and that these allegations of constructive notice meet the notice requirements under the citizen suit statutes and establish subject matter jurisdiction over their suit. However, it is well established that the plaintiff has the burden of distinctly and affirmatively pleading the facts forming the basis of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>298 U.S. 178, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936); C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1206, 78 (1969). Mere allegations that the state of Tennessee, the EPA and the private defendants have been on notice for a period of time exceeding sixty days, and that \u201cfurther notice would be meaningless\u201d fail to sufficiently set forth the jurisdictional predicate of actual notice. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege actual notice. Our decision is without prejudice to any request plaintiff may make to file an amended complaint respecting notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The District Court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 count seeking recovery of their \u201cresponse costs\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a) of CERCLA. The court adopted the magistrate\u2019s reasoning that the fact that CERCLA does not contain a citizen suit provision like those in RCRA and FWPCA indicates that Congress did not intend to create a private right of action under CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">The court\u2019s holding is inconsistent with the literal statutory language of section 9607(a) and is at odds with congressional intent in enacting CERCLA. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>9607(a)(4) provides in pertinent part that owners of waste sites and other responsible parties under section 9607(a) \u201cshall be liable for \u2014 (A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State not inconsistent with the national cotingency plan; (B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> District Court decisions have been virtually unanimous in holding that section 9607(a)(4)(B) creates a private right of action against section 9607(a) responsible parties for the recovery of \u201cnecessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the National Contingency Plan.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bulk Distribution Centers, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., </em>589 F.Supp. 1437, 1442-44 (S.D.Fla. 1984); <em>Jones v. Inmont Corp., </em>584 F.Supp. 1425, 1428 (S.D.Ohio 1984); <em>City of Philadelphia v. Stepan Chemical Company, </em>544 F.Supp. 1135 (E.D.Pa.1982); <em>Pinole Point Properties, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>596 F.Supp. 283, 293 (N.D.Cal.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Although the legislative history of CERCLA is vague, reflecting the compromise nature of the legislation eventually enacted,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is clear that the statute was designed primarily to facilitate the prompt cleanup of hazardous waste sites by placing the ultimate financial responsibility for cleanup on those responsible for the hazardous wastes. <em>Stepan Chemical, </em>544 F.Supp. at 1143. Allowing a private action to recover response costs from responsible parties under section 9607(a)(4)(B) is thus consistent with both the language of section 9607(a)(4)(B) and with the congressional purpose underlying CERCLA as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The District Court therefore erred in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 CERCLA count on the ground that section 9607(a)(4)(B) does not create a private right of action to recover response costs. To the extent that the District Court held that 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b), the FWPCA notice provision, applied to CERCLA actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a), this too was error. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 CERCLA count and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We note only that the District Court did not decide, and we ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>press no opinion, as to whether the notice provision in section 9612(a) applies to private response cost recovery actions under section 9607, and whether the plaintiffs have alleged response costs that are \u201cconsistent with the National Contingency Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In summary, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 FWCPA and RCRA counts with leave to amend, and reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 CERCLA count and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-5\">.
