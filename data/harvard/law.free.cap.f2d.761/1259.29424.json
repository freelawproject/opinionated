Saballo-Cortez (Saballo-Cor-tez) appeals from the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his application for withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) and for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">Issues On Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">Saballo-Cortez raises the following issues in his brief filed with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">One. The immigration judge and the BIA should have applied the burden of proof set forth in <em>Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d 401 (2d Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d, INS v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-16\">Two. The denial of his application was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-17\">Three. The immigration judge violated his right to counsel, due process and equal protection by failing to inform counsel that he had taken possession of a copy of an arrest warrant and had requested a police and security check from the American Embassy in Managua.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-20\">A. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-21\">Saballo-Cortez argued in his brief that the immigration judge and the BIA should have applied the standard of proof adopted in <em>Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d 401 (2d Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d, INS v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984), in reviewing his \u201csubjective evidence\u201d of a well-founded fear of persecution. In <em>Stevic, </em>the petitioner filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings based on a claim of persecution under section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). The BIA denied the motion on the ground that Stevic had failed to present a claim containing a prima facie showing of \u201ca clear probability of persecution directed at the individual respondent.\u201d Ste<em>vic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d at 403-04. The court of appeals in <em>Stevic </em>reversed the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion holding that it was based on a legal test which was no longer the law. <em>Id. </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-26\">After the briefs were filed in the present matter, the Supreme Court issued its opinion reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Stevic v. Sava. INS v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). The Court held that \u201can alien must establish a clear probability of persecution to avoid deportation under \u00a7 243(h)\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2492. The Court concluded that the clear probability standard \u201crequires that an application be supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2501. Thus, Saballo-Cortez\u2019s contention that the immigration judge and the BIA were required to follow <em>Stevic v. Sava </em>is no longer tenable with respect to his application for withholding of deportation in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s express holding in <em>INS v. Stevic. </em>To the extent that the clear probability of persecution test was applied in this matter to the application for withholding of deportation, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-29\">B. <em>The Standard of Proof For Asylum Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-30\">The Supreme Court declined to decide the meaning of the phrase \u201cwell-found<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>ed fear of persecution\u201d which is made applicable by the terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act and regulations to requests for discretionary asylum since that issue was not presented in <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2501. Because the instant case turns on whether Saballo-Cortez met his burden of persuading the immigration judge and the BIA that his testimony was credible, we need not determine the proper standard of proof necessary to make a prima facie showing of a well-founded fear of persecution under Saballo-Cortez\u2019s claim for asylum. We note that the BIA found that Saballo-Cortez failed to meet his burden of proof \u201cwhether his claim is assessed in terms of whether he has demonstrated \u2018clear probability,\u2019 \u2018good reason,\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood\u2019 of persecution.\u201d Thus, we cannot say on this record that the BIA improperly applied the clear probability of persecution standard, as claimed by Saballo-Cortez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">C. <em>Did Saballo-Cortez Meet His Burden of Persuasion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">A petitioner seeking withholding of deportation and asylum must first present sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case that there is a clear probability of persecution as to his 1253(h) claim and a well-founded fear of persecution under the discretionary 1158(a) claim. Secondly, he must persuade the immigration judge and the BIA that his evidence is credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">The immigration judge and the BIA were not persuaded that Saballo-Cortez was a credible witness. We must decide if that finding was substantially supported by the evidence in the record. <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 1312, 1316-1317 (9th Cir. 1981). If the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the testimony was not credible, then Saballo-Cortez has failed to present substantial evidence to compel a mandatory withholding of deportation. Where the facts presented are not credible, it is also not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">D. <em>Pertinent Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">The immigration judge and the BIA made their determination that Saballo-Cortez\u2019s testimony was not truthful based on a review of the facts set forth in his application and his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">1. The Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-14\">In a sworn application, signed under penalty of perjury, Saballo-Cortez recited the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-15\">1. He was a 25 year old native and citizen of Nicaragua.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-16\">2. He was employed at the Embotella-dora Melca, Nicaragua until December, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-17\">3. He arrived in San Ysidro, California, on December 2, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-18\">4. He was issued a passport in Nicaragua in October, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-19\">5. He was issued a Tourist Visa from Mexico in November, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-20\">6. He did not apply for a United States Tourist Visa because he did not believe he was eligible to apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-21\">7. Because of the \u201cSandinista Rule\u201d in Nicaragua, he would be \u201chighly susceptible to persecution and/or execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-22\">8. By departing from Nicaragua, he has expressed a political view adverse to the Sandinista Rule by refusing to live under their government\u2019s control, thus \u201crendering me [subject] to persecution and/or execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-23\">9. The fact that he has sought asylum would make him \u201ca prime target for persecution\u201d because he presents a great threat to their political control in Nicaragua.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-24\">10. Neither he nor any member of his immediate family has been \u201cmistreated\u201d by the authorities in Nicaragua because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>11. He traveled through Honduras, El Savador, Guatemala, and Mexico after leaving Nicaragua, but \u201chad no meaningful stay in any country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-5\">12. He was deprived of his right to buy food by the Comit\u00e9 Defensa Sandinista because he refused to serve as a guard in Managua, Nicaragua.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">When shown his sworn application at the hearing during cross-examination, Saballo-Cortez replied that he could not read English. The application is in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">When asked if the application was accurate in stating that he passed through Honduras, El Savador, and Guatemala, Saballo-Cortez replied that there were mistakes in the answers set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">2. Saballo-Cortez\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">On direct examination, Saballo-Cortez testified as follows. He does not wish to return to Nicaragua because \u201cover there I feel I am persecuted by the Sandinista army.\u201d They have threatened him \u201cmany times.\u201d \u201cThey have taken my rights away from me to work in my country\u201d because he did not want to serve in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">When asked to describe the threats, Sa-ballo-Cortez replied that he was threatened \u201cabout two times.\u201d In January, 1982 he was threatened by a man whose name he did not know, but his nickname is \u201cCay-pal.\u201d He claimed that Caypal \u201ctook over the security of the state.\u201d Caypal told him that he would be found dead in a field with his eyes \u201cfull of ants\u201d because of his refusal to serve in the military or join the neighborhood of Sandinistas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">In October of 1982, he was threatened again by the same man with \u201cthe same threat\u201d because of his failure to serve in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">He was also recruited to join the military by other men who would come in the day or at midnight to get him to sign some papers. The men came to his house five times. As a result, Saballo-Cortez went to sleep somewhere else. He could only identify one of the recruiters as \u201cCarlos\u201d. Military service is compulsory in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-13\">He testified that he was recruited to join the Comite for the defense of Sandinistas (CDS) because he worked for Coca-Cola in the \u201cdepartment of propaganda.\u201d Because of his refusal to serve in the CDS, he did not receive a food card which would have entitled him to pay less for his food. He was also denied a \u201cpermit of my license for my work.\u201d The refusal denied him the right to work in his country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-14\">He was also \u201cdenounced\u201d for \u201ccontraband of arms\u201d in the middle of 1981 and detained for three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">On cross-examination, Saballo-Cortez testified that he was issued a passport by the present Sandinista government on September 30, 1982. He experienced no problem in obtaining a passport. It took only one week to process his passport application. He also received an exit visa on September 30, 1982, through a travel agent without experiencing any trouble. He received a second exit visa on November 17, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">3. Inconsistencies In The Record</p>\n<p id=\"Ant\">A comparison of the sworn facts in the application for asylum with Saballo-Cor-tez\u2019s testimony, reveals the following inconsistencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-16\">1. While he testified that he was not permitted to work because he refused to serve in the military or the CDS, his application shows that his employment at a bottling company continued until December, 1982, when he left Nicaragua.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-17\">2. His application states he was deprived of the right to buy food by the CDS, but his testimony reveals that he could purchase food although he had to pay a higher price than CDS members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-18\">3. His application states that by departing from Nicaragua, he was expressing a political view against living in his country with the Sandinista\u2019s which would subject him to persecution or execution, and yet his testimony, after being shown his passport, revealed that the present government gave him his passport and exit visa, without trouble, with full knowledge of his intention to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-19\">The immigration judge pointed to other portions of the testimony which cast doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>on Saballo-Cortez\u2019s veracity. He noted, for example, while Saballo-Cortez claimed that he faced persecution for his failure to serve in the military of his country, he was not arrested for this conduct, and was allowed to travel outside his country on a Nicaraguan passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">The immigration judge was not persuaded that Saballo-Cortez had been threatened to join the military, and noted that this testimony was not corroborated. <em>See Sanchez v. INS, </em>707 F.2d 1523, 1527 (D.C. Cir.1983) [petitioner failed to provide any other evidence to support his own concluso-ry statements that he would be persecuted upon his return to El Salvador].</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">The immigration judge correctly found that there was no evidence in the record that Saballo-Cortez belonged to any political organization or had taken any political position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, he failed to meet his burden of satisfying the immigration judge that it was more probable than not that he had suffered past persecution or feared persecution because of his political opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">The immigration judge found that while there was evidence that Saballo-Cortez had been suspected of gun-running, the incident occurred in 1981 and no guns were found. We note also that no further action appears to have been taken by Nicaraguan authorities with respect to this alleged offense, and that Saballo-Cortez was allowed to leave the country on a government passport. <em>See Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 134 (5th Cir.1978) [petitioner was issued passport by Haitian government; court found it difficult to believe that Haiti would allow him to leave if it feared his loyalty, as asserted by petitioner]. We agree with the immigration judge that this incident does not support a finding of present danger to Saballo-Cortez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">We are satisfied from our independent review of the entire record that there are substantial inconsistencies in the application and testimony of Saballo-Cortez to sustain the finding of the immigration judge and the BIA that he was not a truthful witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">In spite of Saballo-Cortez\u2019s stubborn defiance and repeated resistance to participation in his country\u2019s compulsory service requirements, he was permitted to work until the day he left without arrest of harm. He was also granted a passport and exit visa. These facts cast great doubt on Saballo-Cortez\u2019s claim that he fears persecution. The fact that he was denied such perquisites as discounts on food and a special work permit for some other type of employment does not establish persecution. <em>See Raass v. INS, </em>692 F.2d 596 (9th Cir. 1982) [asylum relief in U.S. depends on something more than generalized economic disadvantage at the destination]. As noted by the BIA, these sanctions, i.e. denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>special privileges to purchase food or obtain more desirable employment may well be legitimate under Nicaraguan law. Sa-ballo-Cortez\u2019s claim of grotesque threats against his life do not appear credible in light of the evidence that he remained free from arrest, fully employed, and received full governmental cooperation when he applied for permission to travel. The immigration judge and the BIA were free to infer that if he was subject to official persecution or death because of his draft resistance, he would not have been given a passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">E. <em>Applicability Of the McMullen Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF7n\">Saballo-Cortez argues that in <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 1312 (9th Cir.1981), this court \u201cstrongly suggested that the absence of evidence contradicting an alien\u2019s assertions regarding asylum should lead to a granting of asylum.\u201d In support of this novel proposition, Saballo-Cortez relies on the following passage from McMullen: \u201cThe INS did not submit evidence of its own which indicated that any of McMul-len\u2019s exhibits were inaccurate, nor did it submit independent evidence showing McMullen\u2019s lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317. The quoted observation by this court directly follows a recitation of the BIA\u2019s finding that McMullen\u2019s testimony was not credible and that his reports of terrorism were not relevant because they were not directed at the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">We do not read <em>McMullen </em>as compelling the granting of asylum whenever the petitioner\u2019s testimony is not contradicted by evidence presented by the INS. We noted in <em>McMullen </em>that \u201cthe burden of proof was on McMullen to prove a likelihood of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317. Before this court, McMullen conceded \u201cthat the burden is on the alien to prove likelihood of persecution and [submitted] that he met this burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317. After reviewing the entire record in that case, we agreed with McMullen. A comparison of the facts of this case with the record in <em>McMullen </em>demonstrates that our decision in that case has no application to the matter <em>sub </em>judice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">In <em>McMullen, </em>the petitioner presented overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence which was fully corroborated that he faced likelihood of persecution in Ireland from the British because he deserted the army to join the Provisional Irish Republican Army, (PIRA) and from the PIRA because his resignation from that group due to its extremist activities. Thereafter, he was imprisoned by the Republic of Ireland for three years for his PIRA activities. Upon his release, he was asked to help the PIRA and refused. After repeated PIRA intimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>dation, including being kidnapped, he agreed to help. When he refused to kidnap and execute an American, he was brought before a PIRA court of inquiry because of his conduct. When told by a friend that he would be murdered for his disobedience, McMullen fled to the United States, <em>\u201cusing an assumed name to obtain a visa.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) <em>id. </em>at 1314. When he arrived in the United States he contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, hoping to obtain asylum for sharing his knowledge of PIRA activities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">The immigration judge believed McMul-len\u2019s testimony, after observing his demeanor as a witness, <em>id. </em>at 1318, and concluded that deportation should be withheld. <em>Id. </em>at 1313. The BIA reversed, finding that McMullen had not shown a sufficient likelihood that he would suffer persecution upon deportation to Ireland, <em>id. </em>at 1313-14, because his testimony was \u201cinherently unbelievable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">In reversing the BIA, we noted that the INS did <em>not </em>argue that McMullen\u2019s testimony was inherently unbelievable \u201cbecause it is internally inconsistent or lacking in the ring of truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318. Instead, the INS contended that \u201ca petitioner in a deportation is motivated to lie in support of his own case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">We held in <em>McMullen </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-7\">Given ... <em>the immigration judge\u2019s finding of credibility, </em>and the absence of any significant contradictory evidence, we are convinced that McMullen has met his burden of showing that the PIRA considers him a traitor, and that any finding to the contrary would be unsupported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1318. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">In the matter before us, the immigration judge found that Saballo-Cortez was not a credible witness because his testimony and the statements in his application for asylum were internally inconsistent and lacked the ring of truth. After reviewing the record, the BIA also discredited Saballo-Cortez\u2019s testimony for the same reasons. As we noted in <em>McMullen, </em>in applying the substantial evidence test, we do not review the facts de novo. \u201cThe principle of deference to agency expertise is still applicable, and our inquiry is limited to a review of the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s determination is substantially supported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">In reviewing the record, we must defer to an immigration judge\u2019s express and implied findings that the alien\u2019s testimony is not credible if the record supports such findings. <em>See Pereira-Diaz v. INS, </em>551 F.2d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir.1977). The findings of the immigration judge and the BIA that Saballo-Cortez\u2019s uncorroborated beliefs were unbelievable is fully supported by the record. Thus, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision under 1253(h) and there was no abuse of discretion under 1158(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">F. <em>Alleged Violation of Saballo-Cortez\u2019s Constitutional Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-13\">At the hearing, the immigration judge introduced a copy of a letter from the American Embassy in Managua, Nicaragua, written in response to the court\u2019s ex parte inquiry concerning Saballo-Cortez\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-14\">Saballo-Cortez argues for the first time before this court that this conduct was violative of his constitutional rights. Counsel for Saballo-Cortez made no objection before the immigration judge concerning the immigration judge\u2019s questionable conduct. Commendably, Government counsel did object to the fact that the court conducted an ex parte investigation without notifying both counsel. Counsel for Sabal-lo-Cortez made no comment concerning this matter. Based on the record before us, the conduct of the immigration judge, while inappropriate for the reasons expressed by the Government, was not prejudicial to Sa-ballo-Cortez. The immigration judge apparently unsuccessfully attempted to develop facts which would shed light on the present status of the arrest warrant for gun smuggling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>G. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">We affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Saballo-Cortez\u2019s claims for the reason that he failed to meet his burden of persuasion concerning his claims of persecution and his present fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">At oral argument, counsel for Saballo-Cortez indicated that the conduct of the immigration judge in soliciting unclassified information from the American Embassy concerning Saballo-Cortez may have created a danger for him should he now return to Nicaragua.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">We cannot consider the legal effect of facts not raised below. <em>Tejeda-Mata v. INS, </em>626 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 2280, 73 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1982). Our affirmance on this matter is without prejudice to a motion to reopen based on the facts presented to us at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-22\">. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b), the immigration judge considered Saballo-Cortez\u2019s asylum request as a request for withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), an \"alien may be granted asylum in the <em>discretion </em>of the attorney general if the attorney general determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of Section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">. Saballo-Cortez claims for the first time on appeal to \"belong to the social class of young men who refuse to give service, military or otherwise to the Nicaraguan Comit\u00e9 de Sandi-nistas of Nicaragua Military.\" Saballo-Cortez failed to present any evidence to support this contention below. Therefore we do not reach this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">We note, however, that in <em>Chavez v. INS, </em>723 F.2d 1431 (9th Cir.1984), this court, in rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim for asylum and withholding of deportation, held in part that the petitioner\u2019s status as a \u201cyoung urban male neither in the military nor with the guerrillas\u201d lacked sufficient specificity to trigger political asylum, 723 F.2d at 1433.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">The facts in the matter <em>sub judice </em>are clearly distinguishable from those before this court in <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>749 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir.1984). In <em>Bolanos, </em>the evidence showed that the alien was threatened with death if he did not join the guerrilla forces or leave the country. <em>Id. </em>at 1318. We also noted in <em>Bolanos-Hernandez </em>that the alien had \"not simply failed to join either political side, he has made a deliberate and considered decision not to do so.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 18 at 1326. Finally, in <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>we pointed out that \"[njeither the Immigration Judge nor the Board of Immigration Appeals questioned Bolanos' credibility, or expressed any doubt about whether this threat had actually been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. In the matter before us, the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals did not believe SaballoCortez\u2019s testimony. <em>See Espinoza-Martinez v. INS, </em>754 F.2d 1536, 1540 n. 1 (9th Cir.1985) (The rule expressed in <em>Bolanos-Hernandez </em>applies when no question has been raised concerning the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and no doubt is expressed by the Immigration Judge and the BIA that a direct threat was actually made.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">. The dissent argues that the substantial evidence standard of review requires reversal in this case because the INS failed to prove the alien\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent or lacking in the ring of truth, even though the alien\u2019s evidence consisted solely of his uncorroborated testimony. Otherwise, the dissent argues, the asylum and withholding of deportation provisions are \"hollow gestures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">This misconceives the deference due under the substantial evidence test, <em>see McMullen, </em>658 F.2d at 1317, and would effectively shift the burden of proof from the alien to the INS. Even under the de novo standard of review, which accords no deference to previous administrative determinations, an appellate court could uphold an adverse determination if, after an independent examination of the record, it agreed that the alien failed to meet his burden because his testimony was not credible, regardless of what the INS proved. The dissent\u2019s formulation of the substantial evidence standard, rather than conceiving it to be more deferential than de novo review, would create a presumption of reversal unless the INS comes forth with substantial evidence to disprove an alien\u2019s uncorroborated testimony. The proper formulation allows us to reverse only if the trier of fact's conclusion that the alien failed to prove a clear probability of persecution lacks substantial reasonableness. We have reversed on this basis where an alien\u2019s testimony was objectively corroborated and the immigration judge initially ruled in the alien\u2019s favor. <em>See id. </em>But here the testimony was uncorroborated and both the immigration judge and the BIA ruled against the alien. Based on our review of the evidence, we cannot agree that their determinations lacked substantial reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">We are not unmindful of an alien\u2019s limits in obtaining evidence to corroborate his bare testimony concerning the persecution risks in his home country. But Congress allocated the burden of proving a clear probability of persecution to the alien, and we cannot reallocate that burden under the guise of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1361-9\">PREGERSON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">I cannot say that the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is supported by substantial evidence; therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">We have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1361-12\">Review under the substantial evidence standard is not to be superficial or cursory. Rather, the court\u2019s inquiry must be searching and careful, subjecting the agency\u2019s decision to close judicial scrutiny. Further, the court is not confined to those portions of the record, if any, which the agency cites in support of its conclusions. The court is charged to review the record as a whole. <em>Packer Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>596 F.2d 891, 894 (9th Cir.1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At_d\"><em>Memorial, Inc. v. Harris, </em>655 F.2d 905, 912 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"A13n\">The BIA\u2019s decision, subjected to close judicial scrutiny, does not satisfy the substantial evidence standard because: (1) it is contradicted by the record, (2) it gives inadequate weight to petitioner\u2019s testimony, and (3) it suffers from faulty reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-16\">At his deportation hearing, Saballo-Cor-tez, a native of Nicaragua, conceded de-portability under \u00a7 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1982), because he entered the United States illegally. However, he requested political asylum under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.9 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-17\">Before the immigration judge, Saballo-Cortez testified that he would be persecuted by the Nicaraguan authorities if he returned to Nicaragua. He asserted that, while in Nicaragua, because of his refusal to join the militia and the Comit\u00e9 de Sandi-nistas (Sandinista Committee), he was threatened and harassed by high level military personnel and other individuals. He testified that a high level military person known as \u201cCaypal\u201d had repeatedly threatened him. On two occasions, Caypal told Saballo-Cortez that unless he joined the militia or the Sandinista Committee he would be found dead in a field with his eyes filled with ants. Saballo-Cortez also testified that the authorities wanted him to join the Sandinista Committee because he had worked for an American company in its advertising department. Because of this experience, the Sandinistas hoped that he would be a propaganda organizer for the \u201crevolution.\u201d In addition to Caypal\u2019s threats, Saballo-Cortez explained that he had been harassed by military personnel and others, including an employee of the Police Department and Comit\u00e9 de Sandinis-tas named \u201cCarlos,\u201d who came to Saballo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>Cortez\u2019s door day and night, making sleep at home impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">Saballo-Cortez further testified that he was unable to obtain a work permit or a food ration card because of his refusal to join the Sandinistas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">The only documentary evidence that Sa-ballo-Cortez submitted was an alleged copy of a Nicaraguan government document accusing him of gun-smuggling against the Sandinista government. He explained that he had been detained for gun-smuggling, but that, in fact, he had not been involved in such activities. He asserted, however, that his life was in danger because the Sandinista government believed that he actually was involved in activities against its interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">At the hearing, the immigration judge revealed that he had contacted the American embassy in Managua by telegram seeking corroboration for Saballo-Cortez\u2019s gun-smuggling arrest. The embassy responded that the police authorities would not release information on arrest records to anyone but the person concerned, i.e., Saballo-Cortez, and that the embassy files had no record of Saballo-Cortez. The immigration judge then <em>sua sponte </em>admitted into evidence Saballo-Cortez\u2019s purported arrest record for gun-smuggling and the embassy\u2019s response to the judge\u2019s inquiry. The immigration judge then denied Saballo-Cor-tez\u2019s request for asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">On appeal, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decisions. The BIA based its rulings on Saballo-Cortez\u2019s failure to allege that he would be persecuted because of his \u201cpolitical opinion,\u201d and on his alleged failure to meet his burden of demonstrating a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">Saballo-Cortez then timely petitioned this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"anr-dedup-1\">1. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1980 removed the granting of \u201cwithholding of deportation\u201d from the BIA\u2019s discretion. \u201cThe Board <em>must </em>withhold deportation if certain facts exist\u201d and such decisions are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Chavez v. INS, </em>723 F.2d 1431, 1432 (9th Cir.1984); <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The BIA\u2019s decision relies upon three grounds. First, the BIA found that Saballo-Cortez did not allege that he would be persecuted because of his political opinion. Second, the BIA discounted his testimony because it lacked certain \u201ccorroboration.\u201d Third, the BIA cited other factors contributing to its decision, including the fact that Saballo-Cortez obtained a Nicaraguan passport and exit visa. Because none of these grounds can withstand close scrutiny, the BIA\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">(a) <em>Political Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-14\">The BIA found that, even assuming that Saballo-Cortez had been threatened, he did not assert that such threats were made because of his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 .1253(h). The majority agrees. However, a perusal of the transcript of the hearing before the immigration judge yields several instances when Saballo-Cortez or his attorney indicated clearly that his refusals to join the militia or the Sandinista Committee were based on his political opinion. For example, his attorney flatly said that Sabal-lo-Cortez was persecuted for his \u201cpolitical opinion.\u201d Administrative Record (AR) 64. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>In addition, other statements by Saballo-Cortez at the hearing indicate that his problems with Nicaraguan authorities stemmed from his refusal, <em>for political reasons, </em>to support the Sandinista effort. For example, he explained that he did not want to join the militia \u201c[bjecause of the system,\u201d AR 46, and that he had aroused the Sandi-nistas\u2019 ire because he did not want to work \u201c[f]or the revolution.\u201d AR 48. His written application for asylum cites his adverse \u201cpolitical\u201d views as a reason why he would be persecuted. AR 81. His aversion to the established political system is also indicated by his refusal to join the Sandinistas even in the face of their potential denial of a food ration card and work permit as well as in his refusal to produce propaganda for them. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR 51, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">This case should be remanded on this basis alone. It is impossible to discern the extent to which the BIA relied upon its erroneous finding that Saballo-Cortez had not alleged persecution based on his political opinion. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla v. INS, 730 </em>F.2d 562, 567 (9th Cir.1984); <em>cf. Santana-Figueroa v. INS, </em>644 F.2d 1354, 1356 (9th Cir.1981) (case remanded because \u201c[w]hen important aspects of the individual claim are distorted or disregarded, denial of relief is arbitrary.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">(b) <em>Saballo-Cortez\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\">The BIA\u2019s opinion gives insufficient weight to Saballo-Cortez\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">The BIA itself has previously explained that \u201calthough the [petitioner] may ultimately have the burden of persuasion, her own testimony may be the best \u2014 in fact the only \u2014 evidence available to her. It must, therefore, be accorded the most <em>careful and objective evaluation possible, </em>in the light of all available pertinent evi-dence____\u201d <em>Matter of Sihasale, </em>11 I. &amp; N.Dec. 759, 762 (BIA 1966) (emphasis added); <em>see also Matter of Dunar, </em>14 I. &amp; N.Dec. 310, 319 (BIA 1973). We have also directed that a refugee\u2019s testimony should be carefully considered because a person seeking asylum is often limited in the evidence he or she can obtain. <em>Zavala-Bonil-la, </em>730 F.2d at 567; <em>McMullen, </em>658 F.2d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-11\">A refugee\u2019s testimony may, however, be discredited in the same way as any other witness\u2019s testimony \u2014 for example, by inconsistent statements or because of the witness\u2019s demeanor. At the hearing before the immigration judge, there appeared to be an inconsistency between Saballo-Cor-tez\u2019s testimony and his written asylum application. He testified that he traveled by air, with one stop, to Mexico en route to the United States. In his sworn application, however, he wrote that he had traveled through El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. The immigration judge noted this discrepancy in his decision, but did not expressly draw any conclusions from it. The immigration judge made no comments about Saballo-Cortez\u2019s credibility or demeanor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>Moreover, there is no indication in the BIA\u2019s opinion that Saballo-Cortez gave false testimony. What the BIA did, however, was to consider only Saballo-Cortez\u2019s documentary evidence as \u201cevidence\u201d (alleged gun-smuggling incident) and to discount his oral testimony by suggesting that further corroboration is necessary. But this treatment is contrary to our decisions acknowledging the special difficulties encountered by refugees in obtaining corroboration. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 567 (citing <em>McMullen </em>and a United Nations Handbook); <em>cf. Reyes v. INS, </em>673 F.2d 1087, 1089-90 (9th Cir.1982) (corroborating evidence not required in motion to reopen; Board abused its discretion when it discounted petitioner\u2019s affidavits without valid reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">In any event, the BIA\u2019s assertions regarding the corroboration that Saballo-Cortez should have supplied do not undermine his testimony. For example, Saballo-Cortez testified that he was threatened with death in a field with his eyes filled with ants. In discounting that testimony the BIA asserted that the position and authority of the man who had made the threat was not made clear and that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence that the respondent will be killed by the unnamed security officer.\u201d BIA Opinion at 3. But the record shows that Saballo-Cortez did in fact name the security officer, Caypal. Second, the BIA does not explain why Saballo-Cortez should have known the exact rank of the man who threatened him. Finally, it asks too much to require Saballo-Cortez to present evidence to \u201cprove\u201d that Caypal would indeed have killed him. Such unobtainable evidence is not required to prove a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 565; <em>cf. Matter of Dunar, </em>14 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 319. To require such evidence would make the asylum offers embodied in \u00a7 1158(a) and \u00a7 1253(h) hollow gestures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">To take another example, the BIA discounts Saballo-Cortez\u2019s testimony of threats made against him by Sandinista officials by explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-9\">He [Saballo-Cortez] admitted that military service was required in Nicaragua. Under the circumstances, the steps taken against him could be interpreted as <em>legitimate legal sanctions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">BIA Opinion at 4 (emphasis added). This finding is unsupportable. Even if one characterizes Saballo-Cortez as a Nicaraguan army evader, it is hard to imagine how repeated threats, including a threat of being found dead in a field with one\u2019s eyes filled with ants, could ever \u201cbe interpreted as legitimate legal sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">The BIA\u2019s opinion should thus be reversed for failure to give fair consideration to Saballo-Cortez\u2019s direct testimony. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 567; <em>McMul-len, </em>658 F.2d at 1317 (In reversing the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum, we noted that the \u201cINS did not submit evidence of its own which indicated that any of McMullen\u2019s exhibits were inaccurate, nor did it submit independent evidence showing McMullen\u2019s lack of credibility.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">(c) <em>The BIA\u2019s Remaining Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\">The BIA\u2019s other reasons include: (1) the official Nicaraguan letter submitted by Sa-ballo-Cortez was not accompanied by a certified translation; (2) Saballo-Cortez had not shown that he would have been unable to obtain food or work because of the Sandinista government\u2019s refusal to issue him a food ration card or work permit; (3) Sabal-lo-Cortez\u2019s detention for gun smuggling was of relatively short duration (3 hours) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>and distant in time (3 years); and (4) Sabal-lo-Cortez was able to obtain a passport and visa to leave Nicaragua. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, these reasons should not support the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">The lack of a certified translation is of no great moment because the BIA employs many translators who could have easily translated the letter. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 565. Second, it is unreasonable to require Saballo-Cortez to show that the Sandinista\u2019s refusal to issue a food ration card or work permit would result in his total inability to find food or work. Such refusal itself clearly indicates that the Sandinista authorities have made reprisals against him. Third, even if the alleged \u201cgun-smuggling\u201d accusation is remote in time, it is supported by documentary evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, Saballo-Cortez\u2019s ability to obtain a Nicaraguan passport does not constitute substantial evidence, standing alone, to support the BIA\u2019s refusal to grant Saballo-Cortez withholding of deportation. The majority relies heavily on Saballo-Cortez\u2019s ability to get a passport. This isolated fact is insufficient to support a denial of withholding of deportation. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 565 n. 4 (asylum applicant need not show that government of nation from which applicant seeks asylum remembers him/her). To say that the authorities let Saballo-Cortez leave is a far cry from concluding that they would welcome his return.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">2. <em>The Immigration Judge\u2019s Ex Parte Inquiry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">In denying Saballo-Cortez\u2019s application, the BIA does not rely on the embassy\u2019s response to the immigration judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>inquiry. But, at the very least, the immigration judge\u2019s inquiry may add to the potential danger Saballo-Cortez might face were he to return to Nicaragua. In support of this contention, Saballo-Cortez submitted two State Department letters \u2014 one to a District Director in Boston concerning a particular Salvadorean asylum applicant (El Salvador letter), and the other to the Commissioner of the INS concerning the general practice of sending unclassified inquiries to U.S. embassies overseas (Commissioner letter). Both letters indicate the State Department\u2019s concern over the type of inquiry made by the immigration judge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">The letters advise against such inquiries because foreign nationals are employed in embassy mailrooms. Hence, any unclassified documents sent to an embassy may come to the attention of the foreign government in which the embassy is located. In the Commissioner\u2019s letter, the State Department advised that such requests should be sent through State Department classified channels and expressed concern that \u201cthe fact that an individual has applied for asylum may become known to local security agencies, thereby putting the applicant or his family in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-14\">The El Salvador letter stated: \u201cThese unclassified communications in all probability passed at some stage through the hands of Salvadorean nationals.\u201d The letter also expressed concern that \u201cthere may be a risk that [the asylum applicant] faces some danger in El Salvador if her asylum application has become known to these violent forces____\u201d Then, <em>despite </em>some question as to the applicant\u2019s credibility, the letter nonetheless added, \u201cwe are not able to reassure ourselves that information relating to her asylum request did not fall into the hands of those who might wish to do her harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-17\">Saballo-Cortez\u2019s case may be even more precarious than the case discussed in the El Salvador letter. The embassy\u2019s response here is unclear as to whether the Managua <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>police were specifically asked about Sabal-lo-Cortez. Thus, the immigration judge and embassy\u2019s action may have alerted the Nicaraguan authorities to Saballo-Cortez\u2019s application for asylum \u2014 and would constitute more of a signal than a routine passport application upon which the majority places so much weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The government\u2019s only response to the potential danger to Saballo-Cortez from the embassy letter is that he failed to object at the hearing to the introduction of the letter in evidence. Given the surprising and unusual nature of the immigration judge\u2019s action as well as the INS attorney\u2019s objection to the letter, as a matter of fairness I believe we should address Saballo-Cortez\u2019s contentions concerning the immigration judge\u2019s inquiry. Absent a direct remand, I agree with the majority that Saballo-Cortez must be allowed to petition for reopening of his case to consider the additional danger to him that may have stemmed from the immigration judge\u2019s unorthodox inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">For the reasons stated in the foregoing discussion, I believe that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and I would reverse it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">. Applications for asylum submitted during deportation hearings are considered both as asylum applications and applications for \"withholding of deportation\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b) (1983). I disagree with the BIA\u2019s refusal to withhold deportation because my review of the record convinces me that its decision is not supported by substantial evidence. I, therefore, need not address the more difficult question whether the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum was an abuse of discretion. See <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2492-501, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984), for distinction between standards governing INS decisions denying asylum and INS decisions denying withholding of deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">. Saballo-Cortez contends that the BIA applied the incorrect burden of proof in dismissing his petition. I agree with the majority that we need not reach the issue of the appropriate burden of proof, but for a different reason. I would not reach that issue because, for the reasons stated in the text, the BIA\u2019s opinion lacks substantial evidence under any standard. <em>See Zavala-Bonil-la </em>v. <em>INS, </em>730 F.2d 562, 564 n. 2 (9th Cir.1984) (burden of proof issue not considered because BIA\u2019s opinion lacked substantial evidence regardless of the applicable burden of proof).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1362-16\">. The majority misstates the appropriate burden of proof when it suggests, majority opinion at 1262, that Saballo-Cortez must \"present substantial evidence to compel a mandatory withholding of deportation.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">. The immigration judge\u2019s brief reference to the inconsistency regarding petitioner\u2019s travels merely indicates that the original application \"was possibly in error.\u201d The immigration judge never relied on or even specifically made an adverse credibility determination based on that inconsistency or on anything else. The majority here, however, casts the immigration judge\u2019s decision as a credibility determination. The majority then holds that it \"must defer to an immigration judge's express and implied\u201d credibility determination, majority opinion at 1266, concluding that \u201d[t]he findings of the immigration judge and the BIA that Saballo-Cortez\u2019s uncorroborated beliefs were unbelievable is fully supported by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nowhere in the record do I find a ruling by the immigration judge that Saballo-Cortez was not a credible witness. Moreover, the majority opinion might be misread to place the burden of credibility directly on the asylum applicant. Of course, no such burden exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-13\">Furthermore, a review of the record demonstrates that the majority finds an inconsistency where in fact there may only have been confusion that may have stemmed from the INS attorney's overbearing treatment of petitioner. AR 34, 56, 64-67, 73. <em>See, e.g., Zavala-Bonilla, </em>730 F.2d at 566 (where BIA adverse credibility findings were the product of petitioner\u2019s confusion due to lack of English speaking skills).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-14\">Finally, the \"inconsistency\" between petitioner's statement that he had traveled through several Central American countries en route to Mexico and his statement at the hearing that he traveled by air \u2014 with one stop \u2014 to Mexico, might have been easily explained. Saballo-Cor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>tez\u2019s counsel repeatedly sought the opportunity to do so, but was rebuffed. AR 68, 71-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">. Contrary to the majority, I do not think that <em>McMullen </em>is significant only where the immigration judge finds that a petitioner is credible and the BIA finds that he is not. Regardless of where the adverse credibility decision arises, to meet the substantial evidence standard, the BIA must logically explain its reasons for reaching its decision. <em>Santana-Figueroa, </em>644 F.2d at 1356. <em>See Contreras-Buenfil v. INS, </em>712 F.2d 401, 403 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (requiring same even where standard of review is more deferential than substantial evidence); <em>Prapavat v. INS, 662 </em>F.2d 561, 562 (9th Cir.1981) (per cu-riam) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1365-10\">. Copies of the letter submitted by Saballo-Cor-tez and the embassy's response to the immigration judge\u2019s inquiry were submitted to us. The immigration judge\u2019s inquiry to the American embassy in Managua was not made a part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1365-18\">. The majority, in footnote 4, misreads the views expressed in this dissent when it concludes that the dissent would shift the burden of proof. No such result is intended. Rather, this dissent is prompted by the failure of the BIA to support its ruling with substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
