Goods are produced and legitimately sold abroad under a particular trademark and are imported into the United States and sold in competition with goods of the owner of U.S. trademark rights in the identical mark. But for international boundaries and the territoriality of trademark rights, the use of the trademark in competition with the U.S. owner would not constitute infringement because of the relationship between the foreign entity from whom the goods were directly or indirectly obtained and the owner of U.S. rights in the mark. In this sense, grey market goods are \u201cgenuine\u201d and bear a \u201cgenuine\u201d trademark. In some instances, the U.S. trademark owner is an importer of the goods as well, in which case the grey market goods are known as \u201cparallel importations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-8\">Vivitar Corporation, a California corporation, brought suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade against the United States for a declaratory judgment to invalidate regulations of the Department of Treasury Customs Service which, in Vivi-tar\u2019s view, improperly allow importation of grey market goods contrary to the express provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526 (Section 526, Tariff Act of 1930, hereinafter \u00a7 1526). Specifically, Vivitar seeks to force the Customs Service to refuse importation of any foreign manufactured photographic equipment bearing its U.S. registered trademark VIVITAR unless Vivitar gives specific consent to such importation. Vivitar\u2019s position is that \u00a7 1526(a) gives it an absolute right, as a U.S. company owning a U.S. trademark registration, to require Customs to prevent importation of foreign manufactured goods bearing the trademark VIVI-TAR, and that the regulations of the Customs Service which recognize some exceptions to the bar against importation without the consent of the U.S. trademark owner are invalid. The Court of International Trade upheld the regulations as the correct interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-12\">In this appeal, Vivitar urges reversal of the judgment of the Court of International Trade as a matter of law. The United States endorses the decision of the court on the merits, but challenges that court\u2019s holding that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Intervenor, 47th Street Photo, Inc., urges affirmance of the appealed judgment in its entirety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-13\">We conclude that the Court of International Trade correctly held that it has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a), (i)(3), and/or (i)(4). With respect to the merits, we conclude that Customs\u2019 regulations do not define the limits of protection afforded a U.S. trademark owner under \u00a7 1526. We, nevertheless, conclude that the regulations are a reasonable exercise of Customs\u2019 power to exclude under the statute as a matter of agency initiated enforcement. Since the factual situations involving grey market importations vary widely and not all may be in violation of \u00a7 1526(a), we hold that Customs is not required to provide for automatic exclusion beyond that set forth in its current regulations. Exclusion of goods in situations involving common ownership and/or control of U.S. <em>and </em>foreign trademark rights may be left by Customs for determination in the first instance by the courts. When a U.S. trademark owner has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>successfully pursued a claim against a private party, Customs must, of course, give effect to any judicial determination that the owner has a right to bar importation of goods bearing its mark, even though the goods were obtained from or through a foreign related company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of International Trade, but on narrower grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-6\">This appeal is from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the government and the denial of summary judgment in favor of Vivitar. Since no trial was conducted, there is little in the record with respect to the exact nature of Vivitar\u2019s activities in- the United States and abroad. Nor do we have a specific import transaction before us which is challenged. The challenge by Vivitar is against the regulations <em>per se. </em>The material facts on which the parties rely are few and not in dispute. Essentially the facts establish Vivitar\u2019s standing to challenge the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-7\">Vivitar Corporation, a domestic corporation organized under the laws of the state of California, is the owner of U.S. Trademark Reg. No. 808,478, issued May 17, 1966, covering the trademark VIVITAR for some kinds of photographic equipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The registration has been recorded since 1969 with the U.S. Customs Service pursuant to regulations implementing exclusion provisions in the customs statute (\u00a7 1526), as well as other exclusion provisions found in the trademark statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-8\">Vivitar is engaged in the sale of photographic equipment in the United States and abroad. Apparently, Vivitar has little or no manufacturing facilities of its own, but rather has its products manufactured to specification by various foreign manufacturers, principally in Japan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trademark VIVITAR is affixed or displayed on this equipment at Vivitar\u2019s direction. Vivi-tar has set up a worldwide marketing arrangement so that the parent, appellant here, retains the U.S. market, and various foreign subsidiary corporations sell abroad. We will assume that Vivitar and its subsidiaries are selling the same products. No information is of record with respect to technical ownership of foreign trademark rights in the VIVITAR trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-12\">In the United States, Vivitar has set up a network of independent authorized dealerships to whom it sells for resale to the public. VIVITAR products are, however, also reaching the U.S. market via independent importers who purchase VIVITAR products abroad (we do not know whether directly from Vivitar\u2019s subsidiaries or not), import them into the United States, and sell them through discount outlets, such as in-tervenor, 47th Street Photo. The price differential between U.S. and foreign markets on VIVITAR equipment makes the discount operations profitable. Vivitar seeks to justify its authorized dealers\u2019 higher prices as compared to those of discount houses by its extensive advertising costs, warranty costs, and other legitimate business expenses necessary to promote its VI-VITAR products in the U.S. and maintain its goodwill in the mark. Vivitar accuses the discount houses of obtaining a free ride which will eventually destroy the reputation and sales value of its VIVITAR trademark. These matters were not, of course, litigated or resolved by the CIT in ruling on the motions for summary judgment. The sole question was whether Vivitar has a statutory right to have the Customs Service exclude imports of VIVITAR products except those consigned to Vivitar. This issue was not framed in terms of the particular facts of Vivitar\u2019s distribution system in the U.S. and abroad, but as a general proposition with respect to the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>available under \u00a7 1526 to every domestic owner of a registered U.S. trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-4\">The statutory provision in dispute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(a), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-5\">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, it shall be <em>unlawful to import </em>into the United States <em>any merchandise of foreign manufacture </em>if such merchandise, or the label, sign, print, package, wrapper, or receptacle, <em>bears a trademark owned by a citizen of, or by a corporation or association created or organized within, the United States, and registered in the Patent and Trademark Office by a person domiciled in the United States, </em>under the provisions of sections 81 to 109 of title 15, and if a copy of the certificate of registration of such trademark is filed with the Secretary of the Treasury, in the manner provided in section 106 of said title 15, <em>unless written consent of the owner of such trademark is produced at the time of making entry. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1651-6\">The complete current text of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526 appears in the appendix. The remaining sections deal with (b) seizure and forfeiture; (c) private remedies by trademark owners against persons dealing in wrongfully imported goods; (d) exemptions for personal use; and (e) special provisions for goods bearing counterfeit marks. The statute, thus, explicitly provides for a private remedy for violation of (a) in (c) and at least suggests by (a), (b) and (d) that Customs assume an active role <em>sua sponte </em>in enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-7\">The current customs regulations, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 133.21, read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-8\">(a) <em>Copying or simulating marks or names. </em>Articles of foreign or domestic manufacture bearing a mark or name copying or simulating a recorded trademark or trade name shall be denied entry and are subject to forfeiture as prohibited importations. A \u201ccopying or simulating\u201d mark or name is an actual counterfeit of the recorded mark or name or is one which so resembles it as to be likely to cause the public to associate the copying or simulating mark with the recorded mark or name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-10\">(b) <em>Identical trademark. </em>Foreign-made articles bearing a trademark identical with one owned and recorded by a citizen of the United States or a corporation or association created or organized within the United States are subject to seizure and forfeiture as prohibited importations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-11\">(c) <em>Restrictions not applicable. </em>The restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply to imported articles when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-12\">(1) Both the foreign and the U.S. trademark ... are owned by the same person or business entity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-13\">(2) The foreign and domestic trademark ... owners are parent and subsidiary companies or are otherwise subject to common ownership or control (see \u00a7\u00a7 133.2(d) and 133.12(d));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1651-14\">(3) The articles of foreign manufacture bear a recorded trademark ... applied under authorization of the U.S. owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1651-15\">That the regulations are patently less protective of the interests of a U.S. trademark owner than the literal language of the statute is the essence of Vivitar\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-17\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-19\">The government\u2019s initial response to Vi-vitar\u2019s complaint was to file a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in the Court of International Trade (CIT).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-20\">The government\u2019s position is that the statute which Vivitar asserts has been violated, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(a), is one which relates to trademarks. Thus, in the government\u2019s view, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a), which grants jurisdiction to the U.S. district courts over \u201cany civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and <em>trade-marks </em>\u201d (emphasis added) is controlling on the jurisdictional question. The government concludes that since the CIT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>possesses <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction only, not concurrent jurisdiction with the federal district courts, the CIT cannot possess jurisdiction over the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-4\">Vivitar argues that its complaint can rest on several bases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, Vivitar relies on the CIT\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i)(3) over a civil action against the United States arising out of a law providing for an \u201cembargo\u201d or \u201cquantitative restriction,\u201d and on the court\u2019s administration and enforcement powers under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i)(4) over protests (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under either of these theories, the claim falls within the <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction of the CIT, and there is then no jurisdiction in the federal district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-5\">In an opinion dated April 4, 1984, Judge Restani denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The court began its analysis by rejecting Customs\u2019 argument that the case belonged in federal district court as one arising under the trademark laws within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The flaw in the argument, according to the court, was that, while district courts generally have jurisdiction over trademark cases under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, not all cases involving trademarks must be heard in the district courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1652-12\">This case, although arising out of a dispute involving a trademark was, nevertheless, considered by the CIT to be within its jurisdiction because \u201cthe thrust of plaintiff\u2019s grievance is that Customs Service\u2019s administration and enforcement of \u00a7 1526(a) and (b) is improper.\u201d In arriving at this conclusion, the court relied on Vivi-tar\u2019s abandonment of all claims which would require a determination that a third party infringed Vivitar\u2019s trademark, and on Vivitar\u2019s concession that the goods at issue were properly affixed with the VIVITAR trademark abroad. The court further opined that the validity of Customs Service regulations was a matter particularly within the court\u2019s expertise. Moreover, per the court, the regulations were in need of a national, uniform interpretation to avoid confusion and uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-13\">' The court then turned to the jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581, in particular \u00a7 1581(i) quoted in note 5, <em>supra, </em>for a specific grant of authority over the case. Referring first to \u00a7 1581(i)(4), the court noted its jurisdiction over claims arising out of the administration and enforcement of the matters referred to in \u00a7 1581(a)-(h). Under \u00a7 1581(a), the court continued, it has jurisdiction \u201cof any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest, in whole or in part, under section 515 [19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1514-15] of the Tariff Act of 1930.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>In this case there had been no protestable <em>exclusion </em>of the goods in issue since the disputed regulations permit importation. The court, however, read \u00a7 1581(i)(4) broadly as \u201ca residual independent jurisdictional basis for litigating Customs Service administration and enforcement of the substantive matter that may be the subject of a protest, but where the protest remedy is inappropriate or unavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-4\">The court reasoned that reading \u00a7 1581(i)(4), when applied to \u00a7 1581(a), as limited only to cases arising from the administration and enforcement of protests, would render it duplicative to \u00a7 1581(a). Rather, citing <em>United States v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>687 F.2d 467, 475 (CCPA 1982) (Nies, J., concurring), the court held that its jurisdiction under \u00a7 1581(i) was properly invoked, since there was no protestable exclusion and, thus, \u201cthe other provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 are manifestly inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">Alternatively, the court ruled that, since \u00a7 1526 provides for the exclusion of certain goods, jurisdiction over this case could be found in \u00a7 1581(i)(3), as an \u201cembargo\u201d or \u201cquantitative restriction on the importation of merchandise.\u201d The court interpreted \u00a7 1581(i)(3) as granting the court jurisdiction over cases where the importation of goods is limited to a specific quantity; the statutory exclusion of certain goods under \u00a7 1526, in the court\u2019s view, constituted a quantitative limit of zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-7\">The jurisdiction of the CIT with respect to a suit of this nature has not been uniformly recognized. Several federal district courts have also taken jurisdiction over civil actions against the government involving the importation of grey market goods. <em>See, e.g., Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks (CPIAT) v. United States, </em>598 F.Supp. 844, 224 USPQ 701 (D.D.C.1984) and <em>Olympus Corporation v. United States, </em>No. 84-0920 (E.D. N.Y. Nov. 15, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-12\">In both <em>Olympus </em>and <em>CPIAT, </em>the thrust of each complaint was that the Customs regulations were inconsistent with \u00a7 1526. In each case an injunction was sought against the government for failure to exclude grey market goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-13\">In both suits jurisdiction was challenged on the basis that the Court of International Trade had exclusive jurisdiction over a civil action against the government concerning the validity of regulations implementing \u00a7 1526. Both district courts were aware of, but expressly rejected, Judge Restani\u2019s ruling on jurisdiction, holding instead that because the district courts had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 over federal questions and under \u00a7 1338(a) over claims based on a federal statute relating to trademarks, the CIT could not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-15\">We are faced then with irreconcilable decisions from two district courts and the CIT, each asserting that the other lacks jurisdiction. However, we do not see that the jurisdictional statutes themselves are irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-16\">The jurisdiction granted to the U.S. Customs Court, predecessor to the Court of International Trade, has long been recognized as an exception to the jurisdiction of the district courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, i.e., federal question jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Sneaker Circus, Inc. v. Carter, </em>566 F.2d 396, 398-99 (2d Cir.1977), and cases cited therein. Thus, it is faulty analysis to look first to the jurisdiction of the district courts to determine whether the CIT has jurisdiction. Given the broad jurisdictional grant to district courts, a district court would always have jurisdiction, rather than the CIT, using this approach. The result would negate the intent of Congress in granting <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over certain matters to the CIT. The focus must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>solely on whether the claim falls within the language and intent of the jurisdictional grant <em>to </em>the CIT. Since no new claims were created by the Customs Courts Act of 1980 (the 1980 Act), Pub.Law No. 96-417, 94 Stat. 1727 (1980), which created the CIT, the expanded jurisdiction given to that court, <em>a fortiori, </em>means that additional exceptions to the jurisdiction of district courts must result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-4\">With respect to litigation under \u00a7 1526 prior to enactment of the 1980 Act, there is no question that a federal district court was the forum for a trademark owner to pursue any claim for exclusion, whether against the government or a private party. However, one purpose of the 1980 Act was to consolidate jurisdiction over suits against the government in international trade matters, placing such matters in the province of the new court. H.R.Rep. No. 96-1235, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 33, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3729, 3745.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-5\">In this case, Vivitar raises no question of substantive trademark or unfair competition law with respect to activities of a particular private party. If Yivitar were asking the CIT to determine, for example, that certain goods imported by others and sold in this country under its mark constituted infringement of Vivitar\u2019s trademark rights or another form of unfair competition, such subject matter would be beyond the jurisdiction of the CIT. The determinations of the respective rights between private parties under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(c) was not changed by the 1980 Act and, therefore, continues to fall within the jurisdiction of the federal district courts. In contrast, the validity of the regulations governing exclusions of goods by Customs in general is the type of question to which the CIT can bring expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-6\">Judge Restani held, and we agree, that Vivitar\u2019s action against the government for a determination that the Customs regulations are invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIT as a corollary to protest jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). The government attempts to undercut the basis for her analysis by arguing that the exclusion of goods by reason of the trademark thereon is not a matter which an importer may protest. We would agree if the importer were to seek a determination of rights vis-a-vis the trademark owner, a matter to be determined in district court. On the other hand, where the subject matter is the validity of regulations or of procedures thereunder, a protest is appropriate and, therefore, the denial thereof falls within the jurisdictional grant of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). <em>Accord, Lois Jeans &amp; Jackets, U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, </em>5 CIT 238, 566 F.Supp. 1523 (1983) (importer brought a declaratory judgment action to determine rights against the trademark owner, while concurrently pursuing a protest to attack the government\u2019s failure to comply with regulations). Thus, the basis for Judge Restani\u2019s analysis is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-11\">We hold alternatively that jurisdiction may rest on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i)(3) and/or (4), as a civil action against the United States which arises out of an embargo<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or quantitative restriction on certain goods, and the administration and enforcement thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of Judge Restani that the CIT has jurisdiction over Vivitar\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1654-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-14\">\n<em>Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATdH\">The issue, as framed by the parties, is whether the regulations of the Customs Service correctly interpret the extent of protection afforded by the statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526. The provisions of \u00a7 1526(a) appear to create a sweeping bar to importation of any goods bearing the same trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>mark as that owned by a U.S. company without the latter\u2019s consent. In contrast, Customs\u2019 regulations provide for a more limited prohibition. Under current regulations, a U;S. company must disclose foreign affiliated companies as part of the information required upon recordation of its mark.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With r\u00e9spect to goods of these affiliated companies, Customs does not require consent to importation and will not bar importation of goods from these sources bearing the recorded trademark, even if the U.S. trademark owner demands \u2014 as Vivitar has done \u2014 that the goods be excluded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1655-4\">The government makes two arguments in support of a narrow reading of the statute which would limit \u00a7 1526(a) protection to that provided by the regulations: (1) Congressional intent expressed at enactment and subsequently, and (2) long standing administrative interpretation and practice. Vivitar, on the other hand, argues that the regulations <em>violate </em>the statute. Neither party\u2019s position is persuasive for reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-6\">\n<em>Congressional Intent at Time of Enactment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-7\">The Court of International Trade concluded from a review of the legislative history that the sole purpose and effect of \u00a7 1526 was to nullify the result of the decision of the Second Circuit in <em>A. Bourjois v. Katzel, </em>275 Fed. 539 (2d Cir.1921). The government urges that we adopt the lower court\u2019s analysis. Our review of legislative history, however, indicates that, while reversal of the <em>Katzel </em>decision was one purpose of \u00a7 1526, it was clearly, and we use that word advisedly, not the <em>sole </em>purpose. Review of events leading to passage of \u00a7 1526 must begin somewhat earlier than that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-11\">The Trademark Act of 1905, contained, <em>inter alia, </em>the following provisions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1655-12\">\u00a7 27: That no article of imported merchandise ... which shall copy or simulate a trademark registered in accordance with the provisions of this act ... shall be \u2019 admitted to entry at any custom house of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1655-13\">The statute also specified that, \u201cto aid\u201d in enforcing the prohibition, the registrant was to record his certificate of registration with the Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-14\">In 1916, the Second Circuit had before it an appeal from an order granting an injunction which prohibited Customs from detaining merchandise which plaintiff Gretsch sought to import. <em>Fred Gretsch Mfg. Co. v. Schoening, </em>238 Fed. 780 (2d Cir.1916). Gretsch bought violin strings in Germany which were manufactured by a German company Mueller and sold there under Mueller\u2019s trademark ETERNELLE. Schoening was the exclusive sales agent for Mueller in the United States. Schoen-ing obtained a U.S. trademark registration for ETERNELLE for violin strings and recorded that registration with Customs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When Gretsch attempted to bring in \u201cgenuine\u201d ETERNELLE violin strings from Germany, Customs, acting under \u00a7 27, barred their importation. Gretsch sued both Schoening and the Collector of Customs in New York in district court and obtained an injunction against the action taken by Customs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-15\">In affirming the injunction, the Second Circuit held that under the law of the Second Circuit, Gretsch\u2019s sale of \u201cgenuine\u201d Mueller strings under the ETERNELLE mark would not be an infringement. The court then addressed whether Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>nevertheless, intended \u00a7 27 to bar importation of \u201cgenuine\u201d goods. The court concluded that there was no Congressional intent to bar non-infringing goods \u2014 that the words \u201ccopy or simulate\u201d in \u00a7 27 embraced only infringements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-4\">A few years later, the <em>Katzel </em>case, which has some similarities to the <em>Gretsch </em>case, was also decided by the Second Circuit. A French company, E. Wertheimer &amp; Cie. (formerly A. Bourjois &amp; Cie.), had established a business in the United States for its products, one of which was face powder sold under the trademark JAVA in a particular style of packaging. In 1913, Wer-theimer sold its U.S. business, including all of its rights in the U.S. to its trademarks, trade dress, and trade names (including \u201cA. Bourjois &amp; Cie.\u201d) to A. Bourjois &amp; Co., a New York corporation. Bourjois (NY) was not obligated to purchase any products from Wertheimer. However, Bourjois (NY) did, in fact, buy face powder in bulk from Wertheimer, which it then packaged for retail sale in the same style of box which Wertheimer had used in the U.S. and was continuing to use in France.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1656-5\">The defendant Katzel operated a retail pharmacy in New York City. Sometime prior to 1921, Katzel bought a quantity of Wertheimer\u2019s retail packaged JAVA face powder in France and began selling the product in her New York store and to other retailers. The packaging for the Wer-theimer goods sold by Katzel was almost identical to that of Bourjois (NY), and the products were, in fact, the same. The district court enjoined Katzel\u2019s sales as infringements. The Second Circuit, relying on the infringement part of the decision in the <em>Gretsch </em>case, reversed on the theory that no infringement occurred since the JAVA face powder Katzel was selling was \u201cgenuine.\u201d The <em>Katzel </em>court did not have before it any issue of blocking importation or the meaning of \u00a7 27. The court was simply making a decision on trademark infringement, presumably under the common law of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-12\">The Second Circuit decision in <em>Katzel </em>had greater significance at the time than may be readily apparent. During World War I, the Alien Property Custodian (an arm of the federal government) had seized assets in this country owned by foreign nationals of enemy countries and had sold them to U.S. interests. Thus, a number of substantial U.S. businesses had been created, e.g., the U.S. maker of BAYER aspirin, which was entirely independent of its German counterpart and which would have been adversely affected by importation of \u201cgenuine\u201d goods from abroad with the normalization of international relations. Thus, the <em>Katzel </em>litigation was pursued to the U.S. Supreme Court, which accepted the case, and efforts were also directed to Congress to provide relief from the Second Circuit\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-13\">Several committees of Congress took up the matter. Fortuitously for proponents of restrictive importation, Congress had before it what became the Tariff Act of 1922, Pub.L. No. 67-318, 42 Stat. 975 (1922), and they were able to add \u00a7 1526 as an amendment to that bill. The legislative history of the section is very limited, consisting of a short floor debate in the Senate and a brief paragraph in the Conference Report, which reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1656-14\">A recent decision of the circuit court of appeals holds that existing law does not prevent the importation of merchandise bearing the same trade-mark as merchandise of the United States, if the imported merchandise is genuine and if there is no fraud on the public. The Senate amendment makes such importation unlawful without the consent of the owner of the American trade-mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1656-15\">H.R.Rep. No. 1223, 67th Cong., 2d Sess. 158 (1922). The \u201crecent decision\u201d was <em>Kat-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number><em>zel, </em>despite the mischaracterization of what the case had actually held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-5\">The government argues that \u00a7 1526 was intended to do no more than \u201cprotect the property rights of Americans against fraud in the situation in which they had purchased trademark rights from foreign owners yet were unable to obtain relief when goods bearing the genuine trademark continued to be sold and imported.\u201d One sponsor did attempt to convince Senators who questioned the sweep of the proposed language that it would have no greater effect than to protect a U.S. purchaser of trademark rights in the U.S. against fraudulent conduct by the foreign seller of those rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, opponents were unconvinced. The question was raised as to whether U.S.-made WONDER flour purchased in Canada would be excluded by the provision. The proposed legislation was hastily amended to add the limitation that only foreign manufactured goods were ex-cludable, which took care of at least that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-6\">Another supporter indicated he favored the legislation because of the transfer to certain U.S. interests of the BAYER trademark by the Alien Property Custodian. Another agreed that he also understood the purpose of the legislation was to protect such interests. Advocates, thus, were clearly not limiting themselves to the <em>Kat-zel </em>situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-7\">Our review of the comments in the floor debate leads us to the conclusion that the debate is too unfocused and misinformed to serve as a definitive basis for interpretation of \u00a7 1526. The floor debate, like the above committee report, indicates an erroneous understanding of the facts of the <em>Katzel </em>case, namely, that the French seller of the JAVA trademark was violating its contract and that the Second Circuit dealt with \u00a7 27 of the Trademark Act of 1905 in <em>Katzel. </em>The legislation was disparaged during the debate as a \u201cmidnight\u201d amendment, the impact of which was not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-8\">Under these circumstances, the remarks of one or more Senators are an unreliable indication of the sense of the chamber as a whole or of Congress. The only clear indication from the debate is that Congress realized it was providing a bar to importation even though at least one circuit (the <em>Katzel </em>court) would hold that the concurrent use of the mark on the parallel import would not be an infringement. With respect to infringing uses of trademarks on imports, such goods were already excluded, or at least excludable, by \u00a7 27 of the trademark statute. Congress did not debate or intend to change trademark law to make uniform what the various courts might hold to be infringements. Rather, it ignored trademark law and, by amendment to customs law, gave a U.S. owner of a trademark a right to exclude foreign goods bearing the same trademark as the U.S. company had registered in the U.S. and recorded with Customs. Ownership of a U.S. trademark registration was a condition to an exercise of that right, but trademark infringement by the importer was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-11\">At the time of enactment, it cannot be disputed that Congress intended \u00a7 1526(a) to provide an exclusion remedy broader than that in \u00a7 27 of the trademark statute which, as held in <em>Gretsch, </em>was limited by the words \u201ccopy or simulate\u201d to the barring of infringements. Additional support for the conclusion that \u00a7 1526 is not limited to infringements is found in the language of another paragraph of \u00a7 1526 enacted at the same time. That additional provision, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(c), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1657-12\">(c) Any person dealing in any such merchandise [excluded under (a) ] may be enjoined from dealing therein within the United States or may be required to export or destroy such merchandise or to remove or obliterate such trade-mark and shall be liable <em>for the same damages and profits provided for wrongful use of a trade-mark, </em>under the provisions of such Act of February 20,1905, as amended. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>Thus, a private remedy was-created against persons dealing in merchandise prohibited under \u00a7 1526(a), who were made liable <em>for the same damages as provided for trademark infringement. </em>The damage remedy would have been wholly unnecessary if the statute had been intended to reach infringements only, since that remedy was already available in the Act of 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-4\">A few months after the enactment of \u00a7 1526, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>A. Bourjois v. Katzel, </em>260 U.S. 689, 43 S.Ct. 244, 67 L.Ed. 464 (1923). Emphasizing the territoriality of trademark rights, the Court reversed the Second Circuit\u2019s holding of non-infringement. Regardless of the genuineness of the face powder sold under the JAVA trademark in France, and its identity in composition to that sold by the U.S. trademark owner, sales by Katzel of the \u201cgenuine\u201d article under the JAVA trademark could be enjoined in the United States because, as stated in the Court\u2019s opinion, the trademark JAVA \u201cindicates in law, and, it is found, by public understanding, that the goods come from the plaintiff.\u201d 260 U.S. at 692, 43 S.Ct. at 245. Since the goods which defendant was selling did not \u201ccome from\u201d the plaintiff Bourjois in the sense of sponsorship, while the public would attribute such goods to the plaintiff, defendant\u2019s sales of face powder under the JAVA mark infringed plaintiff\u2019s rights. Thus, the Court repudiated several defenses asserted to trademark infringement: (1) that the use of the trademark of Bourjois without its consent was justified because the goods sold under the mark were identical to those of the trademark owner, indeed, were obtained from the same manufacturer, and (2) that the legality of use of the trademark in the country where the importer had obtained the goods justified its concurrent use in this country.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The decision followed the generally accepted theory that the function of a trademark is to identify the producer, the source which stands behind the goods sold under the mark, and not the product itself. Bourjois (NY) did not stand behind the goods sold by Katzel, whereas purchasers would think that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-7\">The Supreme Court did not mention the \u00a7 27 exclusion provision of the trademark statute in <em>Katzel </em>since it was not an issue directly raised in that case. However, the question of exclusion by Customs under \u00a7 27 arose shortly thereafter in <em>A. Bour-jois &amp; Co., Inc. v. Aldridge, </em>263 U.S. 675, 44 S.Ct. 4, 68 L.Ed. 501 (1923). The underlying facts of Aldridge closely parallel those in <em>Katzel, </em>except that the trademark involved was MANON LESCAUT for face powder, another mark Bourjois (NY) had acquired from Wertheimer. Unlike <em>Katzel, </em>this time Bourjois sought relief against the Collector of Customs (Aldridge) at the port of New York under \u00a7 27 of the trademark statute, as well as against the importer, Le Benart Import Co. The district court refused to grant an injunction to require Customs to bar MANON LESCAUT powder (acquired abroad from Wertheimer) from entry by the importer. On appeal, the Second Circuit certified the following two questions to the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1658-8\">(1) Is the sale in the United States of Wertheimer\u2019s Manon Lescaut powder an infringement of plaintiff\u2019s registered trade-marks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1658-9\">(2) Is the collector, by section 27 of the Trade-Mark Law, required to exclude from entry genuine Manon Lescaut powder so as aforesaid made in France?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1658-10\"><em>A. Bourjois &amp; Co., Inc. v. Aldridge, </em>292 Fed. 1013, 1014 (2d Cir.1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-11\">In a memorandum opinion, the Supreme Court answered both questions in the affirmative, \u201cupon the authority of <em>A. Bour-jois v. Katzel, </em>260 U.S. 689, 43 S.Ct. 244, 67 L.Ed. 464, the defendant [Aldridge] not objecting.\u201d Again, infringement was found with respect to arguably \u201cgenuine\u201d goods. Not only was the product identical to that of the U.S. trademark owner sold under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>same mark, indeed, obtained from the same manufacturer, but also the product was legally sold under the mark at the place of origin and purchase. Nevertheless, Customs was directed to exclude this type of \u201cgenuine\u201d goods under \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-4\">It is argued that had the Supreme Court decision in the <em>Katzel </em>case been handed down sooner, \u00a7 1526 would not have been enacted. However, the statute was enacted, and, as the discussion above indicates, it resulted in a statutory bar not limited to the facts of <em>Katzel, </em>indeed, not intended to be limited to technical determinations of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-5\">A contemporary judicial assessment of congressional intent is found in <em>Sturges v. Clark D. Pease, Inc., </em>48 F.2d 1035, 1036 (2d Cir.1931), a case in which the plaintiff sought to import for personal use a secondhand Hispano-Suiza automobile which bore the trademark \u201cH-S.\u201d The U.S. rights in that mark had been acquired by Pease, who refused to allow the \u201cgenuine\u201d article to be imported. Judge A. Hand, addressing the argument that \u00a7 1526 should be narrowly construed, since it would not have been enacted at all had <em>Katzel </em>been decided pri- or thereto, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-6\">But this fact does not settle the scope of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-7\">... The object of this drastic statute is to protect the owner of a foreign trademark from competition in respect to goods bearing the mark____ Sales of cars bearing the foreign trade-mark and imported without the consent of Clarke D. Pease, Inc., interfere with its right to control the use of the mark in this country which was the apparent purpose of the congressional legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-10\">... Buyers are likely to purchase His-pano-Suiza cars from Clarke D. Pease, Inc., in order to secure the mark if they cannot otherwise obtain that advantage. If they are allowed to import for personal use without its consent, Clarke D. Pease, Inc., may certainly lose customers who would be willing to buy from them rather than possess cars bearing no trade-mark. To obtain such advantages the local owner of the foreign mark is given control of the importation of all cars bearing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1659-14\">48 F.2d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-15\">It seems quite clear that Judge Hand did not consider that the statute was limited in scope to the facts of <em>Katzel. </em>In his view, the statute was \u201cdrastic\u201d in that it gave a trademark owner the right to \u201ccontrol\u201d imports of \u201call\u201d goods bearing the mark to which it owned U.S. rights, regardless of the relationship between the U.S. trademark owner and the foreign producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-16\">Despite the reversal of <em>Katzel </em>and the holding in <em>Aldridge </em>by the Supreme Court, which it is argued made \u00a7 1526 unnecessary, the provision has not been nullified, but has remained part of the customs law. Indeed, a proposal to eliminate \u00a7 1526 from the customs law, because the Trademark Act of 1946 would carry \u00a7 27 forward as part of the new statute, was unsuccessful.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1659-17\">We conclude that no limitations, based on indications of congressional intent at the time of enactment, can be read into the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-19\">\n<em>Administrative Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-20\">Turning to the government\u2019s second argument, it is urged that the current Customs regulations reflect a long standing administrative interpretation of the statutory provision and, thus, should be accepted as controlling on this issue. Our review of the series of regulations issued by Customs since 1923, together with administrative practice, Treasury rulings, and correspondence between various Customs officials and members of Congress, indicates that Customs has had and continues to have changing views <em>of the role of Customs </em>in enforcing \u00a7 1526(a) on behalf of owners of registered U.S. trademarks (as well as in enforcing the import exclusion in the Trademark Acts of 1905 and 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>The first regulations following enactment of \u00a7 1526 were issued by Customs in 1923. As noted in Judge Restani\u2019s opinion, these regulations offer little insight into the agency\u2019s interpretation, in that they merely recognized that U.S. owners of registered trademarks were entitled to the protection of \u00a7 1526. (Customs Regulations of 1923, Articles 475-480.) Upon reenactment of \u00a7 1526 as part of the Tariff Act of 1930,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> new regulations were issued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1660-4\">Prohibition of entry. \u2014 Entry is prohibited of imported merchandise <em>bearing a genuine trade-mark </em>when such trade-mark is recorded with the Treasury Department and registered under the trademark law of February 20,1905, if compliance is had with all provisions of section 526 of the tariff act of 1930, provided the period of protection for such trade-mark has not expired. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anj-dedup-0\">Customs Regulations of 1931, Article 513(a). The bar against goods with \u201cgenuine\u201d marks appears to have been considered at that time, by Customs, to be absolute. Without the U.S. trademark owner\u2019s consent, all goods, even with \u201cgenuine\u201d marks, were barred. <em>Sturges, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1660-5\">The first inroad on that concept is found in the 1936 regulations. It must first be noted that Customs regulations have dealt with exclusions based on trademarks in a single set of regulations, whether under \u00a7 1526 or under the trademark statute. In the 1936 regulations, goods barred under \u00a7 1526 were stated to be deemed for purposes of the regulations to bear a trademark which \u201ccopies or simulates\u201d a protected trademark (language taken from the trademark statute). Imported goods were no longer subject to either the trademark or customs law prohibition in the absence of the trademark owner\u2019s consent \u201cif such foreign trade-mark ... and such United States trade-mark ... are owned by the same person, partnership, association, or corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-10\">In 1953, Customs put into the regulations a much broader limitation under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.14. Importation was no longer to be barred by Customs in the absence of the trademark owner\u2019s consent if the foreign trademark was owned by a \u201crelated company\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946) of the U.S. owner, and disclosure of such related companies was required. The definition in \u00a7 45 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127) covers <em>licensees </em>as well as commonly owned companies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1660-11\">Despite these regulations, some U.S. trademark owners continued to enjoy the exclusion of imports of \u201cgenuine\u201d goods from abroad apparently by reason of earlier recordation of a mark before disclosure of affiliates was required. Such a situation was revealed in <em>United States v. Guerlain, Inc., </em>155 F.Supp. 77, 114 USPQ 223 (S.D.N.Y.1957). A U.S. distributor, Guerlain, had utilized the exclusionary provisions of \u00a7 1526(a) to prevent importation by others of the same goods which Guerlain was importing. In the district court, the United States successfully maintained that Guerlain\u2019s action was in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the goods sold under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>trademark, i.e., intrabrand competition in the subject goods was prevented.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Had this ruling stood, Vivitar would not be advancing the interpretation of \u00a7 1526 which it is urging today. However, during the pendency of the case before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department moved to vacate the judgments of the district court in its favor to enable it to move in that court to dismiss. As reasons for such action, the government stated that it was <em>the practice of Customs </em>to allow such exclusions of \u201cgenuine\u201d goods and that the government would seek legislation to clarify that the products of an affiliate of the U.S. trademark owner were not subject to the exclusion remedy. The Supreme Court granted the government's motion. 358 U.S. 915 (1958). Efforts to obtain such legislation proved unfruitful. <em>See </em>H.R. 7234, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-5\">In 1959, apparently as a result of the <em>Guerlain </em>situation, Customs expressly went back to the more limited 1936 exception, i.e., importation was allowed without consent only if the \u201csame entity\u201d owned rights here and abroad. <em>See </em>J.F. Atwood, <em>Import Restrictions on Trademarked Merchandise </em>\u2014 The <em>Role of the United States Bureau of Customs, </em>59 Trademark Reporter 301, 307 (1969). It appears from Treasury Decision T.D. 69-12(2) (1969) in the record, however, that the \u201csame entity\u201d requirement was satisfied, in the view of Customs, by a parent/subsidiary relationship. However, disclosure of foreign relationship was not required in the 1959 regulations except for principal and agent, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.15(a) (1959), so that Customs could not uniformly enforce the limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-6\">In 1972, the regulations were again revised. The new regulations, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 133.21, carried forward the \u201csame entity\u201d limitation and added limitations explicitly for (1) parent/subsidiary corporations and other common ownership of the owners of the foreign and U.S. trademarks (\u00a7 133.-21(c)(2)) and (2) foreign licensees of the U.S. company which is the owner of a U.S. trademark (\u00a7 133.21(c)(3)). (The regulation does not distinguish between a licensee of U.S. rights or foreign rights). Disclosure of these names is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-9\">With respect to actual administration practice, during some years Customs acted to exclude goods which, under its regulations, should not have been excluded because it lacked information to implement its regulations. Thus, trademark recor-dants prior to 1953 were treated differently from recordants between 1953-1959 and those after 1959 differently from those before that date. Whether earlier recordants are not treated the same today as those after 1972, we do not know. In the above cited article by J.F. Atwood, a customs law specialist at the then Bureau of Customs, the problem of lack of uniform administration is discussed. 59 Trademark Reporter at 310-11. One section is entitled \u201cThe Related Company Riddle\u201d and concludes with the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1661-10\">Thus related companies are no longer denied full protection merely because they are affiliated with a foreign firm, or because control as to the nature and quality of the trademark [sic, goods sold under trademark] is exercised, but only because there is common ownership or control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1661-11\">59 Trademark Reporter at 317. Work on clarifying the position of Customs with respect to bars against related companies was proceeding at that time (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-12\">Similarly, a comprehensive study is being made at this time with respect to genuine goods in the grey market. <em>See </em>Solicitation of Economic Data Notice, 49 Fed.Reg. 21,-453-56 (1984). As stated therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1661-13\">Because of the controversy and considerable interest on both sides of the issue expressed in many letters to, and requests for meetings with, the Executive Branch Departments and Agencies, the Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade\u2019s [CCCT] Working Group on Intel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>lectual Property [WGIP] is studying the issues relating to parallel imports. The WGIP may make a recommendation to the CCCT with respect to parallel imports of trademark products when it concludes its study.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1662-4\">While the notice does not propose new regulations, we discern a continued uncertainty within the executive branch as to the meaning of the exclusion provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-5\">Finally, we note that Customs joined with the Department of Justice in filing an amicus brief in 1983 in another \u201cgrey market\u201d goods case entitled <em>Bell &amp; Howell: Mamiya Co. v. Masel Supply Co., </em>719 F.2d 42 (2d Cir.1983), in which the government urged the court to construe \u00a7 1526(a) \u201cin accord with the normal meaning of the statutory language\u201d and repudiated the position urged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-6\">While the government has cited other official or semi-official statements of Customs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 1526(a), we do not see that these materials help its \u201clong standing administration\u201d argument here. Rather than a consistent policy of administration over the years, reflecting an unvarying interpretation of the statute, it appears that Customs has had continuing questions concerning the reading of the statute. It is evident that, over the years, Customs has attempted to adjust its regulations to reflect the few judicial decisions which interpreted the law prior to 1972. The regulations, while imposing the \u201csame entity\u201d limitation since 1936, have not been consistent in respect of what other limitations should be recognized nor has consistency been unequivocally shown in enforcement. Thus, like the legislative history argument, the \u201clong standing administrative interpretation\u201d argument of the government and intervenor does not afford a basis for a definitive statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-8\">\n<em>Implied Ratification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"a6j-dedup-0\">Finally, the government argues that Congress has ratified the interpretation given to the statute by the Customs regulations. As early as 1954, Treasury informed Congress that the overlap of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124 \u201cwas confusing,\u201d and that a proposed amendment of \u00a7 1526 to specify that exclusion was not authorized with respect to commonly owned companies, agents, licensees, etc., would endorse Customs\u2019 interpretation. The amendment was not passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-10\">In 1978, Congress did amend \u00a7 1526 to add an exemption from the statutory bar against importation with respect to goods accompanying travellers for personal use (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(d)). The House Report (H.R.Rep. 521, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 27 (1977)) states, albeit incorrectly, that the Customs Service had consistently interpreted \u00a7 1526 as not encompassing imports which were authorized by the U.S. trademark owner to be produced abroad. Nothing in any materials we have been able to find indicates in any way that the limitations set forth in the Customs regulations were endorsed or incorporated into the statute. Several problems concerning individual travellers were being addressed, of which the bar to bringing in \u201cgenuine\u201d goods for personal use was one of the most annoying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-11\">From these events, appellees argue that Congress must be deemed to have, in effect, incorporated the limitations of the 1972 regulations into the statute because it was aware of them. We cannot agree. Legislation by total silence is too tenuous a theory to merit extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-13\">\n<em>Interrelationship of Statute and Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-14\">Vivitar attacks the regulations as contrary to \u00a7 1526(a) and, therefore, invalid. In Vivitar\u2019s view, the statute, but not the regulations, provides an absolute bar to importation of goods manufactured abroad which bear a trademark identical to one registered in the U.S. by a U.S. entity unless the latter consents. Thus, per Vivi-tar, the regulations unlawfully limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>rights of the trademark owner given by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\">It appears that Vivitar\u2019s position is based on an erroneous understanding as to the structure of the statute and the nature of the subject regulations. Vivitar\u2019s arguments are premised on the assumption that the regulations set the limits of its right to exclude under \u00a7 1526(a). This premise erroneously treats the regulations as <em>legislative </em>rules having the force of law. Congress may, of course, entrust an agency with the duty to exercise its judgment under guidelines set forth in a statute, and to fill in the extent of protection thereunder. <em>See, e.g., Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). However, we find no language in the statute by which Congress delegated such <em>legislative </em>authority to the Secretary of Treasury in connection with administration of \u00a7 1526(a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Without such authority, Customs regulations cannot affect the actual scope of a trademark owner\u2019s rights vis-a-vis an importer under the statute. <em>See </em>2 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 7.8 (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-6\">Regardless of whether Customs excludes or does not exclude particular imports, the courts must independently determine whether the importation is or is not precluded by the statute.' In connection with exclusion under the trademark statute (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124), Customs\u2019 administrative determination that importations bear a mark that is not likely to cause confusion with a recorded mark has no effect on a trademark owner\u2019s right to obtain a judicial determination of infringement and, thereafter, to have such goods excluded (or vice versa). <em>See La Societe Anonyme des Parfums LeGalion v. Jean Patou, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1265, 181 USPQ 545 (2d Cir.1974); <em>Lois Jeans &amp; Jackets, U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, </em>5 CIT 238, 566 F.Supp. 1523 (1983) (injunction granted against exclusion pending determination of infringement in district court); <em>Holland v. C. &amp; A. Import Corp., </em>8 F.Supp. 259, 261 (S.D.N.Y.1934); <em>see also Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Sekisui Chemical Co., </em>165 USPQ 597, 604-605 (TTAB 1970) (Customs defers to decision of TTAB or other tribunal). Similarly, Customs\u2019 decision, as expressed in the subject regulations, not to exclude grey market goods does not control on the question of whether particular goods should or should not be excluded. A trademark owner is entitled, as in the \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d mark case, to pursue private remedies against the importer and, if successful, to have such grey market goods excluded.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-9\">With these considerations in mind, we conclude that the regulations do no more than define Customs\u2019 role in initiating administrative enforcement of the statute. Viewed in this manner, it is apparent that the regulations are not <em>contrary </em>to the statute in the sense that goods are being routinely excluded which should be admitted or <em>vice versa. </em>Nor has any instance been brought to our attention where, after a judicial determination that imports should be excluded, Customs refused thereafter to undertake to act accordingly. Vivitar\u2019s complaint is simply that the regulations do not go far enough in automatically excluding all types of grey market importations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-10\">In our view, Customs is not required to exclude all grey market goods <em>sua sponte. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>Congress could not have foreseen all possibilities in international trade relationships at the time of enacting the statute. The variations of the grey market are myriad.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> While we have rejected the government\u2019s argument that the statute must be interpreted as limited by the regulations, we must also reject the view that the statute may not have <em>any </em>implied limitations or that general principles such as \u201cagency,\u201d \u201cpiercing the corporate veil,\u201d \u201csham\u201d transactions, \u201cestoppel,\u201d \u201cfraud\u201d or other defenses could not defeat an apparent right to invoke the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-4\">In any event, if we return to the statute, U.S. trademark owners are provided therein essentially with a private remedy, which is properly being tested in the federal district courts with increasing frequency and where issues, such as those raised above, are being resolved. It appears to us that \u00a7 1526(a) may be developing on a case-by-case basis into protection against <em>sui generis </em>types of unfair competition in international trade.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That Customs regulations do not provide for exclusion initially in a case where the trademark owner ultimately prevails in federal district court does not mean that regulations must be declared invalid. Where protection under the statute is unclear or depends upon resolution of complex factual situations, Customs may decline to impose <em>sua sponte </em>the extreme sanction of exclusion and leave such cases for initial determination by the district courts under the private remedies provided to the trademark owner in \u00a7 1526(c).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, the fact that the trademark owner is provided with the remedies of injunction and damages against private parties who have improperly dealt in the goods in the United States negates the idea that agency-initiated action in all cases is expected. Further, the absence of a provision for expeditious relief and monetary compensation for an importer whose goods are improperly excluded cautions against automatic administrative exclusion in such cases.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1664-8\">Accordingly, we hold the current regulations to be valid but not controlling with respect to the scope of protection of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(a). To obtain any additional protection, Vivitar must first pursue a determination of its alleged rights against persons engaging in parallel importation of VIVITAR photographic equipment in federal district court, and, if successful, is entitled to have the parallel imports excluded by Customs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-10\">We conclude that the Court of International Trade had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of the current regulations administering 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(a). We further conclude that the scope of the statutory protection afforded to a U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>trademark owner under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526 is not fixed by the Customs regulations. The regulations, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 133.21, are upheld as a reasonable exercise of administratively initiated enforcement. The judgment of the Court of International Trade is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1665-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"AR56\">APPENDIX</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1665-7\">\u00a7 1526.

United States, </em>751 F.2d 1239, 1244-46 (Fed.Cir.1985), a recent decision of this court plowing much of the ground of the CIT\u2019s current power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-10\">On the merits, I agree with the majority that the challenged Customs regulation is valid because Customs could properly, for its own administrative and enforcement purposes, provide that it would exclude less than all the trademarked goods that <em>might </em>turn out to be covered by \u00a7 1526(a), <em>i.e., </em>that Custom\u2019s own enforcement need not be coterminous with the full reach of that statute as it applies between private persons. Unlike the majority, I find that since 1936 the Customs regulations have been substantially consistent as they apply to imported goods comparable to those Vivitar says should be excluded in its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-12\">I do not join the court\u2019s opinion mainly because I think it is wholly inappropriate for this court to go further and to delve (as it does extensively in Part III of the majority opinion) into bases for construing \u00a7 1526(a) as that legislation applies between private parties. That type of discussion should be left to the district courts and the regional courts of appeals when they are faced with a suit (under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526(c), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1338) by the trademark owner against persons dealing in this country in merchandise said to have been imported in violation of \u00a7 1526(a). The CIT will never deal with those private-party suits and issues, and this court can reach them only if they happen to be joined with an appealed patent claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). To me, it is needless and gratuitous for this court, in this international trade case coming from the CIT, to indulge in lengthy dicta bearing on the full scope of \u00a7 1526(a), <em>obiter dicta </em>which will not bind any court in a private suit but which simply tends to confuse the trademark bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-13\">I certainly agree that we should make it clear that the Customs regulation does not <em>necessarily </em>cover the full sweep of \u00a7 1526(a), but it is not for us to indicate affirmatively (as the majority does), even in dicta, that that full sweep is actually wider than the regulation. The entire matter should be left to further litigation with which we can only be haphazardly concerned, if at all. All that we <em>hold </em>in this ease is that the Customs regulation is now valid as a Customs enforcement regulation. That is quite enough.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
