Marro, <em>Bankruptcy Judge, </em>dated May 17, 1984, dismissing an application by appellant California Chieftan (\u201cChieftan\u201d), a secured creditor, for an order compelling appellee Air Vermont, Inc. (\u201cAir Vermont\u201d), a debt- or-in-possession, to abandon certain property in its estate. 39 B.R. 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">Chieftain maintains that, as a conditional vendor of an aircraft to the vendee Air Vermont, it has a right, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110, to repossess the aircraft from Air Vermont, since the latter has defaulted on its payments. Air Vermont contends that, because Chieftan failed to perfect its security interest in the subject aircraft, it may not avail itself of any right to repossess under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">The bankruptcy court held that a creditor with an unperfected security interest in an aircraft may not repossess the aircraft pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. The court therefore denied appellant\u2019s motion which sought compulsory abandonment by Air Vermont of its interest in the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">We hold that, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110, the conditional vendor of the subject commercial aircraft should be permitted to repossess the aircraft from the debt- or-in-possession herein in view of Air Vermont\u2019s default, even though Chieftan\u2019s interest is unperfected. We therefore reverse the decision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-24\">Appellant Chieftan is a partnership consisting of W.M. Francis, W.M. Francis, Jr., and J.W. Coleman. With financing from the Bank of America, the partnership purchased a 1977 Piper Navajo aircraft (the \u201caircraft\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-25\">On April 27, 1982, Chieftan and Air Vermont, an air taxi operator and commuter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>air carrier operating under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201.1-.5 (1984), executed a contract for the conditional sale of the aircraft from Chief-tan to Air Vermont. The conditional sales contract gives Chieftan the right to repossess and resell the aircraft in the event of a default by Air Vermont. The contract also states that the purchase of the aircraft by Chieftan had been financed with a loan from Bank of America, Santa Ana Main Branch, Santa Ana, California. The aircraft was not registered in the name of Air Vermont with the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d), as required by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 47.1-.51 (1984), nor was a copy of the contract filed with the Aircraft Registration Branch of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On January 31,1984, having defaulted on payments under the conditional sales contract, Air Vermont filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On March 7, 1984, Chieftan moved in the bankruptcy court for an order to compel Air Vermont to abandon the aircraft pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. After notice and a hearing, on March 13, 1984, the bankruptcy court granted Chief-tan\u2019s motion, which had not been opposed by Air Vermont, and ordered that Chieftan could take possession of the aircraft for purposes of resale, subject to the condition that, within two weeks, Chieftan would provide documentation of a perfected security interest in the aircraft. The aircraft was surrendered by Air Vermont to Chief-tan, pursuant to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Following a second hearing on April 13, 1984, the bankruptcy court learned that the conditional sales contract had not been filed with the FAA. Chieftan urged, however, that the order to abandon property should nevertheless be continued pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. Air Vermont, on the other hand, moved to vacate the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of March 13, 1984, due to the absence of a perfected security interest. On April 14, 1984, the bankruptcy court granted Air Vermont\u2019s motion, vacated its prior order, and ordered Chieftan \u201cnot to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of said aircraft, nor turnover the aircraft to any other secured or unsecured party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The bankruptcy court, by order dated May 17, 1984, denied Chieftan\u2019s motion for an order directing Air Vermont to abandon the aircraft under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. The court held that a creditor who has failed to perfect its security interest in an aircraft by filing with the FAA may not avail itself of any right to repossess under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110. In accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b), direct appeal was made to this Court by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The estate of a debtor who files a petition for bankruptcy includes, among other things, \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property <em>as of the commencement of the case.\u201d </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) (emphasis added). Moreover, it is on this date that the debtor-in-possession, or the trustee, becomes a hypothetical lien creditor who may avoid an unperfected security interest. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544. Herein, as of the date that Air Vermont filed its petition for bankruptcy, i.e., as of January 31, 1984, Chieftan had not perfected its security interest pursuant to the requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403. Therefore, absent some exception, Air Vermont, as the debtor-in-possession, could avoid Chieftan\u2019s security interest. <em>In Re O.P.M. Leasing Services, Inc., </em>23 B.R. 104, 116 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 1982); <em>In Re Jerome, </em>31 B.R. 266, 268 (Bankr.D.Vt.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Chieftan argues that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 provides an exception that grants it the power to repossess the aircraft. According to Chieftan, although a debtor-in-possession, as a hypothetical lien creditor, may avoid the assertion of an unperfected security interest pursuant to \u00a7 544 of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 1110 requires special preferred treatment for security interests in aircraft and is unaffected by \u00a7 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">In essence, \u00a7 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code does permit a conditional vendor of specified aircraft to repossess the aircraft if the debtor defaults on its debt, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>such repossession is in accordance with the conditional sales contract, despite the usual protections afforded to debtors-in-possession or trustees pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">Section 1110 states in pertinent part: The right of a ... conditional vendor of ... aircraft, ... that are ... conditionally sold to, a debtor that is an air carrier operating under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board, ... to take possession of such equipment in compliance with the provisions of a ... conditional sale contract ... is not affected by section 362 or 363 of this title or by any power of the court to enjoin such taking of possession,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The bankruptcy court offered three reasons in support of its conclusion that a secured creditor may not avail itself of \u00a7 1110 if its conditional sales contract is unperfected, as is the case herein. We find these reasons to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">First, the bankruptcy court points to the legislative history of \u00a7 1110 and states that the \u201clegislative history does not stand for the proposition that the holder of an unper-fected security interest in aircraft or vessels is to be afforded the same or more rights than are available to secured creditors holding perfected security interests.\u201d However, our own reading of the legislative history and statutory scheme of \u00a7 1110 causes us to conclude that Congress did intend to extend extraordinary protection to financiers of aircraft in order to encourage investment in new equipment for air carriers, especially small ones such as Air Vermont. H.R.Rep. No. 944, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1957), <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1926, 1927; S.Rep. No. 1032, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1957) (Statement of Rep. Flynt); H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 238-39 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5963, 6198. Chieftan correctly contends that Congress intended to encourage this investment, by providing that the power of creditors to repossess aircraft from a defaulting debtor not be restricted in any way by the usual protections afforded debtors-in-possession or trustees by the Bankruptcy Code. According to the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the purpose of section 116(5), the immediate predecessor to \u00a7 1110,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[was] to provide that the parties to a lease or conditional sale of specified aircraft equipment be rendered <em>immune </em>from the provisions of chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act in regard to the repossession of such property.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1032, at 2 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The report of the House Judiciary Committee contains a virtually identical statement of purpose. H.R.Rep. No. 944, at 2. In addition, we are unaware of any reference to the need for recording in the legislative histories of either \u00a7 1110 or \u00a7 116(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Next, the bankruptcy court cites two cases to support its position that if a creditor holding a security interest in aircraft does not record the security instrument with the FAA pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403, his security interest is subordinate to the rights of either a trustee or a debtor-in-possession. Both cases, however, are in-apposite. In both <em>In re Pagasus International Travel Club, </em>15 B.R. 842 (Bankr.M.D.Pa.1981) and <em>Feldman v. First National City Bank, </em>368 F.Supp. 1333 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>511 F.2d 460 (2d Cir.1975), \u00a7 1110 was inapplicable because the debtors were not air carriers under FAA regulations, as required by \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Moreover, contrary to Air Vermont\u2019s contention, <em>In re Belize Airways Limited, </em>7 B.R. 601 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1980), a case in which a conditional vendor attempted to rely on \u00a7 1110 to repossess collateral, does not indicate that filing is material to a creditor\u2019s power under \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In <em>Belize Airways, </em>the creditor had conditionally sold certain ground equipment, but had not recorded the sales contract with the FAA or state authorities. The bankruptcy court held that the creditor could not repossess under \u00a7 1110 because \u201cthe equipment conditionally sold does not fall within the terms of the definitions contained in the Federal Aviation Act ... since it is not used or capable of being or intended to be used in the navigation, operation or control of aircraft during flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. Since the creditor could not avail itself of \u00a7 1110, the court held the creditor\u2019s otherwise unperfected security interest to be void as against the trustee under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\"><em>Belize Airways </em>thus holds that the conditional vendor could not repossess under \u00a7 1110 because the first element of \u00a7 1110, i.e., the requisite type of equipment, was not satisfied. The court stated that, given the absence of protection under \u00a7 1110, the conditional vendor\u2019s position was that of an ordinary secured creditor, which could be defeated by the trustee under \u00a7 544 for lack of perfection by filing. As noted, the <em>Belize Airways </em>court did not point to the lack of filing as having any bearing on the creditor\u2019s power under \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The third reason cited by the bankruptcy court to support its position that the rights provided by \u00a7 1110 are not available to a vendor whose interest is unperfected relates to the actual language of \u00a7 1110. Section 1110 states in part that \u201c[t]he right of a ... conditional vendor ... to take possession ... is not affected by section 362 or 363 of this title or by any power of the court to enjoin such taking of possession ...\u201d According to the bankruptcy court, since Congress explicitly stated that the right to possess existed notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 362 and 363 (the automatic stay provisions), if Congress had wanted \u00a7 1110 to override \u00a7 544 (granting a hypothetical lien creditor rights superior to those of a creditor with an unperfected security interest), it would have said so. The bankruptcy court concluded that the omission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u00a7 544 meant that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1110 to abrogate \u00a7 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">From our perspective, however, we think it more significant that \u00a7 1110 makes no mention whatsoever that a conditional sales contract must be recorded in order for \u00a7 1110 to apply. Rather, \u00a7 1110, on its face, empowers a vendor of aircraft pursuant to a conditional sales contract to repossess the aircraft provided only that elements of the section are satisfied. As Chieftan argues, since the statute is unambiguous on its face in this respect, and since this is not one of those \u201crare and exceptional circumstances [when there is] something to make plain the intent of Congress that the letter of the statute is not to prevail,\u201d <em>Crooks v. Harrelson, </em>282 U.S. 55, 60, 51 S.Ct. 49, 51, 75 L.Ed. 156 (1930), quoted in <em>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 187 n. 33, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2298 n. 33, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), the statute\u2019s literal meaning must be applied, and no condition of recording may be superimposed on the requirements explicitly specified in order for \u00a7 1110 to apply. Furthermore, since the language of \u00a7 1110 goes beyond excluding merely \u00a7\u00a7 362 and 363 and, if the requirements of \u00a7 1110 are satisfied, allows creditors to repossess notwithstanding \u201cany power of the court to' enjoin such taking of possession,\u201d the bankruptcy court is unable to grant relief to a trustee or a debtor-in-possession .by virtue of its powers under \u00a7 544 or under any other provision of law. Thus, provided the requirements for applicability of \u00a7 1110 are satisfied herein, the bankruptcy court was precluded from preventing Chieftan from repossessing the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">According to appellant Chieftan, all of the express requirements for repossession set forth in \u00a7 1110 have been satisfied. Chieftan is a conditional vendor; the collateral is an aircraft; Air Vermont is an air carrier operating under FAA regulation; and the conditional sales contract provides that Chieftan may repossess the aircraft if Air Vermont defaults in its obligations thereunder. Since the bankruptcy court found that Air Vermont has defaulted on its payments and has neither cured nor acted to cure the pre-petition default under \u00a7 1110(a)(1), (2), Chieftan contends that it has the right, pursuant to \u00a7 1110, to repossess the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Air Vermont maintains, however, that one of the requirements for repossession under \u00a7 1110 has not been satisfied. It contends that the ability of a conditional vendor to exercise the right afforded by \u00a7 1110 is contingent upon there being a valid agreement from which the right to repossess arises. While admitting that the subject contract provides that Chieftan may repossess the aircraft if Air Vermont defaults, it argues that since Chieftan failed to record its conditional sales contract as required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(a), the contract is invalid based upon 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(c), and Chieftan is not entitled to the benefits afforded conditional vendors of aircraft by virtue of \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1301(19) of title 49 of the United States Code, a contract for the conditional sale of civil aircraft falls within the purview of the Federal Aviation Act. According to the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(a), the Administrator (Secretary of Transportation) shall establish and maintain a system for the recording of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ny ... contract of conditional sale, or other instrument executed for security purposes, which ... affects the title to, or any interest in, any specifically identified aircraft engine or engines____\u201d Furthermore, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(c) states that \u201c[n]o conveyance or instrument the recording of which is provided for by [\u00a7 1403(a) ] shall be valid ... against any person other than the person by whom the conveyance or other instrument is made or given, ... until such conveyance or other instrument is filed for recordation in the office of the Secretary of Transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Based on these statutory provisions, Air Vermont contends that the conditional sales contract herein is not valid, since it was not filed with the FAA. Therefore, according to Air Vermont, one of the conditions of \u00a7 1110 has not been satisfied, i.e., the requirement that the right to repossess be in compliance with a valid conditional sales contract, and hence Chieftan may not repossess the aircraft pursuant to \u00a7 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Indeed, as Air Vermont states, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(a), (c) does state a general requirement that a conditional sales contract conveying an interest in aircraft be recorded in order for the contract to be valid. Section 1403(c), however, states an exception, which is applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Section 1403(c) states that \u201c[n]o conveyance or instrument the recording of which is provided for by [\u00a7 1403(a) ] shall be valid ... against any person <em>other than the person by whom the conveyance or other instrument is made or given, </em>... until such conveyance or other instrument is filed for recordation in the office of the Secretary of Transportation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403(c) (emphasis added). Under the terms of that statute, the conditional sales contract allowing Chieftan to repossess in the event Air Vermont defaults is valid between the parties, <em>see Philko Aviation, Inc. v. Shacket, </em>462 U.S. 406, 103 S.Ct. 2476, 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 678 (1983), and provides a basis for repossession. In our view, that is all \u00a7 1110 requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Accordingly, because all of the statutory conditions for repossession under \u00a7 1110 have been satisfied, we reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u00a7 1110.
