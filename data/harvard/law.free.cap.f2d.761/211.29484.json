(Greyhound). In proceedings before the RCT, Greyhound sought a 15% increase in its Texas intrastate passenger rates and package express rates and a 26% increase in its intrastate charter rates. Trailways Lines, Inc. (Trailways) intervened and submitted evidence supporting Greyhound\u2019s request. On November 28, 1983, the RCT denied the rate increases requested by Greyhound and adopted the recommendation of an examiner that Greyhound should receive only a 6.4% increase in its intrastate passenger, package express, and charter rates. The decision applied to all other intrastate motor bus carriers in Texas. Both Greyhound and Trailways, in separate proceedings, petitioned the ICC to review and set aside the RCT\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In setting aside the decision of the RCT, the Commission acted under \u00a7 17 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (the Bus Act), codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e). Section 11501(e) significantly changed the relationship of state agencies and the ICC with respect to the regulation of intrastate bus transportation. It grants the ICC more extensive authority to preempt state regulation of intrastate bus rates. The ICC may preempt state regulation when (1) a carrier has requested a rate change and the state has denied that request in whole or in part, or has failed to act on the request within 120 days, and (2) the Commission finds that the challenged rate, rule, or practice in effect .imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Section 11501(e)(2)(A) establishes three rebut-table presumptions concerning when an intrastate rate imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Greyhound and Trailways sought to invoke the first of these, \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i), which provides that an intrastate rate imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce if it \u201cresults in the carrier charging a rate for such transportation which is lower than the rate such carrier charges for comparable interstate transportation of passengers.\u201d One may rebut the presumption by establishing differences in operating conditions, services, or costs between intrastate and interstate operations sufficient to justify the rate disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Before the Commission, the RCT argued that the presumption did not apply because, although the fares of Greyhound and Trailways for intrastate travel may have been less than the published fares for interstate travel, the statute requires the ICC to look at the rates actually charged, and the actual interstate rates of Greyhound and Trailways were lower than the intrastate rates when excursion fares, discount fares, and reduced rate fares (collectively excursion fares) were taken into account. The RCT supported its argument by citing evidence which indicates that the carriers\u2019 revenue per passenger-mile was higher for their intrastate operations than for their interstate operations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The Commission rejected the RCT\u2019s arguments in both the Greyhound and the Trailways proceedings for identical reasons. In rejecting the argument that an effective rate comparison must take into account excursion fares, the Commission invoked its general policy that such fares should not be taken into account because they are typically initiated for promotional or advertising purposes and frequently are effective only for limited time periods. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Commission also' rejected the RCT\u2019s comparison of revenue per passenger-mile for intrastate and interstate services because the RCT did \u201cnot determine the relative profitability of these services, absent a similar comparison of costs.\u201d <em>Greyhound Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10893, at 4 (February 21, 1984). The Commission, faulting the revenue per passenger-mile data relied upon by the RCT because it compared intrastate trips with interstate trips of much greater average length, stated that \u201c[w]e do not consider this to represent \u2018comparable transportation\u2019 within the meaning of the statute, particularly as it is well known that costs per passenger mile decline significantly with trip length.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Consequently, in both decisions, the Commission found that the RCT\u2019s partial denial of the proposed passenger, package express and charter rate increases resulted in intrastate rates which caused unreasonable discrimination against, and imposed an unreasonable burden on, interstate commerce. It, therefore, approved the sought rate increases in full. The State of Texas, on behalf of the RCT, appeals both decisions of the Commission and the appeals have been consolidated. The issues and arguments are the same in both cases, except that the issue dealing with intrastate charter rates applies only to the action involving Greyhound, because Trailways did not challenge that issue before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">For the reasons that follow, the decisions of the Commission in these cases are reversed and both actions are remanded to the Commission in order for it to consider excursion fares in the process of determining whether intrastate rates are less than interstate rates. In all other respects, the decisions of the Commission are affirmed. In doing so, we hold that the rebuttable presumption of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) does apply to package express rates and the ICC does have jurisdiction to prescribe intrastate charter rates and package express rates for a motor common carrier of passengers under \u00a7 11501(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">We are called upon to review the propriety of a general policy of the ICC which excludes excursion fares from the comparison of intrastate and interstate rates required by \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). Under this policy, upon comparing the intrastate rates with the published or non-discounted interstate rates, the Commission determined that the interstate rates were greater and that, consequently, a rebut-table presumption arose that maintenance of the intrastate rates unreasonably burdened interstate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To uphold the Commission\u2019s determination, the agency decision must satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1977). These requirements were fully explicated in <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Section 706(2)(A) requires a finding that the actual choice made was not \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 5 USC \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1964 ed., Supp. V). To make this finding the court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. Although this inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 823 (citations omitted); <em>see also Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. United States, </em>634 F.2d 137, 149 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 831, 102 S.Ct. 128, 70 L.Ed.2d 108 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Additionally, we are mindful that judicial review should be even more restrictive when, as respondents assert, \u201cthe Commission\u2019s interpretation is necessary to set in smooth motion the machinery of a new statute.\u201d In <em>National Cable Television Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Tribunal, </em>724 F.2d 176 (D.C.Cir.1983), however, the court reiterated the standard enunciated in <em>Volpe </em>and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">[i] n all cases, we attempt to assure ourselves that the agency has fairly attended to prescribed procedures____ [I]f Congress entrusts a novel mission to an agency and specifies only grandly general guides for the agency\u2019s implementation of legislative policy, judicial review must be correspondingly relaxed. [On the other hand,] [i]f Congress sets precise guidelines for agency action, courts must tightly review the agency\u2019s directives to determine whether the congressional instructions have been observed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">724 F.2d at 181 (citations omitted). In this action, the statutory directive to compare intrastate and interstate rates charged by a carrier is not a \u201cgrandly general guide\u201d; rather, it is a precise and specific guideline by which the ICC may presume, subject to rebuttal, the existence of an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">In <em>Western Coal Traffic League v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 772 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2160, 80 L.Ed.2d 545 (1984), we deferred to the regulations adopted by the ICC that were designed .to effectuate its statutory duties pursuant to the broad congressional directive to establish standards and procedures for making a market dominance determination. In our two proceedings, however, the ICC did not adopt or establish regulations to identify when intrastate rates imposed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce; rather, it simply attempted to follow the specific congressional directive to compare intrastate and interstate rates. Consequently, we need not merely \u201cdefer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute and affirm that interpretation if \u2018it has a reasonable basis in law\u2019 \u201d as required by <em>Western Coal. Id. </em>at 777. Moreover, the Supreme Court has recently noted, in this context, that \u201c[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See also Western Coal, supra, </em>at 782-83 (Rubin, J. and Reavley, J., dissenting). As our opinion <em>infra </em>makes clear, the statutory term \u201crates charged\u201d unambiguously evidences Congress\u2019 intent that the Commission compare the actual rates charged. Accordingly, we decline respondents\u2019 invitation to \u201crelax\u201d judicial review of the ICC\u2019s decision and instead accept the duty to \u201ctightly review\u201d that decision to ensure that it is in accordance with the statutory guidelines and that it \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors____\u201d <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-21\">III. <em>Passenger Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-22\">The State of Texas argues that it is impossible to determine the rates actually charged by Greyhound and Trailways from a review only of published rates because the carriers changed their rates daily by offering excursion fares;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Texas argues, the ICC erroneously failed to consider the rates the carrier \u201ccharges\u201d <em>i.e., </em>actually charges, regardless of the published rates. Texas also argues that its data \u2014 that intrastate revenues per passenger-mile exceed interstate revenues per passenger-mile \u2014 conclusively establish that intrastate rates of Greyhound and Trailways were higher than their interstate rates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In responding to these arguments, the Commission defends its general policy of excluding excursion fares in comparing intrastate and interstate rates by asserting that these fares are effective for only limited periods and that consequently the published rate is, more often than not, the rate that is actually charged. The Commission also attacks the statistical logic underlying Texas\u2019 revenue per passenger-mile data. We will address the latter dispute first.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A. Revenue Per Passenger-Mile</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The State of Texas introduced evidence before the RCT that Trailways\u2019 intrastate revenue is 8.562$ per passenger-mile while its interstate revenue is only 6.985$ per passenger-mile. Similarly, Texas introduced evidence that Greyhound\u2019s intrastate revenue is 7.432$ per passenger-mile, while its interstate revenue is only 5.832$ per passenger-mile. This evidence is based upon cumulative averages, however, and noteably fails to compare intrastate and interstate revenue per passenger-mile for journeys of comparable length. For example, in its rebuttal before the Commission, Trailways correctly acknowledged that a comparison of revenues or fares for intrastate and interstate trips of comparable length is more illustrative of differing rates and gave the following illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEu\">[I]f a passenger were to purchase a ticket today from Dallas, Texas to Shreveport, Louisiana and from Dallas, Texas to Waskom, Texas, which represents a mileage difference of approximately 22 miles, the standard interstate fare would be $31.00, or .1422 cents per bus mile in revenue, while the intrastate fare would be $17.05, or $.0870 cents per bus mile in revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Notwithstanding the remaining question\u2014 are the \u201cstandard\u201d interstate fares representative of the actual fares charged or should excursion fares be considered (and if the latter, whether the interstate fare would be lower in this example) \u2014 , we agree that a comparison of the actual fares charged of comparable length journeys is the preferable data for revealing unequal or discriminatory rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Commission rejected the RCT\u2019s revenue per passenger-mile comparisons because the data used by the RCT compared, on a cumulative average basis, a large number of relatively short intrastate trips with interstate trips of much greater average length. As support for its action, the Commission has aptly stated in another proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">It is well known that the costs of transportation by bus and by virtually every other mode are not directly proportional to length of haul, but that costs per mile for short trips are typically much higher than for long trips. This reflects the influence of costs of ticketing, baggage handling, other station expenses, and other expenses which do not vary significantly (or at least not proportionally) with the length of the trip. This in turn is reflected in the rate structure for bus and virtually all other forms of transportation: rates or fares per mile are typically much higher for short trips than for long trips. The higher short haul rates or fares per mile reflect the fact that short haul costs per mile are significantly higher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Greyhound Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10921, at 3 (April 18, 1984) (not printed), <em>aff'd sub nom. Public Service Commission of West Virginia v. ICC, </em>749 F.2d 32 (4th Cir.1984). We agree with the foregoing reasoning of the Commission. The State of Texas\u2019 revenue per passenger-mile data fail to take into account the disparate costs between interstate and intrastate service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission properly rejected the RCT\u2019s revenue per passenger-mile comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">B. Excursion Fares</p>\n<p id=\"AaL\">Our agreement with the Commission with respect to its rejection of Texas\u2019 revenue per passenger-mile data does not also resolve the issue of the Commission\u2019s failure to consider excursion fares. In its decision in the Greyhound petition, the Commission explained its general policy excluding consideration of excursion fares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyG\">The Commission has specifically addressed and rejected the argument that an effective rate comparison as contemplated by subsection 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) must take into account excursion fares and other discounts applicable to a petitioner\u2019s interstate rate structure. See, for example, No. MC-C-10866, <em>Petition of Greyhound Lines, Inc., for Review of a Decision of the California Public Utilities Commission Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11501 </em>(not printed), decided September 9, 1983. Promotional-type discount or ceiling fares or rates for certain qualifying traffic are generally initiated for promotional or advertising purposes and are frequently effective only for limited time periods. Therefore, we have concluded that such reduced rate options should generally not be considered in making rate comparisons under \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\"><em>Greyhound Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10893, at 4 (February 21, 1984); <em>see also Trailways Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10891, at 6 (January 31, 1984). We disagree with this general policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The application of the foregoing policy in actions such as these results in a comparison of rates that do not necessarily reflect the actual rates charged. Because the Commission impliedly agrees that the statute requires a comparison of <em>actual </em>rates charged,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> its failure to consider the excursion fares resulted in decisions that were not \u201cbased on a consideration of the relevant factors\u201d and that were the product of \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 823. Accordingly, for this reason and for the reasons that follow, the decisions of the Commission are reversed and these actions are remanded so that the Commission may compare intrastate rates with interstate rates taking into account the impact of excursion fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The State of Texas brought forth considerable evidence that passengers traveling in interstate traffic were doing so at excursion fare rates in a majority of cases. The RCT, in its original proceeding, surveyed a sample of tickets issued for interstate travel selected by Greyhound and found that 89% of those tickets represented excursion fares. Although Greyhound stated in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>rebuttal before the Commission that it was unable to determine how the RCT arrived at this percentage, it admitted that 67% of the tickets were purchased at an excursion fare. The Commission noted that these excursion fares were employed for a limited time; however, the record indicates that the Joint Reduced Fare Tariffs of Greyhound have no expiration date. Moreover, the record indicates further that Trailways\u2019 Excursion Fare Tariff was in effect for over six months. This evidence is certainly sufficient to raise a serious question before the Commission as to whether it could justifiably invoke its general policy excluding consideration of excursion fares and still expect to make a valid comparison of the actual rates charged in intrastate and interstate traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Greyhound did submit some data that took excursion fares into account. Greyhound submitted a table comparing intrastate and interstate fares for travel between various cities, organized by mileage brackets. Certain entries are, in fact, based on temporary competitive reduced fares and it appears that, even with the reduced fares, the interstate rate per passenger-mile is higher than the intrastate rate per passenger-mile. However, there is no indication from Greyhound or from the Commission whether the data selected by Greyhound is exhaustive of the excursion fares offered. Trailways, on the other hand, submitted no data involving excursion fares. Greyhound\u2019s data failed to conclusively show either that excursion fares represented an insignificant percentage of interstate revenue or that the rebuttable presumption should have been invoked even if the Commission had considered the excursion fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">While determining the impact of excursion fares upon intrastate and interstate rates and weighing the evidence before it is a task particularly well suited to the Commission, it has neither the authority nor the discretion to entirely disregard excursion fares in making rate comparisons under \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). Because the statute contemplates a comparison of the <em>actual </em>intrastate and interstate rates, we hold that the Commission should not invoke its general policy \u2014 that excursion fares should not be considered in comparing intrastate and interstate rates \u2014 unless it has found that to do so would nevertheless yield a reasonable approximation of the actual rates charged. The Commission, of course, must be allowed certain latitude in efficiently and effectively exercising its agency functions. <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 916, 920 (5th Cir.1981); <em>State of Texas v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 87, 89-90 (5th Cir.1981). On the other hand, states and state regulatory bodies have an interest in ensuring that intrastate rates will not be preempted unless discriminatory rate structures actually exist. <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977) (\u201cWhere, as here, the field which Congress is said to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied by the States, \u2018we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 This assumption provides assurance that \u2018the federal-state balance,\u2019 will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by the courts.\u201d) (citations omitted). Accordingly, a balancing of these interests leads this Court to conclude that the Commission\u2019s exercise of its general policy excluding consideration of excursion fares is to be sanctioned only in those cases where it has found that the published rates, in fact, represent a reasonable approximation of the actual rates. In all other cases, the Commission is bound to consider excursion fares and assess their impact on intrastate and interstate rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Our holding today is supported by several considerations. First, we are convinced that the purpose of the Bus Act is furthered by imposing this requirement upon the Commission. We note, initially, that none of the parties has cited any legislative history defining or interpreting the phrase \u201crates charged\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). Similarly, this Court has uncovered no support in the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>history for the parties\u2019 positions. Nevertheless, the statute represents the response to a clear concern with the need for uniformity in the national transportation system. 127 Cong.Rec. H8588 (daily ed. Nov. 19, 1981) (remarks of Rep. Clausen). More specifically and with respect to the preemption of state regulation provided by \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i), the Senate recognized that \u201cthe carrier who is unable to raise rates high enough on its intrastate route is forced to charge its interstate travelers an inequitable price to remain financially viable. The impact of such practices presents a substantial burden on interstate commerce.\u201d S.Rep. No. 97-411, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 8, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2308, 2315 (Senate Report). It is this inequality of rate structures which resulted in the . inclusion of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) as an amendment to the Bus Act and led the conference committee to find that \u201cthe existing Federal and State regulatory structure has tended to impair, in certain circumstances,. the ability of carriers to enter markets and to maximize use of equipment and opportunities to expand.\u201d H.Conf.Rep. No. 97-780, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 32, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S. Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 2342, 2343 (Conference Report).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Were we to allow the Commission, through its newly acquired power, to preempt state regulations and prescribe intrastate rates without first requiring it to determine whether a disparity between intrastate and interstate rates actually exists, the ICC could exercise this power in situations in which the evils that led Congress to create this power do not exist. Such a result would contravene the very purpose of the 1982 amendment. Accordingly, Congress\u2019 concern with the burden imposed upon interstate commerce by an <em>actual </em>disparity of intrastate and interstate rates leads us to conclude that the Commission in certain instances must examine the impact of excursion fares upon interstate rates in its \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Second, the Commission\u2019s general policy excluding consideration of excursion fares presents a unique opportunity for active misrepresentation of actual interstate rates by carriers in an effort to induce the Commission to preempt state regulated rate ceilings. By artificially increasing published interstate rates while maintaining actual, reduced interstate rates through extended excursion fares, carriers could rely upon the Commission to find that intrastate rates are lower than interstate rates and consequently to adjust upwards their intrastate rates. The State of Texas contends, in its brief on appeal, that \u201cthe regulatory agency could order rates published which are three hundred percent (300%) higher than interstate tariffs, then prescribe \u2018working\u2019 tariffs in effect for indefinite periods of time. The published rates would bear no relationship to what the carrier was actually paid.\u201d While we may disagree with the extent of possible misrepresentations predicted by Texas, we nevertheless consider the possibility of such representations sufficiently disturbing to warrant the requirement that the Commission review not only the published fares but also the excursion fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Third, we reject the Commission\u2019s sole argument in support of its general policy excluding consideration of excursion fares. The Commission argues, in its brief on appeal, that its policy is \u201csupported by the strong public policy favoring the elimination of inter- and intra-state rate disparities.\u201d The Commission then asserts that \u201c[bjecause the Commission\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and entitled to great deference, it should not be disturbed.\u201d (citing <em>National Ass\u2019n of Greeting Card Publishers v. United States Postal Service, </em>462 U.S. 810, 820, 103 S.Ct. 2717, 2725, 77 L.Ed.2d 195, 204 (1983); <em>FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild, </em>450 U.S. 582, 598, 101 S.Ct. 1266, 1276, 67 L.Ed.2d 521 (1981)). There is an inherent failure of logic in such an argument. The Commission fails to recognize that a policy excluding consideration of excursion fares will not accurately determine the actual intrastate and interstate rates charged and consequently will cause the Commission to overestimate rate dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>parities. In some instances, the Commission may determine a rate disparity where none, in fact, exists. In such cases, the Commission\u2019s exercise of its preemption power will result in the prescription of intrastate rates which exceed the \u201cactual\u201d interstate rates. Moreover, there is no logic to the argument that the Commission\u2019s policy is supported by \u201cthe strong public policy favoring the elimination of inter- and intra-state rate disparities,\u201d when a disparity of rates does not actually exist. We reject the Commission\u2019s argument that the admittedly important goal of eliminating intrastate and interstate rate disparities somehow lends support to a policy of the Commission that refuses to examine the rates the carriers are actually charging.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s decisions in these matters should have given consideration to excursion fares in determining whether the published rates of these carriers in fact represented a reasonable approximation of the actual rates charged. Since the Commission has failed to do so, a clear error of judgment has resulted; accordingly, we find the Commission\u2019s findings were \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1977). The decisions of the ICC will be set aside and these actions will be remanded for further proof in order for the Commission to determine the impact of excursion fares as part of the \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">IV. <em>Package Express Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKU\">The State of Texas challenges the jurisdiction of the Commission over intrastate package express rates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It argues that the plain meaning of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) which refers to \u201cinterstate transportation of passengers\u201d calls for the presumption to apply only to movement of people, not property; that the wording of the statute is clear; and that, consequently, there is no need to look beyond the official text of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. ICC, </em>724 F.2d 472, 477 (5th Cir.1984). We disagree with Texas\u2019 initial premise that the plain meaning of the statute is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Initially, we set forth the relevant provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e), the statute in dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, there shall be a rebut-table presumption that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(A) any rate, rule, or practice applicable to <em>transportation provided by a motor common carrier of passengers </em>entirely in one State imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce if the Commission finds\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">(i) that such rate, rule, or practice results in the carrier charging a rate for <em>such transportation </em>which is lower than the rate such carrier charges for <em>comparable interstate transportation of passengers;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">(emphasis added). In support of its argument that \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) applies only to rates for transportation of passengers and not for transportation of property, Texas points out that while \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A) refers broadly to all types of transportation provided by motor common carriers, the language of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) is more concise and refers only to \u201ccomparable interstate transportation of <em>passengers.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Rather than conclude that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>language is clear or that such language evidences a clear intent on the part of Congress to apply this presumption only to transportation of passengers, we believe a review of the legislative history is warranted because of the statute\u2019s inherent ambiguity and because Texas\u2019 reading of the statute conflicts with Congressional aims embodied in the Bus Act. <em>See, e.g., Steere Tank Lines, Inc., </em>724 F.2d at 477-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">As Texas properly points out, the language of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A) is broad; it impliedly refers to all forms of transportation of a motor common carrier including transportation of <em>property </em>\u2014 e.g., package express. Nevertheless, the language of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) compares \u201csuch trans<em>portation\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., all forms of transportation of a motor common carrier, including package express \u2014 to \u201ccomparable interstate transportation of passengers.\u201d It is illogical to compare the rates of several forms of transportation to the rates of one form of transportation (passenger service). If Congress had intended to only compare intrastate and interstate passenger rates, it might very well have added the words \u201csuch transportation <em>of passengers </em>\u201d to the language of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). As we are convinced that the language of the statute is unclear, we turn to the legislative history of the 1982 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Our review of the legislative history of the Bus Act uncovers no evidence that Congress considered applying the rebuttable presumption of subsection (i) only to passengers. On the contrary, the reports of the House, Senate and of the conference committee make clear that the entire procedure for the preemption of state rates, rules, or practices provided by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e) applies also to package express rates. For example, in the Conference Report, <em>supra, </em>at 52, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2363, the committee described the Senate amendment, which was adopted by the conference committee, in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">The Senate amendment creates a new subsection (e) to section 11501 which details the procedure for preempting State decisions with respect to rates and practices. <em>This procedure would also apply to State rate decisions affecting package express rates or </em>practices____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">There is a rebuttable presumption that any intrastate bus rate, rule or practice imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce if the ICC finds that: (1) such rates, rule, or practice results in the carrier charging a rate for intrastate transportation which is lower than the rate for comparable interstate transportation; ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">(emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 28, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2308, 2335; H.R.Rep. No. 97-334, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 45 (1982). As the Commission noted in its brief on appeal, \u201c[a]ll three reports directly apply the procedures of Section 11501(e) to package express rates, and all three exclude the words \u2018of passengers\u2019 in describing the re-buttable presumptions of Section 11501(e)(2)(A).\u201d We can only conclude from the clear and consistent message imparted in the legislative reports that Congress did not intend to exclude package express rates from the provisions of \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). Consequently, we hold that the rebuttable presumption of subsection (i) applies to package express as well as passenger rates, rules and practices.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>V. <em>Preemption Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"aco-dedup-0\">The State of Texas and Greyhound, as intervening respondent, challenge the jurisdiction of the ICC to set intrastate charter rates. Texas also challenges the jurisdiction of the Commission to set intrastate package express rates. Upon reviewing the relevant statutory provisions of the Bus Act, we are convinced that the Bus Act empowers the Commission with the authority to preempt state rates, rules and practices with respect not only to passenger rates but also to intrastate charter and package express rates. Because the statutory language is clear and because adopting Texas\u2019 position would contravene the central purpose of the Bus Act, we conclude that \u00a7 11501(e) grants the ICC jurisdiction to preempt and set intrastate charter and package express rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The State of Texas notes that \u00a7 11501(e) limits the scope of the Commission\u2019s preemption power to cases involving \u201cany rate, rule or practice applicable to transportation provided entirely in one State by a motor common carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchap-ter II of chapter 105 of [Title 49]____\u201d The Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under subchapter II is prescribed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10521, which in turn, Texas asserts, limits the Commission\u2019s power to prescribe rates for intrastate transportation to the type of transportation that is subject to Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10922(c)(2) and 11501(e). Section 10922(c)(2) clearly provides that the Commission has jurisdiction over carriers providing \u201cregular-route transportation.\u201d As a result, Texas argues that because intrastate charter service is not \u201cregular-route transportation,\u201d the Commission does not have jurisdiction under 11501(e). In furtherance of this argument, Texas asserts, without support, that the Bus Act evidences an intent not to grant the ICC jurisdiction over intrastate charter operations and charges and that the legislative history of the statute further evidences Congress\u2019 intent to provide for the preemption of intrastate regular-route transportation and not the preemption of intrastate charter transportation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">As Texas properly notes, the scope of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction is set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10521. Subsection (b)(2) to that provision authorizes \u201cthe Commission to prescribe or regulate a rate for intrastate transportation provided by a motor carrier\u201d \u201cexcept as provided in sections 10922(c)(2) and 11501(e).\u201d Texas fails to explain why we should read this language to empower the Commission with jurisdiction as provided by \u00a7 10922(c)(2) and not also as provided by \u00a7 11051(e). We agree with the Commission\u2019s assessment that \u201cbecause sections 10922(c)(2) and 11501(e) are two entirely separate intrastate rate provisions, there is no basis for the RCT\u2019s contention that the former somehow limits or restricts the latter.\u201d <em>Greyhound Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10893, at 2 (August 17, 1984) (on petition for reconsideration of ICC\u2019s decision of Feb. 21, 1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction may be determined by looking at the language of \u00a7 11501(e) itself. Our review of that provision leads us to conclude the Commission has jurisdiction to review and prescribe intrastate charter and package express rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Section 11501(e)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he Commission shall prescribe <em>any </em>rate, rule or practice\u201d applicable to intrastate trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>portation provided by a carrier which also provides transportation that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, (emphasis added). The plain language of the provision entrusts the Commission with the power to prescribe \u201cany,\u201d and therefore \u201call,\u201d rates charged by the applicable carriers. Moreover, Texas\u2019 contention that the language at the end of subsection (e)(1)\u2014 \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title\u201d \u2014 somehow limits the Commission to a review of intrastate regular-route rates is misplaced. Rather, we agree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation that such language \u201cwas added only to ensure that the Commission's review and prescription of intrastate rates was confined to those of interstate motor carriers of passengers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold that intrastate charter rates and package express rates are subject to the Commission\u2019s preemption powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Our holding today is supported further by the fact that Congress, in other sections of the Bus Act, has expressly and selectively singled out charter transportation from other types of transportation. For example, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10708(d)(4) provides, under certain circumstances, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">[notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers, or joint rate proposed by one or more such carriers, applicable to any transportation <em>{other than special or charter </em>transportation) on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">(emphasis added). Consequently, had Congress intended to limit the jurisdiction of the ICC to a review of regular-route rates, and to exclude the Commission\u2019s review of charter rates, it would have expressly singled out charter transportation as it did in \u00a7 10708(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over intrastate charter rates and package express rates under \u00a7 11501(e)(1) is also supported by legislative history and by the purpose of the Bus Act. In discussing the Senate amendment to \u00a7 11501(e), which was adopted by the conference committee except for minor technical changes, the Conference Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">The Senate amendment, with two exceptions, confers a review power in the ICC with respect to all proposed increases in intrastate passenger fares and express rates. The first exception is that the States would retain full authority over the rates of carriers owned by or controlled by a State or local government. Secondly, State ratemaking authority over the intrastate rates of solely intrastate carriers would not be affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZP\">Conference Report, <em>supra, </em>at 52, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2363. The committee\u2019s failure to mention intrastate charter rates within the reach of the two exceptions provides support for the Commission\u2019s position.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, as Greyhound properly asserts, in its brief as intervenor, \u201c[n]ot only does RCT\u2019s truncated view of the ICC\u2019s preemptive authority find no support in the statutory language, such [a] view would also be contrary to Congress\u2019 intent to eliminate burdensome and discriminatory State rates, rules and practices.\u201d One of the principal goals of the Bus Act is the elimination of \u201cthe previous lack of uniformity in standards and procedures that governed rate-setting by interstate rail carrier____\u201d <em>State of Texas v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 339, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 267, 83 L.Ed.2d 203 (1984). In addition, the Senate Report noted that \u201ca large number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of routes, particularly intrastate routes serving rural communities, are cross-subsidized by more profitable interstate routes and charter operations.\u201d Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 8, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2315. Precluding burdens on interstate commerce, including burdens on interstate charter operations, that result from a lack of uniformity in rate structures is a primary goal of the Bus Act; consequently, it is highly improbable that Congress would fail to grant the Commission the preemptive power necessary to reach that goal. The legislative history of \u00a7 11501(e) and the purpose of the Bus Act, as well as the clear language of the statute and Congress\u2019 failure to expressly exclude intrastate charter transportation from the Commission\u2019s preemption power, lead this Court to conclude that Congress empowered the Commission to preempt and prescribe rates applicable to intrastate charter transportation and to intrastate package express transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We REVERSE the decisions of the Commission and REMAND these actions in order for the ICC to consider the excursion fares offered by the carriers. In order to exclude excursion fares from its comparison of intrastate and interstate rates, the Commission must expressly find that the published rates offered by each carrier, represent in fact a reasonable approximation of the actual rates charged. If the Commission does not so find, it must then consider the excursion fares in its \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) analysis. In all other respects, the petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. The RCT erroneously assumes that since revenue per passenger-mile is higher for intrastate transportation, then intrastate rates must be higher than interstate rates. <em>See </em>part III A, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">. Title 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e) grants to the ICC review of intrastate rates and sets out the presumptive burdensome effect on interstate commerce of a disparity, as found by the Commission, between intrastate and interstate rates. The statute, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agq\">(1)(B) if the Commission finds that the rate, rule, or practice in effect and applicable to such intrastate transportation causes unreasonable discrimination against or imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">(A) any rate, rule, or practice applicable to transportation provided by a motor common carrier of passengers entirely in one State imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce if the Commission finds\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">(i) that such rate, rule, or practice results in the carrier charging a rate for such transportation which is lower than the rate such carrier charges for comparable interstate transportation of passengers____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-15\">. The parties heatedly dispute the length of time that excursion fares were employed and the rate' at which the published fares were changed or turned over. As our decision does not necessitate the resolution of this issue, we leave its resolution for the Commission on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. The State of Texas argues in the alternative that even if the presumption of an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce was raised, this proof of <em>actual </em>\u201crates\" effectively rebutted the presumption. It is unclear, however, whether the State also asserts that the higher intrastate revenue per passenger-mile data lend more credence to its argument that the ICC\u2019s review of only the published rates was erroneous. Because we conclude that the revenue per passenger-mile data offered by Texas are misleading and unpersuasive, <em>see </em>part III A., <em>infra, </em>we do not consider this data offered by the State in determining the propriety of excluding excursion fares from the comparison of intrastate and interstate rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. The State of Texas objects strongly to the Commission\u2019s statement that \"comparisons of revenue per passenger-mile for interstate and intrastate services do not determine the relative profitability of these services absent a similar comparison of costs.\u201d <em>Greyhound Lines, </em>ICC Decision No. 10893, at 4 (February 21, 1984). Texas contends that the statute\u2019s reference to rates \"charged\u201d speaks to revenue and not to profitability. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i). While the plain meaning of the statute supports Texas\u2019 interpretation, we are of the opinion that the Commission\u2019s reference to \"profitability\u201d more likely than not was a reference to the disparate cost structures of intrastate and interstate traffic. Nevertheless, we need not decide whether a comparison of profitability is appropriate under \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) as we believe the Commission was entirely correct in concluding that the lower cost factors for lengthy interstate trips (of considerable length across some points of Texas) as compared to higher costs for short intrastate trips rendered Texas\u2019 statistics misleading and unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\">. In justifying its general policy excluding excursion fares, the Commission argues that the \"published, base rate is the rate that is charged normally.\u201d The premise of such an argument is that excluding excursion fares is proper because the Commission is still comparing the <em>actual </em>rates charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. Initially, Texas argued that the \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) presumption is not applicable to package express rates. In response to the Commission\u2019s contention that Texas' argum\u00e9nt was not raised before the Commission and therefore waived, Texas concedes that \"this question goes to the jurisdiction of the ICC over package express rates.\u201d While our resolution of the jurisdictional issue, <em>see </em>part V, <em>infra, </em>might leave unresolved the question of the applicability of the \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) presumption to package express rates, we believe that the Commission\u2019s utilization of the subsection (c) rebut-table presumption in the course of its decision places the question properly before this Court. The Commission\u2019s application of the presumption to package express rates can be inferred from language in the decision that \"Greyhound\u2019s allegation that the intrastate rates sanctioned by the RCT are .. burdensome to interstate commerce stands <em>unrebutted, </em>except for <em>package express rates </em>in the 0-10 pound, category.\u201d ICC Decision No. 10893, <em>supra, </em>at 5 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we proceed to determine the applicability of the \u00a7 11501(e)(2)(A)(i) presumption to package express rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. Although the legislative history provides this Court with a clear picture of Congress\u2019 intent, we are not unmindful that the Commission\u2019s application of the rebuttable presumption to package express rates constitutes \"the construction of a statute by [the party] charged with its execution\u201d and that such a construction \"should be followed if it is reasonably defensible.\" <em>United States Department of Justice v.
