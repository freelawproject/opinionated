(1) FNMA\u2019s liability for Hammond\u2019s alleged violations of the Texas Debt Collection Act (TDCA), Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat.Ann. arts. 5069-11.01 to 5069-11.11 (Vernon Supp.1985), (2) the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>On the first issue FNMA claims this Court should determine as a matter of law that Hammond was an independent contractor of FNMA, thereby insulating FNMA from liability for Hammond\u2019s conduct. Whether Hammond was an independent contractor rather than an agent of FNMA is a question reserved for the trial court upon remand. We deny the motion for rehearing insofar as it relates to FNMA\u2019s claim that it had no liability for Hammond\u2019s alleged actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On the second issue FNMA urges us to reconsider our opinion upholding the denial by the district court of its motion for attorney\u2019s fees. At this stage FNMA\u2019s request cannot be made the subject of a ruling since FNMA has not been exonerated of liability under the TDCA. We do grant the motion for rehearing on this issue to the extent that we modify our opinion to allow the district court to reconsider the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees to FNMA in the event it determines that FNMA is not liable under the Texas Act. Under our remand the district court will retain discretion in the awarding of fees even though attorney\u2019s fees are authorized in the contract. The court may weigh whether such an award would be inequitable or unreasonable in this case. 756 F.2d 1197, 1210; <em>Cable Marine, Inc. v. M/V Trust Me II, </em>632 F.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">FNMA\u2019s motion for rehearing therefore is GRANTED to the extent that, on remand, the district court is authorized to reconsider FNMA\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In all other respects the motion for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The petition of Hammond Mortgage Corporation for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
