In his complaint, Johnson requested declaratory and equitable relief, alleging that the judges, in their respective capacities, wrongly decided a fourth amendment suppression issue in his criminal trial and on his direct appeal. The district court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution. We affirm but on the ground that Johnson has failed to present a case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">In late 1977, Johnson was tried and convicted in state court for aggravated rape. Prior to trial, Johnson filed a motion to suppress evidence the police had seized from his vehicle. The trial court denied the motion. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found the search to be valid and affirmed the conviction. The United States Supreme Court subsequently denied a writ of certiorari. <em>Johnson v. Texas, </em>451 U.S. 909, 101 S.Ct. 1978, 68 L.Ed.2d 297 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">In early 1984, Johnson filed the present action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for declaratory and equitable relief, contending that the refusal to suppress by the trial court and the affirmance by the court of appeals violated his constitutional rights. The district court ordered Johnson to refile his claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as a petition for federal habeas corpus relief. When Johnson refused to alter his pleadings, the district court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution. Johnson then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-18\">Before a federal court may issue a declaratory judgment, the Federal Declaratory Judgement Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that there be \u201ca substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <em>Emory v. Peeler, </em>756 F.2d 1547, 1552 (11th Cir.1985). <em>See also Lake Carriers\u2019 Association v. MacMullan, </em>406 U.S. 498, 506, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1755, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972) (present continuing actual controversy requisite); <em>Wolfer v. Thaler, </em>525 F.2d 977, 979 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 2176, 48 L.Ed.2d 800 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">In <em>Emory, </em>the plaintiff, a former juror in a state court murder trial, filed suit against the judge who presided over the trial. The plaintiff requested, inter alia, declaratory relief and alleged, inter alia, that the judge had singled him out at the close of the trial as the only juror to vote against the death penalty. The Eleventh Circuit found that there was no controversy because there was no \u201cfactual allegation ... that such conduct has continued or will be repeated in the future,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[a] declaration that [the judge\u2019s] past conduct violated [the plaintiff\u2019s] constitutional rights ... \u2018would be nothing more than a gratuitous comment without any force or effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Emory, supra, </em>at 1552 <em>(quoting Northern Virginia Women\u2019s Medical Center v. Balch, </em>617 F.2d 1045, 1049 (4th Cir. 1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>In the present case, Johnson has likewise failed to show that an actual controversy exists. Johnson argues that past judicial conduct has violated his constitutional rights. He does not argue that \u201csuch conduct has continued or will be repeated in the future.\u201d <em>Emory, supra, </em>at 1552. In effect, he is seeking to use the Declaratory Judgment Act to appeal his criminal conviction. This he may not do. <em>See Shannon v. Sequeechi, </em>365 F.2d 827, 829 (10th Cir.1966) (\u201cThe [Declaratory Judgment] Act does not provide a means whereby previous judgments by state or federal courts may be reexamined, nor is it a substitute for appeal or post conviction remedies.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing Johnson\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-14\">. Section 2201 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-15\">\u00a7 2201. Creation of remedy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or nor further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
