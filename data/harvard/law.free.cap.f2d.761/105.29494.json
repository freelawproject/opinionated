The parties\u2019 briefs refer to zoning ordinances, to a licensing and permit ordinance, and to a building permit, all of which bear on the proposed operation of an \u201cadult bookstore\u201d that would offer \u201csexually explicit books and magazines\u201d and include coin-operated viewing machines exhibiting \u201csexually explicit films.\u201d Appeal is by the City of West Haven, Connecticut (\u201cthe City\u201d), from the grant of a preliminary injunction by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, T.F. Gilroy Daly, Chief Judge, enjoining the City from enforcing its zoning and licensing ordinances against appellee 754 Orange Avenue, Inc. (\u201c754 Orange\u201d), and ordering the City to issue a building permit to 754 Orange as had been previously ordered by the district court. Since the case was briefed, however, the City has complied with the building permit portion of the injunction, and that issue is therefore moot. Although the zoning and licensing issues are not moot, the City conceded on oral argument, as it had not in its brief, that the City\u2019s prohibition on coin-operated viewing machines in retail stores is invalid. For the parties\u2019 guidance, however, we will treat the zoning and licensing ordinances as if such a concession had not been made, since the controversy as to the location of an \u201cadult bookstore\u201d \u2014 a term the ordinance does not define \u2014 is a live and viable one. We affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">754 Orange leases premises that the district court located at 760-762 Orange Avenue, West Haven, Connecticut, but that the parties stipulated to be located at 761 Orange Avenue. At these premises, 754 Orange intends to operate an adult bookstore that would offer, in addition to books and magazines, films that are accessible to its customers through individual coin-operated viewing booths. The parties stipulated that the books and magazines, as well as the films, portray \u201csexually explicit\u201d activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ty. Precisely what \u201csexually explicit\u201d means is, so far as the record discloses, left to the reader\u2019s as well as to the court\u2019s imagination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On February 24, 1984, 754 Orange applied to the City for a building permit, apparently to make renovations necessary to conduct the business of the bookstore, and presumably pursuant to a building ordinance that the parties have not seen fit to include in our record. Although we assume that the sale of books and magazines was a permitted use under the City\u2019s then-existing zoning ordinances and therefore posed no bar to the issuance of a building permit, the City\u2019s zoning ordinances did contain a section that arguably imposed restrictions, if not a prohibition, on 754 Orange\u2019s contemplated use of its leased premises. Entitled \u201cUse Group 10,\u201d section 32-2.7 of the City\u2019s 1967 zoning regulations, as amended effective May 1, 1982, identifies a category, Use Group 10, which \u201cconsists of all indoor or outdoor recreation centers, and amusement, athletic and entertainment facilities.\u201d Under section 32-2.7, uses falling within Use Group 10 are prohibited in \u201cresidential areas or local commercial districts ... due to the traffic and noise that they generate\u201d and allowed only by Special Permit in other zoning districts. A special permit is to be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission subject to five enumerated considerations \u2014 \u201clocation on the street system and impact on traffic patterns,\u201d \u201ctype of structure located in,\u201d \u201coff street parking,\u201d \u201cdistance to schools, parks and playgrounds,\u201d and \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d In addition to the foregoing considerations, section 32-2.7 authorizes the Planning and Zoning Commission to \u201cset any restrictions it deems necessary to insure the health, safety and welfare of the general public including screening, security, personnel, minimum floor space and hours of operation,\u201d and to recommend the revocation of a Special Permit on a finding \u201cthat the permitted use is generating excessive noise, loitering, littering or traffic hazards.\u201d Section 32-2.7 also contains a list of uses that are \u201camong those included in Use Group 10\u201d \u2014 a list that, when 754 Orange applied for its building permit, contained the entry \u201cAmusement Centers.\u201d Finally, section 32-2.7 grants the Director of Planning discretionary authority to permit temporary fairs or carnivals operated as fund raising activities and to permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae2\">A maximum of four (4) coin operated amusement machines or game tables ... in any sitdown eating or drinking facility, recreation or social club or amusement facility as an accessory use if the applicant can demonstrate that these machines or tables are clearly incidental to the primary business, and that they will be operated and maintained in such a manner so as to prevent excessive noise, loitering, littering or traffic hazards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Planning Director\u2019s discretion is limited, however, in that \u201c[n]o coin operated amusement machines or game tables shall be permitted in any retail store, wholesale establishment, office or manufacturing facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The extent to which section 32-2.7 of the City\u2019s zoning ordinances in its then-current state was applicable to the use contemplated by 754 Orange for its leased premises is unclear. The installation of coin-operated viewing booths in a bookstore might arguably convert a bookstore into an \u201camusement center\u201d and therefore make applicable the Special Permit provision of section 32-2.7, conditioning the use of the leased premises on approval of the City\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission after submission of information about the operation of the business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is also unclear but arguable that 754 Orange\u2019s coin-operated viewing machines are \u201ccoin-operated amusement machines\u201d within the meaning of section 32-2.7, thereby engaging either the four machine maximum imposed upon \u201cclearly incidental\u201d uses of such machines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>or the flat ban against them in retail stores. Perfectly clear, in contrast, is the inapplicability of the \u201cdistance to schools, parks and playgrounds\u201d provision of the then-current section 32-2.7, which states that \u201c[n]o commercial recreational facility shall be located on a property within a one-thousand (1000) foot radius of a park, playground or public or private primary or secondary school,\u201d since 754 Orange\u2019s leased premises are between 1,000 and 1,500 feet from May V. Carrigan Middle School, the nearest school, park, or playground.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As if the City\u2019s zoning ordinance were insufficient to confuse the status of the use contemplated by 754 Orange for its leased premises, the City also has a licensing and permit ordinance that raises similar issues of applicability while authorizing a different mode of enforcement. Adopted on September 27, 1982, section I of this ordinance establishes, inter alia, a license requirement for \u201cmechanical amusement device[s] (including video games).\u201d The licensing and permit ordinance also provides, at section II, that \u201cthe [pjolice [department ... shall in its reasonable discretion and subject to its approval issue the above stated licenses and permits and shall provide suitable forms and blanks and applications and shall keep suitable records of all licenses and permits and applications.\u201d Furthermore, under its provisions, the police department may \u201crevoke a license or permit for any breach of the terms and conditions thereof, upon giving to the person to whom the same is issued notice of such revocation, and making a record thereof.\u201d There is no provision for appealing to any court a denial of a license or permit application or a revocation of a license or permit; instead, appeal must be made within ten days to the City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">None of the foregoing issues concerning the applicability and enforcement of the City\u2019s zoning and licensing ordinances were addressed, much less resolved, when 754 Orange applied to the City for a building permit. Instead, the City\u2019s Building Official, defendant Steven Di Pier, simply refused to issue the building permit. In response, on April 23, 1984, 754 Orange filed this action in the district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment against the City and against Daniel Krevolin, Steven Di Pier, Michael N. D\u2019Errico, and Lawrence Minichino, who were the City\u2019s Zoning Enforcement Officer, Building Official, Chief of Police, and Mayor, respectively. An order to show cause issued, and on May 4, 1984, the district court ordered that the City\u2019s Building Official issue a building permit no later than May 7, 1984. The permit did not issue, a motion for contempt was filed, and on May 14 a hearing was held on the contempt. On May 23, following the filing of an amended complaint on May 15 and a stipulation of facts by the parties, the district court issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">Based on the pleadings and representation of counsel in this matter, it is hereby ordered that the defendant Steven Di Pier as building official for the City of West Haven and/or his successors or whomever is empowered either on a permanent or temporary basis to issue building permits on behalf of the City of West Haven, Connecticut, to <em>[sic </em>] issue a building permit for the plaintiff\u2019s leased premises known as 760-762 Orange Avenue, West Haven, Connecticut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Counsel for the plaintiff is to be notified immediately by counsel for defendants upon appointment of any. person who becomes authorized to issue building permits in the City of West Haven.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">In another order issued the same day, the district court ordered that defendant Lawrence Minichino, the City\u2019s Mayor, in no way impede or obstruct the issuance of a building permit to the plaintiff. The Mayor responded by removing the defendant Steven Di Pier from the position of Building Official on May 31, 1984, while declining himself to issue any building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">On June 15, 1984, the City amended section 32-2.7 of its zoning ordinances, increasing the minimum distance required between a \u201ccommercial recreational facility\u201d and a school, park or playground from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1,000 feet to 1,500 feet and adding \u201cAdult Bookstores\u201d to the list of uses falling within Use Group 10. As a result, to the extent that the use contemplated for 754 Orange\u2019s leased premises constituted a \u201ccommercial recreational facility,\u201d those premises were no longer in compliance with section 32-2.7. Furthermore, under the newly amended section 32-2.7, 754 Orange\u2019s proposed \u201cadult bookstore\u201d would clearly be required to obtain a Special Permit from the Planning and Zoning Commission, and to conform to the Special Permit Requirements referred to earlier, as well as to any further restrictions set forth by the Planning and Zoning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">On the basis of the newly amended section 32-2.7, the City moved for dismissal of 754 Orange\u2019s complaint. The district court referred the City\u2019s motion to dismiss and 754 Orange\u2019s cross-application for a preliminary injunction to Thomas P. Smith, United States Magistrate, who issued a sixteen-page recommended ruling on September 26, 1984, in favor of 754 Orange\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">After citing this circuit\u2019s requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction, <em>see Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Magistrate first addressed plaintiff\u2019s showing of irreparable harm, finding that even if \u201ccoin operated amusement machines\u201d were \u201cartificially interpreted\u201d not to include film-viewing devices, irreparable harm would still follow from the denial of a preliminary injunction, since the application of a term as \u201cundefined, ambiguous and sweeping\u201d as is \u201ccommercial recreational facilities\u201d within section 32-2.7 would impermissibly vest in the Chief of Police an \u201cunfettered freedom to characterize any use listed in \u2018Use Group 10\u2019 [citation omitted] as being subject to the radius requirement [of section 32-2.7], should he choose to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The Magistrate went on to find that 754 Orange had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. He found no evidence that a legally significant governmental interest was presented to or considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission when it increased the radius requirement under section 32-2.7 to encompass 754 Orange\u2019s leased premises. The Magistrate reasoned that because the zoning ordinance created more than merely \u201cincidental\u201d limitations on First Amendment activity, it was justifiable only if \u201cthe governmental interest [was] unrelated to the suppression of free expression,\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). He found, however, that the evidence before him \u201cstrongly suggests the zoning resolutions were amended in order to frustrate plaintiff\u2019s sale and display of sexually explicit material.\u201d Alternatively, the Magistrate found that 754 Orange had shown a likelihood of success on the merits, in that, taken together, section 32-2.7 of the zoning ordinance and section II of the licensing ordinance are impermissibly vague and overbroad within the meaning of <em>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 150-51, 89 S.Ct. 935, 938-39, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Addressing also the second prong of the <em>Jackson Dairy </em>test, the Magistrate found that 754 Orange had sustained its burden of showing not only sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation but also a balance of hardships tipping decidedly towards plaintiff. In this connection, the Magistrate found that \u201ca serious due process question\u201d was raised where, as here, an application for a permit was made, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court order to grant that permit had issued, and a recalcitrant city then relied on an ordinance amended thereafter as justification for denying the permit. Finally, the Magistrate noted that there had been no affirmative showing that the City would be irreparably harmed by the grant of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Adopting the Magistrate\u2019s recommendations in full, Chief Judge Daly granted a preliminary injunction as above stated by an order dated October 15, 1984. '</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">1. <em>The \u201cAdult Bookstore\u201d Issue. </em>The arguments as set forth in the briefs are like ships passing in the night, never seeming to have contact with each other. One may gather, however, that the City\u2019s claim is that 754 Orange did not show that enforcement of the zoning regulations would cause it irreparable harm because, as in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976), the operation of adult bookstores is not eliminated but simply restricted as to location in order to preserve the quality of urban life and, as the City claims here, to protect children from distractions disturbing to an educational environment. The City argues further that the irreparable harm alleged by 754 Orange, the deprivation of a fundamental right, cannot be shown here because prurient or erotic expression does not further the core purposes of the First Amendment. <em>Cf. FCC v. Paci-fica Foundation, </em>438 U.S. 726, 746, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3038, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality opinion) (sexual or excretory language occupies inferior position in hierarchy of First Amendment values).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">To anyone who would contemplate establishing a bookstore business within the City\u2019s jurisdiction, the City\u2019s threat to enforce its zoning and licensing ordinances against 754 Orange operates as a prior restraint. <em>See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 552-58, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1243-46, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975); <em>Shuttlesworth, </em>394 U.S. at 150-51, 89 S.Ct. at 938-39. We say this, because absent a definition of \u201cadult bookstore\u201d that would confine the application of section 32-2.7 to a store purveying or making a business of purveying \u201csexually explicit\u201d literature as explicitly defined, for example, in the Detroit ordinance under consideration in <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. at 53 n. 4, 96 S.Ct. at 2444 n. 4, the City\u2019s zoning and licensing restrictions may, in the hands of its administrators, sweep into its scope literature that has always been accorded full First Amendment protection. <em>Cf. Carlin Communications, Inc. v. FCC, </em>749 F.2d 113, 119 (2d Cir.1984) (regulation of indecent material must be carefully limited because of inherent dangers in regulating any form of expression).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Moreover, while it may be permissible for a city to regulate the time, place, and manner of operation of a bookstore, it cannot do so indiscriminately;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 75-76, 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>S.Ct. 2176, 2186-87, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981), \u201c[t]o be reasonable, time, place and manner restrictions not only must serve significant state interests but also must leave open adequate alternative channels of communication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The record before us, however, fails to justify section 32-2.7 as a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction by reference either to the presence of a significant state interest or to the existence of adequate alternative channels of communication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find no evidence whatsoever that would relate the impact \u2014 upon traffic patterns, current noise levels, or parking places \u2014 of \u201cadult bookstores,\u201d however precisely defined, to the promotion of the City\u2019s interest in reducing neighborhood decline or danger to children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, on the record before us, it is impossible to determine whether or not section 32-2.7 leaves open adequate alternative channels of communication; we have no idea as to what portions of the City of West Haven, if any, remain available for the operation of \u201cadult bookstores\u201d under the newly amended section 32-2.7. <em>Cf. American Mini Theaters, </em>427 U.S. at 71 n. 35, 96 S.Ct. at 2453 n. 35 (plurality) (no suppression of lawful speech where a myriad of permissible locations remains despite zoning restriction). As stated in <em>Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston, </em>652 F.2d 1115, 1120 (1st Cir.1981),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">[regulations governing in advance the time, place or manner of expression permitted in a particular public forum are valid if they serve important state interests by the least restrictive means possible. [Citations omitted.] Put another way, a regulation that is directed primarily at conduct or at noncommunicative aspects of protected expressive activities is permissible despite an incidental prior burden on expression if it is justified by sufficiently strong permissible government interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">As the matter was put in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679, the state\u2019s interest in regulating nonspeech conduct may sometimes justify incidental limitations on protected speech, but only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[1] it is within the constitutional power of the Government; [2] if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; [3] if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and [4] if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-10\"><em>See also </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>580-82, 682-84 (1978) (analyzing indirect abridgement of free flow of infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>mation or ideas). In contrast to the City of Boston\u2019s satisfaction of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test in <em>Fantasy Book Shop, </em>652 F.2d at 1121, the City of West Haven does not meet the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test because the newly amended section 32-2.7 as drawn and as enacted appears to reflect a governmental desire to suppress free expression. Section 32-2.7 is impermissible as drawn, because it ignores the fact that what is \u201cprurient\u201d or \u201cerotic\u201d to one person may be mere realism or sheer art to another; the City\u2019s virtually total failure to recognize, much less discharge, its responsibility to protect freedom of expression against whatever legitimate but competing concerns it may have had, as that failure is reflected in a zoning ordinance that restricts without even defining the operation of \u201cadult bookstores,\u201d evinces an intent that cannot be said to be \u201cunrelated to the suppression of free expression\u201d under the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In addition, section 32-2.7 is impermissible as enacted, because its adoption strongly suggests that it was aimed solely at 754 Orange. Only after the City learned that 754 Orange\u2019s leased premises is beyond 1,000 feet from any school, park or playground did the City amend the ordinance so as to include 754 Orange\u2019s building within its scope. It is true that, as a matter of general zoning law in Connecticut, a permit applicant does not have a vested right in the existing classification of his land; instead, his right to establish a particular use may be summarily terminated by an amendment that reclassifies his land and outlaws the use in question. <em>See Edward Balf Co. v. Town of East Granby, </em>152 Conn. 319, 323, 207 A.2d 58, 60 (1965); 1 R. Anderson, <em>American Law of Zoning </em>\u00a7 6.20, at 399 (2d ed. 1976). Even as a matter of zoning law, however, a court will not allow changed building zone regulations to act as a bar to a building project where it would be inequitable to do so. <em>Marmah, Inc. v. Town of Greenwich, </em>176 Conn. 116, 123, 405 A.2d 63, 67 (1978). That the equity of notice, if not its right, may be a legitimate consideration in First Amendment eases appears clear from Justice Powell\u2019s key, concurring opinion in <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. at 80, 96 S.Ct. at 2457 (emphasis added), where he justified the ordinance at issue in part by the fact that it <em>\u201cwas already in existence, and its purposes clearly set out, </em>for a full decade before adult establishments were brought under it.\u201d Thus, in <em>Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson, </em>667 F.2d 659, 662-63 (8th Cir.1981), a case in which a zoning ordinance restricting the showing of sexually explicit films was struck down, the Eighth Circuit, sitting en banc, relied heavily on the fact that the ordinance was enacted after the city council was informed of the impending opening of an adult theater. So, too, it has been noted in <em>Purple Onion, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>511 F.Supp. 1207, 1224 (N.D.Ga.1981), that \u201c[m]ost adult zoning ordinances passed in the wake of <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>have contained grandfather clauses permitting pre-existing, nonconforming uses as to all regulated adult businesses.\u201d The City simply did not \u201c \u2018adequately justif[y] its substantial restriction of protected activity,\u2019 \u201d <em>Avalon Cinema, </em>667 F.2d at 662 (quoting <em>Schad, </em>452 U.S. at 72, 101 S.Ct. at 2184), in a manner sufficient to justify its ex post facto treatment of Orange Avenue\u2019s contemplated use.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In sum, we think that 754 Orange showed both a threat of irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits in its challenge to the City\u2019s enforcement of its zoning ordinance against the operation of its bookstore.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">2. <em>The Coin-Operated Machines Issue. </em>In light of the provision in section 32-2.7 that \u201cno coin operated amusement machines ... shall be permitted in any retail store,\u201d the City conceded at oral argument that its zoning ordinance operates as an absolute bar to coin-operated amusement machines (assuming that the ordinance applies at all to coin-operated viewing machines in private or individual booths).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>But even if that provision were to be eliminated by amendment, the City still would have serious problems with its licensing ordinance. This is true by virtue of the discretion given the police department (presumably the Chief of Police) under a licensing ordinance that sets forth no standards for the issuance or revocation of a license. <em>Shuttlesworth, </em>394 U.S. at 150-51, 89 S.Ct. at 938-39; <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 305-07, 60 S.Ct. 900, 904-05, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). Moreover, so far as appears on the face of the ordinance, there is no provision for judicial review as required under <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 58-59, 85 S.Ct. 734, 738-39, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965); <em>see also Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, </em>390 U.S. 676, 685, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 1303, 20 L.Ed. 225 (1968) (vague censorship standards are not cured merely by de novo judicial review). And lest there be any doubt as to irreparability of harm were the present ordinances to be enforced to prevent the coin-operated film machines from being utilized, 754 Orange would, like the appellee in <em>414 Theatre Corp. v. Murphy, </em>499 F.2d 1155, 1160 (2d Cir.1974), be required to choose between continuing without a license in its business, thereby subjecting itself and its employees to the threat of criminal and civil prosecution, or removing the machines from its premises permanently or temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Thus we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction. Doing so, however, we are careful to point out that it is possible for the City \u2014 at least if it were, and possibly if it were not, to follow the lead of other cities in the wake of <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>and \u201cgrandfather in\u201d existing uses \u2014 to draw an ordinance or ordinances that would limit the sale, showing, or purveyance of sexually explicit material or films, properly and specifically defined as such, at least in certain areas or certain distances reasonably related to the preservation of neighborhoods or the protection of children. It might also be possible to define what an adult bookstore is by the nature of its patrons and by limitations in respect thereto, on the one hand, and by reference to the nature of materials sold, on the other. The ordinances here in question, however, do not begin to meet the tests required by the Supreme Court or the lines drawn by this and other courts. The judgment therefore must be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\">. Under section 32-2.7, the Planning and Zoning Commission is to consider a Special Permit applicant's method of operation on the basis of \"[\u00a1Information concerning business hours, standards of conduct, personal security, maintenance, site plan and floor plan for the premise [that] shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. Under the standard for injunctive relief set forth in <em>Jackson Dairy, </em>596 F.2d at 72, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">(a) irreparable harm and (b) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decided toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. The Magistrate apparently thought that the Chief of Police could deny a license under the City\u2019s licensing ordinance by virtue of his construction of the City's zoning ordinance \u2014 a construction which, however, would seem in the first instance to be for the Planning and Zoning Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">. It is not at all clear, even after <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>that time, place, and manner analysis is appropriately applied to the instant circumstances. Time, place, and manner restrictions are permissible only where the restrictions are content-neutral. <em>See, e.g., Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 647-48, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563-64, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981); <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumers Council, </em>425 U.S. 748, 771, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1831, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976); <em>Carlin Communications, </em>749 F.2d at 120-21. Although Justice Stevens seems to have indicated in <em>American Mini The-atres, </em>472 U.S. at 71-72, 96 S.Ct. at 2452-2453, that the Detroit ordinance at issue was being upheld as a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction, such a view commanded only a plurality of the Court, and was flatly rejected by Justice Powell in his concurring opinion, <em>id. </em>at 82 n. 6, as well as by four dissenting Justices, <em>id. </em>at 84, 96 S.Ct. at 2459. Moreover, since <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>the Court has reaffirmed the requirement that any time, place, and manner restrictions be content-neutral, <em>see, e.g., Heffron, supra. </em>Our examination of the City\u2019s zoning ordinance under a time, place, and manner analysis should therefore be interpreted to assume arguendo the appropriateness of such an analysis, reflecting the influence of the plurality position in <em>American Mini Theatres.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>. </em>To the extent that the applicability of section 32-2.7 to 754 Orange\u2019s contemplated use would trigger the enforcement of section II of the City\u2019s licensing and permit ordinance, our discussion of section 32-2.7 pertains equally to section II as applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. In this sense, the comparison that the City attempts to draw between the circumstances in <em>American Mini Theatres </em>and those here is inapt. In <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. at 54-55 &amp; n. 8, 96 S.Ct. at 2444-45, &amp; n. 8, the City of Detroit expanded the scope of its \"Anti-Skid Row Ordinance\u201d in 1972 to include adult theaters and adult bookstores only after the number of adult theaters in Detroit grew from 2 to 25 within the previous 5 years, with \"a comparable increase in the number of adult bookstores and other 'adult-type businesses.'\u201d <em>American Mini Theatres. </em>Moreover, Detroit\u2019s decision to amend its zoning ordinance was based at least in part on the determination of urban planners and real estate agents that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">the location of several such businesses in the same neighborhood tends to attract an undesirable quantity and quality of transients, adversely affects property values, causes an increase in crime, especially prostitution, and encourages residents and businesses to move elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 55, 96 S.Ct. at 2445. In contrast, the City stated during oral argument that the adult bookstore contemplated by 754 Orange would be the first and therefore only such store in West Haven. Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence that the City sought or obtained a professional analysis of the extent to which 754 Orange\u2019s proposed adult bookstore, given the City\u2019s then-current zoning ordinances would affect the quality of urban life or the educational environment for children. It is apparent that while Detroit\u2019s amendment of its zoning ordinance was supported by professional analysis of a concrete situation, the City's amendment of section 32-2.7 appears to have been both undeliberated and speculative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b207-5\">. This concession strikes us as yet another puzzling feature of the City\u2019s litigation strategy, since it is not initially clear whether, under section 32-2.7, \"retail store\u201d refers to all stores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>engaged in the sale of goods <em>and </em>services to ultimate consumers, or whether the term is intended, as more commonly understood, to refer only to those stores engaged in the sale of goods or commodities. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1938 (1971) (\"retail\" defined as \"the sale of commodities or goods in small quantities to ultimate consumers \u2014 opposed to <em>wholesale </em>\u201d). The City's brief argues that the provision prohibiting retail stores from operating coin-operated amusement machines did not operate as a total ban, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa8\">[a]lternatively, the plaintiff could operate its\u2019 <em>[sic </em>] facility as an amusement hall rather than a retail bookstore. It is also conceivable that the plaintiff could rent another location within the forum (City of West Haven) in which to place only coin-operated booths, and it could continue to operate the bookstore as a separate entity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
