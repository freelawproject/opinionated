United States, </em>745 F.2d 1044 (7th Cir.1984). The petition for rehearing in this case was denied by an order of the court on April 8, 1985 (amended April 12, 1985) in view of this amended opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b418-6\">SWYGERT, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Cesar Moya was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. 1 (N.D.Ill.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>704 F.2d 337 (7th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 418, 78 L.Ed.2d 355 (1983). The district judge refused to suppress the evidence obtained from searching Moya\u2019s shoulder bag \u2014 501.77 grams of 35% cocaine \u2014 as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (quoting <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed.2d 441 (1963)). He concluded that the law enforcement officers had reasonable suspicion that Moya was carrying contraband and that therefore they were justified in detaining Moya\u2019s shoulder bag for three hours before obtaining a valid search warrant and conducting a dog-sniff test.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">The district judge\u2019s conclusion was based on the following facts. After deplaning, Moya surveyed the crowd, then walked toward the main terminal, periodically looking back over his shoulder as if trying to detect whether he was being followed. He entered a stall in a men\u2019s room and remained there for a few minutes without using the facilities. Although his only luggage was a shoulder bag, he hurriedly left the main terminal and did not go to the baggage claim area. When questioned by the law enforcement officers, Moya was hesitant to offer any identification. Finally, as he was reaching into the side pocket of his shoulder bag for identification, Moya exposed a corner of a clear plastic bag. Whey Moya was asked about the plastic bag, he denied that it existed. 561 F.Supp. at 11. Ultimately, Moya produced the plastic bag containing drug paraphernalia after one of the officers threatened to forceably remove it from Moya\u2019s shoulder bag. But in his determination of reasonable suspicion, the district judge specifically refused to consider the drug paraphernalia found in the clear plastic bag because he found that evidence to be the result of an \u201cunconstitutional, warrantless search.\u201d 561 F.Supp. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">On appeal, a majority of this court affirmed. <em>United States v. Moya, </em>704 F.2d 337 (7th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 418, 78 L.Ed.2d 355 (1983). We agreed with the district judge that the evidence, excluding the contraband found in the clear plastic bag, supported a finding of reasonable suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">The Supreme Court vacated and remanded our decision for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983). In <em>Place, </em>the Court held that a ninety-minute detention of luggage while awaiting the arrival of a trained narcotics detecting dog based upon less than probable cause violated the fourth amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">This court then sought additional briefing from the parties on the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">(1) Whether there was probable cause for the seizure of Moya\u2019s shoulder bag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-19\">(2) Whether there was any legal justification for the warrantless seizure of the clear plastic bag from Moya\u2019s shoulder bag, in particular whether the plastic bag fit within the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-20\">(3) Whether the three hour detention of Moya\u2019s shoulder bag could be persuasively distinguished from the ninety-minute detention that occurred in <em>Place?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-21\">We now hold that the facts on which the district court based its finding of reasonable suspicion do not support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>probable cause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the district court was correct in finding that the seizure of the plastic bag was unconstitutional, so that its contents cannot be considered in the determination of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The implications for personal privacy resulting from a finding of probable cause require that the standard be rigorously enforced. Probable cause requires sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe, not merely suspect, that a crime has been or is being committed. <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310-11, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). We must be especially cautious when the evidence that is alleged to establish probable cause is entirely consistent with innocent behavior. <em>See Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 2754, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Saperstein, </em>723 F.2d 1221, 1229 (6th Cir.1983). We find that the evidence available to the officers in this case was insufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime was being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">It is clear that the officers did not have probable cause at the time that they approached Moya in the taxicab line outside the airport. At that time the officers knew that Moya was arriving from Miami, had only carry-on luggage, scanned the crowd repeatedly, looked back over his shoulder, and \u201csought the privacy of a washroom stall for some reason other than a desire to relieve himself.\u201d <em>Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 4. Indeed, this information was insufficient to establish even reasonable grounds for suspecting that Moya was carrying contraband. <em>Id.; see Reid, </em>448 U.S. at 441, 100 S.Ct. at 2754 (reasonable suspicion not established by observations that suspects deplaned from a principal place of origin of cocaine for distribution, arrived in the early morning when law enforcement activity is diminished, carried only shoulder bags, and attempted to conceal the fact that they were traveling together).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">After being approached in the taxicab line, four events occurred that the district court found sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion. First, when asked for identification Moya responded that he had none. Then, when asked again for identification once inside the terminal, Moya proceeded to produce a driver\u2019s license from his shoulder bag. Third, while reaching into the bag, Moya exposed the corner of a clear plastic bag. Finally, when asked to produce the plastic bag, Moya responded that no plastic bag existed. <em>See Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 8. These four events were not sufficient to give rise to probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">Probable cause is not established either by failing to present identification upon request by a law enforcement officer, <em>see Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 2641, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>731 F.2d 1491, 1494 <em>modified on other grounds, </em>743 F.2d 1505 (11th Cir.1984), or by carrying a plastic bag in one\u2019s travel luggage, <em>see infra </em>at 326. The only question presented by the instant case is whether Moya\u2019s false responses to the officers concerning identification and the plastic bag gave the officers probable cause to believe he was engaged in criminal activity. There are several innocent explanations for a lack of forthrightness with law enforcement officers. A person could simply be mistaken or have forgotten; this explanation appears particularly plausible if one considers the stress that someone might reasonably feel when subjected to police questioning. Alternatively, a person could be attempting to conceal information that is personal or embarrassing but not criminal, or supplying answers that she or he believes will expedite the questioning process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>that Moya\u2019s seeming dishonesty with the officers was insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>See also Place, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2640, 2644 (no probable cause found although the defendant falsely reported to law enforcement officers that his luggage had already been searched by other officers).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The district court found that the war-rantless seizure of the plastic bag containing drug paraphernalia was unconstitutional and excluded the evidence from consideration in determining the reasonableness of the detention of the shoulder bag. <em>See Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 8-9. We agree with the district court (and the government\u2019s position at trial) that the search was illegal and the contents must therefore be excluded from our probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The district court correctly concluded that the plain view exception to the warrant clause was inapplicable to the seizure of the plastic bag, <em>see Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 9 n. 6. The plain view doctrine authorizes the warrantless seizure of personal property where the initial intrusion which affords the officers a plain view is lawful, the discovery of the property is inadvertent, and the incriminating nature of the property is \u201cimmediately apparent.\u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 466, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2038, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (plurality opinion); <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>723 F.2d 1288, 1295 (7th Cir. 1983) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2360, 80 L.Ed.2d 831 (1984). The phrase \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d does not \u201cimply that an unduly high degree of certainty as to the incriminatory character of evidence is necessary for an application of the \u2018plain view\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1542, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983). The character of the property must be such as to give the officers \u201cprobable cause to associate the property with criminal activity.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 587, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1380, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980); <em>see Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">There is nothing apparently incriminating about a plastic bag. Plastic bags are used by travelers for a variety of innocent purposes. Bags are used, for example, to carry wet items, to contain items that may spill, and to keep items sanitary. The exposure of the corner of the clear plastic bag did not give the officers probable cause to believe that the plastic bag contained contraband. <em>Contrast Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1543 (the incriminating nature of a tied-off balloon \u201ccommon[ly]\u201d used to carry narcotics found sufficiently apparent); <em>id. </em>at 1545 (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201cWe are not advised of any innocent item that is commonly carried in uninflated, tied-off balloons such as the one ... seized.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the plain view exception is inapplicable to the seizure of the contents of the plastic bag is further supported by consideration of the principle underlying the exception. \u201cThe principle is grounded on the recognition that when a police officer has observed an object in \u2018plain view,\u2019 \u201d the owner has no remaining privacy interest in the object. <em>Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1541. It is clear that Moya retained an expectation of privacy in the contents of his plastic bag even after exposing a corner of the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">In <em>Place, </em>the Supreme Court found unreasonable the ninety-minute seizure of the defendant\u2019s luggage based only on the law enforcement officers\u2019 reasonable suspicion that the luggage contained contraband. The Court stated, \u201c[W]e have never approved a seizure of the person for the prolonged 90-minute period involved here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>and cannot do so on the facts presented by this case.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2646. The Court, however, \u201cdeclinefd] to adopt any outside time limitation\u201d beyond which all such seizures would be unreasonable, and left the question of the reasonableness of a detention for resolution on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>We find no persuasive grounds for distinguishing the three hour seizure of Moya\u2019s shoulder bag from the ninety-minute seizure disapproved in <em>Place.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The officers who apprehended Moya admitted that they stationed themselves at the airport specifically to investigate the transportation of illicit drugs. Under these circumstances, we believe it is reasonable to expect officers to arrange to have a narcotics detecting dog readily available. <em>See also United States v. Puglisi, </em>723 F.2d 779, 791 (11th Cir.1984) (three hour detention of luggage while awaiting canine sniff-test unreasonable where officer had alternatives of having trained dog at airport or directing agents in the destination terminal to conduct the search); <em>cf. United States v. Sanders, </em>719 F.2d 882, 887 (6th Cir.1983) (detention found unreasonable where no explanation why agents did not arrange to conduct investigation at airport); <em>United States v. West, </em>651 F.2d 71 (1st Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>463 U.S. 1201, 103 S.Ct. 3528, 77 L.Ed.2d 1382 (1983) (remanding to district court question why agents did not have trained dog in immediate vicinity). In fact, the record in the instant case indicates that Moya\u2019s shoulder bag was eventually tested by a dog from the United States Customs Department located in the airport\u2019s international terminal; there is no explanation why it took three hours to transport the luggage from one terminal to another. <em>See </em>Transcript of December 1, 1980, at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In addition, the Court in <em>Place </em>found the unreasonableness of the search exacerbated by the officers\u2019 failure to inform the defendant where his luggage was being detained or how long the detention would last and to make arrangements for the return of the luggage if the sniff-test was negative. 103 S.Ct. at 2646. <em>See also Sa-perstein, </em>723 F.2d at 1233 n. 18. The officers acted similarly unreasonably with respect to the seizure of Moya\u2019s luggage.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We recognize that in <em>Place </em>the New York law enforcement officers were given advance notice by agents in Miami that the defendant, a suspected drug courier, was going to arrive. The Supreme Court held that the diligence with which law enforcement officers pursue an investigation is one factor, although not the only factor, to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a detention. The Court concluded that the officers involved in <em>Place </em>were less than diligent because they could have, but failed to, \u201carrange for their additional investigation ..., thereby ... minimizing] the intrusion on respondent\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests.\u201d <em>Place, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2645-46. Because the officers had alternatives that would have minimized the intrusion on Moya\u2019s fourth amendment interests, we do not find persuasive the fact that the officers had no advance warning that Moya would be arriving at the' airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and remanded with instructions to suppress all evidence seized from Moya\u2019s shoulder bag.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">. Even if the officers had probable cause to believe Moya\u2019s bag contained contraband, there would be a question whether the three hour detention of the bag before seeking a search warrant was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Saperstein, </em>723 F.2d 1221, 1232 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-15\">. We do not condone dishonesty with police officers.

Moya, </em>704 F.2d 337, 339-40 (7th Cir.1983), because the facts are vital to a proper determination of probable cause. I further dissent from the majori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ty\u2019s absolute refusal to apply the plain view doctrine recently enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) and this court in <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>723 F.2d 1288 (7th Cir.1983). Moreover, I dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to rule, as a matter of law, that in view of the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, the law enforcement officers had probable cause to seize Moya\u2019s shoulder bag, obtain a search warrant, and uncover 501.77 grams of 35% pure cocaine, valued at between $40,000 and $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The Supreme Court has recognized that each airport encounter involving the seizure of luggage believed to contain narcotics is unique and must be decided upon its particular facts and circumstances. <em>See United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 2646, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983). <em>Cf. Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 506-07, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1329, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (same rule applies to airport encounters involving the seizure of person believed to be carrying narcotics). The facts in this ease, as found by the district court in <em>United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 2-3, reveal that on March 20, 1980, Agent Labik of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) and Officer Kinsella of the Chicago Police Department were stationed at O\u2019Hare International Airport to monitor passengers arriving from certain cities considered to be \u201csources\u201d for the illegal drug traffic in Chicago, Illinois. At approximately 7:35 p.m., Labik and Kinsella observed the defendant, Cesar Moya, deplaning from Delta Flight 142, a nonstop flight originating in the \u201csource\u201d city of Miami, Florida. The officers observed Moya exit the arrival gate carrying a shoulder bag, walk across the concourse, suspiciously survey the crowd, and proceed toward the main terminal, repeatedly glancing backwards over his shoulder. Based upon years of experience in detecting drug couriers at O\u2019Hare International Airport, Officers Labik and Kinsella were convinced that Moya fit the \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d and thus followed Moya in close pursuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before reaching the main terminal, Moya, followed by Agent Labik, entered a public restroom, discovered that all of the enclosed stalls were occupied, and exited. Upon reaching the main terminal, Moya, this time followed by Officer Kinsella, entered another public restroom, found an open stall, entered, closed the door, stood there for several minutes, and again exited without using the facilities. Moya proceeded to the escalator opposite the Delta Airlines ticket counter and at the moment he made eye contact with Labik and Kinsella, boarded the down-escalator. When he reached ground level, Moya bypassed the baggage claim area, exited the terminal, and entered a cab line while still carrying his shoulder bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Labik and Kinsella, who were dressed in plain clothes, approached Moya in the cab line, identified themselves as law enforcement officers, and asked Moya, in a \u201crelaxed\u201d tone of voice, if they could speak with him. Moya agreed without hesitancy, and Officer Kinsella proceeded to ask for identification. Moya denied having any identification, but agreed, again without hesitancy, to move inside the terminal building to avoid the pedestrian traffic and the night chill. The officers and Moya entered the terminal and stationed themselves in a public foyer, between the primary and secondary exit doors, where questioning resumed. The officers asked Moya his name and he replied \u201cCesar Moya.\u201d Officer Kinsella next asked to see Moya\u2019s airline ticket, Moya agreed, and produced a one-way ticket from Miami, Florida to Chicago, Illinois, on Delta Flight 142, in the name of Cesar Moya. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>examining the ticket, Agent Labik asked Moya for further identification. Moya inquired \u201cwhat was this all about.\u201d Labik, ignoring Moya\u2019s comment, again asked for further identification and Moya responded by unzipping a side pocket of his shoulder bag, reaching into the pocket, and producing a Florida driver\u2019s license in his name and with his picture thereon. When Moya reached into the side pocket of his shoulder bag, Labik observed \u201ca clear plastic bag\u201d in plain view. Labik asked Moya to remove the plastic bag, Moya refused, insisting that he did not have a plastic bag, and Labik replied that if Moya did not remove the plastic bag, he (Labik) would. At that point, Moya reached into the side pocket of his luggage and removed the clear plastic bag which, according to Agent Labik\u2019s testimony, contained \u201c12, 14 other clear plastic bags that were rolled up and three small brown bottles that had black lids on them and onto each lid, each cap, was attached a small chain and a small gold spoon.\u201d Moya, giving a phony explanation, stated that he used the contents of the bag for jewelry, however, the well-trained and experienced Agent Labik recognized, at once, that the clear plastic bag contained narcotics paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The officers seized Moya\u2019s shoulder bag, returned to their airport headquarters, and detained the luggage for purposes of obtaining a search warrant. At approximately 8:15 p.m., Agent Labik contacted the United States Customs Office and requested a trained canine to \u201csniff test\u201d Moya\u2019s shoulder bag for narcotics. Some three hours later, at approximately 11:00 p.m., the trained canine arrived on the scene, and from a lineup of six similar pieces of luggage, picked out Moya\u2019s shoulder bag. About one-and-a-half hours later, at 12:35 a.m., the officers obtained a valid search warrant from a state court judge in Chicago, opened the shoulder bag, and uncovered 501.77 grams of 35% pure cocaine, valued at between $40,000 and $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">At the outset it is important to note that the majority does not, and legally cannot, dispute the district court's holding in <em>United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 7 that \u201cno constitutional seizure of Moya\u2019s person occurred in this case.\u201d Similarly, the majority does not, and legally cannot, dispute the original holding by a majority of this panel (Judges Cudahy and Coffey with Judge Swygert dissenting) in <em>United States v. Moya, </em>704 F.2d at 342, that, \u201c[bjased on the factors outlined by this court in <em>[United States v. Black, </em>675 F.2d 129, 132-36 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1068, 103 S.Ct. 1520, 75 L.Ed.2d 945 (1983) ], we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that no seizure occurred during the \u2018personal intercourse\u2019 between Moya and the law enforcement officers and a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 would have believed that he was free to leave.\u201d Indeed, the district court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cthe undisputed testimony shows that Labik and Kinsella did not engage in any show of force in approaching Moya, that they did not lay hands on him at any time, and that Moya showed no hesitancy in agreeing to respond to their questions or in agreeing to remove himself from the taxi line and enter the terminal foyer.

The record contains no evidence suggesting that Moya was naive or vulnerable to coercion and, moreover, Moya was free at all times to walk away from the officers, which he eventually did when Officers La-bik and Kinsella detained his shoulder bag. Accordingly, Moya\u2019s person was not seized, <em>see Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 501-02, 103 S.Ct. at 1326; <em>United States v.

According to the law in this circuit at the time, an officer could detain luggage if he \u201chad reasonable suspicion to believe the bags contained contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. Klein, </em>626 F.2d 22, 26 (7th Cir.1980) <em>(\u201cKlein </em>\u201d). The district court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u201cby the time that Moya initially failed to produce the plastic bag, he had given Labik and Kinsella several grounds for suspecting that his travel bag contained contraband: His behavior in walking from the arrival gate to the taxi stand was sufficient to arouse the officers\u2019 inchoate suspicions. After they approached Moya and began to question him, these inchoate suspicions had been sharpened by the disclosure that Moya was hesitant to provide them with information about his identity and by the disclosure that Moya was carrying a plastic bag whose contents he wished to keep a secret.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 8. In view of this evidence, the district court denied Moya\u2019s motion to suppress and ruled that Officers Labik and Kinsella lawfully seized Moya\u2019s shoulder bag because they had \u201c \u2018reasonable and articulable\u2019 grounds for suspecting\u201d that the luggage contained contraband. <em>Id. </em>The district court, in ruling that reasonable suspicion existed and that the cocaine found in Moya\u2019s luggage could be introduced at trial, refused to consider the drug paraphernalia discovered by Agent Labik in the clear plastic bag that he observed in plain view. The district court concluded that, based upon the relevant case law in existence at the time, \u201cthe order compelling Moya to disclose the contents of his shoulder bag amounted to an unconstitutional warrantless search,\u201d because, according to the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), \u201cplain view <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence.\u201d 403 U.S. at 468 (emphasis original). <em>See United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 9, n. 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, this court ruled that \u201cthe officers had a reasonable suspicion to believe that Moya\u2019s travel bag contained contraband even before Moya turned the plastic bag over to them.\u201d <em>United States v. Moya, </em>704 F.2d at 343. Thus, we held that under the legal analysis of <em>Klein, </em>Officers Labik and Kin-sella lawfully seized Moya\u2019s shoulder bag. Because of this holding, we had no reason to address the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plain view doctrine was inapplicable to the seizure of the clear plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its decision in <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983) <em>(\u201cPlace </em>\u201d). In <em>Place, </em>the Court held that the .ninety minute detention of luggage, based solely upon a reasonable suspicion that the luggage contained narcotics, constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the present case, the majority mistakenly concludes that the police officers had only reasonable suspicion, and not probable cause, to seize Moya\u2019s shoulder bag. Thus, the majority reasons that the three hour detention of Moya\u2019s luggage, based solely upon reasonable suspicion, violates the standards of <em>Place. </em>In my opinion, the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Place </em>is legally unsound and factually inaccurate. \u25a0 I am firmly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>vinced that, combining the totality of the circumstances with the proper legal application of the plain view doctrine, the police officers had probable cause to seize Moya\u2019s shoulder bag. Accordingly, <em>Place </em>is irrelevant to the disposition of this case because it is limited to and applies only to the seizure of luggage based upon reasonable suspicion, a legal test completely separate and distinct from the probable cause evident in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">I initially note that neither the district court nor this court, on appeal, had any reason to address the probable cause issue, given this circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Klein </em>that reasonable suspicion of narcotics is sufficient to detain a traveler\u2019s luggage. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s thorough and exhaustive factual findings concerning Moya\u2019s conduct at O\u2019Hare International Airport provide a more than adequate basis for this court to rule on the legal issue of probable cause. Indeed, all we need do is apply the relevant legal principles of probable cause to the district court\u2019s factual findings. According to the Supreme Court in <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976), \u201c[t]he matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.\u201d 428 U.S. at 121, 96 S.Ct. at 2877-78. In view of the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning Moya\u2019s airpoft conduct, this is a case where the \u201cappellate court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">This court has already ruled that Officers Labik and Kinsella had reasonable suspicion to believe that Moya\u2019s luggage contained narcotics, even before the officers viewed the contents of the clear plastic bag. <em>United States v. Moya, </em>704 F.2d at 343. Added to this reasonable suspicion of narcotics was agent Labik\u2019s observation, <em>in plain view, </em>of a clear plastic bag that Moya emphatically and blatantly denied being present in the unzipped side pocket of his luggage. At the time of Moya\u2019s outright lie concerning the presence of a clear plastic bag in his luggage, Officers Labik and Kinsella knew that Moya deplaned from Delta Flight Number 142, a non-stop flight originating in Miami, Florida, a \u201csource city\u201d for the illegal drug traffic in Chicago. The officers further observed Moya walk across the concourse, suspiciously survey the crowd, and nervously proceed down the concourse, repeatedly glancing backwards over his shoulder. The well-trained, experienced officers determined that Moya\u2019s appearance, demean- or, behavior, and actions all fit the \u201cdrug courier profile.\u201d Thus, the officers trailed Moya as he entered one public restroom and exited without using the facilities, then entered a second public restroom, closed the door to his private stall, stood there for several minutes, and again exited without using the facilities, all in an obvious effort to frustrate and elude attempted surveillance. At the moment Moya made eye contact with the officers, he immediately boarded the down escalator and fled outside the terminal into a cab line, claiming no luggage and carrying only his shoulder bag. When Officers Labik and Kinsella approached Moya and asked for identification, he deliberately lied, initially responding that he had none but later producing a driver\u2019s license in the name of Cesar Moya, with his picture thereon. Further, when asked to remove the clear plastic bag in plain view from the side pocket of his luggage, Moya deliberately lied a second time, responding that he had no plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Moya\u2019s \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d his suspicious, nervous, and elusive actions in O\u2019Hare International Airport, his lie concerning identification, and his deliberate lie that he did not have a plastic bag, even though it was in plain view, clearly suggest that Moya was involved in some type of drug trafficking and that the clear plastic bag, in plain view, contained evidence of an incriminating nature. Nevertheless, the district court, relying upon the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>that \u201c \u2018plain view\u2019 <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence,\u201d ruled that the plain view doctrine did not allow for seizure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>clear plastic bag. <em>United States v. Moya, </em>561 F.Supp. at 9 n. 6 (emphasis original). The district court reasoned, as does the majority, that a clear plastic bag, by itself, is not sufficient to invoke the plain view doctrine. I note that the district court issued its decision in May 1981, but some two years later, in April 1983, the Supreme Court, in <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) <em>(\u201cBrown </em>\u201d), reanalyzed the plain view doctrine and clarified the law concerning our nation\u2019s ever-increasing drug problem. In <em>Brown, </em>the Court interpreted the phrase from <em>Coolidge </em>that \u201cplain view alone is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence,\u201d to mean that \u201cin order for the plain-view doctrine to apply, a police officer must be engaged in a lawful intrusion or must otherwise legitimately occupy the position affording him a \u2018plain view.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 737 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 3. In the present case, there is no question that Officers Labik and Kinsella lawfully \u201coccupied the position affording them a plain view,\u201d as Moya freely consented and agreed to answer the questions of the officers while standing in the public foyer of the airport terminal. Thus, in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Brown, </em>the district court\u2019s rationale for not applying the plain view doctrine to the seizure of the clear plastic bag is misplaced, and I believe that we are now compelled to analyze the facts of this case under the plain view doctrine enunciated in <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>the Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201c \u2018plain view\u2019 provides grounds for seizure of an item when an officer\u2019s access to an object has some prior justification under the Fourth Amendment. \u2018Plain view\u2019 is perhaps better understood, therefore, not as an independent \u2018exception\u2019 to the Warrant Clause, but simply as an extension of whatever the prior justification for an officer\u2019s \u2018access to an object\u2019 may be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">460 U.S. at 738-39, 103 S.Ct. at 1542 (footnote omitted). Since the <em>Brown </em>decision, this court has interpreted the plain view doctrine to allow for the warrantless seizure of evidence if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201c(1) the initial intrusion which afforded the authorities the plain view was lawful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">(2) the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">(3) the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\"><em>United States v.

Reed, </em>726 F.2d 339, 343 (7th Cir.1984). In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that it does \u201cnot view the \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 language ... as establishing any requirement that a police officer \u2018know\u2019 that certain items are contraband or evidence of a crime.\u201d 460 U.S. at 741, 103 S.Ct. at 1542. Instead, the Court determined that \u201cprobable cause to associate the property with criminal activity\u201d is sufficient to satisfy the third prong of the \u201cplain view\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 741-42, 103 S.Ct. at 1542-43 (quoting <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 587, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1380, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). <em>See also McDonald, </em>723 F.2d at 1295. According to the Court in <em>Brown:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">\u201cprobable cause is a flexible, commonsense standard.

The Supreme Court has added that \u201cprobable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>activity.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 244 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The facts in the present case satisfy all three prongs of the plain view test, as that test has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>and this court in <em>McDonald. </em>Moya freely agreed to speak with Officers Labik and Kinsella while standing in a public foyer of the airport terminal, and during the course of this conversation Moya voluntarily unzipped the side pocket of his luggage exposing the clear plastic bag in plain view. Thus, the initial intrusion affording Agent Labik access to observe Moya\u2019s luggage, and the clear plastic bag in plain view, was lawful and justified under the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, Agent Labik\u2019s discovery of the clear plastic bag was completely inadvertent, as he did not view the bag until Moya, on his own initiative and in search of identification that he earlier denied existed, unzipped the side pocket of his luggage, affording the officer a plain view. Finally, even though a clear plastic bag may be used for a multitude of noncriminal purposes, it is common knowledge that such a bag is frequently used to stash illegal narcotics and, as it was in this case, to store narcotics paraphernalia. In light of the facts available to Agent Labik, including Moya\u2019s \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d his repeated suspicious, nervous, and elusive actions at O\u2019Hare International Airport, his lie concerning identification, and his deliberate lie that he had no plastic bag, even though it was in plain view, there certainly was a \u201cpractical, nontechnical\u201d probability that the clear plastic bag contained incriminating evidence. Indeed, the only logical explanation for Moya\u2019s adamant denial of the clear plastic bag in plain view is that Moya wanted to conceal the bag, and its contents, from Agent Labik because it contained incriminating evidence. Thus, in line with the flexible, common sense standard of plain view set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>and this court in <em>McDonald, </em>and in view of the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, Agent Labik properly seized the clear plastic bag under the plain view doctrine. <em>See Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 742-44, 103 S.Ct. at 1542-44 (opaque balloon frequently used to carry narcotics properly seized under plain view doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Having established that Agent Labik properly seized the clear plastic bag, and viewed its contents, under the plain view doctrine, I turn to the issue of whether Agent Labik had probable cause to seize Moya\u2019s luggage. The relevant case law establishes that probable cause is a flexible, practical, common sense standard that requires facts sufficient \u201c \u2018to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. at 175-76, 69 S.Ct. at 1310-11 (quoting <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. at 162, 45 S.Ct. at 288). <em>See also Texas v.

These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. at 175, 69 S.Ct. at 1310. <em>See also Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 231, 103 S.Ct. 2328; <em>United States v.

In making a determination of probable cause, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty,\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335, n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The record in this case reveals that Agent Labik had sufficient facts, information, and knowledge, including Moya\u2019s \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d his suspicious, nervous, and elusive actions in O\u2019Hare International Airport, his repetition of lies, including his misstatement that he had no identification and his emphatic denial of the clear plastic bag in plain view, and the presence of drug paraphernalia in that clear plastic bag, \u201cto warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u201d that a crime involving the transportation of narcotics was taking place. In view of Agent Labik\u2019s observations, probable cause clearly existed to believe that Moya\u2019s luggage contained narcotics. <em>See United States v. Large, </em>729 F.2d 636, 639-40 (8th Cir.1984) (probable cause to seize luggage based on corroborated information of confidential informant, defendant\u2019s pattern of behavior in airport, and defendant\u2019s nervousness during investigatory stop); <em>United States v.

Thus, Agent Labik properly seized Moya\u2019s luggage, obtained a search warrant, and uncovered 501.77 grams of 35% pure cocaine, valued at between $40,-000 and $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">It is evident that the positive \u201csniff test\u201d performed by the trained canine does not affect the legality of the search, for as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Place, </em>a canine \u201csniff test\u201d of this nature does \u201cnot constitute a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2645. <em>See also United States v. Goldstein, </em>635 F.2d 356, 360 (5th Cir.1981) and cases cited therein. The positive \u201csniff test\u201d simply served to substantiate the already present probable cause that was necessary to obtain a search warrant in the first instance. Moreover, once Officers Labik and Kinsella had probable cause to believe that Moya\u2019s luggage contained narcotics, the delay in obtaining the search warrant was reasonable and in accord with the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Jodoin, </em>672 F.2d at 233-36 (overnight detention of luggage based upon probable cause is permissible). In contrast to the probable cause existing in this case, the Supreme Court in <em>Place </em>was dealing with a luggage detention based solely upon reasonable suspicion. The Court\u2019s concern with the length of the luggage detention resulted from the fact that the law enforcement officers had only a reasonable suspicion to conduct an \u201cinvestigative stop.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2645. Officers Labik and Kinsella had probable cause to believe that Moya\u2019s luggage contained narcotics, and thus the detention of Moya\u2019s luggage was for the purpose of obtaining a search warrant, not for the purpose of conducting a brief investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In <em>United States v.

Few problems affecting the health and welfare of our population, particularly our young, cause greater concern than the escalating use of controlled substances. Much of the drug traffic is highly organized and conducted by sophisticated criminal syndicates. The profits are enormous. And many drugs, including [cocaine], may be easily concealed. As a result, the obstacles to detection of illegal conduct may be unmatched in any other area of law enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">446 U.S. at 561-62, 100 S.Ct. 1881 (opinion of Powell, J.). In the present case, Agent Labik and Officer Kinsella performed their drug enforcement duties in an exceptionally skilled and proper manner, fully comporting with the law. The record reveals that at the time that Agent Labik seized Moya\u2019s luggage, he had probable cause to believe that such luggage contained narcotics. Before conducting a search of the luggage, Officers Labik and Kinsella, interested in protecting Moya\u2019s constitutional rights, followed proper legal procedures and sought the \u201cdetached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate, which is a more reliable safeguard against improper searches than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

As soon as the state court judge issued a valid search warrant, Agent Labik opened the shoulder bag and uncovered 501.77 grams of 35% pure cocaine valued at between $40,000 and $50,000. Based upon a thorough review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure of Moya\u2019s luggage, I conclude that Officers Labik and Kinsella had probable cause to seize Moya\u2019s luggage. Accordingly, the seizure of Moya\u2019s luggage and the subsequent search thereof, pursuant to a valid search warrant, were reasonable and in accord with the Fourth Amendment. I dissent from the majority\u2019s glossed over representation of the facts and their refusal to accurately analyze the facts and circumstances of this case, which are vital to a proper determination of probable cause. I also dissent from the majority\u2019s refusal to apply the plain view doctrine enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>and this court in <em>McDonald, </em>and their failure to rule, as a matter of law, that the law enforcement officers had probable cause to seize Moya\u2019s shoulder bag.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\">.

The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Reid v.

Men-denhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980), concerned the <em>seizure of a person </em>believed to be carrying narcotics, not the <em>seizure of luggage </em>believed to contain narcotics. In the instant case, it is clear that Moya's person was not seized and thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Reid </em>and <em>Mendenhall </em>is inapplicable to the issue before this panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. I note that some two years after the district court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court, in <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983), interpreted the phrase \"plain view alone is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence\u201d to mean that \"in order for the plain-view doctrine to apply, a police officer must be engaged in a lawful intrusion or must otherwise legitimately occupy the position affording him a 'plain view.' \u201d 460 U.S. at 737 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1540 n. 3. <em>See </em>discussion in text, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
