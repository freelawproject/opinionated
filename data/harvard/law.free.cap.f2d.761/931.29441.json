We construe the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), as mandating application of the six-month limitations period to all section 301 actions that are predicated upon a union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation, and implicate no countervailing federal policy. We will therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of United Auto Workers Local 980<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and against appellant Granville Taylor in his section 301 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">In 1969, Ford Motor Company laid Taylor off from his position as a pumpman, and did not recall him until May, 1976. One month later, an arbitrator determined that Ford had breached its collective bargaining agreement with Local 980 by failing to notify Taylor of a vacancy that had occurred in his job classification in 1973, and by failing to recall him at that time. The arbitrator awarded Taylor pension rights and benefits from May 1973. When the UAW/Ford Retirement Board denied Taylor these retroactive pension credits, he sought the assistance of Local 980 in enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award. However, on December 4, 1978, the president of the Local wrote Taylor that the union would take \u201cno further action\u201d in the matter. <em>See Taylor v. Ford Motor Co. (\u201cTaylor I\u201d), </em>703 F.2d 738, 740-41 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">In 1980, Taylor brought his section 301 suit against Ford and Local 980 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The district court dismissed Taylor\u2019s action against Ford on the ground that it was time-barred by New Jersey\u2019s 90-day limitation period for confirmation of an arbitral award. On the same ground, the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of Local 980. In March 1983, on appeal from this latter determination, this court determined that New Jersey\u2019s six-year statute of limitations for contract actions applied to Taylor\u2019s suit, heeding the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>AFL-CIO v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966), that courts in section 301 actions are to apply the most analogous state statute of limitations. <em>See Taylor I, </em>703 F.2d at 741, 745. Taylor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>action was then remanded to the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 745. However, in June 1983, the Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>DelCostello, </em>which held that the appropriate limitations period for a hybrid section 301 action is the six-month one contained in the NLRA. <em>See </em>103 S.Ct. at 2293-94. Relying on <em>DelCostello, </em>the district court once again awarded summary judgment in favor of Local 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">In <em>DelCostello, </em>an employee sought to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award. Taylor\u2019s principal argument on this appeal is that <em>DelCostello </em>is inapplicable where, as here, an employee seeks in a section 301 action to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award. We do not think that <em>DelCostello </em>can be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The basis of <em>DelCostello </em>was the Court\u2019s recognition that state actions dealing with contracts or commercial arbitrations are at best imperfectly analogous to a hybrid section 301 suit. <em>Id. </em>at 2291. Such a hybrid action is possible only where the union has breached its duty of fair representation in handling the employee\u2019s grievance against the employer. <em>See Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, </em>424 U.S. 554, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976); <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). Because a union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation bears a \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d to an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, the policy determination underlying the NLRA\u2019s six-month limitations period \u2014 that the need for expeditious dispute resolution in the labor arena and for uniform procedural treatment of similar claims weighs against any need employees might have for lengthy periods in which to vindicate their rights \u2014 also applies to hybrid section 301 actions. <em>See DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2294. Thus the Court concluded that the NLRA\u2019s six-month period applies to hybrid actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\"><em>DelCostello </em>draws no explicit distinction between employee actions seeking vacation of arbitral decisions and those seeking enforcement. Nor can we conceive of any convincing reason for such a distinction. The \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d of a union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation to an unfair labor practice is not vitiated merely because the breach consists of a failure to enforce an arbitral decision rather than a failure to represent the employee\u2019s grievance adequately in the arbitral forum. Wherever this \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d exists, the need for rapid resolution of labor disputes and for uniformity mandates application of the NLRA\u2019s six-month limitation period, absent some countervailing federal policy. <em>Compare Local Union 1397, USWA v. USWA, AFL-CIO, </em>748 F.2d 180 (3d Cir.1984) (NLRA\u2019s six-month limitations period applies to an action brought under section 102 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412) <em>with Adams v. Gould, Inc., </em>739 F.2d 858 (3d Cir.1984) (limitations period of ERISA, rather than that of NLRA, applies to hybrid section 301 lawsuit for employer\u2019s breach of a pension agreement), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 806, 83 L.Ed.2d 799 (1985). We hold, therefore, that the six-month limitations period of section 10(b) of the NLRA applies to a hybrid section 301 action to enforce an arbitration award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">Taylor contends that, even if <em>DelCostello </em>applies to 301 actions generally, it may not be applied retroactively to his action. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>contention need not detain us long. We have already decided, in <em>Perez v. Dana Corp., </em>718 F.2d 581 (3d Cir.1983), that <em>Del-Costello </em>applies retroactively. Having just held that <em>DelCostello </em>is not materially distinguishable from this case, there is no need to repeat the retroactivity analysis we undertook in <em>Perez. </em>We hold that <em>DelCos-tello </em>is applicable to Taylor\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Finally, Taylor contends that the district court erred in holding that his cause of action accrued on December 4, 1978, when he was notified that Local 980 would not assist him in seeking enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award. The union must have allegedly breached its duty of fair representation before an employee may bring a hybrid section 301 action. <em>See Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). Thus, where an employee seeks to enforce an arbitration award, his hybrid section 301 action accrues either when the union unequivocally refuses to assist him, or, if no such refusal occurs, when the statute of limitations on the union\u2019s action against the employer has run. <em>See Federation of Westinghouse Independent Salaried Unions v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>736 F.2d 896, 902 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Taylor I, </em>703 F.2d at 743. Here, Taylor did receive an unequivocal refusal on December 4, 1978, when Local 980 notified him that \u201cthe Union [had gone] its last mile, and there would be no further action ... taken on the matter____\u201d Letter from William Beckham, President of Local 980, to Granville Taylor, <em>quoted in Taylor I, </em>703 F.2d at 740. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that Taylor\u2019s cause of action accrued on that date, and was time-barred when he brought it in November 1980, nearly two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">. The co-defendant, Ford Motor Company, has not been a participant in the case since it obtained summary judgment in 1981. <em>See Taylor v. Ford Motor Co., </em>703 F.2d 738, 741 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\"><em>. </em>Taylor argues that this holding will place this court in conflict with the First and Fifth Circuits, which have held that <em>DelCostello </em>does not apply to section 301 actions brought by unions to enforce arbitration awards against employers. <em>See Derwin v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>719 F.2d 484 (1st Cir.1982); <em>IUE v. Ingram Mfg. Co., </em>715 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1711, 80 L.Ed.2d 184 (1984). We disagree. <em>Derwin </em>and <em>Ingram </em>were straight, non-hybrid, section 301 actions, to which, the Supreme Court has indicated, the rule of <em>Hoosier Cardinal </em>still applies. <em>See DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2289, 2291; <em>Ingram, </em>715 F.2d at 888. Here, it is precisely the hybrid nature of Taylor\u2019s lawsuit that mandates the application of <em>DelCostello.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1028-10\">A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">Relying on <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), the majority holds that appellant\u2019s hybrid section 301/unfair representation suit to <em>enforce </em>an arbitration award is barred by the NLRA\u2019s six-month limitations period for unfair labor practice claims. As the majority notes, however, <em>DelCostello </em>involved a hybrid suit to <em>vacate </em>an arbitration award. Though the majority cannot \u201cconceive of any convincing reason\u201d to distinguish suits to vacate arbitration awards from suits to enforce, I believe that such a distinction has \u2014 for cogent reasons \u2014 long been recognized by state and federal law, with the result that limitations periods for suits to enforce are generally longer than those governing suits to vacate. <em>DelCostello </em>does not require that we eviscerate this distinction. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">The Supreme Court in <em>DelCostello </em>made it quite clear that their holding was not to be extended mechanically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-13\">We stress that our holding today should not be taken as a departure from prior practice in borrowing limitations periods for federal causes of action, in labor law or elsewhere. We do not mean to suggest that federal courts should eschew use of state limitations periods anytime state law fails to provide a perfect analogy____ Nevertheless, when a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking, we have not hesitated to turn away from state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">462 U.S. at 171-172, 103 S.Ct. at 2294. Thus, we must look to the \u201cfederal policies at stake\u201d and the \u201cpracticalities of litigation\u201d before we may conclude that the NLRA\u2019s six-month limitations period is a \u201csignificantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking\u201d than the six-year state limitations period that we found to be applicable to appellant\u2019s cause of action in <em>Taylor I. See also Adams v. Gould, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>739 F.2d 858, 867 (3d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 806, 83 L.Ed.2d 799 (1985). In carrying out this analysis, I think we must be cognizant of the fact that the practical effect of borrowing the federal rather than the state statute of limitations in <em>DelCostello </em>was to extend (from three to six months) the period in which an employee could bring a suit to vacate, whereas here the effect would be to drastically reduce (from six years to six months) the applicable limitations period. I believe that both the practicalities of litigation and the federal policies at stake militate in favor of a significantly longer period for actions to enforce arbitration awards than the six months allowed for bringing an action to vacate under <em>DelCostello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">When an employee seeks to vacate an arbitration award in a section 301/unfair representation hybrid suit, the gravamen of the unfair representation claim will generally be the union\u2019s mishandling of grievance and arbitration procedures, and the cause of action will accrue at a fairly definite date \u2014 the date the adverse arbitration decision is issued. <em>Cf. DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 172, 103 S.Ct. at 2294. In a suit to enforce, however, the gravamen of the complaint will be the union\u2019s conduct <em>after </em>the arbitration process is complete, and the claim will not accrue until the futility of further union appeals becomes apparent or should have become apparent. <em>Scott v. Local 863, </em>725 F.2d 226, 229 (3d Cir.1984). Judge Becker has recently described the dilemma the employee confronts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">The problem is that, unlike other situations where the twin defenses of failure to exhaust and the statute of limitations combine to give the litigant a narrow window in which to file suit, here there is no guarantee that statutes, regulations, or other form of clear, written notice will exist that warn the plaintiff of his per-il____ [U]nion officials may well be equivocal or contradictory in their communications to dissatisfied members and may send such communications through persons within the internal union hierarchy whose authority to bind the union is at best hazy. As a result, the potential suitor will not know when exhaustion is futile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\"><em>Scott, </em>725 F.2d at 230 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\"><em>Scott </em>was a case where the union refused to bring a grievance to arbitration, and this court applied <em>DelCostello </em>to the employees\u2019 hybrid action. I submit, however, that in cases such as this one \u2014 where the grievance has been arbitrated and the employee has won \u2014 the \u201cwhipsaw\u201d Judge Becker described becomes intolerable and a more generous limitations period is needed. Where the union has assisted an employee in successfully processing a grievance through to arbitration, it is only natural that the employee will continue to rely on the union rather than the courts, for assistance in enforcing the award, even in the face of evidence that the union may go no further. As we said in <em>Taylor I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-11\">It is the union ... to whom Taylor looked to protect his recall interest. The union provided the arbitration process procedure as a means for a member to resolve a grievance over such an interest. After a union member exhausts the union\u2019s procedure for dispute resolution through arbitration, it is reasonable for that member to expect the union to follow the necessary steps to conclude the dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">703 F.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">The employee\u2019s dilemma is well-illustrated by the present case. Even assuming that the majority is correct in holding that appellant\u2019s claim accrued when he received the letter from the Local president stating that the union would go no further, it is apparent that he continued to pursue internal appeals in good faith. There is evidence of record to indicate that appellant could reasonably have believed that the International might take a different view of the matter. This suit was filed shortly after it became apparent that the International would not intercede. The longer limitations period afforded by state law would mitigate the consequences of erroneously relying \u2014 as did the appellant \u2014 on the union\u2019s continued efforts, by opening the section 301/unfair representation \u201cwindow\u201d somewhat wider. The window should not be precipitously closed on employees who, having won the first battle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>side-by-side with their union \u2014 and often without the aid of independent counsel\u2014 fail to appreciate that their union has suddenly deserted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The policies underlying federal labor law point to the same result. The Court in <em>DelCostello </em>emphasized the \u201cnational interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements,\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2294 (quoting <em>United Parcel Service v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 70, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 1567, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1980)). Stable bargaining relationships require, among other things, that all parties abide by arbitration awards. <em>See Federation of Westinghouse Independent Salaried Unions v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>736 F.2d 896, 901 (3d Cir.1984). Thus, actions to enforce stand on a very different footing from actions to vacate. The finality of private settlements, which is undermined by actions at law to vacate, is actually promoted by the availability of actions to compel compliance. Indeed, achieving \u201cfinality\u201d is a preeminent goal of <em>all </em>arbitration\u2014 whether commercial, labor, or any other\u2014 and in all of these contexts actions to enforce have been accorded more dignity, in the form of longer limitations periods, than actions to vacate. <em>See e.g., </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12 (1982) (one year to confirm award, three months to vacate); Uniform Arbitration Act \u00a7\u00a7 11,12 (1978) (no limitation on confirmation, ninety days to vacate); <em>Taylor I </em>(under New Jersey law six-year breach of contract limitations period applies to confirmation, ninety-day limitation on actions to vacate). Thus, the \u201canalogy\u201d between actions to enforce commercial arbitration awards and actions to enforce labor arbitration awards is much stronger than the analogy between actions to vacate. Further, I believe that in the context of enforcing arbitration awards, the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and the finality of private settlements override the interests in \u201cexpeditious dispute resolution in the labor arena and ... uniform procedural treatment of similar claims\u201d that the majority emphasizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">For the foregoing reasons I conclude that the <em>DelCostello </em>rule should not be applied to hybrid actions to enforce an arbitration award, and for the reasons given in this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Taylor I, </em>I would hold that appellant\u2019s claim against Local 980 is not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">SUR PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"aif-dedup-0\">Before ALDISERT, Chief Judge, SEITZ, ADAMS, GIBBONS, HUNTER, WEIS, GARTH, HIGGINBOTHAM, SLOYITER, BECKER, STAPLETON and MANS-MANN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The petition for rehearing filed by</p>\n<p id=\"A1_\">Appellant Granville B.
