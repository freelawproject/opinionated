Practice Book \u00a7 298. Because the question was not raised in or decided by the trial court, we decline to consider it. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 223, 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s counter affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment presented no genuine issue of fact as to whether the decedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>whose body was found on the tracks of the New Haven Bailroad, had been a passenger on the defendants\u2019 train or as to how he met his death. It is not enough that one opposing a motion for a summary judgment claims there is a genuine issue of material fact; some evidence showing the existence of such an issue must be presented in the counter affidavit. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 299, 300; <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Merchants Fire Ins. Co., </em>204 F. Sup. 311, 314 (D. Conn.); <em>Kasowitz </em>v. <em>Mutual Construction Co., </em>154 Conn. 607, 613, 228 A.2d 149. The court therefore properly granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
