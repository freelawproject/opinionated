The property which is the subject matter of this action has been used as a gasoline filling station and for motor vehicle sales and repairs since 1927. In 1949, new zoning regulations were adopted by the town which placed the property in question in a general business zone. Later, in 1967, the plaintiffs, wishing to replace the present building, made application to the building inspector of the town for a building permit to construct a new structure. The building inspector denied the application on the ground that \u201cthe new filling station would constitute an enlargement or extension of a non-conforming use.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed from this adverse ruling to the defendant zoning board of appeals, which upheld the building inspector\u2019s ruling. They then took an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, which overruled the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The court made no limited finding, as it should have, setting forth its conclusions as to the issues which the defendant desired to have reviewed. The conclusions which are attacked appear only in the memorandum of decision. The defendant has assigned as error the conclusions in that memorandum. The parties have briefed and argued the errors assigned in these conclusions, and we have decided to consider the issues. <em>Faubel </em>v. <em>Zoning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Commission, </em>154 Conn. 202, 204, 224 A.2d 538; <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>149 Conn. 698, 704, 183 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The vital question, the answer to which is dis-positive of this appeal to this court, is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 property, under the zoning regulations, is a nonconforming use as decided by the building inspector and the defendant zoning board of appeals. Historically, when new zoning regulations were adopted by the town in 1949, the property of the plaintiffs was placed in a general business zone pursuant to article 3 \u00a7 6, entitled \u201cGeneral Business Zone,\u201d which included among the permitted uses (1) those \u201cpermitted in neighborhood business zone\u201d and (2) \u201c[s]torage, repair, sales and service of automobiles and farm equipment as carried on at the adoption of these regulations.\u201d Under the regulations at that time, the plaintiffs\u2019 property was in a zone in which the business conducted by them became a permitted use. <em>Dostmann </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>143 Conn. 297, 302, 122 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Thereafter, in 1952, the town again amended the regulations to provide that a garage or a service or gasoline station as described therein would become \u201can additional permitted use\u201d in its neighborhood business zone<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and made the issuance of the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>subject to certain distance requirements. Under the zoning regulations in effect at the time of the application and hearing, gasoline service stations were permitted under special exceptions granted by the zoning board of appeals subject to various distance limitations including a 1000-foot distance requirement from other gasoline service stations. Glastonbury Zoning Regs. \u00a73.8.7 (1965). As of the date of the application and hearing, there were other gasoline service stations within the distance limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In the determination whether a particular use is permitted or nonconforming, the question is one of expressed intent as stated in the zoning regulations, which are basically legislative enactments, and such intent must be found from the intent expressed in the regulations construed as a whole. <em>Garbaty </em>v. <em>Norwalk Jewish Center, Inc., </em>148 Conn. 376, 381, 382, 171 A.2d 197; 101 C.J.S., Zoning, \u00a7 148. A permitted use is not a nonconforming use. <em>County of Saunders </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>182 Neb. 377, 378, 155 N.W.2d 317; 101 C.J.S. 936 n.70, Zoning, \u00a7180. A nonconforming use is merely an \u201cexisting use\u201d the continuance of which is authorized by the zoning regulations. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 8-2. The regulations specifically and particularly define a nonconforming use as follows: \u201cA use of land, building or premises which is not a use permitted by the provisions of these Regulations for the zone in which such land, building or premises is situated.\u201d Glastonbury Zoning Regs. \u00a7 2.14.a (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">In the determination whether the classification of the plaintiffs\u2019 property falls into that of a permitted use, the following regulations in effect at the time of the hearing before the board are relevant. Section 3 lists the uses permitted in different zones: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Section 3.9, entitled \u201cGeneral Business Zone GB\u2014 Permitted Uses,\u201d deals specifically with the zone in which the plaintiffs\u2019 property is located; \u00a7 3.9.3 permits business uses permitted in neighborhood business zones in a general business zone; \u00a73.8, entitled \u201cNeighborhood Business Zone NB \u2014 'Permitted Uses,\u201d lists, inter alia, the following types of business in \u00a7 3.8.8: \u201cStorage, repair, sales and service of motor vehicles and farm equipment existing on the effective date of this Regulation\u201d; \u00a7 3.8.7 has already been noted above. The plaintiffs have used their property for repair, sales and service of motor vehicles since 1927 so that, under \u00a7 3.8.8, their use was existing on the effective date of \u00a7 3.8.8 and is not a \u201cuse of land . . . which is not . . . permitted by the provisions of these Regulations\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2.14.a and cannot be a nonconforming use within the meaning of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 3.8.8 and 3.9.3, the plaintiffs explicitly have a permitted use so long as it can be described as the use \u201cexisting on the effective date of this Regulation.\u201d The term \u201cexisting use\u201d is usually employed by legal authorities with relation to the concept of nonconforming use so that, in this frame of reference, the phrase is related in point of time to the use which existed at the time of the enactment of the zoning regulation prohibiting such uses. <em>DeFelice </em>v. <em>Zonmg Board of Appeals, </em>130 Conn. 156, 32 A.2d 635; <em>Haller Baking Co.\u2019s Appeal, </em>295 Pa. 257, 145 A. 77. In the <em>DeFelice </em>case (p. 161), we have stated, in defining the words \u201cexisting use,\u201d that we mean a utilization of the property so that it may be known in the neighborhood as being employed for a given purpose; that neither the extent nor the quantity nor the quality of the use which may be permitted to continue is prescribed by those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>words; and that it is only required that the use must have existed. The court is not generally required to speculate as to the number of acts or business transactions necessary to constitute an existing use. See also 101 C.J.S., Zoning, \u00a7 184. Although the defendant in its brief goes into great detail concerning the square footage of the plaintiffs\u2019 present and proposed new buildings, the number of lifts and bays currently existing and planned and the size of new oil and gasoline tanks, it is not disputed that, even after the proposed improvements, the plaintiffs\u2019 property will continue to be used for the same purposes as it was used in 1949 and earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The defendant agrees that the plaintiffs\u2019 premises are presently in a general business zone. It argues, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 station cannot satisfy the distance requirements of \u00a7 3.8.7, even though the other gasoline stations within the distance limitation \u201cwere constructed after the plaintiffs\u2019,\u201d and that therefore \u201ctheir use of the premises in question can only be a nonconforming one.\u201d To reach this conclusion we would have to ignore completely \u00a7 3.8.8. The plaintiffs\u2019 property falls squarely within the latter section, which does not contain any distance limitations. It is a standard rule of construction that, \u201cwhenever feasible, the language of an ordinance will be construed so that no clause is held superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Synanon Foundation, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 305, 309, 216 A.2d 442. Further, zoning regulations are in derogation of common-law rights and should not be extended by implication. <em>Park Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>142 Conn. 30, 35, 110 A.2d 614. \u201c[EJvery owner of property located in a town which has adopted zoning is entitled to ascertain, with reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>able certainty, what uses he may legally make of any portion of his property.\u201d <em>Lebanon </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>153 Conn. 182, 191, 215 A.2d 112. The defendant was in error in refusing to issue a building permit to the plaintiffs for the reason \u201cthat the new filling station would constitute an enlargement or extension of a non-conforming use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Additional support for this view is derived from the fact that at least since 1949 the Glastonbury regulations have made express provision for the continuance of nonconforming uses. See art. 5 (1949); \u00a7 5 (1965). By expressly permitting the \u201c[s]torage, repair, sales and service of motor vehicles and farm equipment existing on the effective date of this Regulation\u201d under \u00a7 3.8.8, the local legislative body must have intended to give to such a business the status of a permitted use rather than that of a nonconforming one.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In this opinion King, C. J., and Thim, J., concurred; Alcorn and House, Js., concurred in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\"> \u201c[Glastonbury Zoning Begs. (1952)].
