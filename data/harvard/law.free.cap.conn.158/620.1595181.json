On this appeal, the sole assignment of error is addressed to this ruling. The basic claim of the plaintiff is that we should reexamine the holding of the <em>Landers </em>case and change our rule that the substantive internal law of the situs of a tort determines the capacity to sue as it may be affected by the marriage relationship. We see no reason to change our rule as enunciated in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
