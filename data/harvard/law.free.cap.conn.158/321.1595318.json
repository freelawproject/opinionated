Daly, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, was <em>John D.

At the trial, Mrs. Rita Brescia, who had been with the defendant on the evening of the crimes, appeared as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>a witness for the state and testified about the defendant\u2019s involvement in a theft at the Manchester Country Club. On direct examination, the state asked Mrs. Brescia whether she had pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court to a criminal charge which arose in connection with the defendant\u2019s alleged theft at the Manchester Country Club. Mrs. Brescia answered that she had pleaded guilty to such a charge in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Upon cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to attack Mrs. Brescia\u2019s credibility by attempting to show that Mrs. Brescia had made a prior inconsistent statement concerning her plea of guilty to a criminal charge. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked Mrs. Brescia whether she remembered testifying at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing in the Circuit Court that she had \u201cno criminal record whatsoever.\u201d Furthermore, the defense counsel asked her what offense she had been charged with in the Circuit Court, and she answered \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d. The trial court ordered the jury to disregard the prior statement of Mrs. Brescia that she had no criminal record whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The trial court did not commit error by striking the prior statement of Mrs. Brescia that she had no criminal record even though it may have been inconsistent with her admission at the defendant\u2019s trial that she had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge in the Circuit Court. Mrs. Brescia\u2019s admission was immaterial and irrelevant on the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Even if we assume that Mrs. Brescia was correct when she testified at the probable cause hearing that she had no criminal record, that fact could not have been shown in evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial for any purpose other than to point out the contradiction. See 3 Wigmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>(3d Ed.) \u00a7 1003. A witness may not be contradicted on cross-examination as to any answer he may have made on direct examination with respect to an irrelevant or immaterial fact. <em>Schurgast </em>v. <em>Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 482, 242 A.2d 695; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>151 Conn. 592, 597, 200 A.2d 724, cert. denied, sub nom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>379 U.S. 963, 85 S. Ct. 654, 13 L. Ed. 2d 557; <em>Martyn </em>v. <em>Donlin, </em>151 Conn. 402, 408, 198 A.2d 700; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinrib, </em>140 Conn. 247, 254, 99 A.2d 145; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Charles William Palomba Co., </em>114 Conn. 108, 115, 157 A. 902; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>99 Conn. 307, 323, 324, 122 A. 68; <em>Koskoff </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>86 Conn. 415, 421, 422, 85 A. 588; <em>Barlow Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>73 Conn. 696, 702, 49 A. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial and upon direct examination, Mrs. Brescia admitted that she had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge in the Circuit Court. This admission was, of course, an unfavorable one, and it inured to the defendant\u2019s benefit because Mrs. Brescia was a state\u2019s witness. Since Mrs. Brescia\u2019s contradictory statements involved a matter which was completely unrelated to the ultimate question in issue, the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
