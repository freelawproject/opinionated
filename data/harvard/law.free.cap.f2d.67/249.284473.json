A special plea was filed that no appeal had been taken to the Director of the Veterans\u2019 Bureau and no denial of the claim had been made by him or any one acting in his name. On a trial of the plea a verdict was directed sustaining it, and the suit was dismissed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-23\">The evidence in the bill of exceptions consists mostly of extracts from letters,. no signatures being shown, which are recited to have passed between \u201cthe Veterans\u2019 Bureau\u2019\u2019 and \u201cthe counsel for plaintiff.\u201d They show that the executrix made claim under the policy, that the Bureau wrote that only a part of the insurance which had been revived under section 305 of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act, 38 USCA, \u00a7 516, was of force, and that it went to a relative of the soldier who was named sole legatee in his will rather than to the executrix. No formal judgment is shown. Thereafter \u201cthe Veterans\u2019 Bureau\u201d was requested by \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s counsel\u201d to \u201creview the insurance feature of this ease\u201d with additional proofs. The Bureau replied, stating that the request would be acted on by the Insurance Council, and sent a blank to be filled out touching the deceased, which blank was executed and returned. No further action on the claim appears to have been taken before suit was filed. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was representing both the executrix and the legatee, and he argues that the request for review was made in behalf of the legatee, with the sole purpose of getting allowed to her the face of the policy rather than the lesser amount awarded; and that he understood the letter stating that the executrix took nothing to be a final rejection of her claim. This contention can hardly be sustained, seeing that the record expressly states that plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the request for a review, not that the counsel for the legatee did. But, taking his contention as correct, the executrix none the less sued prematurely. The administration of the War Risk Insurance is committed to the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, and the Director is to decide all questions arising about it. 38 USCA \u00a7 426. Suit is permitted only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>after a disagreement is reached; and, because of dispute as to what would constitute a disagreement, it was enacted July 3, 1930, 46 Stats. 993 (38 USCA \u00a7 445), that \u201cthe term \u2018disagreement\u2019 means a denial of the claim by the director or some one acting in his name on an appeal to the director.\u201d There is nothing in this record to show that any appeal was ever taken to the Director of the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, or that he or any one acting for him had rejected the claim of the executrix. The Director is not mentioned in the pleadings or in the evidence as we have it. Congress could so condition \u2019 the consent of the United States to be sued as to require a precedent appeal to the Director and adverse action by him. The suit may not be maintained otherwise. United States v. Densmore (C. C. A.) 58 F.(2d) 748; United States v. Collins (C. C. A.) 61 F.(2d) 1002; Griffin v. United States (C. C. A.) 60 F.(2d) 339; United States v. Peters (C. C. A.) 62 F.(2d) 977; Straw v. United States (C. C. A.) 62 F.(2d) 757. It is the general rule that in suing a government administrative remedies must be exhausted before appeal is made to the courts. Error is not made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
