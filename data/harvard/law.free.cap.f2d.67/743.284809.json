United States, 202 U. S. 344, 387, 26 S. Ct. 688, 701, 50 L. Ed. 1057, 6 Ann. Cas. 362, the court said: \u201cThe constitutional requirement is that the crime shall be tried in the state and district where committed; not necessarily in the state or district where the party committing it happened to be at the time.\u201d See, also, In re Palliser, 136 U. S. 257, 265,10 S. Ct. 1034, 34 L. Ed. 514; Horner v. United States, 143 U. S. 207, 213-214, 12 S. Ct. 407, 36 L. Ed. 126; Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 362, 32 S. Ct. 793, 56 L. Ed. 1114, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614; Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 235, 44 S. Ct. 519, 68 L. Ed. 989; Moran v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 264 F. 768, 770\u2019; Grayson v. United States (C. C. A. 6) 272 F. 553, 557, certiorari denied, 257 U. S. 637, 42 S. Ct. 49; 66 L. Ed. 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-24\">In support of their contention, the appellants cite a number of decisions by the Supreme Court. These decisions, however, are not applicable, either because they refer to extradition and not removal proceedings, or because they cannot be construed as the appellants claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-25\">Hyatt v. New York ex rel. Corkran, 188 U. S. 691, 23 S. Ct. 456, 47 L. Ed. 657, was a case in which a \u201cproceeding by habeas corpus was commenced by the relator * * * to obtain his discharge from imprisonment by the plaintiff in error, the chief of police in the city of Albany, state of New York, who held the relator by means of a warrant issued in extradition proceedings by the governor of New York, * * * .granted on a requisition from the governor of Tennessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-26\">Again, Price v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 488, 493, 30 S. Ct. 257, 259, 54 L. Ed. 581, cited by the appellants, is clearly no authority for their contention. The court said: \u201cThe evidence, independent of that afforded by the New York indictments, relied upon to show that appellant was not in the District of Columbia when the conspiracy is charged to have been formed, has been examined. It cannot be said to be at all conclusive. * * * Second, it does not exclude the possibility that the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>may have been formed in the District of Columbia without appellant being physically present when the conspiracy was formed. [Cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
