In view of the similarity of issues in this ease and in appeals Nos. 4993 and 4999, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Lafayette Life Insurance Company (C. C. A.) 67 F. (2d) 2-09, decided this day, the decision in these latter cases shall govern the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">It is therefore ordered that the order of \u2022the Board be, and it is hereby, reversed with directions to redetermine the tax of the respondent herein in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion in Nos. 4993 and 4999.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
