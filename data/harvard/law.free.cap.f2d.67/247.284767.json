An effort is made to relate the words \u201cremoved as aforesaid\u201d to the allegations of removal in the first count and thus to introduce averments touching the tax. One count may by express reference adopt without repetition the allegations of another count; and a very general reference by the words \u201chereinbefore set forth and described\u201d was held sufficient on demurrer in Nichols v. United States (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 46, 47. But the reference here is not necessarily to the allegations of removal made in the first count for there were also precedent allegations of removal in the second count to which it may have application. The second count must be held to be self-contained; and on demurrer it must have fallen for failure to allege a necessary element of the crime sought to be charged. The eases to this effect in Woods v. United States (C. C. A.) 26 P.(2d) 63, and Dukes v. United States (C. C. A.) 275 P. 142, relied on to support this judgment of discharge, were decisions on direct anpeal from conviction. They have no application to collateral at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tack by writ of habeas corpus. In the latter, if there is such a class of crimes as the indictment apparently attempts to charge, and the court had jurisdiction over such crimes and over the person of the accused, the question of the sufficiency of the indictment to charge an offense cannot be raised or reviewed on habeas corpus. Knewel v. Egan, 268 U. S. 442, 446, 45 S. Ct. 522, 69 L. Ed. 1036. The trial court has power to determine, subject to orderly appeal, what the elements of the offense are and what the indictment should allege, and it ends inquiry about such things by deciding them. Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 7 L. Ed. 650; In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 8 S. Ct. 1263, 32 L. Ed. 274. Guilt or innocence, and the measure of punishment within the limits fixed by law, are the responsibility of the trial court and not of another judge on habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The judgment of discharge is reversed, and the ease remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
