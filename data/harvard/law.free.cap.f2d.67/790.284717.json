Judgment was entered dismissing the bill on November 21, 1927. No appeal was taken from this judgment, but after a lapse of nearly eight months the plaintiff applied for a reissue of his patent, which was granted October 30, 1928, No. 17,122.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">On February 15, 1929, the plaintiff brought the bill in equity now pending, alleging an infringement of the reissue patent No. 17,122. The cause was heard on the record in the original suit and the reissue parent, and on May 16, 1930, the District Court handed down an opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> holding that as the reissue patent must be for the same invention as the original patent, which had already been held invalid, the issue as to the validity of the reissue patent was res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">On appeal to this court the decree of the District Court was reversed on the ground that the present bill was based, in part, on new claims in the reissue patent, and the doctrine of res judicata did not apply, as the issues under the reissue patent were not the same a** under the original bill. 46 F.(2d) 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">This court remanded the case to the District Court for further consideration on its merits to determine whether the machine described in the specifications and claims of the reissue patent was the same as the machine described in the original patent, and held that if the District Court on further consideration should find that the invention described in the reissue patent was the same as that described in the original patent, the judgment in the prior suit that the machine did not involve a patentable invention would constitute an estoppel and conclude the plaintiff as to that issue in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">This cause was set down for hearing in the District Court, and an opinion was handed down on July 7,1932, dismissing the bill with costs. 5 F. Supp. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">The District Court found, first, that the combination of the several parts of the machine constituting the invention described in the reissue patent was the same as that described in the original patent, and held that the judgment in the prior suit, which was not appealed from, estopped the plaintiff from again raising the issue of its patentability in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">The District Court also considered the case from the standpoint of whether the issues in the present suit were different from those in the prior action on the ground that the new claims added in the reissue patent were broader than those contained in the original patent, and held that they were broader \u2014 which, however, the plaintiff strenuously denies \u2014 but further held that, since the application for the reissue patent was not made for three years and eight months after the granting of the original patent, it is invalid, and dismissed the bill on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">Since the plaintiff contends that the claims in the reissue patent are no broader than those in the original patent, and that the drawings and specifications in the reissue patent describe exactly the same machine as the original patent, we think the District Court need have gone no farther than to dismiss the bill on the ground that the plaintiff! is estopped by the judgment in the former suit from prevailing in this suit. The plaintiff elected to accept the judgment of the District Court in the former suit that his machine involved no patentable invention. Clearly a reissue patent for the same machine involving the same invention cannot avail the plaintiff in a new suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Assuming that the new claims are broader than those in the first patent, we think the District Court committed no error in dismissing the bill on the ground that there was too long delay in applying for the reissue patent. Under the ordinary rule a reissue patent with broader claims will not be granted after two years from the date of the granting of the original patent, Miller v. Brass Co., 104 U. S. 350, 26 L. Ed. 783; .Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U. S. 354, 5 S. Ct. 174, 6 S. Ct. 451, 28 L. Ed. 665, unless a reasonable excuse can be shown for the delay. Wollensak v. Sargent, 151 U. S. 221,14 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 137; Topliff v; Topliff et al., 145 U. S. 156, 12 S. Ct. 825, 36 L. Ed. 658; Webster Co. v. Splitdorf Co., 264 U. S. 463, 466, 469, 471, 44 S. Ct. 342, 68 L. Ed. 792. The plaintiff cites the fact, as excusing his delay, that during three years of that period he was engaged in supporting his original patent in the court and could not withdraw his original patent without abandoning his suit, and also cites in support of his contention, Gross v. Norris (D. C.) 18 F.(2d) 418, whieh was affirmed in (C. C. A.) 26 F.(2d) 898, without considering this issue. The plaintiff had previously appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals in the ease of Gross v. Frank, and after a decision in that court (293 F. 702) had proceeded within six weeks to apply for a reissue patr ent. The District Court held, in Gross v. Norris, supra (18 F.(2d) 418), that a delay of over two years was thus satisfactorily explained. In the present ease the plaintiff was advised that the patentability of his invention as described in his original patent was denied by the defendant\u2019s answer to his prior suit in January, 1926, and he not only did not appeal from the judgment of the District Court, holding that his original patent contained no patentable invention, but slept on his rights for eight months more before making application for a reissue patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Assuming, as the District Court found, that claim 2 and three new claims of the reissue patent are broader than the claims of the original patent, we think the defendant may fairly claim to have acquired intervening rights as to the use of the so-called Donnelly machines, which it began to use even before the machine of the plaintiff was placed on the market, and which it has continued to use after the plaintiff\u2019s machine was held by the District Court in the prior suit not to involve 'a patentable invention, and after the plaintiff had abandoned his rights under his original patent by failing to appeal from the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">It is suggested that Donnelly made his machine after seeing the plaintiff\u2019s and copied the principles of it, and, therefore, is not in this court with clean hands; but this is only an inference from the omission of a date from Donnelly\u2019s first drawing that some of the officials and employees went to see the Ban court machine some time in the summer of 1923. To the contrary is the direct testimony of Donnelly and the evidence of some of the officials and employees of the defendant, that the defendant for some time prior to the time when the plaintiff began working on his machine \u2014 whieh he did while in the defendant\u2019s employ and withput advising the defendant of what he was doing \u2014 had expended considerable sums in an effort to obtain a satisfactory \u201ctap-splitting\u201d machine. The District Court could have as well found from the evidence that the plaintiff got his idea of his invention from discussions which he overheard while in the defendant\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In any event, the District Court in this suit held that he did not show a reasonable excuse for not applying for his reissue patent within the two year period, or promptly after his original patent was declared invalid. What was a reasonable time within which to apply for a reissue, or what constituted a rea- - sonable excuse for not applying within the two year period, was a question of fact for the sitting justice. We do not find that his finding on this point was clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\"> Orally.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
