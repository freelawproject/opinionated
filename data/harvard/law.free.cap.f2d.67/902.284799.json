The District Court on final hearing, although it held that under the evidence a ease of forfeiture had been made out, dismissed the libel on the sole ground that the section of the law indorsed on it had been repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">It is true that 19 USCA \u00a7 498 was repealed by the Tariff Act of June 17, 1980, 46 Stat. 762, \u00a7 651 (a) (1). But its provisions were at the same time re-enacted almost in haee verba. 19 USCA \u00a7 1594. The same provision of law was therefore kept in force without interruption. The indorsement on the libel of the repealed statute was no part of the libel. The only material question before the court was whether the facts alleged made out a ease of forfeiture under any law of the United States. Williams v. United States, 168 U. S. 382, 389, 18 S. Ct. 92, 42 L. Ed. 509; Wessels v. United States (C. C. A.) 262 P. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
