Upon the return day, the District Court vacated and set aside that part of the order which restrained the prohibition agents from entering the premises and remaining in the brewery between the hours of 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon and 7:30 o\u2019clock in the forenoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">An appeal was taken from this order and a supersedeas was allowed by this court with the proviso that the brewery was not to operate between the hours of 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon and 7:30 in the forenoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Since the appeal was argued in this court, it has come to the attention of the court that the permit of the appellant for the year 1932, under which the brewery operated, has expired and a new permit to manufacture beer not exceeding 3.2 per cent, of alcohol was issued to the appellant; that this permit has been revoked and the brewery is not now being operated. Consequently, the questions involved in this case have become moot, and so the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
