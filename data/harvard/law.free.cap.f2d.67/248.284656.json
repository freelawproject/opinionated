The argument for the appellant assumes that he had not been convicted of an offense but was in jail awaiting trial, and urges that such a prisoner is not properly in the custody of the Attorney General but of the court, and that his escape from such custody was as a matter of law not an offense against this statute. But no such case is made by the record. The petition for the writ does not make that allegation, and the warden\u2019s response which stands unchallenged shows that appellant was convicted of another offense at Memphis and sentenced on September 4, 1929, to two years\u2019 imprisonment, and that the sentence for the escape specified that it should commence at the expiratioh of the sentence imposed at Memphis on September 4, 1929. It thus appears that on December 26, 1930, the date of the escape, appellant was under sentence and properly should have been in the custody of the Attorney General, and might very well for sufficient reason have been by him placed in the jail as a penal institution. The indictment should have al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>leged how and why the defendant therein was in the custody of the Attorney General and not have stopped at alleging the legal conclusion that he was properly in such custody. But an indictment which manifestly seeks to charge the breach of a valid statute and has gone to final judgment of conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction may not be nullified for such a defect through a writ of habeas corpus.
