The right to reclaim is asserted under a contract set out below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The Wayside Stores, party to the eontraet of June 12, 1930, was a partnership. Bankrupt, which was incorporated on June 30, 1930, continued to receive furniture shipped under the contract. The eontraet was not filed for record until October 7, 1932, and the petition in bankruptcy was filed on October 22,1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Appellant claims that the eontraet is one of consignment. The referee held that the eontraet was one of conditional sale not filed as required by the law of Wisconsin, and that it was not an agreement between the bankrupt and the appellant. The District Court sustained the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">In considering this eontraet, the language of this court In re Leflys, 229 F. 695, 696, is pertinent. The court said: \u201cThe eontraet under consideration is one not easy to classify. It indicates an intention to s\u00e9eure the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of a conditional sale. In arriving at a proper construction of it, little weight can be given to the frequent allusions therein to the claim that the relation of the parties is that of principal and agent, as against the effect of its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">In the eontraet now before the court there is no provision for the segregation and marking of the goods. It is not required that the Wayside Ihirniture Company shall be held out as the agent of the appellant. There is ' no reservation of title in the proceeds and no provision against commingling of the proceeds. The Wayside Company could sell the furniture at any price and on such terms as it saw fit to do. Its only obligation was to pay to the Union Company within thirty days after sales made by second party the amount at which the furniture was invoiced. The provision that the Wayside Company shall have \u201cthe privilege of purchasing such furniture or any part thereof upon such terms as may be specifically agreed to by the parties thereto\u201d is meaningless unless it is read in connection with the right of the Wayside Company to sell the furniture and convey title thereto upon payment of the invoice price within thirty days. Taking the instrument as a whole, it appears that the consignee is at liberty to sell at a price and on terms fixed by itself, being answerable to the consignor for a fixed price. The eontraet, in our opinion, cannot be regarded as one of consignment. In re Leflys, supra; Flanders Motor Co. v. Reed (C. C. A.) 220 F. 642, 644; In re GarcewiCh (C. C. A.) 115 F. 87; In re United States Electrical Supply Co. (D. C.) 2 F.(2d) 378, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">The distinction between a contract such as the one now before us and contracts like the ones involved in Ludvigh v. American Woolen Company, 231 U. S. 522, 34 S. Ct. 161, 58 L. Ed. 345, and similar eases, is pointed out in Flanders Motor Co. v. Reed, supra. The court said</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">\u201cThe District Court held the trustee in' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that case entitled to the goods, notwithstanding the attempted reservation of title (176 F. 155); the Court of Appeals reaching the contrary result (188 F. 30, 110 C. C. A. 180), and the decision of the Court of Appeals being affirmed by the Supreme Court. In the opinion of the Court of Appeals it was said (188 F. 30, 33, 110 C. C. A. 180,183):</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>\u201c </em>'Contracts of sale under which title is to remain in the vendor, although the vendee may consume the goods, or sell them and apply the proceeds to his own use, are fraudulent as to creditors, because the stipulation that title is to remain in the vendor is entirely inconsistent with the purpose of the contract\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u2014citing the decision of the same court in Re Garcewich, 115 F. 87, 53 C. C. A. 510. In the ease at bar there were no provisions to prevent the vendee from thus consuming the goods, or selling them and applying the proceeds to his own use, and Re Gareewieh therefore applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We are also of the opinion that the contract falls within the definition of \u201cconditional sale\u201d in section 122.01 of the Wisconsin Statutes, 1931.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The right of the consignee to sell on his own terms and convey title subject only to a liability to pay the invoice price within thirty days is a relinquishment by the consignor of title to the proceeds which stand for the property in the hands of the consignee. This brings tbe contract within the definition of paragraph (a). While appellant claims that the clause giving consignee the right to purchase the property upon such terms as the parties may agree to adds nothing to the contract, nevertheless, it is in the contract, and brings it within the terms of paragraph (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Appellant asserts that, as the contract was filed on October 7, 1932, and the bankruptcy suit was not filed until October 22, 1932, it is valid against the trustee under section 122.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes, 1931.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\">The document filed was a contract between Union Furniture Company and Wayside Furniture Stores, by W. K. Kuebler, its trustee. Nothing was filed to show that it was adopted or acted upon by bankrupt. No contract with bankrupt was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-20\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-23\"> \u201cThis agreement, made this 30th day of June 1930, between Union Furniture Company of Rockford, Illinois, party of the first part, and Wayside Furniture Stores, party of the second part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-24\">\u201cWitnessoth: That the party of the first part in consideration of the compensation and conditions hereafter named, agrees to forward to the party of the second part, on consignment, certain articles of furniture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-25\">\u201cThat the party of the second part, in consideration of the said furniture forwarded to him or them by the party of the first part, on consignment, agrees to accept, take delivery of, and sell the said furniture and to remit and pay to the party of the first part the sum or sums of money set forth on invoice rendered at the time of shipment, or such part or parts thereof as is represented by the values as so invoiced, of the furniture sold, within thirty (30) days after such sale or sales are made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-26\">\u201cThat the party of the second part shall pay all expenses for the storage, cartage, transportation\u00bb handling, sale, and distribution of the said furniture and all expenses incident thereto, except on return of merchandise requested by party of the first part, or on account of defects, in which case said expense shall be paid by party of the first part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-27\">\u201cThat the party of the second part shall insure the said furniture against both fire and theft for the protection of the party of the first part, and the party of the second part agrees that the failure to keep said insurance in full force and effect shall be deemed negligence on the part of the party of the second part and render him, or them liable to the party of the first part for any loss occasioned by such failure to insure.
