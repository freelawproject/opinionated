The plaintiff contended that on July 18, 1894, while descending the stairs in a building owned by the defendant he was precipitated to the floor below and sustained injuries by reason of the negligence of the defendant, his agents atid servants, in permitting a tread on the stairs to become defective and unsafe. Trial in the Superior Court before <em>Grasicill, </em>J., who directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions, which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-10\"><em>J.
