I told the defendant they wanted him back there; he said, \u2018 What for ? \u2019 I said some one was run over, and the defendant turned and went back; later he went away again and I followed him to the stable in Pembroke Street and saw him get out of the carriage. ... I told him we were sent to see who he was. He called me in. I gave him my name and address and asked him his, and he said,6 Never mind my name.\u2019 \u201d On cross-examination, the same witness stated: \u201c When the defendant in the carriage drove back to the scene of the accident, the coup\u00e9 into which the plaintiff had been put had just started off, and the \u2022 plaintiff was gone; that the defendant then turned and drove .towards the stable and I followed him.\u201d Another witness subsequently testified: \u201cI saw the vehicle going away at a rapid rate; I did not see the occupant of the carriage, saw no whip used and heard nothing said to the horse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">1. The defendant\u2019s first exception is to the admission of Mauer\u2019s testimony. The refusal of the defendant to give his name to Maher, who said, \u201c We were sent to see who he was,\u201d might reasonably be considered by the jury to be an act indicating that thq defendant did not wish his name known and was endeavoring to hide it from the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>sel argues that the defendant was under no obligation to give Mauer an answer, because Mauer\u2019s action in following the defendant and demanding his name was entirely gratuitous, and, in fact, he had not been sent. But this was not known to the defendant at that time, and it is his refusal to give his name under the circumstances then appearing which is significant; we think the testimony was competent. We also think it was competent for Mauer to testify that the defendant drove away and did not turn back until requested so to do by him, though this was denied by the defendant. It was for the jury to determine whether they believed Mauer or the defendant on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">2. The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury: \u201c First. If the plaintiff came round from behind McGovern\u2019s team, and the defendant had not the opportunity to perceive the plaintiff until it was too late to stop or change the direction of the defendant\u2019s horse, the defendant would not be liable.\u201d The defendant contended that the rule of the road applied to the locus where the accident happened. This instruction was deficient if, as the defendant contended, the rule of the road applied to the case ; it was deficient because it omitted from the case the question whether the defendant or the plaintiff was complying with the rule of the road; on this point the evidence was conflicting ; it was also deficient in not instructing the jury what consideration should be given by them to the speed at which the defendant was .driving, on which point, also, the evidence was conflicting; if the jury believed that the defendant was driving at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour, the facts stated in this ruling would not have been, as matter of law, a <em>defence; Purtell </em>v. Jordan, 156 Mass. 573; that fact would have taken the case out of the rule laid down in <em>Messenger </em>v. Dennie, 137 Mass. 197, and the other cases relied on by the defendant in this connection. The principle of this request, so far as it was applicable to the case, was adopted by the presiding justice, and- instructions fully covering the facts of the case were given. The judge was not bound to tell the jury that certain facts would or would not constitute negligence apart from other facts already testified to. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston </em>Railroad, 160 Mass. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">3. The ruling requested by the defendant, \u201c Third. If the plaintiff was travelling on his wheel at a rate faster than seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>miles an hour just before and up to the instant of the accident, and that was one of the causes of the accident, he was not in the exercise of due care,\u201d is in conflict with the St. 1894, c. 479, and was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">4. There was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant and of due care on the part of the plaintiff, and therefore the fourth, fifth, and sixth requests for rulings were rightly refused.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> These requests were as follows: \u201c 4. There is no evidence of the negligence of the defendant. 5. The plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care and cannot recover. 6. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
