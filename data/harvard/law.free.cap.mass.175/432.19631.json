St. 1819, c. 156, \u00a7 1. Rev. Sts. c. 117, \u00a7 1. <em>Thaxter </em>v. Williams, 14 Pick. 49, 53. See <em>Howard </em>v. Robinson, 5 Cush. 119. The lien was extended by St. 1851, c. 343, to cases where the person who made the contract for labor or materials had \u2022contracted with the owner of the land for its purchase, \u201cfor the purpose of erecting and [any] building thereon.\u201d See <em>Donahy </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>12 Cush. 440; <em>Metcalf </em>v. Hunnewell, 1 Gray, 297. By St. 1852, c. 307, \u00a7 1, the lien was further extended to cases in which labor or labor and materials had been \u201c expended in the erection or repair of any building, by virtue of any contract with the owner thereof, or other person having authority to contract for such labor \u201d; with a proviso that no lien for materials should attach to any building or land, unless, before furnishing the materials, the person claiming the lien had given notice of his intention to claim it to the owner of the land and to the person \u25a0who had contracted with the owner. It was held, in <em>Belding </em>v. Cushing, 1 Gray, 576, 579, 580, under the statute last cited, that it was the intention of the Legislature \u201c to provide the means for imposing, in behalf of laborers and mechanics, a lien upon real estate only, and not upon personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In the year after this decision the Legislature made a further provision, the language of which made \u201c any building or structure upon real estate \u201d the subject of the lien, as well as the interest of the owner of the building or structure in the lot of land on which it was situated, with a proviso that no lien for materials should attach, unless notice of intention to claim a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>lien was given to the owner of the land if such owner was not the purchaser of the materials. St. 1855, c. 431, \u00a7 1. The language of this statute includes all buildings and structures on real estate, whether the buildings are personal property or part of the realty. That it was so intended and understood by the Legislature is apparent from the note reviewing this legislation appended by the commissioners who reported the revision of the laws in the year 1858, which became the General Statutes of 1860, to chapter 150 of their report, in which note they state that, \u201cAs the lien may be upon a building or structure the owner of which has no estate or interest in the land upon which it is erected,\u201d certain provisions have been altered \u201c so as to provide for a sale in such cases; but as the property in such building might be, and for some purposes is, regarded as personal estate, and as the owner of the land might perhaps require its removal, section 24 [the section giving a right of redemption in real estate sold] has not been extended to such cases.\u201d One alteration so made to provide for a sale in cases where the owner of the building or structure has no estate or interest in the land upon which it is erected, was the substitution in \u00a7 2 of the words \u201c notice to the owner of the property to be affected by the lien \u201d for the words <em>\u201c </em>notice to the owner of the land,\u201d found in St. 1855, c. 431, \u00a7 1. Another alteration for the same purpose was the substitution of the words <em>\u201c </em>shall order notice to be given to the owner of the building or structure,\u201d in \u00a7 14 of the commissioner\u2019s draft, for the words \u201c shall order notice to be given to the owner of the land \u201d used in Rev. Sts. c. 117, \u00a7 7. So the words, \u201c When the owner of the land shall have failed to perform his part of the contract,\u201d found in Rev. Sts. c. 117, \u00a7 13, are changed by the commissioners to \u201c When the owner-fails to perform his part of' the contract,\u201d in \u00a7 20 of the draft. And in \u00a7 27 of the draft, providing for the disposition of a surplus of proceeds of a sale made in enforcing a lien, the words \u201c shall be forthwith paid over to the owner of the property \u201d are substituted for the words \u201c shall be forthwith paid over to the owner of the land,\u201d used in Rev. Sts. c. 117, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">The provisions reported by the commissioners were enacted by the Legislature. See Gen. Sts. c. 150, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 14, 20, 27. The language of \u00a7 1 gives the lien upon \u201c any building or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>structure upon real estate,\u201d if the debt is due \u201cby virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of such building or structure, or any person having authority from, or rightfully acting for, such owner \u201d; and the language of the present statute, Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, is the same, save that the words \u201c a building or structure \u201d are used in the latter as the equivalent of \u201c any building or structure.\u201d See Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 16, 23, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In our opinion this makes it clear that Gen. Sts. c. 150 and Pub. Sts. c. 191 were intended by the Legislature to give a lien upon buildings the owner of which had no estate or interest in the land upon which the building was erected, as well as upon any interest which the owner of a building might have in land on which it might be erected, and that the lien might extend to a building erected upon land although the building was personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The contrary opinion expressed in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Fessenden, </em>106 Mass. 228, 231, and in <em>Stevens </em>v. Lincoln, 114 Mass. 476, 478, was not necessary to the decision of either of those cases, and therefore is not binding as an authoritative construction of the statute. In neither of those cases was the building personal property. In the former it was put upon the land by one who had merely a written agreement with the owners of the land for its purchase; and the lien was denied, for the sufficient reason that a person holding such an agreement merely could not charge the building with a lien, because he was not the owner of the building, under the authority of <em>Poor </em>v. Oakman, 104 Mass. 309. The statements, \u201c If he had had an interest in the building as personal property, the lien would not have attached,\u201d to which <em>Belding </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>1 Gray, 576, decided as we have seen before the adoption of the General Statutes, alone is cited, and \u201c The statutes do not contemplate any severance of the building, or a sale of it, or of any interest in it, separate from an interest of the owner in the land itself,\u201d were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">So in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>114 Mass. 476, where a lien was denied because by mistake a schoolhouse had been built partly upon lands of the town and partly upon lands of other persons, and it was not shown how much of the work was done on the respondent\u2019s land, there was no ground for contending that thp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>building was personal property. So much of it as stood on land of other persons than the respondent was the real estate of those persons, and so much of it as stood on the respondent\u2019s land was the respondent\u2019s real estate; and the ground upon which the exceptions were sustained was, that it could not be shown how much of the work was done upon the building on the respondent\u2019s land. The statement, \u201c It is well settled that if a party for whom work is done has an interest in a building only as personal property, the owner of the land never having consented to or authorized such work thereon, no lien can attach thereto, and this because such party has no interest which can be sold so as to render the lien effectual; and further, that it is not contemplated by the statutes that there shall be any severance of the building, or a sale of it or of any interest in it separate from an interest of the owner in the land itself,\u201d to which <em>Belding </em>v. <em>Cushing </em>and <em>Hayes v. Fessenden </em>are cited, was not necessary to the decision and was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">In our opinion, under the true construction of Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, a lien is given upon any building or structure upon real estate, irrespective of the fact whether the building is real or personal property, to any person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished, or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of such a building by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of such building or structure, or of any person having authority from, or rightfully acting for, such owner in procuring or furnishing such labor or materials. If the owner of the building has an interest in the land on which the building is situated the lien attaches also to that interest. And under the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 191, the lien can be enforced by a sale of the building alone, if its owner has no interest in the land on which it is situated, and by a sale of the building and of the interest of the owner of the building in the land, if he has an interest in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In the present case the lease to the respondent required the erection of the building, and so was a consent to its erection on the part of the owner of the land, and as the lease also gave to the respondent an estate for years in the land, this made the respondent the owner of the building within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Pub. Sts. c. 191, \u00a7 1, for the term of years at least. We assume further, as the respondent contends, that the terms of the lease have the effect to prevent the building from becoming part of the realty, and that it is the respondent\u2019s personal property. Notwithstanding this, the liens of the petitioners attached to the building, and to the respondent\u2019s estate for years in the land on which the building is situated, and were properly ordered to be established. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
