The prayer was for remedy against the mistake under which he accepted the offer and conveyed the land, by permitting him to refer the question of damages to a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">The defendant demurred, assigning among other things as ground therefor want of equity. In the Superior Court a decree was entered that the demurrer be sustained and the bill dismissed; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-11\">G. <em>W. </em>Parke., <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-12\"><em>P.

In so far as his liability depended upon the law authorizing such an assessment and he was mistaken about that, it was a mistake as to the general well known law on the subject and not of fact. And moreover we do not understand the bill to allege that the plaintiff was mistaken about the law. In so far as his liability depended upon any assessment which the proper authorities might thereafter lay and he was mistaken about that, it was a mistake not with reference to the existence at that time of a certain fact, but simply as to the probability of the occurrence of a future event. This is not a mistake of fact within the meaning of that term in the rules in equity concerning the rescission or reformation of a contract. The mistake must be with reference to a fact past or present. Kerr, Fraud &amp; Mistake, (2d ed.) 476. Beach, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 49. <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Memphis, </em>84 N.
