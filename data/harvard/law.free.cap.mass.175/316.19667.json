Con. (13th ed.) 238 <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>8 Gray, 172; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Weir, 1 </em>Allen, 261, and cases there cited; and we know of nothing in our statutes respecting the relations of husband and wife to each other, and to the property of each other, which should change this rule so far as material to this case. But the husband is not so liable if the wife has property adequate to her support. He is liable only upon ground of reasonable necessity. Where, however, the wife has some means, the question as to whether in any particular case her means are such as to relieve the husband from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>liability for the articles furnished is generally a question of fact and not of law. <em>Liddlow </em>v. Wilmot, 2 Stark. 86. <em>Thorpe </em>v. Shapleigh, 67 Maine, 235. Hall v. Weir, ubi <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In this case the defendant was thirty-two years of age, and his wife much older, and he had left her without justifiable cause. It appears that at that time she was the owner of an equity of redemption of the value of $2,000 in a house in Haverhill, the rents of which were applied to payment of the interest on the mortgage and taxes, and were, during the separation, no more than sufficient for that purpose, and that she had no other <em>property; </em>that upon her husband\u2019s desertion she lived alone for a time and afterwards went to live with her daughter, the plaintiff, upon the credit of the husband, at the rate of $3.50 a week, which was a reasonable rate. It does not appear what property the defendant had, or what his station in life was.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The court declined to rule that \u201c the wife having property of her own the husband was not liable for necessaries furnished to her without his knowledge or assent by one who knew the wife\u2019s circumstances,\u201d and having so declined, found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The wife was homeless. She had no personal property, nor does it appear that her interest in real estate was such that she could realize upon it so as to relieve her distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We cannot say, as matter of law, under the circumstances, that the ruling requested should have been given. Whether the wife\u2019s necessity was so great as to make the defendant liable was a question of fact and not of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
