The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after the bill was dismissed, to this court, on appeal, upon agreed facts, the nature of which appears in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>S.

It is evident that the Legislature thought that a fire used to melt ores and metals was dangerous; and that a fire used to heat them was not dangerous ; and for that reason it forbade the erection of a furnace, but did not forbid the erection of a forge. <em>Decree dismissing Mil affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
