It is to be presumed that she could bear children, although her offspring would probably have been affected by the disease. The marriage was followed by cohabitation for four months, and, consummation must be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\">As was plainly intimated in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>171 Mass. 404, 410, the concealed existence of venereal disease of such a character, in one of the parties to a marriage which has been consummated, is not a sufficient ground for a decree of nullity of marriage. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
