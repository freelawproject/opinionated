Forrest executed to the defendant a mortgage, containing a power of sale, of his interest in certain real estate in Lynn ; that the mortgage was conditioned to pay the sum of $2,100, with interest, and provided that, in case of a default and subsequent sale, the proceeds should be applied first to the legal indebtedness of the defendant, and that the surplus should be paid to the mortgagor ; that there had been a default in the conditions of the mortgage, and the property was duly sold according to its terms, on or about April 9, 1898, to Ralph W. Putnam, for the sum of $2,571, which sum exceeded all the indebtedness of the defendant by the amount of $219.27; that subsequently to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the execution of the mortgage to the defendant, and prior to the foreclosure sale, namely, on June 19,1897, the plaintiff made an attachment of Forrest\u2019s interest in the real estate described in the mortgage, and the attachment was duly recorded, as required by law, and was the first of numerous attachments and other liens recorded on Forrest\u2019s equity in the premises ; that the plaintiff recovered judgment in his action against Forrest for the sum of $215, and execution was issued thereon on November 9, 1898, which had never been satisfied, in whole or in part; that within thirty days from the date of the judgment, namely, on December 7, 1898, the plaintiff had maintained his lien on the surplus proceeds of the sale of the land by filing this bill and causing a demand to be made on the defendant for the share of such surplus belonging to Forrest; and that the plaintiff was entitled to have the defendant pay over the share of Forrest in such surplus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">The prayer of the bill was that the defendant be ordered to account to the plaintiff for the proceeds of sale, and to pay over to the plaintiff the share of Forrest in such proceeds, or so much thereof as should satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim, after deducting the indebtedness of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The answer alleged that, on April 29, 1898, the defendant, without notice of any legal proceedings by the plaintiff against Forrest, and upon the latter\u2019s order, paid $200 of the surplus proceeds in its hands to one Holcombe, an execution creditor of Forrest, of whose claim it had notice before the sale, and paid the balance of $19.27 to Forrest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">Hearing before Sheldon, J., who dismissed the bill, with costs; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>F.

In that case it was held that a mortgagee who had released a portion of the mortgaged premises was not bound to contribute to a subsequent mortgagee of the existence of whose mortgage he had no notice, actual or constructive, at the time of such release. It was further held that the fact that such subsequent mortgage had been duly recorded was not constructive notice to him. See also <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Norcross, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>14 Pick. 224; <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>141 Mass. 489. In the opinion in <em>George </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>9 Allen, 80, 84, it is said that when a purchaser from the mortgagor seeks to enforce his equity against a mortgagee who has released a portion of the mortgaged premises prior to\" the conveyance to such purchaser, \u201c it is reasonable to require strict proof of notice. He [the purchaser] takes his title with full knowledge that it is subject to the mortgage; and if he does not perfect it by a release, he ought not to subject the mortgagee to the constant necessity of investigating transactions between the mortgagor and third persons subsequent to the mortgage, in order to protect him; when by giving notice he can so easily protect himself. The establishing of such mere collateral equities, which do not affect the legal title, cannot be considered as within the pimposes intended to be accomplished by the statutes for registration of deeds.\u201d We think that this reasoning applies to the case of an attachment of an equity of redemption, and that if the attaching creditor wishes to protect any interest that he may have in the proceeds remaining in the mortgagee\u2019s hands upon a foreclosure sale he should give due notice to the mortgagee. Upon a foreclosure sale the' attachment is not transferred by operation of law to the funds in the hands of the \u25a0mortgagee. It is only by due proceedings in equity that the \u25a0creditor can secure the benefit of his attachment if there should be a surplus remaining in the mortgagee\u2019s hands- upon the foreclosure -sale. And we think that, as said in <em>George </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>he \u25a0can easily protect himself by giving notice to the mortgagee, \u2022and that it is more reasonable to require him to do so than, it is to compel the mortgagee at his peril to keep run of all attachments and conveyances subsequent to his mortgage. See Jones, Mortgages, \u00a7 1930; Fisher, Mortgages, \u00a7 846; Robbins, Mortgages, 914; <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>[1895] A. C. 495; <em>M\u2019Lean </em>v. <em>Lafayette Bank, </em>4 McLean, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">' We see no difference in principle between the case of a release of a portion of the mortgaged premises by the mortgagee and the case of payment of the \u201csurplus remaining on a foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed ; Mil dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
