The error alleged is that, by mistaken figures in a plan giving a measurement which the scale of the plan showed to be wrong, every one was misled at the trial and the defendant in error recovered a strip of land to which she was not entitled. In short, it is an attempt to re-try a case upon its merits by writ of error, on the ground that the time for review has gone by, and that otherwise the plaintiff in error will suffer wrong. A writ of error has no such function. \u201c A party cannot re-try his case upon error.\u201d <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>139 Mass. 471. \u201c Error in fact cannot be assigned, where it contradicts the record, and where the matter of fact might have been put in issue and tried, and <em>a fortiori, </em>when it is in fact put in issue and tried.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Waugh, </em>8 Cush. 220, 221. <em>Bodurtha </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>3 Gray, 508, 512. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>135 Mass. 189, 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">\n<em>Writ of error dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
