J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD8\">It is not denied that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff under St. 1892, c. 270, if that statute is constitutional. The effect of that act is that if a city or town sees fit voluntarily to order the construction of public works owned by it, then, <em>nolens volens, </em>it must assume a part of the responsibility of an employer to the workmen employed by the contractor with whom it deals. It is intended to be a milder application of the principle of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws. We see no constitutional objection to the law. It is a familiar type of statute, and has been upheld heretofore. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Boston, Revere Beach, Lynn Railroad, </em>121 Mass. 510. A compulsory relation of master and servant is not unknown even to the common law. <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>134 Mass. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
