A decree was entered for the plaintiff in the Superior Court; and she appealed to this conrt. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-10\"><em>W. B. Orcutt W.

The case is before us on an appeal from this decree, the plaintiff contending that the amount which she is required to pay is too large.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">The case was heard by a master, and came before the Superior Court on the master\u2019s report and the plaintiff\u2019s objections and exceptions thereto. An examination of the exceptions shows that no exception was taken to either of the findings of the master which the plaintiff seeks to have reviewed by this court. There is no question, therefore, properly before us. <em>Popple </em>v. <em>Day, </em>123 Mass. 520; and the decree of the Superior Court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>therefore be affirmed. As the time allowed for redemption has expired, pending the appeal, that court may, if it sees fit, allow a further time for that purpose. <em>Deoree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
