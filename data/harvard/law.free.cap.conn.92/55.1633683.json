Lyon, then of Bridgeport, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>this action was not brought against his executrix until December, 1915. To a plea of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff replied that Lyon removed from the State of Connecticut in 1892 and continued to reside out of the State until his death in April, 1915. The reply was traversed, and the finding on that point is that Lyon and his wife took an apartment in New York City in 1892 and removed from the State, and were without the State until his death, except that from 1892 until the death of his mother in 1906 Lyon continued to keep a residence at his mother\u2019s house in Bridgeport, where for a considerable part of each year he spent three days a week. It is also found that Lyon\u2019s name was on the voting list of the city of Bridgeport until his death, that he sometimes voted there, and that it was his usual custom to spend Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays of each week at his mother\u2019s house, where he had a room, except those portions of the year when he was away from Bridgeport on some trip or vacation. There are other findings not inconsistent with the above, which, in the view we take of the case, need not be repeated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-6\"><em>William H. Comley, Jr., </em>with whom was <em>Charles A. Hopwood, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\"><em>W. Parker Seeley, </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b70-8\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axq\">The controlling question is whether Lyon was \u201cwithout the State,\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes, \u00a7 1125, from 1892 to 1906, so that the statute of limitations did not run against the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action during that period. If it did run, the plea was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">It seems clear that the finding concludes the point against the plaintiff\u2019s contention. The finding is that Lyon was without the State except as therein stated; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>but the exceptions nullify the affirmation. In <em>Sage </em>v. Hawley, 16 Conn. 106, we held that the proviso as to absence from the State did not refer to temporary absences, but was intended to preserve the plaintiff\u2019s right of action during a period when, by reason of the defendant\u2019s absence, it was impossible to commence an action <em>in personam </em>against the defendant; and we said that if the defendant is domiciled or resident within the State, although temporarily absent therefrom, the statutes still provide a way by which a personal action may be commenced against him, in which a judgment may be obtained which will be binding and conclusive between the parties, and therefore in such a case no saving of the right of the plaintiff to commence such an action is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In this case the defendant was not even absent from the State. He was customarily in Bridgeport three days in the week, and by the exercise of ordinary diligence the creditor could have ascertained that fact, and commenced his action at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The finding that he sometimes voted in Bridgeport, indicates very strongly that Lyon himself regarded Bridgeport as his legal domicil. There is no finding on the point of domicil, but it is expressly found that he had a residence in Bridgeport, and the necessary inference from the other facts found is that he also had a usual place of abode in Bridgeport. A man may be a resident in two or more States at the same time, and the house where a resident of Connecticut habitually spends three days in the week for a period of fourteen years, except when away on trips and vacations, is his usual place of abode for the purpose of serving process upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
