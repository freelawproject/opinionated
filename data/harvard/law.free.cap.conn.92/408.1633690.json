Ward of Bridgeport, deceased, brought to and reserved by the Superior Court in Fair-field County, <em>Curtis, J., </em>upon an agreed statement of .facts, for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">In 1894 Lucinda J. Ward of Bridgeport executed a will by which her entire estate, both real and personal, was left to trustees, the income, and at their discretion, the principal, to be paid to her three sons, Charles, Edward, and Harry, during their lives, the issue of any deceased son to take the share of his or her parent. After the death of the three sons the property was to be disposed of as directed by the will of Charles, \u201cand should he fail to make such will, the residue and remainder shall be divided equally among the heirs at law of my three sons according to the laws of distribution of intestate estates in the State of Connecticut.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">In July, 1898, Charles died leaving neither widow nor issue and without executing the power. In January, 1900, the testatrix executed a codicil in which she ratified and confirmed her will with some minor exceptions not now material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">In April, 1901, the testatrix died. Edward died without issue in 1907, leaving a widow Mary Elizabeth Ward. Harry died without issue in 1916 leaving a widow Harriet M. Ward. A fourth son of the testatrix, George, died before the will was executed, leaving a son, Brownlee Robertson Ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">Plaintiff is the sole trustee under the codicil, and the following claims are made upon the funds in his hands. Brownlee Robertson Ward claims the whole fund as the only \u201cheir at law\u201d of his three uncles. Harriet M. Ward and Mary Elizabeth Ward claim to be entitled to share in the fund as persons entitled to take \u201caccording to the laws of distribution of intestate estates in the State of Connecticut.\u201d Mary Elizabeth claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>also, as executrix of the estate of her husband, on the theory that the remainder over to the heirs at law of the three sons was void under the statute against perpetuities, and that the fund in question is intestate estate of the testatrix.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-6\"><em>Robert H.

It is not void under the common-law rule.-</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">All the other claims depend upon the answer to the question whether, .under the proper construction of the residuary clause, the fund is to be divided among the heirs at law of the three sons, or among those entitled to share in intestate estates according to the statute of distribution., '</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Our decisions recognize the fact that the phrase \u201cheirs at law\u201d is sometimes used by testators in the latter sense. \u201cThe term \u2018legal heirs,\u2019 in legal strictness, signifies those who would inherit real estate. <em>Ruggles </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Randall, </em>70 Conn. 44, 38 Atl. 885. It is also used to indicate those who would take under the statute of distribution. <em>Tingier </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>71 Conn. 466, 469, 42 Atl. 718.\u201d <em>Dickerman </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>83 Conn. 342, 345, 76 Atl. 362. In fact, the word \u201cheirs\u201d has been so often used and construed as including all who would inherit either real or personal estate, that there is no longer any good reason for insisting upon its technical significance, except where the intention to use it in that sense is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In this context the phrase \u201cheirs at law\u201d cannot reasonably be used in its technical legal significance. In order to do so it would be necessary to construe the words \u201caccording to the laws of distribution of intestate estates,\u201d as referring only to the rule for the division of the estate among the heirs at law of the three sons; but the testatrix has already adopted her own rule of division by the word \u201cequally.\u201d And if it be attempted to escape that difficulty by reading in the words <em>\u201cper </em>stirpes,\u201d then collateral heirs are excluded, and under the circumstances of this case the whole fund becomes intestate. The only construction which will avoid inconsistency or intestacy, is that the words \u201caccording to the laws of distribution of intestate estates\u201d refer to the persons who are to take, and so construed, they give to the term \u201cheirs at law\u201d its secondary, but not uncommon, significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The Superior Court is advised that the residue and remainder of the estate of Lucinda J. Ward under the provisions of her will and codicil should be divided equally between Harriet M. Ward, Mary Elizabeth Ward and Brownlee Robertson Ward, and that judgment should be rendered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
