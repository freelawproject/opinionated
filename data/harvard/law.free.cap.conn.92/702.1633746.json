The force of the collision threw the plaintiff off his machine, caused a severe injury to him, and he was removed to the hospital. The fact of the collision was communicated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the police headquarters of the town of Orange.- The chief of police of this town requested the defendant to send a car to take bim to the place of the accident. The defendant took a light touring-car and carried the officer to the place of the collision, which was about four miles distant from the defendant\u2019s garage. This was about eleven o\u2019clock at night. The defendant refused to permit the motorcycle to be loaded into his car because of its size and weight. After an unsuccessful attempt to remove the motorcycle from the highway, the defendant carried the officer back to police headquarters, where a report was made of the collision. After the matter had been reported to police headquarters, the defendant went to his home. Early in the morning of October 11th, the defendant was called up by an officer of the police department and requested by him to go up in the morning and get the plaintiff\u2019s machine. This the defendant agreed to do. When the defendant attempted to obtain possession of the plaintiff\u2019s machine it could not be found, as some one had removed it during the latter part of the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">It is plain from the evidence that the defendant did not stand in the relation of bailee of the plaintiff when his property was surreptitiously taken from the highway. While it is true that there are a number of different kinds of bailments, the different kinds are of the same general character, and for the purposes of this case the word may be defined to be \u201ca delivery of goods in trust, upon a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be duly executed, and the goods restored by the bailee, as soon as the purpose of the bailment shall be answered.\u201d This is a standard definition of this word, and in the present case there can be no difficulty in understanding its application to the facts presented by the record. The evidence plainly shows that the plaintiff\u2019s property was never for a moment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>defendant\u2019s possession as bailee, nor does it appear that there was any acceptance of the article by the defendant, as the law of bailment requires. The record clearly indicates that the verdict of the jury was one which could not have been reasonably reached from the evidence, and that it was properly set aside by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
