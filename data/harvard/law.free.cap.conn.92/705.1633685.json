M. Hibbard; that Hibbard died solvent between May 10th and July 10th, 1916, and that administration was granted on his estate before July 10th, 1916, and that plaintiff knew it before that date; that each of the notes of July 10th, October 11th, and January 11th, and others for the same obligation which antedated them, were negotiated by the maker with the plaintiff and discounted by it for the maker\u2019s use, and that the defendants, \u2022understanding that said notes were renewals, indorsed each of them in the reasonable belief and expectation that the estate of Hibbard would, with defendants, indorse the same before the plaintiff would discount them for the maker; that the plaintiff knew, or should have known, that the several notes took the place of the old notes, and that plaintiff took the note of July 10th, 1916, without the indorsement of Hubbard\u2019s estate and without informing .the defendants; that the plaintiff, without informing defendants, delivered the note of May 10th to some unknown person, who delivered the same to the Hibbard estate; that the plaintiff took no steps to hold the Hibbard estate liable for the indorsement of Hibbard on the note of May 10th; and that the Hibbard estate now has possession of said note of May 10th, and claims to be free from all liability because of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b720-6\">The plaintiff demurred to the answer and the Superior Court sustained the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>James P.

Negotiable Instruments Act, General Statutes, \u00a74222.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The defendants\u2019 answer will be searched in vain to find any such allegation or its equivalent. The averment that the note in question was a renewal of a note for like amount, does not change the relation or liability of the parties in any particular. Indeed, the law knows no \u201crenewed negotiable note,\u201d though that term is often used to denote a transaction wherein a note is used to pay and discharge a prior note of like tenor, without the payment, it may be, of any money. But, even so, the holder of such a note is a holder in due course. The contract is a new and independent one, and does not differ from the one implied in law upon the initial note. The defendants have alleged that the plaintiff surrendered a note bearing date May 10th, 1916, made by the Jordan Company and indorsed by these other defendants with one B. M. Hibbard, that Hibbard\u2019s indorsement was prior to that of the defendants O\u2019Brien and Stone, and that the defendants indorsed the note in suit in the expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>that the Hibbard estate would also become an indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The expectation on the part of the other indorsers, that some representative of the Hibbard estate would indorse the note, is not a sufficient defense to this action. That fact does not constitute any infirmity in the note, or defect in the title of the one negotiating it. A note'in the form of this one is negotiated when it is indorsed and delivered by any holder to the transferee, and it makes no difference, so far as the liability of such indorsers to a holder in due course is concerned, that the indorsers are accommodation parties. Even if such holder knows that one or all of the indorsers are accommodation indorsers, that does not change the indorser\u2019s liability. So, also, mere knowledge or reasonable belief on the part of the holder of the note that the several indorsers expected other accommodation parties to indorse it, even if the expectation is not realized, cannot relieve the other indorsers of their obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The liability of the indorsers to the holder of the note is not affected by any agreement among the indorsers not appearing upon the note; therefore the right of co-sureties to a contribution, or the effect of the release of one surety upon the obligations of the others, has no application in the case now before the court, whatever may be the rights and liabilities of the indorsers as between themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
