Evidence offered by the plaintiff, though contradicted by the defendants, tended to prove that the servant had for two years or more been accustomed to use the motor-truck to go to his dinner with the knowledge and consent of the defendants\u2019 manager. <em>Held </em>that under these circumstances the defendants could not complain of the charge of the trial court which permitted the jury to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>as a question of fact whether the servant was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b692-6\">Respecting the duty of the boy, the jury were instructed that he, too, was bound to use reasonable care, but that the law did not ordinarily ask of a boy the same care that it expected from a man; that the boy must exercise such degree of care as might reasonably be expected from an ordinarily prudent boy of his years similarly circumstanced; that he could not be heedless, but was bound to use his faculties and do what he reasonably could to avoid threatened danger. <em>Held </em>that these instructions correctly defined the duty of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b692-7\">With respect to damages, the jury were told that so far as they could, they were to base them upon the loss that would come to the estate of the decedent by reason of his untimely death, or in other words to award a sum which would fairly compensate for the loss of net earnings during the period of the decedent\u2019s expectancy after he reached twenty-one. <em>Held </em>that while this instruction did not contain all the elements of damage, it did the defendants no harm; and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict of $5,000. The estate of a decedent whose death is caused by negligence, is entitled to some damages for the death alone, without considering the decedent\u2019s expectation of life or his probable accumulations.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b692-8\">Argued June 4th \u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4Q\">decided July 23d, 1918.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b692-9\">Action to recover damages for personal injuries resulting in the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants, brought to the Superior Court in Fairfield County and tried to the jury before <em>M\u00e1ltbie, J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $5,000, and appeal by the defendants.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AfC\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b692-10\"><em>Carl Foster, </em>for the appellants (defendants).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b692-11\"><em>Nehemiah Candee </em>and <em>John F.

Kavano, a boy about fifteen years old, was killed on April 19th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>1917. He was struck by an automobile truck on Main Street, in tbe city of Norwalk. He was riding a bicycle and George Ayrault was driving tbe truck. Ayrault was employed by the defendants as a truck driver at the time. He was returning from a trip made to deliver merchandise for the defendants. It was about half past twelve o\u2019clock, and it was his intention to go home for his dinner. Ayrault had been accustomed to use the truck to go to his house for dinner, from two to four times a week, for a period of from two to four years, with the knowledge and consent of the employer\u2019s manager. No question is made on the appeal that the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not caused in part at least by Ayrault\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The defendants claim that the court erred (1) in submitting to the jury, as a question of fact, whether Ayrault at the time was acting within the scope of his employment; (2) in charging the jury upon the question of Kavano\u2019s duty, as a boy of fifteen years, to exercise reasonable care; and (3) in charging the jury on the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The first question above stated has been before this court in a number of cases, from <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>45 Conn. 44, to <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>88 Conn. 37, 89 Atl. 894. But the rule in this State is laid down in <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>63 Conn. 155, 28 Atl. 29, and is the one uniformly applied. In the last case the court uses this language (p. 161): \u201cIn cases where the deviation is slight and not unusual, the court may, and often will, as matter of law, determine that the servant was still executing his master\u2019s business. So too, where the deviation is very marked and unusual, the court in like manner may determine that the servant was not on the master\u2019s business at all, but on his own. Cases falling between these extremes will be regarded as involving merely a question of fact, to be left to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The court in leaving to the jury, as a question of fact, whether this act of the defendants\u2019 servant, in intending to go home to his dinner under the circumstances, was a departure from his master\u2019s service, was as favorable to the defendants as the facts in the case permitted. Ayrault was on his return trip; the outward trip was confessedly in the line of his employment, and it cannot be said that a simple intention on his part to go home with the truck for his dinner, with the consent of his employer, was a departure from his master\u2019s business. The deviation, if any, may have been so slight that the court might have properly instructed the jury as a matter of law that the servant was acting within the scope of his employment. It does not appear how far from the most direct route to defendants\u2019 yard, where presumably the truck was placed when not in use, Ayrault had departed at the time of the accident, but it does appear that the direct route from the point where he came upon Main Street, after delivering his load of merchandise, was in a southerly direction, while he turned to go northerly. It would not be contended that if Ayrault\u2019s house had been on the direct route to the yard, his purpose to stop for his dinner on the way would be a departure from his master\u2019s business, and neither can it be said as a matter of law that taking a more indirect way constituted such departure, because, so far as appears, the deviation may have been so small as to be no deviation at all, even if it is assumed that it was his intention to depart wholly from the master\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Upon the question of due care on the part of the boy Kavano, the court said: \u201cThe same rule applies to the boy with reference to what he should do as applies to the man; each must use reasonable care; but there is this distinction: you do not ordinarily ask of a boy the same care which you ask of a man, and the law does not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The law says that what a boy must do is to use that degree of care which a boy of the same degree of intelligence, of the same age, of the same experience, might reasonably be expected to exercise. It is not now the care of an ordinarily prudent man, it is the care of an ordinarily prudent boy similar to the boy in question in these various respects. So that the burden which rests upon the plaintiff in regard to the care which this boy should exercise is, did he act as a boy of that age and experience and intelligence and general surroundings might be expected to act?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">This extract may be open to objection if stated in connection with Ayrault\u2019s duty under the circumstances, because it would not be his duty to use the same precautions to avoid injury to this boy that he would be required to use with a child just beginning to walk. He is only bound to regulate his conduct by that which by due attention he could see. He could not see the boy\u2019s intelligence and experience in life. But the court also said: \u201cThe boy cannot be heedless and careless. . . . He is bound to use his faculties. He is bound to do what he can reasonably to avoid injury, to see and hear and use generally his faculties; and if he finds himself in a position where danger is imminent, he is bound to do what he can reasonably to avoid it.\u201d This correctly defines the duty of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The court charged the jury in regard to the damages in substantially the language of this court in <em>Broughel </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>73 Conn. 614, 48 Atl. 751, as follows: \u201cJust as far as you can you base it on the loss which would come to his estate by reason of his untimely death.\u201d But the trial court said further: \u201cSo that the rule, as I say, is the lump sum which will fairly give compensation for the loss of the net earnings.for the space of time which you may fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>expect this boy to live after he gets to be twenty-one.\u201d The rule thus stated does not contain all the elements of damage named in the case above cited. However, as stated, it did the defendants no harm. Quoting from that case (p. 620): \u201cUnder these statutes the right to recover a limited compensation for death alone, as one of the results or consequences of a wrong inflicted upon a man in his lifetime, survives to, or is vested in, his executors or administrators for the benefit of certain designated beneficiaries, and is thus in a certain sense made a part of his estate, regarded as that aggregate of rights and possessions which a man leaves at his death.\u201d So the law is that a man\u2019s estate is entitled to some compensation for death alone, without wandering into the somewhat hazy realm of an individual\u2019s expectation of life or his probable accumulations, though these latter are in some cases proper subjects of consideration on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict for the damages awarded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
