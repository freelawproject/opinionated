Hawes to recover from the defendant a broker\u2019s commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>claimed to be due him for the sale of certain real estate situated in the town of Milford, Connecticut, which it is alleged and claimed by the plaintiff was owned and controlled by the defendant. This suit is based upon the claim that the defendant entered into an agreement with the plaintiff whereby he was to act as agent for the sale of this property and was to have as his commission all that was received in excess of $6,000 for the property. The property at this time belonged to the defendant and to her husband, Julius H. Engler, and remained in their names upon the land records of Milford until the transfer in question. Jo-, hanna at one time prior to this transfer was conservator for her husband. The disability of the husband had been removed before the conveyance of the property. Although the husband joined in executing the deed when this real estate was transferred, it was not claimed that he had any negotiations with the plaintiff as to his commission for the sale of the property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-6\"><em>Omar W.

There was no question about the sale. The principal questions were as to the alleged agreement, and whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the sale. These were questions of fact for the jury, and there was no error in the refusal of the'trial court to set aside the verdict as being against the evidence. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>91 Conn. 404, 406, 99 Atl. 1032; <em>Roma </em>v. <em>Thames River Specialties Co., </em>90 Conn. 18, 19, 96 Atl. 169</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defendant complains because the court below failed to charge the jury as requested that: \u201cIf you find that the purchasers\u2019 attention was first called to the property in question by notices and other advertising matter of the defendant, and that it was by these means that they first learned that the property was for sale, and that they later visited the defendant unaccompanied by the plaintiff or any one representing him and there consummated the purchase of said property, then the plaintiff has failed to establish the second material allegation of his complaint . . . and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d This objection is without, merit. It appears that the court below instructed the jury fully and in detail upon this branch of the case. About one page of the record is filled with its remarks upon this subject. While the court did not adopt the exact phraseology of the defendant\u2019s requests to charge in this connection, yet the instructions upon this point were full and clear, and it is apparent that the jury could not have been misled or prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Upon the trial of the case no claim was made that the defendant was not personally liable for her acts as conservator or agent, for the nonperformance of this agreement, when acting within the scope of her authority. as such conservator or agent. This proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>is now embodied in one or more reasons of appeal. While it is the duty of the trial court to state to the jury the issues presented to it in a plain and concise manner, and to correctly state the law applicable to those issues so that the instructions will be sufficient for the guidance of the jury, yet in the present case it does not appear that the question alluded to above was raised by the pleadings or by the parties in the trial of the case in the court below. Under these circumstances the defendant should not now complain of the omission of the trial court to instruct the jury upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
