Among other things it provided that an appeal might be taken to the Court of Common Pleas for Fairfield County, at its next return day, from any judgment or decree of the court except one following a jury trial. In this particular the charter remained unchanged until the 1917 session of the General Assembly. At that session \u00a7 119 was amended to read as recited in the amending Act. In its amended form that portion of the original section above referred to, which gave the right of appeal from a judgment or decree rendered, was entirely eliminated and no pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>vision authorizing such appeal appears in it.

Those portions of the original section which were omitted from the section in its new form, ceased to be the law and were as effectually repealed as it was possible to accomplish a repeal. The defendant\u2019s attempted appeal was, therefore, without authority, and conferred upon the Court of Common Pleas no jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
