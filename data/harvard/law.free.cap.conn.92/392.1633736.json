The contract contained the following: \u201cThe said Whitman is to come and get the milk at No. 1 Wawarme Avenue, in the City of Hartford.\u201d The premises of the defendant are known as No. 1 Wawarme Avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">On the 23d day of November, 1914, by an order of the Commissioner of Domestic Animals for the State, all the defendant\u2019s cattle and products of his farm were quarantined. The defendant was quarantined and he was not allowed to go from the premises. Shortly after the quarantine order, all the cows on the farm were killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">The quarantine was intended to prevent, as far as possible, all persons and animals from going on or off the premises, as well as to prevent the removal of products of all kinds that might carry infection of the \u201choof and mouth disease,\u201d .then prevalent among the defendant\u2019s cattle. From November 22d, 1914, the defendant failed to furnish, or offer to furnish, milk until March 13th, 1915. From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff the defendant has appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Francis P. Bohrmayer, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-6\"><em>James B. Henry, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-7\">Shumway, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AME1\">This was an absolute and unconditional undertaking by the defendant to sell and deliver milk daily, of the specified quality and amount. The defendant\u2019s claim is that he was excused from the performance of the contract by reason of the quarantine, which made it illegal for him to leave his premises and carry away any products of his farm or any articles that might carry infection. The quarantine order did not make it illegal to deliver milk, nor make it illegal for the defendant to procure its delivery. This much is conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">But the defendant contends that the clause in the contract, to wit, \u201cThe said Whitman is to come and get the milk at No. 1 Wawarme Avenue,\u201d is an essential part of the contract, and as delivery was to be made at the place named, therefore delivery under the terms of the contract was illegal. There is nothing in the record to show that the defendant could not perform his contract. While it may be true that the plaintiff could not enter the defendant\u2019s house or go upon other parts of the premises which were under quarantine, it does not follow that the contract could not be performed substantially if not literally. The contract was not to deliver milk produced on the premises. All that can be said is that the defendant was under a temporary disability to perform his contract. He is not, however, released from the obligations of his contract because it was difficult or impossible to perform them, so long as the performance was not illegal. <em>School District No. 1 </em>v. <em>Dauchy, 25 </em>Conn. 530; <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Charter Oak Life Ins. Co., </em>41 Conn. 372, 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
