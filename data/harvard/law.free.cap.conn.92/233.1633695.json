Unless the car was already in sight when the plaintiff stepped off the sidewalk, it must have been running at headlong speed until within a few feet of the plaintiff, and it hardly needs the evidence before us to prove that under the conditions stated a trolley-car, although no signal is given, makes noise enough to attract the attention of a reasonably prudent person of good hearing who is about to cross the track diagonally in the middle of a block.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">There is no evidence that the motorman had an opportunity to avoid the collision after it became apparent that the plaintiff was in a position of peril from which he was making no effort to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
