In May, 1915, he accepted employment as a chauffeur, and the store was then conducted by his brothers. July 29th, 1915, he made a bona fide sale of the business, for valuable consideration, to his father, Abraham Wein, who thereupon took it over and carried it on. On July 9th, 1915, a statutory notice of intent to sell was filed by the defendant in the town clerk\u2019s office of Greenwich, and the bill of sale given by him to his father on the 29th was recorded the next day. In August, 1915, the defendant, while still acting as chauffeur, broke his leg, and was compelled to give up his employment in that capacity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>On or about September 15th, having recovered sufficiently from his injuries, he entered into his father\u2019s employment as manager of the store, at an agreed wage of $15 per week. During all the time from July 29th, 1915, until his return to the store about the middle of September, he had nothing whatever to do with its conduct. After the middle of September he continued, through the whole period covered by the transactions involved in this case, to conduct the store as his father\u2019s agent and in his father\u2019s pay. The latter lived and carried on another business in the adjoining town of Port Chester, New York. He was unfamiliar with the conduct of a store, and did not participate personally in the conduct of the one he had purchased from his son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">The plaintiff was a baker. Early in November, 1915, he for the first time sold and delivered certain goods to the store in Greenwich, and continued to do so until sometime in February, 1916. The total amount of his sales so made was $137.83. Of this amount $25 was paid to the plaintiff by Abraham. The remainder has not been paid. The goods were ordered by the defendant in charge of the store, and the same were entered upon the plaintiff\u2019s books as charged as follows, to wit, the first two pages of entries to \u201cWein,\u201d \u201cGreenwich,\u201d and the remainder to \u201cLouis Wein.\u201d All bills contracted in the conduct of the business at the store were paid either by checks of Abraham Wein or by cash taken in at the store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">The store bore no sign, inscription or notice indicating to whom the business belonged. During the time covered by the plaintiff\u2019s sales, or at least some portion of it, the name of Louis Wein appeared in both the general and telephone directories of Greenwich as the proprietor of the store, but it was placed therein before the sale, and when Louis was the proprietor. In the store at the time of sale were certain blank order slips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>with the name of Louis Wein thereon. These slips were, for reasons of economy, used subsequent to the sale as receipts for goods delivered, and such receipts were given to the plaintiff. The plaintiff made no examination of the records in the town clerk\u2019s office, and no evidence was given of representations made by either Louis or Abraham as to the ownership of the store. Demand for payment of the plaintiff\u2019s bill was made by him of Abraham personally, he having gone to the latter\u2019s house in Port Chester for the purpose. In March, 1916, Abraham was adjudicated a bankrupt. The plaintiff extended credit to the owner of the store and not to Louis.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-6\"><em>Robert R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A85v\">The plaintiff seeks recovery for goods sold and delivered by him, upon order, to a store in Greenwich. Abraham Wein, the defendant\u2019s father, was the proprietor of this store. The defendant, during the whole period covered by the plaintiff's dealings with it, had no other connection with it, or interest in the business there carried on, than as his father\u2019s agent in its management. He cannot, therefore, be held liable for the plaintiff\u2019s account, a rightful charge against his father, unless the goods whose sale and delivery furnish the basis of it, were sold and delivered upon the defendant\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The court has found that the plaintiff, in his transactions with the store, extended credit to its owner, the defendant\u2019s principal, and not to the defendant. This is a finding of fact. If it is to stand, the judgment exonerating the defendant from liability necessarily follows. It must stand unless as an ultimate fact it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>inconsistent with the subordinate evidential facts which are found, or its deduction from those subordinate facts was one which could not reasonably be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We are unable to discover such inconsistency or unreasonableness, especially in view of the facts that the only credit appearing upon the plaintiff\u2019s account was for a payment made by Abraham, and that the plaintiff sought out Abraham to make personal demand of him for payment of the balance due. In the face of these facts, strongly suggestive of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of Abraham\u2019s proprietorship and of a giving of credit to him, a trier might reasonably regard the other facts upon which the plaintiff relies, as furnishing less convincing indications as to the person, whether the principal or the agent, upon whose credit the sales were made. The original entry in the plaintiff\u2019s books is as readily explainable upon the theory that it was used to indicate the place of business, as of the place of residence of its proprietor, and the use of the order slips was an incident of the transactions with the plaintiff entirely consistent with knowledge of the true proprietorship. The absence of a sign possesses only such negative significance as arises from an absence of a representation of ownership by that method, and the directory entries, speaking the truth when made, possess no importance touching the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, since it does not appear that they ever came to the plaintiff\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In this opinion Wheeler, Beach and Shumway, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Roraback, J.</p>\n<p id=\"AUc1\">(dissenting). I am unable to agree with the conclusion just announced, although it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>be conceded that the defendant purchased the goods in question as agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">It is well settled that it \u201cis the duty of the agent, if he would avoid personal liability on a contract entered into by him on behalf of his principal, to disclose not only the fact that he is acting in a representative capacity but also the identity of his principal, as the person dealt with is not bound to inquire whether or not the agent is acting as such for another.\u201d 2 Corpus Juris, p. 816, \u00a7 491, with notes; 2 L. R. A. 811, 812, notes bottom of pages; 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 232, 234, notes bottom of pages; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Bradbury, </em>40 Conn. 32; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>48 Conn. 314.; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Allis, </em>71 Conn. 207, 215, 41 Atl. 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">It is not claimed that the defendant gave any express notice of his agency to the plaintiff; neither does it appear that there was anything in the attendant circumstances from which the plaintiff could have fairly inferred that the defendant was not conducting the business of the Greenwich store in his own name and behalf. He was residing in Greenwich, Connecticut, where the store was located, and was in the absolute control and possession of the place of business where the goods were sold and delivered. His father, Abraham, at this time was living and carrying on a different kind of business in Port Chester, New York. There were no indications, by signs or otherwise, on or about the store, that the father was interested in the business at this place, when these goods were purchased, and there was no intimation or suggestion from anyone that there was any agency or that the purchases were for Abraham.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Upon the other hand, it is distinctly found that in making these purchases, the defendant used slips with his own name thereon, which were filled out by him and given to the plaintiff as receipts for his goods. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>It is well known that telephone and city directories are the sources generally relied upon for information as to the locations of different branches of business and the owners thereof. It appears that when the transactions now under question were being carried on in Greenwich, the defendant\u2019s name appeared in both the city and telephone directories of Greenwich as proprietor of this store. The defendant should not be relieved from liability because the plaintiff failed to make an examination of the land records of the town of Greenwich. It is true that one who purchases land without making an examination of the registry of deeds is presumed to be negligent. This case does not concern the matter of titles, and we have seen the defendant was not bound to make any inquiry. If there were any duty resting on the plaintiff in this connection, it is plain that he acted with due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">It appears that the goods were charged to the defendant and not to the father, Abraham. The finding shows that in the plaintiff\u2019s books, which appeared in evidence, the first two pages of the entries of this account for merchandise were charged to \u201cWein, Greenwich.\u201d This clearly was Louis, the defendant, then living in Greenwich, where the store was located, and not his father, Abraham, who lived and was doing business in Port Chester, New, York. The remaining pages of the account -for merchandise were regularly charged to \u201cLouis Wein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The facts found do not show that the only credit upon the plaintiff\u2019s account was for a payment made by Abraham, by his check. As the finding reads, the most that can be claimed relative to this payment is that it was made from cash taken in at the store, or by Abraham\u2019s check. It is fair to infer that if this payment had been made by check, the court below would so have found in no uncertain terms. At least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>date would appear when the check was given, which \u2022 was the best evidence upon this subject. It is obvious that if this payment was made with cash from the store, which was in the control and under the management of the defendant\u2019s son, the matter of payment would be of no value as evidence for the defendant. It is not possible to attach any significance to the alleged payment on account, or to the demand made for the balance unpaid, as it does not appear when these facts occurred. It is almost unnecessary to state-that if this were done after the goods in question had been sold and delivered, after the transaction had been practically closed, and when the defendant\u2019s liability had been established, these facts would not furnish the defendant any relief from his liability. A payment or demand before a liability had been established may be one thing, and like conduct after the goods had been sold and delivered might be quite another.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">From the special facts found, the trial court inferred that the plaintiff extended credit to the owner of the store, and not to Louis. Such an inference cannot be legally drawn from the facts set forth in the finding. In the light of these facts, the only reasonable inference was that credit was given to the defendant, Louis Wein, as the apparent owner of the store where these goods were sold and delivered. A memorandum of decision may \u201cbe resorted to as indicating a conclusion of law controlling the decision.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hendrick, </em>85 Conn. 260, 267, 82 Atl. 586; <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>80 Conn. 426, 433, 434, 68 Atl. 993. In this connection it is of interest to quote from the memorandum of decision, made a part of the record in this case, in which the trial court states that the plaintiff, \u201cevidently, did not inquire as to the ownership of the store, nor did he know, apparently, if you judge from the record evidence, to wit, his first charges in the book, who owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the store, except that it was owned by a Wein and it doesn\u2019t appear that he ever made any inquiries, nor that he was ever told by anybody that the defendant owned that store or claimed to own the store, and, when he brought the action in the present suit, he made no inquiries but simply assumed, on the strength of what he had seen, that the defendant and not his father was the owner of the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">It is apparent that the trial court in its decision acted upon the theory that it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to make inquiries, and that he could not rely upon the strength of what he saw. Such is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Aside from this, if we assume that the trial court properly reached the conclusion that the plaintiff extended credit \u201cto the owner of the store,\u201d this would not absolve the defendant from liability. In other words, it appears from the finding, as it now reads, that the defendant is personally hable from his own showing. It is fair to assume that the finding of the court as to the matter of extension of credit by the plaintiff is as broad and comprehensive as the disclosure upon which the conclusion upon this subject is predicated. When so considered, it appears that the substance of the disclosure made by the defendant was only to the effect that he was acting as agent \u201cfor the owner of the store.\u201d Such a disclosure falls far short of the naming of the principal in the sense that the law requires. It is a universal rule that it is not sufficient that the third person has knowledge of facts and circumstances which would, if reasonably followed by inquiry, disclose the identity of the principal; actual knowledge on his part of the principal\u2019s identity is necessary to exonerate the agent. 2 Corpus Juris, 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The disclosure claimed to have been made by the agent in this case is too indefinite to exonerate him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>from liability. The owner of the store could not sue or be sued without naming him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In the language of an eminent jurist: \u201cIt is impossible to suppose, that the other contracting party is willing to enter into a contract, exonerating the agent, and trusting to an unknown principal, who may be insolvent or incapable of binding himself.\u201d Story on Agency (8th Ed.) \u00a7 267, p. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">It follows from what I have said that I cannot concur in the majority opinion that there is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
