W. Lambert, * * * a peace officer of the town of Saltville, Virginia, in the discharge of his duty by unlawfully assaulting said J. W. Lambert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al7\">The justice found him guilty and fined him ten dollars. From this judgment he appealed to the Circuit Court of Smyth county, in which he was tried before a jury. The jury returned a verdict finding him guilty and fixing his punishment at sixty days in jail and a fine of fifty dollars. The court entered judgment sentencing him accordingly; and to this judgment Galliher makes, in effect, two assignments of error: (1) The court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict on the ground that it is contrary to the law and the evidence, and without evidence to support it. (2) The court erred in admitting evidence as to what occurred at the mayor\u2019s office when Galliher was brought there about two hours after the offense with which he is charged is alleged to have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">The Commonwealth, to sustain its charge, introduced five witnesses, Lambert, Miller, Stephenson, Snodgrass and Gouvas. Only one of them, J. W. Lambert, had any knowledge of what took place at the time the offense is alleged to have been committed. The testimony of the others is relevant only upon the question: Was Galliher drunk at the time Lambert arrested him?</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">The testimony certified up to us has been reduced to narrative form, in doing which it is difficult to reflect the full force and shades of meaning of the testimony of the several witnesses. This fact and the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses testify are to be borne in mind in reviewing the action of the trial court in refusing to set aside the verdict in a case such as this is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">At the time the offense charged is alleged to have been committed Lambert was in the act of arresting Galliher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>without a warrant, on the charge that he was drunk. Lambert\u2019s account of what took place is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">On the Sunday night in question he saw Galliher at Price\u2019s restaurant, and spoke to him. He \u201csaw him walk and he staggered some and talked some;\u201d and he (Lambert) \u201csuspecting that he was intoxicated was watching his conduct.\u201d \u201cAfter some time\u201d Galliher started up the street with Ernest Waddell going towards Galliher\u2019s home. \u201cShortly thereafter\u201d he (Lambert) got in his automobile andi followed the boys. He drove around in front of them, got out and walked back towards the boys, and met them near the public school building (which is about one-fourth of a mile from Price\u2019s restaurant). They had been joined by a third boy (Cornelius Wheeler) and were walking along the sidewalk, three abreast, Galliher being next to the curb. They were \u201cdoing nothing but talking when I drove around them and stopped them.\u201d Then, to use the language of the narrative contained in the record, Lambert \u201csaid: \u2018Galliher, you are drunk,\u2019 and Galliher replied: \u2018Hell, no,\u2019 and witness said: \u2018I\u2019ll have to,\u2019 when Galliher hit, struck witness on his left shoulder with his right <em>hand </em>(italics ours) before witness could complete the sentence he started, which was : \u2018I\u2019ll have to arrest you;\u2019 and witness struck the prisoner across his forehead with his billy and knocked him partly down, and he was getting up again, and then scuffled with and fought him until he got him on the ground, when he handcuffed him and took him to the jail.\u201d He \u201cdid not smell liquor \u25a0on the breath of the defendant,\u201d nor did he \u201csee the prisoner have liquor or take a drink that night;\u201d but he \u201cknows he was drinking from his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Being told by. the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to tell \u201cwhat you did after you took the prisoner to the mayor\u2019s office,\u201d Lambert responded :</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">\u201cI took the'\u2019prisoner to the hospital to have his head treated and dressed. It was bleeding some and he was complaining. I walked him down the street about one-fourth of a mile, and after his head was dressed I took him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>and put him in the jail. After a while * * * his brothers came and wanted to bail him out. I telephoned Mr. Miller, the chief, and he came down and agreed to accept a cash bond. I took the prisoner out of the calaboose, and when he walked out into the mayor\u2019s office, he took the bloody bandage off his head, threw it on the floor, and was cussing about the matter. He was acting like a drunk man, and Mr. Miller ordered me to put him back in the calaboose and let him stay there until he got sober and knew how to talk. I did as directed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">When questioned with reference to the suggestion that he bore a grudge against Galliher because of his suspicion that Galliher had thrown water on him a few nights before, Lambert said: \u201cI was not mad at the prisoner for throwing water on me. I don\u2019t know that he did throw the water, but I suspected him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">John E. Miller, the chief of police of the town, did not see Galliher that night until \u201cshortly before midnight,\u201d when about two hours after he had been arrested, he was brought to the mayor\u2019s office. His testimony as narrated is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">\u201cWhen Mr. Lambert brought the prisoner out of the calaboose and into the mayor\u2019s office, the prisoner jerked the bandage, which was bloody, off his head, and threw it to the floor, and cursed all of them for locking him up and for arresting him; and witness being of opinion that the prisoner was drunk ordered him locked up until he had sobered up. I thought the prisoner was idrunk, but I did not smell any liquor on him, or see any liquor about him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Claude Stephenson was at the mayor\u2019s office when Galliher was brought there. He testified that he \u201csaw the prisoner grab the bandages off his head and curse and act like he was drunk;\u201d and that he \u201cthought he was drunk,\u201d but \u201csaw no liquor and smelled no liquor, and was not close enough to the prisoner to have done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">After Galliher and Waddell left Price\u2019s restaurant, where they had gotten something to eat, they stopped in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>a restaurant run by Charlie Gouvas, a Greek. He testifled that he \u201csaw the prisoner and thought he was drunk and that he thought the other boys were trying to get him out and away before the officers saw him;\u201d that he \u201csaw no liquor and smelled no liquor;\u201d but that \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions and conversation made me think he was drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AT_\">W. F. Snodgrass, a watchman for the Matheison Alkali Works, testified that \u201cabout nine o\u2019clock * * * he came along the street and saw the prisoner and another hoy standing in a doorway;\u201d that \u201cthe prisoner was standing there with his head down, and appeared to the witness to be drunk;\u201d that he said to him \u201che had better be getting on home,\u201d but Galliher made no reply; that he was close enough to Galliher for him to have heard this remark but does not know whether he heard it or not; that he \u201csaw no liquor or liquor drinking, nor did the prisoner move out of his tracks or say anything,\u201d but that he made the remark above mentioned \u201cbecause he thought the prisoner was drunk or drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">The testimony of the accused and the two boys who were with him at the time Lambert proceeded to arrest him, one of whom had been with him for some hours, is that he was not drunk and had not been drinking; that he did not strike or attempt to strike Lambert at any time; that when Lambert accosted them and said: \u201cGalliher, you are drunk,\u201d he replied: \u201cHell, no, I am not drunk,\u201d whereupon Lambert struck him over the head with his billy, knocked him down, beat him for a while, and then handcuffed him and took him to jail; and all that Galliher did was to throw up his hand to try to ward off the blow at the time Lambert struck him the first blow. The statements of Galliher and his other witnesses with reference to what took place at the mayor\u2019s office accord with those given by the witnesses for the Commonwealth. Galliher explains his conduct there, saying that he was not drunk, but \u201cwas mad to know that a man could be beaten up and treated this way anywhere when he was not guilty of any offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>The nurse who attended him when he was taken to the hospital was put on the witness stand by him, and testified that \u201cseveral stitches were taken on his forehead;\u201d that she dressed and bandaged his head, and that \u201cif he was drunk or drinking she could not tell it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">H. K. Price, who waited upon Galliher at his restaurant, and Bradley Price, who saw and talked with him there, both of whom were introduced by the accused, testified positively that he \u201cwas not drunk or drinking.\u201d The two brothers of Galliher, who saw and talked with him in jail and at the mayor\u2019s office, testify positively that he was not drunk and had not been drinking that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Claude Heath, the last witness introduced by the accused, testified that he was in the restaurant when Floyd Galliher came in and during the whole time he was there; that he \u201ctalked to him and he was not drinking or drunk;\u201d that \u201cLambert was out there (i. <em>e. </em>in front of the restaurant) and said he would give five dollars to know who threw water on him from the upstairs;\u201d that nobody said anything about it to him (Lambert); and that \u201cLambert thought Floyd and myself threw the water on him, but we did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Accepting Lambert\u2019s version of what occurred as true, the evidence discloses no sufficient excuse for the severe blow on the head and the subsequent beating which he gave Galliher in effecting his arrest; but Lambert is not here on trial for using unnecessary force and doing Galliher unnecessary bodily harm in effecting his arrest. When an officer attempts to arrest, without a warrant, a person who is committing a misdemeanor in his presence, if, as the Commonwealth contends was the case here, the accused strikes the officer before the officer strikes him or uses any unnecessary force against him, he is guilty of resisting arrest; and the fact that the officer subsequently uses more force than is necessary and does the accused unnecessary bodily harm in effecting his arrest does not exculpate the accused from the offense of resisting the officer. This is true even though the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>may have subsequently used so much more force than was necessary that he committed a crime in so doing which is deserving of a much severer punishment than that committed by the accused in resisting the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">In this connection, however, the following observation made by this court in <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>133 Va. 441, 113 S. E. 893, 900, and reiterated in <em>Crosswhite </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>139 Va. 471, 124 S. E. 242, 40 A. L. R. 54, is pertinent: \u201cOfficers of the law must be accorded the fullest protection in the discharge of their duties, but the liberty <em>(and rights) </em>of the citizen is of equal importance, and nothing can so-militate against the effective administration of justice and a proper regard for the law of the land as unlawful and reckless conduct on the part of officers who are charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Words in italics added by us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\"> With a few statutory exceptions, which need not be noticed here, the common law relating to arrest is the law on that subject in Virginia. At common law \u201ca peace officer may arrest without a warrant for a breach of the peace committed in his presence, but for no other misdemeanor.\u201d Beale\u2019s Cr. PI. &amp; Pr., section 21, and Burks\u2019 note thereto; 84 Am. St. Rep. (note) pp. 685-686; 2 R. C. L. p. 447; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>106 N. C. 796, 11 S. E. 366, 8 L. R. A. 529 <em>et seq; Muscoe </em>v. <em>Com., </em>86 Va. 443, 10 S. E. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">An offense is committed within the presence of an officer, within the meaning of this rule, when he has direct personal knowledge, through his sight, hearing, or other senses that it is then and there being committed. 2 R. C. L. p. 448 ; 84 Am. St. Rep. p. 686; <em>McBride </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. C. A.) 284 Fed. 416, certiorari denied 261 U. S. 614, 43 S. Ct. 359, 67 L.

E. 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">\u201cMere drunkenness, with no other act beyond, is not indictable at the common law. There are old English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>statutes, early enough to be common law with us, making drunkenness punishable or finable, yet they do not seem to have, been recognized in this country.\u201d Bishop, Cr. L. (9th Ed.) section 399. But by section 18 of the Layman act, Acts 1924, p. 593, ch. 407, as amended by Acts 1926, p. 419, ch. 231, Michie\u2019s Code Va. 1930, section 4675(18), it is provided that \u201cany person who, being intoxicated as defined in this act, shall appear in any public place\u201d shall be fined not less than $5 nor more than $50, i. <em>e., </em>shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. And section 81 of the same act, Michie\u2019s Code Va. 1930, section 4675(81), provides that \u201cany person who has drunk enough ardent spirits to so affect his manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior, as to be apparent to observation, shall be deemed, for the purposes of this act, to be intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIZe\">Where there are such statutes, drunkenness is generally held to constitute a breach of the peace within the meaning of the rules relating to arrest. 84 Am. St. Rep. (note), p. 693; <em>Muscoe </em>v. <em>Com., </em>86 Va. 443, 10 S. E. 534. See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>86 Mich. 175, 48 N. W. 870, 24 Am. St. Rep. 116, 13 L. R. A. (note), p. 163 <em>et seq., </em>for what constitutes a breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"AK-\">The real question presented by the first assignment of error is: Was there evidence to support a verdict predicated upon a finding (1) that Floyd Galliher was drunk, within the meaning of the Virginia statute, at the time Lambert proceeded to arrest him, and (2) that Galliher struck, or attempted to strike, Lambert before Lambert struck him over the head with his hilly? We are not able to say that there was no evidence, which, if believed, was sufficient to support a verdict predicated upon these two findings. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the first assignment of error is not well made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">The objection made by the accused to the introduction of the testimony as to what occurred at the mayor\u2019s office was that \u201cit is immaterial as to what he did after the difficulty in question,\u201d and any evidence with refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>ence thereto would \u201ctend to confuse and mislead the jury on matter immaterial to the issue.\u201d As the evidence negatives any idea that Galliher had had anything intoxicating to drink between the time he was arrested and the time he was brought to the mayor\u2019s office, what occurred there was of some, though under the facts of this case perhaps weak, evidential value as to whether he was drunk at the time of his arrest. For this reason the court did not err in- admitting evidence as to what occurred at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">The judgment of the court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">\n<em>Affirmed..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
