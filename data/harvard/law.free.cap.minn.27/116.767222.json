G. Abbott owned and occupied as his homestead an eighty-acre tract of land, situate in the county of Hennepin. On that day, being in \u201cembarrassed and failing circumstances financially,\u201d he caused the land to be conveyed to his co-defendant wife, by- means of a deed from him and her to one McIntosh, and a deed from McIntosh to her. There was no valuable consideration for either of these conveyances, and they were made for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>transferring the property to the wife, so that she could hold it free from the claims of her husband\u2019s creditors. At the time of the conveyances, the defendant N. G. Abbott was indebted to the plaintiffs in something over $600, upon three overdue promissory notes. Having put the notes in judgment in the district court for said county of Hennepin, the plaintiffs bring this action for the purpose of subjecting the land to levy and sale to satisfy the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Under our homestead law, (Gen. St. 1878, <em>c. </em>68, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8,) the land, while owned and held as a homestead by N. G. Abbott, was not \u201csubject to attachment, levy, or sale upon -execution, or any other process issuing out of any court within this state,\u201d and the judgment recovered was not \u201ca lien on such homestead for any purpose whatever.\u201d Under these provisions of the statute, so long as a tract of land is the homestead of a debtor, his creditors (not mortgage creditors) cannot subject it to the payment of any claims which they may hold against him, nor to any lien for the securing of such claims, either for the present or the future. It is in every respect, and absolutely, out of their reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Section 8 of the homestead law authorizes him to sell and convey it without subjecting it by such sale and conveyance to the claims of creditors. This authority to sell and convey Is unlimited. What the purpose or motive of the sale and conveyance are is wholly immaterial. The power to sell and convey is absolute. He may sell and convey a homestead of the value of $10,000 for a consideration of one dollar, and with the purpose and effect of putting the property in the hands of his wife or of any other person. See <em>Drentzer </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>11 Wis. 119. It was thought by the learned judge below that this authority to sell and convey did not authorize a gift \u2014 that is to say, a conveyance without actual valuable consideration. We do not agree to this construction. In our opinion, the words \u201csell and convey\u201d were used to denote any transfer and conveyance, for such consideration, either nom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>inal or actual, as will support a deed. Were it otherwise, it would be unaccountable that the statute has made no provision in reference to adequacy of consideration \u2014 that a homestead owner may sell and convey his homestead for a dollar paid, and cannot sell and convey it for a nominal consideration of a dollar, expressed in the deed, but not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The cases of <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, </em>8 Minn. 272 (309) and <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>22 Minn. <em>384, </em>are not parallel to' this. In both cases the land, the title to which the debtor had caused to be put into the hands.of another person, never was his homestead, because he never had owned it. In the case of <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>12 Minn. 60, the judgment was, under the law then in force, a lien upon the debtor\u2019s homestead\u00bb and this lien was held to become operative and enforceable, when the debtor\u2019s homestead right was terminated by his voluntary termination of his ownership of the land constituting such homestead; that is to say, by his conveyance of it, his wife joining.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">From this, our interpretation of the statute, it follows that the court below erred in holding that the conveyance by which the eighty-acre tract in question was transferred ta defendant Ellen M. Abbott was fraudulent and void as respects the \u2022 plaintiffs, (creditors of defendant N. G. Abbott,) and adjudging the plaintiff\u2019s judgment to be a lien thereupon, and directing the same to be sold to satisfy such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The judgment is accordingly reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
