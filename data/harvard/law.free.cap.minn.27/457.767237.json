The instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tion was based upon the decision of this court in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>City of St. Paul, </em>25 Minn. 331. That case states, approves, and is determined upon the propositions that \u201cin the control and improvement of streets for public use, \u201d a municipal corporation possesses \u201cthe same rights and power as a private owner has over his own land, subject to the same liabilities, \u201d and \u201cthat the corporation will be liable for damages caused to private property by grading streets, when a private owner of the soil over which the streets are laid would be liable if improving it for his own use.\u201d Upon further reflection, and an examination of authorities cited by the defendant, we see no occasion for receding from these propositions. As remarked in the <em>O'Brien Case, </em>we are still of opinion that the principle laid down \u201cis the most sound, as it is most in accordance with justice, and with the protection to private rights against encroachment by the public, which the constitution aims to give. \u201d That a private owner of land has a i right to the lateral support of the adjoining soil, and is enti- I tied to damages for its removal, is an ancient and well-settled <em>4 </em>rule of law.
