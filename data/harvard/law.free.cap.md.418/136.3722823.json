Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court held that, before police interrogate a person in custody, the police must advise the person, inter alia, that any statement he or she makes \u201ccan and will be used against\u201d him or her in court. We decide in this case whether, following the police officer\u2019s issuance of proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the suspect\u2019s knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of the rights afforded by <em>Miranda, </em>the officer subverted the warnings and waiver by later stating that the interrogation is \u201cbetween you and me, bud.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the officer\u2019s statement subverted the warnings and waiver, rendering in violation of <em>Miranda </em>all statements the suspect thereafter made during that interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">The issue we address grew out of an incident on September 8, 2006, in which Eric Fountain was fatally shot in his Dun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>dalk, Maryland home, and Randy Hudson, the father of Mr. Fountain\u2019s granddaughter, was assaulted and, allegedly, robbed. Two days later, an informant contacted the Baltimore County Police Department regarding the incident and provided information from which the police developed three suspects: Petitioner Christian Darrell Lee; his cousin, Darnell Smith; and John Satterfield. The police later arrested and charged Petitioner for crimes connected to the events of the night in question. Petitioner filed a pre-trial motion to suppress certain statements he made during a police interrogation. The following facts were developed at the hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The police arrested Petitioner at 5:30 a.m. on September 9, 2006, and transported him to police headquarters. Detective Craig Schrott of the Homicide Unit began the interrogation of Petitioner at approximately 12:38 p.m. The interview was recorded by a camera hidden in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Detective Schrott began the recorded interview by obtaining from Petitioner certain biographical information. Detective Schrott then said he wanted to interview Petitioner about \u201ca robbery that was down at Dundalk for a guy that was beat up in a back yard, and there was a man that was killed up in his bedroom.\u201d Detective Schrott had Petitioner read aloud the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, including that \u201canything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d Detective Schrott confirmed with Petitioner that he understood each advisement, as. it was read, and that he understood that he was not required to answer the questions and could stop the interview at any time. Petitioner then signed a written waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Detective Schrott asked Petitioner if he knew about the incident in Dundalk. Petitioner acknowledged that he knew, because he was present at the scene at the time of the incident. Petitioner explained that, on the night in question, \u201cJohn\u201d and Petitioner\u2019s cousin, \u201cDarnell,\u201d accompanied by two girls, picked him up from his home. Together they traveled by car to Dundalk, ending up in a park to \u201chave a few drinks.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>John went into a nearby alley to move the car and there got into a fight with a man. Petitioner and Darnell walked over to the scene of the fight but, according to Petitioner, he left the group because John could \u201chandle himself.\u201d Eventually, John, Darnell, and the man who had been in the fight with John went into a house. The house to which Petitioner referred was the Fountain residence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Petitioner acknowledged following the men into the Fountain residence. Petitioner stated at that point in the interrogation that he left the house because he was scared and waited outside for the others, and he did not know what had occurred in the house. Detective Schrott told Petitioner that he had spoken with the others involved, and he knew that Petitioner had been in the house with Darnell. Petitioner then acknowledged that he had gone into the house and up to the second floor with Darnell, where he saw a \u201cguy that was shot.\u201d Petitioner added, though, that he was not present when the shooting took place, he did not hear a shot, and he did not know who shot the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Detective Schrott continued to press Petitioner for an explanation of the shooting which, about an hour into the interrogation, led to the following exchange between the two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">Q. The man, where was he at? Was he still in, was he still in bed; was he standing up? I mean, it\u2019s important to tell me what his demeanor is? Tell me what he\u2019s, he\u2019s saying, or what he\u2019s doing, all right, so I can get a better picture of what\u2019s going on, what you\u2019re going through. When the two of you go upstairs, all right, and, is he, is he in the bedroom? Is he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">A. (Witness nodding head yes.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">Q. \u2014 is he standing up, or was he still in bed? Was he sleeping? Was he awake? Chris, bud \u2014 all right. Was he still in bed or did he get up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">A. I\u2019m going to jail, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Q. We\u2019re not talking about jail right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">A. Just \u2014 that\u2019s what the whole thing is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">Q. That ain\u2019t what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about getting to what the truth is, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">Now, was he still in bed, or did he get out of bed while your cousin was up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">A. He was still in bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">Q. And once you two got upstairs what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">A. We was told money was under the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">Q. Was under the bed. Now who told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">A. Chuck told me \u2014 John.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">Q. Who told that (sic) you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">A. John. Guess he got out of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">Q. John told you that. So \u2014 all right, sir \u2014 so when you got there, you went into that room, was that man awake; was he asleep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">A. He was asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-17\">Q. He was asleep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-18\">A. Yeah, this is being recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-19\">Q. This is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-20\">A. I\u2019m trying to put together fact and accept that my life is basically over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">Not long after that exchange, Petitioner admitted for the first time during the interrogation that he shot Eric Fountain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az-\">Q. Are you guys \u2014 do you wake him up, or does your cousin wake him up looking for the money, or do you try to find the money without waking him up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-23\">A. First we look under the bed. He, he woke up when my cousin left, then he tried to rush me. He got too close. I tried to run. I didn\u2019t see, I didn\u2019t see why. I tried to get him away from me so I could leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-24\">Q. So you were trying to get away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>A. I, I thought, I thought a gunshot would scare him. I ain\u2019t know I hit him. I wasn\u2019t even looking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">Q. Slow\u2019d you shoot when you were running? I mean, did you shoot like over your shoulder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">A. No. Like, like this (Indicating). \u2019Cause I was close, near the door, and he, he just kept coming. I shot two immediate times. It\u2019s not like I shot, went away, shot here. I shot two immediate times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Petitioner followed those admissions with a more complete description of what occurred before and during the shooting. He described further details about the fight in the alley; he stated for the first time that he was involved in assaulting Randy Hudson, whom he now identified as \u201cScooby\u201d; and he provided additional details about what occurred in the house. Petitioner stated, among other things, that he learned while upstairs that there was to be a robbery of $100,000, which was supposed to be under the mattress in the bedroom. Petitioner said that Darnell yelled, woke up the victim, and stated there was money under the bed, which the victim denied. Petitioner stated that Darnell then \u201c[g]ave me the gun and I was supposed to watch him. He, he try [to] wrestle him, and I tried [to] run. Shot twice.\u201d Petitioner, Darnell, and John ran from the house, got in a car, and left the scene. The interrogation concluded at approximately 2:10 p.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The video recording of the interrogation was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing and played for the court. Defense counsel raised a number of arguments in support of suppression of all or part of Petitioner\u2019s statements during the interrogation. Pertinent here, the defense argued that Detective Schrott\u2019s advising Petitioner during the interrogation, \u201cThis is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?\u201d, vitiated Petitioner\u2019s prior waiver of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights by effectively undermining the warning that anything he said during the interrogation would be used against him in court. Counsel argued that the <em>Miranda </em>violation compelled suppression of everything Petitioner thereafter said to Detective Schrott. Counsel also argued that Petitioner\u2019s statements following Detective Schrott\u2019s comment were involuntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The court denied the motion on all grounds. With respect to whether Petitioner\u2019s prior waiver was vitiated by Detective Schrott\u2019s statement that the conversation was \u201cbetween you and me, bud,\u201d the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">And, finally, I think it\u2019s a close case. I think that the State has made a good argument that [Petitioner\u2019s] demean- or does not change from the beginning of the interview throughout the end of it, as he does get more emotional at times. But his way of responding to the questions doesn\u2019t change in any material respect, and he appears to know that he is being recorded. The statement he makes is, this is being recorded, ain\u2019t it? The Detective does not directly answer that question by saying yes or no, but he certainly leaves the Defendant to believe that the conversation is just between the two of them, which was not true. But I do not think that the, it changed the Defendant\u2019s willingness to answer the questions in any way. Or violated his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Petitioner was tried before a jury on charges of first degree murder of Eric Fountain, robbery and assault of Randy Hudson, robbery and assault of Anna Hudson (Eric Fountain\u2019s wife, who was present in the house on the night in question), first degree burglary, and related handgun offenses. The State made use of Petitioner\u2019s statement during its case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">During its deliberations, the jury submitted to the court a written note which read, \u201c1. In the case of felony murder anyone present is as guilty as the person who personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>commits the murder. 2. In the case of felony robbery does the same hold true?\u201d The court responded to the note by writing: \u201cThe answer to this question is contained in the Jury Instructions provided to you.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s response: \u201cI thought that as to this, the Court should indicate that the first sentence [of the jury\u2019s note] is inaccurate ----I am objecting to that not being included within the instructions.\u201d The jury found Petitioner guilty of felony murder of Eric Fountain, first degree burglary, first degree assault of Randy Hudson and Anna Fountain, and related handgun offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Lee argued, among other claims of error, that the court erred in denying the motion to suppress his statements to Detective Schrott following the comment, \u201cThis is between you and me, bud,\u201d and in its response to the jury note. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of conviction. <em>Lee v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 631, 975 A.2d 240 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The Court of Special Appeals held that, considered in context, Schrott\u2019s statement, \u201cThis is between you and me,\u201d was not a promise of confidentiality that undermined the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiver, and it did not render Petitioner\u2019s subsequent statements involuntary, under either the federal or state constitutions or Maryland common law. <em>Id. </em>at 657-58, 975 A.2d at 255. The court further held that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question, referring the jury to the instructions previously given, was sufficient because the initial instructions \u201cmade clear\u201d the answer. <em>Id. </em>at 665-66, 975 A.2d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Lee v. State, </em>411 Md. 355, 983 A.2d 431 (2009), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">1. Whether the interrogating officer made a promise of confidentiality, violated the protections of <em>Miranda v. Arizona} </em>} and induced an involuntary statement when, an hour into an interrogation in which Petitioner continually denied involvement in the shooting, the officer stated: \u201cThis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>between you and me, bud. Only you and me here, all right? All right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">2. Whether where the deliberating jury asked, \u201cIn the case of felony murder anyone present is as guilty as the person who personally commits the murder. In the case of felony robbery, does the same hold true,\u201d the trial court erred in merely responding, \u201c[t]he answer to this question is contained in the jury instructions provided to you\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with Petitioner that everything he said following Detective Schrott\u2019s comment, \u201cThis is between you and me, bud,\u201d undermined the prior <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and therefore everything Petitioner said during the remainder of the interrogation was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>We do not agree, though, that the detective\u2019s statements rendered Petitioner\u2019s subsequent confession involuntary under either federal and state constitutional principles or Maryland common law. Because Petitioner is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the State made substantive use at trial of the statements that were the product of the <em>Miranda </em>violation, we have no need to, and thus do not, decide the second question he presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In undertaking our review of the suppression court\u2019s ruling, we confine ourselves to what occurred at the suppression hearing. <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129, 1135 (2007). \u201c\u2018[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion,\u2019 \u201d here, the State. <em>Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 403, 924 A.2d 1072, 1080 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 444 (2003)), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1144, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008). \u201cWe defer to the motions court\u2019s factual findings and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 375 n. 3, 993 A.2d 25, 33 n. 3 (2010). \u201cWe, however, make our own independent constitutional appraisal, by reviewing the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>993 A.2d at 33 n. 3 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The <em>Miranda </em>decision is grounded in that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution that provides: \u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the Court\u2019s stated aims in establishing the <em>Miranda </em>rule is to \u201cassure that the individual\u2019s right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The <em>Miranda </em>Court put into place \u201c \u2018certain procedural safeguards that require police to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Florida v. Powell, </em>559 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 1195, 1203, 175 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2010) (quoting <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 201, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989)). Specifically, police must warn a suspect that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\"><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479,86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The <em>Miranda </em>Court explained the importance of the warning concerning the use of the individual\u2019s statements in court. That warning is needed in order to make the individual</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\">aware not only of the privilege [against compelled self-incrimination], but also of the consequences of foregoing it. It is only through an awareness of these consequences that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege. Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system \u2014 that is he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4L\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The rights expressed in the <em>Miranda </em>warning pertain throughout the interrogation. <em>See Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2263-64, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (\u201cIf the right to counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any point during questioning, further interrogation must cease.\u201d); <em>see also Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease____If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Inquiry into the adequacy of the waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201chas two distinct dimensions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if \u201cthe totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\"><em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The <em>Miranda </em>Court recognized that a waiver of the rights afforded by the warnings can be undermined by words or actions on the part of the police. If the evidence shows \u201cthat the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver,\u201d then that \u201cwill, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>S.Ct. 1602. <em>See Colorado v. Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 576 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 851, 93 L.Ed.2d 954 (1987) (noting that the Court \u201chas found affirmative misrepresentations by the police sufficient to invalidate a suspect\u2019s waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>accord United States v. Anderson, </em>929 F.2d 96, 100-01 (2d Cir.1991) (affirmative misrepresentations by the police may be sufficiently coercive to invalidate a suspect\u2019s waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege); 2 Wayne R. Lafave, Jerold H. Israel <em>&amp; </em>Nancy J. King, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(c) (stating that, in contrast to traditional voluntariness, \u201cthere is an absolute prohibition upon any trickery that misleads the suspect as to the existence or dimensions of any of the applicable <em>[Miranda </em>] rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Supreme Court has clarified, moreover, that the motive underlying the interrogator\u2019s conduct, whether intentional or inadvertent, is in itself irrelevant when evaluating \u201cthe intelligence and voluntariness of [the suspect\u2019s] election to abandon his rights\u201d under <em>Miranda. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. at 423, 106 S.Ct. 1135. Rather, \u201csuch conduct\u201d by the police \u201cis only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 106 S.Ct. 1135. Similarly, when examining an officer\u2019s statements to a suspect regarding his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights, courts look only at the words the officer used and \u201cwill not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given,\u201d because such an inquiry \u201ccan never be more than speculation____\u201d <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469-70, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Since <em>Miranda </em>was decided, courts have applied the principles of that case and its progeny to hold that, after proper warnings and a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver, the interrogator may not say or do something during the ensuing interrogation that subverts those warnings and thereby vitiates the suspect\u2019s earlier waiver by rendering it unknowing, involuntary, or both. Such action on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the police violates <em>Miranda </em>and, as a consequence, requires suppression of any statements the suspect makes thereafter during the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">One such case is <em>Hopkins v. Cockrell, </em>325 F.3d 579 (5th Cir.2003). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that a police officer made an improper assurance of confidentiality when, after proper warnings and waiver, he told Hopkins: \u201cThis is for me and you. This is for me. Okay. This ain\u2019t for nobody else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. The court cited <em>Miranda </em>for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[a]ny evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. 1602). The Court then had this to say about the interrogating officer\u2019s assurance of confidentiality: \u201cAn officer cannot read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then turn around and tell him that despite those warnings, what the defendant tells the officer will be confidential and still use the resultant confession against the defendant. Yet Knott [the interrogating officer] and the prosecution did exactly that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585. The <em>Hopkins </em>court concluded that the officer\u2019s statement violated <em>Miranda, </em>which, together with other circumstances surrounding the interrogation, also rendered Hopkins\u2019s confession involuntary under the dictates of <em>Spano v. New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hopkins, </em>325 F.3d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The Supreme Court of Georgia applied the <em>Hopkins </em>court\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>analysis to its decision in <em>Spence v. State, </em>281 Ga. 697, 642 S.E.2d 856 (2007). In that case, Spence, arrested for rape, was interrogated about a murder unrelated to the arrest. The <em>Spence </em>court described what happened: \u201cDuring the interrogation, Spence was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>signed. In the first hour of interrogation, Spence said nothing to implicate himself. Spence then broke down in tears and asked if he could talk to his girlfriend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698, 642 S.E.2d at 857. There was then an exchange between Spence and the interrogating officer, during which the officer told Spence \u201cJust you and me, just you and me.\u201d Spence said: \u201cI\u2019m just scared when I go to jail, everybody gonna know that I said something.\u201d To that the officer responded, \u201cLem, ain\u2019t nobody saying nothing, this is confidential.\u201d <em>Id., </em>642 S.E.2d at 857. Shortly thereafter, the officer repeated that \u201cnobody knows what you\u2019re there for,\u201d because \u201c[tjhis is confidential what we\u2019re doing right here. Do you understand that? This is confidential____\u201d <em>Id., </em>642 S.E.2d at 857. The officer then implored Spence to tell him \u201cwhat happened.\u201d After that, Spence \u201cgave a statement incriminating himself in the murder.\u201d <em>Id., </em>642 S.E.2d at 857. The <em>Spence </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">[I]t would have been reasonable for Spence to understand Quinn\u2019s [the officer\u2019s] statement that their interview was confidential as an unqualified statement that what Spence told Quinn would be kept confidential between the two of them, and would not be disclosed to anyone else. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that Spence\u2019s statement to Quinn was admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 700, 642 S.E.2d at 858. The court did not state the legal ground for its holding. The court stated, though, that its decision was controlled by <em>Hopkins, </em>referring specifically to the <em>Hopkins </em>court\u2019s declaration that \u201c \u2018An officer cannot read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then turn around and tell him that despite those warnings, what the defendant tells the officer will be confidential and still use the resultant confession against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699, 642 S.E.2d at 858 (quoting <em>Hopkins, </em>825 F.3d at 585).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The <em>Spence </em>court also found controlling its earlier decision, <em>Foster v. State, </em>which involved an officer repeatedly telling the defendant that the recording of his previous, unrecorded confession \u201cwas not going to hurt \u2018a thing\u2019 and that it would be \u2018as much for your benefit as ours.\u2019 \u201d 258 Ga. 736, 742, 374 S.E.2d 188,194 (1988). The Georgia Supreme Court repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>what it had held in <em>Foster: </em>\u201c \u2018An accused must be warned that anything he says can and will be used against him in court. Telling him that a confession is not going to hurt and, on the contrary, will benefit him as much as the police, is not consistent with the warnings required by <em>Miranda. </em>\u2019 \u201d 281 Ga. at 699, 642 S.E.2d at 858 (quoting <em>Foster, </em>258 Ga. at 742, 374 S.E.2d at 194). Although the <em>Spence </em>court did not say so expressly, the rationale for its holding is plain: Spence\u2019s incriminating statement to the police was inadmissible at his trial because, notwithstanding earlier warnings and waiver, his subsequent confession violated <em>Miranda </em>in that the officer\u2019s statement of confidentiality subverted the earlier warnings and waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Similar to the above cases is <em>State v. Pillar, </em>359 N.J.Super. 249, 820 A.2d 1 (N.J.Super.App.Div.2003). In <em>Pillar, </em>the defendant, after receiving proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and making a knowing and voluntary <em>Miranda </em>waiver, was asked by the police if he wished to speak. He responded that he was \u201cguilty of some of the things on [a statement of charges that he had been given to read] ... but not all of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 820 A.2d at 11. The defendant said that he wanted to speak to a lawyer first, and he asked what would happen next. He was told about the arraignment process, setting of bail, and appointment of counsel if necessary. The defendant then asked to say \u201csomething off-the-record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 820 A.2d at 11. The police agreed, and the defendant then made an incriminating statement. The New Jersey court held that the police officers violated <em>Miranda </em>by agreeing to receive the defendant\u2019s off-the-record statement. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d at 21-22. The court explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">A police officer cannot directly contradict, out of one side of his mouth, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings just given out of the other. An acquiescence to hear an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement from a suspect, which the officer ought to know cannot be \u201coff-the-record,\u201d totally undermines and eviscerates the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, at least with respect to a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>made, as here, in immediate and direct response to the misleading assurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 268, 820 A.2d at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The California Supreme Court held to like effect in <em>People v. Braeseke, 25 </em>Cal.3d 691, 159 Cal.Rptr. 684, 602 P.2d 384 (1979). The <em>Braeseke </em>court held that the police violated <em>Miranda </em>when, following <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiver, they obtained a statement that the defendant requested be made to one officer only and \u201coff-the-record\u201d; the police agreed to that procedure without explaining that there was no such thing, in the interrogation context, as \u201coff-the-record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 159 CaLRptr. 684, 602 P.2d at 390. The court held that a request to speak off-the-record cannot constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, specifically with respect to the advice that anything a suspect says can be used against the suspect in a court of law. <em>Braeseke, 25 </em>Cal.3d at 702, 159 CaLRptr. 684, 602 P.2d at 391. In so holding, the court observed: \u201cIndeed, defendant\u2019s request revealed a marked lack of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. [The police] then contributed to defendant\u2019s lack of understanding by agreeing to the request rather than informing defendant that there could be no such thing as an off the record discussion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 159 CaLRptr. 684, 602 P.2d at 391. <em>See also State v. Stanga, </em>617 N.W.2d 486, 491 (S.D.2000) (holding that multiple statements made by an interrogating officer to the defendant that \u201cI\u2019m here for you and I to talk\u201d \u201cnullified\u201d earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The rationale underlying the decisions in the cases we have discussed applies with equal force to the present case. As in all of those cases, Petitioner was properly advised of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, which included the advisement that \u201canything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d As in those cases, Petitioner, at the time of those advisements, voluntarily and knowingly waived <em>Miranda </em>and agreed to talk. And, much as in those cases, Petitioner was later told something by the officer that subverted the advisement that anything he said during the interrogation could and would be used against him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Detective Schrott\u2019s words, \u201cThis is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?,\u201d on their face imply confidentiality and thereby directly contradict the advisement that \u201canything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d Moreover, even if we were to assume that Detective Schrott did not intend his words to imply a promise of confidentiality (an assumption about which we have serious doubt), our focus is not on what the detective intended, but rather on what a layperson in Petitioner\u2019s position would have understood those words to mean. <em>See Burbine, </em>475 U.S. at 423-24, 106 S.Ct. 1135. No reasonable lay person would have understood those words to mean anything other than that the conversation, at that moment and thereafter, even if not before, was \u201cbetween\u201d only Detective Schrott and Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The State argues that Detective Schrott\u2019s assertion amounted to something less than an assurance of confidentiality because it was offered in response to Petitioner\u2019s uttering, \u201cthis is being recorded.\u201d The State, however, ignores the conspicuous implication of the phrase Schrott used. Intentionally or not, the detective\u2019s utterance, \u201cthis is between you and me, bud,\u201d communicated more than a mere \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>reply to a query about the presence of a recording device. Indeed, in line with our interpretation here, the Circuit Court found that Schrott\u2019s statement \u201cleaves the Defendant to believe that the conversation is just between the two of them----\u201d It is of no consequence that Detective Schrott committed the <em>Miranda </em>violation only once, rather than multiple times as in some of the cases we have discussed. The violation, once committed, was enough to undermine the warning that anything Petitioner said to the detective could and would be used against him in court. In this regard we grant the officer no greater leave than we would had he made the error while advising Petitioner in the first instance. <em>See Luckett, </em>413 Md. at 384, 993 A.2d at 38-39 (holding that the officer\u2019s warnings, which included both correct and incorrect statements concerning the scope of the <em>Miranda </em>protections, fell far short of properly advising the defendant of his rights under <em>Miranda).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We hold that Detective Schrott\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation mid-way through the interrogation that Petitioner\u2019s statements were \u201cjust between you and me, bud. Only you and me are in here,\u201d rendered Petitioner\u2019s prior <em>Miranda </em>waiver ineffective for all purposes, going forward. We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals that the detective\u2019s words did not misrepresent the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The detective\u2019s words were nothing less than a promise of confidentiality, even though not couched in precisely those terms. The <em>Miranda </em>violation, moreover, lay in the officer\u2019s words themselves. We therefore do not undertake to examine further whether Petitioner subjectively relied on them to his detriment. To hold otherwise would violate the very foundation upon which <em>Miranda </em>is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>TV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Because the State made substantive use of the statements of Petitioner that were taken in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>he is entitled to a new trial. <em>See Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (statements taken in violation of <em>Miranda </em>may not be used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>prosecution in its case in chief, but may be admitted for impeachment purposes); <em>accord Oregon v. Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 721-22, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975). We nonetheless must also address Petitioner\u2019s arguments that those same statements were involuntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as well as Maryland common law. We must do so because, if we were to find the statements involuntary on any of those grounds, then the State is precluded from using Petitioner\u2019s statements for any purpose, including impeachment. <em>See Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 397-98, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978) (any criminal trial use of a defendant\u2019s statement which was involuntary under the federal constitution is prohibited); <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 599-600, 655 A.2d 370, 379 (1995) (a statement is inadmissible in the State\u2019s case in chief and for impeachment purposes if it is involuntary under Maryland common law). It is to that task that we turn next.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Petitioner devotes very little space in his brief to the constitutional voluntariness arguments, and only a bit more to his argument concerning common law voluntariness. We, too, need not devote much attention to either of these contentions, as neither entitles Petitioner to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We begin with the well-recognized proposition that only voluntary confessions are admissible as evidence against a criminal defendant. <em>Knight v. State, </em>381 Md. 517, 531, 850 A.2d 1179, 1187 (2004). To be voluntary, a confession must satisfy federal and state constitutional strictures as well as the Maryland common law rule that a confession is involuntary if it is the product of an improper threat, promise, or inducement by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 850 A.2d at 1187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We begin our analysis with the test for voluntariness under federal and state constitutional law. We have held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>due process protections inherent in Article 22 are construed <em>in pari materia </em>with those afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 535 n. 3, 560 A.2d 1108 n. 3 (1989), so what we say about the latter controls, for both the federal and state constitutional arguments Petitioner makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Supreme Court has established a test for voluntariness that prohibits confessions that are the result of police conduct that overbears the will of the suspect and induces the suspect to confess. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 288, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). (declaring that a credible threat of physical violence can render a subsequent confession involuntary); <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986) (holding that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d); <em>see also Spano, </em>360 U.S. at 323, 79 S.Ct. 1202 (concluding \u201cthat petitioner\u2019s will was overborne by official pressure, fatigue and sympathy falsely aroused, after considering all the facts in their post-indictment setting\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Not every deceptive practice by the police meets this standard. <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 178-79, 699 A.2d 1170, 1180 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998). Lying to the suspect about the strength of the evidence against the defendant and showing false sympathy for the suspect, for example, do not rise to the level of the type of police coercion that is viewed as overbearing the will of the suspect. Indeed it is the rare and extreme case in which a court will find that a suspect confessed involuntarily. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rutledge, </em>900 F.2d 1127, 1129 (7th Cir.1990) (commenting that \u201cvery few incriminating statements, custodial or otherwise, are held to be involuntary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We emphasized the point in <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 981, 122 L.Ed.2d 134 (1993). In <em>Reynolds </em>we noted, 327 Md. at 505, 610 A.2d at 787, that the Supreme Court in <em>Fulminante </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cmade it clear that constitutional voluntariness does not require that all promises, threats, or inducements render a confession involuntary; instead, the federal constitution requires only that courts consider promises, threats, or inducements as part of the totality of the circumstances that courts must look at to determine voluntariness.\u201d <em>See Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 285-86, 111 S.Ct. 1246 (stating that the <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 U.S. 532, 18 S.Ct. 183, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897) standard of condemning any confession obtained by \u201cany direct or implied promises, however slight, [or] by the exertion of any improper influence,\u201d has been replaced by a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Petitioner grounds his constitutional voluntariness argument solely on Detective Schrott\u2019s assurance of confidentiality, which, Petitioner asserts, \u201cmisled [him] as to his constitutionally protected right against self-incrimination.\u201d Petitioner points to the fact that, before the detective\u2019s improper statement, Petitioner denied involvement in the crimes, and only after the detective\u2019s statement did he make a full confession. We are not persuaded by Petitioner\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">To be sure, the State has the burden to prove voluntariness. <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>381 Md. 539, 558, 850 A.2d 1192, 1202 (2004). We cannot help but note, nonetheless, that Petitioner did not testify at the suppression hearing. Therefore, we do not have even his word that Detective\u2019s Schrott improper comment overbore his will and produced his confession. Nor does the fact that Petitioner\u2019s confession followed the detective\u2019s comment, by itself, establish that Petitioner\u2019s will was overborne. As we have said, a mere promise, whether it be of leniency or, as here, confidentiality, without more, will not render a confession involuntary, for federal (or state) constitutional purposes. We therefore hold that Petitioner\u2019s confession, made after the improper promise of confidentiality, did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, for the same reason, did not violate Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We likewise reject Petitioner\u2019s common law voluntariness argument. Under Maryland common law, a confession is involuntary if it is the product of certain improper threats, promises, or inducements by the police. <em>See Knight, </em>381 Md. at 532, 850 A.2d at 1187-88. The test for common law voluntariness was set forth in <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979). Under that test, an inculpatory statement is involuntary under Maryland common law if (1) any officer or agent of the police promises or implies to the suspect that he will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession, and (2) the suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s explicit or implicit inducement. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. \u201cBoth prongs [of the <em>Hillard </em>test] must be satisfied before a confession is deemed to be involuntary.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 310, 765 A.2d 97, 116 (2001). The sort of promise or inducement to which the <em>Hillard </em>test applies, however, has been limited to leniency before, during, or after trial. <em>See Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 75-77, 12 A.3d 1193, 1201 (2011) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">As with constitutional voluntariness, the State has the burden to prove that Petitioner\u2019s confession, following Detective Schrott\u2019s improper remark, was voluntary under this common law standard. <em>See Knight, </em>381 Md. at 532, 850 A.2d at 1190. We are convinced that it was. The promise here was of confidentiality, not leniency, as in those cases in which we heretofore have found a common law violation. <em>See, e.g., Hill, </em>418 Md. at 80-81, 82, 12 A.3d at 1204, 1205 (holding that a statement to a suspect by an interrogating officer that the victim and the victim\u2019s family \u201cdid not want to see [the suspect] get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology\u201d for what happened, is an improper inducement); <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 536, 850 A.2d at 1188 (concluding that the interrogator\u2019s alleged \u201cpromise\u201d to the defendant that he would inform the prosecutor of how the interrogation went, including whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>he cooperated, was not an improper inducement to confess; also concluding that an interrogator\u2019s statement that the defendant\u2019s cooperation would be \u201chelpful\u201d was not an improper inducement, but that the statement, \u201cIf down the line, after this case comes to an end, we\u2019ll see what the State\u2019s Attorney-can do for you, with your case, with your charges,\u201d was \u201cclearly a promise to exercise advocacy on the defendant\u2019s behalf\u2019); <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 289, 765 A.2d at 104 (\u201cI can make you a promise, Okay? I can help you. I could try to protect you\u201d held to be an improper inducement); <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420 (\u201c[I]f you are telling me the truth ... I will go to bat for you\u201d held to be an improper inducement); <em>Streams v. State, </em>238 Md. 278, 281, 208 A.2d 614, 615 (1965) (\u201c[I]t would be better for [you] if [you] made a statement because if [you] did they would try to get [you] put on probation\u201d held to be an improper inducement).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Petitioner does not cite any Maryland cases holding that a promise of confidentiality, like the one Detective Schrott made during the interrogation, renders a subsequent confession involuntary under Maryland common law. Petitioner simply asks us to hold as much. Given that he offers little to persuade us that, on the facts of this case, we should do so, we decline at this time to expand the rule of common law voluntariness to cover situations like the one presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We hold that the statement by Detective Schrott that \u201cthis is just between you and me, bud\u201d was effectively a promise of confidentiality that directly contradicted the early <em>Miranda </em>advisement that \u201canything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d thereby vitiating Petitioner\u2019s prior waiver, and rendering in violation of <em>Miranda </em>everything that Petitioner said to the detective during the remainder of the interrogation. The detective\u2019s statement, however, did not render Petitioner\u2019s statements involuntary under either federal or state constitutional law, or Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND REMAND FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-5\">BELL, C.J., and MURPHY, J., Concur and Dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\">.

The prosecutor informed the suppression court that the State would not be seeking to admit any part of that second interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">. The Fifth Amendment applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy v.

The <em>Hopkins </em>court ultimately held that the constitutional error in allowing use at trial of Hopkins\u2019s involuntary statements was harmless \u201d[i]n light of the overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence present in this case[.]\u201d 325 F.3d at 585.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. The Court of Special Appeals points out that some courts see a distinction between misrepresentations by the police, concerning the scope of <em>Miranda's </em>protections, that occur before a <em>Miranda </em>waiver and those that occur later in the interrogation. <em>Lee v. State, </em>186 Md.App. at 650-51, 975 A.2d at 251 (citing <em>United States v. Bezanson-Perkins, </em>390 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2004) (questioning whether police misstatements after a voluntary waiver could invalidate the waiver); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>999 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir.1993) (detective\u2019s statement that the defendant's cooperation would \"help\" him did not invalidate Chadwick\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; it could not have had any impact on Chadwick\u2019s decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, since the waiver had occurred earlier)). We agree with our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals that the timing of the police deception is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>dispositive and we explain, <em>infra, </em>why, to the extent those courts hold that a suspect is not entitled to suppression of statements he or she makes following a mid-interrogation, affirmative misrepresentation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, those courts, in our view, are incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b197-6\">MURPHY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Abd\">concurring and dissenting, in which BELL, C.J. joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">I agree that the Petitioner is entitled to a new trial.
