Our interpretation is guided by the legislative intent to enhance public safety with prompt removal of drunk drivers from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Upon being detained on suspicion of drunk driving, Petitioner Matthew C. Thomas was asked to submit to a preliminary breath test pursuant to TA Section 16-205.2. He was then advised of his rights with regard to a alcohol concentration test (\u201cchemical breath test\u201d) by oral recitation of a standard Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) form. Thomas refused to take any breath test and was arrested. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) later suspended Thomas\u2019s driver\u2019s license for his refusal of the chemical breath test, and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">On appeal, Thomas argues that he had been improperly advised of his rights because the officer had never offered Thomas the chemical breath test and had not arrested or formally charged Thomas prior to his refusal. Thomas claims that this procedure was unduly misleading, and thus his license should not have been suspended. We granted Thomas\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>A. As a matter of first impression, does <em>Maryland Annotated Code, </em>Transportation \u00a7 16-205.1(b) require an officer to arrest, take into custody, and/or charge a person with a violation of the traffic law before effectively satisfying the officer\u2019s duty to fully advise a person of the administrative sanctions for refusal of a \u00a7 16-205.1 chemical breath test as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">B. Whether the Petitioner was not \u201cfully advised\u201d of the administrative sanctions for refusing a chemical breath test and was mislead where Petitioner was requested to submit to a preliminary breath test by an officer at the scene of a traffic stop, Petitioner initially agreed to the preliminary breath test and the officer immediately began reading the DR-15 advice of rights form at the scene of the traffic stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">C. Whether the denial of a MVA subpoena request for a police officer by an Administrative Law Judge[,] where the documentary evidence constituting the testimony of the absent officer is conflicting on its face[,] requires resolution of the conflicting testimony in favor of Petitioner and dismissal of the MVA\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We shall hold that Thomas was properly advised of his rights, and thus affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">On a late evening in March, Private Nemser and another police officer of the Hyatsville Police Department responded to a complaint that a person driving a silver Mustang was speeding and blaring loud music. After arriving at the location, Nemser observed a silver Mustang and pulled behind it. Thomas, the driver of that vehicle, then accelerated quickly, spinning the car\u2019s tires. Nemser initiated a traffic stop and his fellow officer approached the vehicle and ordered Thomas out. Thomas struggled to exit his vehicle, and Nemser noticed that he had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. The other officer observed a nearly empty pint bottle of Jack Daniels Whiskey sitting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Thomas\u2019s cup holder. Thomas was unable to maintain his balance well enough to perform any Field Sobriety Tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Nemser asked Thomas to take a preliminary breath test, and Thomas agreed. Nemser then began to advise Thomas of his rights by reading to him from the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form. This form sets forth a driver\u2019s rights with regard to the chemical breath test, a test that is wholly separate from the preliminary breath test. Compare TA \u00a7 16-205.1 (chemical breath test)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with TA \u00a7 16-205.2 (preliminary breath test).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The very first paragraph of the DR-15 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">You have been stopped or detained and reasonable grounds exist to believe that you have been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle under circumstances requiring that you be asked to submit to a test under \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Maryland Vehicle Law. In this situation, the law deems that you have consented to take a test to measure the alcohol concentration or drug or controlled dangerous substance content in your system. You may refuse to submit to the test(s), unless you were in a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of or life-threatening injury to another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzY\">The remainder of the DR-15 form sets forth the consequences for refusing to submit to the Section 16-205.1 chemical test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>A refusal results in suspension of the driver\u2019s license. <em>See </em>TA \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(3). The preliminary breath test, on the other hand, has no adverse consequences for refusal. <em>See </em>TA \u00a7 16-205.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">As Nemser was reading from the DR-15, Thomas informed the officer that he would not sign any paperwork or take a breath test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nemser signed the DR-15, certifying that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>advised Thomas of his rights pursuant to the form, and in the place for the driver\u2019s signature, Nemser wrote \u201cREFUSED.\u201d Nemser also checked the box indicating that the driver refused the chemical breath test. He then took Thomas into custody and placed him in the front seat of his marked police car. Before they departed for the police station, however, Thomas urinated in the front seat and Nemser immediately removed him. Nemser then issued four traffic citations to Thomas, and, to prevent further damage to the vehicle, released Thomas to walk to his home, which was approximately 100 yards away.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Three months after that night, Thomas appeared for his administrative hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing, the ALJ accepted into evidence Nemser\u2019s DR-15A Order of Suspension, DR-15 Advice of Rights Form, Officer\u2019s Alcohol Influence Report, and Thomas\u2019s driving record. Although Nemser was not present at the hearing to testify, he had summarized the night\u2019s events in his Alcohol Influence Report, part of which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">THOMAS continually asked why he was stopped. When he was told that he was driving his vehicle, he stated \u201cMy car is parked in front of my house.\u201d He was unaware that he was sitting ten feet away from his vehicle. THOMAS was staggering around until we had him sit on the curb. I asked him if he would like to take a preliminary breath test and he said yes. While reading the DR-15 to THOMAS, he informed me that he would not sign any paperwork or take a breath test. I took THOMAS into custody and placed him in the front seat of my marked [car] and prepared to transport him to the [police station]. Just before I began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>driving THOMAS looked at me and stated \u201cI just fucked you!\u201d I asked him what did he mean by that. He repeated again, \u201cI just fucked you!\u201d I told him that I didn\u2019t understand what he meant. He then stated \u201cI just pissed all over your front seat.\u201d I immediately removed him from the vehicle in order to prevent further damage to the seat [and issued him four citations].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After admission of this evidence, Thomas moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the evidence did not prove that he had been offered a chemical test and thus, he could not have refused what he was never offered. The ALJ denied Thomas\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and Thomas was immediately sworn in to testify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On the witness stand, Thomas simply testified that he had not been offered a chemical breath test, that he had never been transported to the police station, and that he had signed the citations issued to him. Thomas\u2019s attorney then argued that, because TA Section 16-205.1 required that Thomas be charged before Nemser could offer the chemical breath test, Thomas had only refused the preliminary breath test. The ALJ disagreed, finding that Thomas had been fully and properly advised of his rights and had refused the chemical breath test. The ALJ concluded that Thomas had alcohol in his system that night, citing Nemser\u2019s report that Thomas had been staggering about, had slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, could not exit his vehicle without falling to the ground, and later urinated in the front seat of the police vehicle. Accordingly, the ALJ did not give \u201cmuch credibility to [Thomas\u2019s testimony that he had not refused a chemical breath test] because of the state he was in when all of this was occurring.\u201d The ALJ suspended Thomas\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 120 days, and disqualified his commercial driver\u2019s license for one year, pursuant to TA Sections 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(3)(A) and 16-205.1(b)(l)(iii)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Thomas challenged the ALJ\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, but was unsuccessful. In affirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ing the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Circuit Court determined that nothing in Nemser\u2019s Alcohol Influence Report or the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form would prevent a reasoning mind from coming to the same conclusion as the ALJ, and thus the ALJ\u2019s ruling must stand. Thomas then petitioned this Court for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AC6R\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">When reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s judgment, we are mindful of the highly deferential standard afforded to an administrative agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">... [A] court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency[.] Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\"><em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Illiano, </em>390 Md. 265, 274-75, 888 A.2d 329, 335 (2005) (quotations marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\n<em>A. Potential Gatekeepers: Whether Formal Charges Or An Arrest Must Precede A Request For A Chemical Breath Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Thomas argues that, according to TA Section 16-205.1, an officer has not fully advised a person of the administrative sanctions associated with refusing a chemical breath test until the officer has charged that individual with a violation of the motor vehicle laws. Thus, a person cannot be penalized for any test refusal that occurs before he or she has been arrested for drunk driving. As evidence, Thomas points to 16-205.1(b)\u2019s language setting forth the consequences for a test refusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">[A] person may not be compelled to take a test. However, the detaining officer shall advise the person that, on receipt of a sworn statement from the officer that the person was so charged and refused to take a test ... the Administration shall [suspend the driver\u2019s license].[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">TA \u00a7 16-205.1(b) (emphasis added). Thomas claims that this language supports an interpretation that TA Section 16-205.1 requires a formal charge before the advice of rights is effective. He also claims sustenance from Sections 10-302 through 10-309 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC JP\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>which govern evidence in relation to motor vehicle laws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> CJP Section 10-802 (\u201cChemical test for alcohol, drug or controlled dangerous substance content \u2014 Purpose\u201d) begins \u201c[i]n a prosecution for a violation of law concerning a person who is driving or attempting to drive a vehicle in violation of [the motor vehicle laws] a [chemical breath test] may be administered[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Thomas reasons that the term \u201cprosecution\u201d assumes a charge against the driver for a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In addressing Thomas\u2019s arguments, we adhere to the well-known and oft-recited cannons of statutory interpretation. \u201c[O]ur primary goal [when analyzing a statute] is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision[.]\u201d <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>408 Md. 336, 351, 969 A.2d 971, 979 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Our first step is to look at the statutory language. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel, </em>408 Md. at 351, 969 A.2d at 980. Throughout this process, this Court \u201cmust always be cognizant of the fundamental principle that statutory construction is approached from a \u2018commonsensical\u2019 perspective. Thus, we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The General Assembly enacted TA Section 16-205.1 \u201cto reduce the incidence of drunken driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the statute was not meant to protect drivers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100, 108 (2007). Accordingly, subsection (a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented ... to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">(Emphasis added). The legislatively designed incentive for taking the test comes in the form of subsection (b)(1), which allows \u201ca driver\u2019s license to be suspended promptly for suspected 11 drunken driving if the person refused a test to determine alcohol concentration.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>399 Md. at 255, 923 A.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Also contained within TA Section 16-205.1 is a list of procedures established by the General Assembly for an officer who \u201cstops or detains\u201d a driver on suspicion of drunk driving. Specifically, subsection (b)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">[I]f a police officer stops or detains any person who the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving ... a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol ... the police officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">(i) Detain the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">(ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">(in) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15 at the time of testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">(iv) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions ... that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">(v) Advise the person of the additional criminal penalties that may be imposed ... if the person knowingly refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>take a test arising out of the same circumstances as the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In <em>Willis v. State, </em>302 Md. 363, 488 A.2d 171 (1985), we held that TA Section 16-205.1\u2019s phrase \u201cstops or detains\u201d carried the same meaning as \u201capprehended\u201d in CJP Section 10-303.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>302 Md. at 376, 488 A.2d at 178. We stated that \u201can accused is \u2018apprehended\u2019 when a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is or has been driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated or while under the influence of alcohol and the police officer reasonably acts upon that information by stopping or detaining the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, in <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986), we held that TA Section 16-205.1 \u201cwas not invoked <em>until </em>the officer <em>\u2018stops or detains </em>any individual.\u2019 \u201d 306 Md. at 625, 510 A.2d at 1082 (emphasis in original). We went on to explain that \u201cthe word \u2018detain\u2019 is used twice in \u00a7 16-205.1\u201d but that the second use of the word did not have a meaning different from or more restrictive than the first. <em>Id. </em>at 625 n. 1, 510 A.2d at 1082 n. 1. \u201cSimply put, the proper interpretation of the section is: if the officer first detains (or stops) one whom he has reasonable grounds to believe is driving while intoxicated, the officer shall <em>further </em>detain the individual in order to carry out the procedures prescribed by the section.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The word \u201cdetain\u201d has multiple meanings, including \u201cto arrest, to check, to delay, to hinder, ... to restrain from proceeding____\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>449 (6th ed.1990). Yet, for purposes of TA Section 16-205.1, it is evident that \u201cdetain\u201d does not mean a formal arrest. That section applies when an officer \u201cdetains\u201d a driver that the officer has \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe is driving under the influence. <em>See </em>TA \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2). The pairing of these two terms is crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to our analysis. In a previous case, we have held that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language signifies a detention short of arrest. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 254, 923 A.2d 100, 107 (2007). In <em>Shepard, </em>a driver argued that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language meant that, at the very least, the officer must have probable cause. We rejected this argument, explaining that \u201cSection 16-205.1 does not require an arrest to precede an officer\u2019s request for the driver to take a test[,]\u201d but rather requires that \u201cthe person should be <em>detained </em>on <em>suspicion </em>of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 256, 923 A.2d at 108-09 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we stated that \u201c[gjiven the underlying purpose and plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1 requiring a detention and not an arrest, we conclude that the use of the word \u2018detained,\u2019 combined with the word \u2018suspicion,\u2019 means reasonable articulable suspicion and not probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 256, 923 A.2d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Consequently, looking at TA Section 16-205.1\u2019s list of procedures through the lens of the statute\u2019s legislative purpose and our caselaw, we agree with the ALJ and Respondent MVA that \u201c[t]he \u2018so charged\u2019 [and \u2018prosecution\u2019 language], on which Mr. Thomas bases his argument, necessarily relates to prospective action that will be taken, based on the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>certification.\u201d Nowhere in the supplied procession of steps does TA Section 16-205.1 mandate that an officer make an arrest prior to advising the driver of his or her rights or requesting that the driver submit to a chemical breath test. Rather, the statute merely says that the officer shall \u201c[d]etain the person\u201d and \u201c[r]equest that the person permit a test to be taken[.]\u201d We agree with the ALJ that the \u201ctest is a form of evidence gathering^]\u201d and given that the statute was intended to protect the public and not the driver, we will not read into it an additional step that could hinder or delay an officer\u2019s investigation into suspected drunk driving. Therefore, we affirm the AL J\u2019s conclusion that Nemser was not required to arrest or formally charge Thomas before requesting that he submit to a chemical breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>B. Whether Nemser Misled Thomas Into Refusing The Chemical Breath Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Thomas claims that the ALJ erred in determining that he had been properly and fully advised of the consequences for refusing a chemical breath test because Nemser misled Thomas as to what test the officer was attempting to administer. He explains that the \u201cAlcohol Influence Report evidences that after offering the [preliminary breath test] to [Thomas] and [Thomas\u2019s] agreement to take a [preliminary breath test], [Nemser] immediately began to read [Thomas] the DR-15.\u201d He claims that this was an error that \u201cresulted in not only misleading [Thomas] but also an outright failure to properly advise [Thomas] under both [TA] \u00a7\u00a7 16-205.1 and 16-205.2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In his alcohol influence report, Nemser described his encounter with Thomas that night. In relevant part, he recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">THOMAS was staggering around until we had him sit on the curb. I asked him if he would like to take a preliminary breath test and he said yes. While reading the DR-15 to THOMAS, he informed me that he would not sign any paperwork or take a breath test. I took THOMAS into custody[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Thomas attempts to analogize this situation to those of <em>Fowler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>394 Md. 331, 906 A.2d 347 (2006) and <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 630 A.2d 753 (1993), to show that the preceding exchange was impermissibly confusing. In both of those cases, we reversed the license suspension and directed the ALJ to make additional findings as to whether the officer inadvertently deceived the driver regarding his or her rights under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In <em>Fowler, </em>the driver refused to submit to a preliminary breath test at the scene of the traffic stop, and was subsequently arrested and transported to the police station. 394 Md. at 337, 906 A.2d at 350. Fowler alleged that, at the station, the officer handed him the DR-15 Advise of Rights Form to read, but then informed Fowler that his license was being suspended because Fowler had already refused the test. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 906 A.2d at 351. Consequently, Fowler signed the DR-15 believing that he was merely acknowledging his refusal of the preliminary breath test. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 906 A.2d at 351-52. Similarly, in <em>Forman, </em>the driver alleged that, although she had been given and had read the advice of rights form, the officer negated the warnings contained within the form by suggesting that refusal did not necessarily result in an automatic license suspension. 332 Md. at 209-10, 630 A.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We explained that \u201c[i]n Maryland, a prerequisite to the MVA\u2019s suspension of a driver\u2019s license after a hearing is a finding that the police officer requested a test after the person was <em>fully advised </em>of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed[.]\u201d <em>Forman, </em>332 Md. at 217, 630 A.2d at 762 (emphasis in original) (quotation marks omitted). We clarified that \u201cfully advised\u201d under Section 16-205.1 \u201cmeans not only advised <em>initially, </em>but the detaining officer must also take care not to <em>subsequently </em>confuse or mislead the driver as to his or her rights under the statute.\u201d <em>Fowler, </em>394 Md. at 345, 906 A.2d at 355 (brackets and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). We warned officers to be \u201cvery cautious in providing information beyond that contained in the Advice of Rights form.\u201d <em>Forman, </em>332 Md. at 218, 630 A.2d at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Here, unlike the officers in <em>Fowler </em>and <em>Forman, </em>Nemser did not add to, negate, or misstate any of the rights enumerated in the Advise of Rights form. He merely offered Thomas a preliminary breath test, something that he was permitted, but not required, to do.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>TA \u00a7 16-205.2 (\u201cA police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that an individual [is driving under the influence of alcohol] may ... request the individual to submit to a preliminary breath test[.]\u201d) (emphasis added). After Thomas agreed to the preliminary breath test, Nemser began reading the DR-15 Advise of Rights Form, which states in its very first sentence that Thomas was being \u201casked to submit to a test under \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Maryland Vehicle Law[,]\u201d i.e. a chemical breath test. We do not see any source of confusion; clearly the request that Nemser was making of Thomas at that time no longer pertained to the preliminary breath test. Moreover, Thomas cannot rely on the fact that he refused the test while Nemser was reading the DR-15. By signing the Advice of Rights form, Nemser certified that he advised Thomas of <em>all </em>of his rights as enumerated in the form, \u201cincluding sanctions imposed for: 1) a refusal to take a test; 2) a test resulting in an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15; 3) a test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more; and 4) disqualifications for persons holding a commercial driver\u2019s license.\u201d (E.81) As the ALJ appropriately concluded, \u201cbased on the reading of [the] DR-15 it\u2019s indicated that there\u2019s a request [for the chemical breath test] in there[;] ... [thus, Thomas\u2019s] indication that he would not sign any paperwork or take the breath test is an adequate refusal for purposes of Section 16-205.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\n<em>C. Alleged Inconsistencies In Nemser\u2019s Sworn Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In one last attempt to discredit the ALJ\u2019s ruling, Thomas claims that the ALJ improperly resolved the conflicting evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>dence presented by the Alcohol Influence Report and the DR-15. While he does not challenge the actual denial of the MVA\u2019s subpoena request, Thomas argues that the MVA\u2019s evidence, supplied by the Alcohol Influence Report and the DR-15, is contradictory, and that the ALJ failed \u201cto resolve the inconsistencies in [those documents] in favor of [Thomas.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As Thomas concedes, the sworn statement of the officer is \u201cprima facie evidence of a test refusal, ... [and] unless explained or contradicted, [is] sufficient to establish that the [driver] refused to take an alcohol concentration test.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 283, 666 A.2d 511, 516 (1995). If the only evidence contradicting the officer\u2019s sworn statement is the testimony of the driver, the ALJ is left with an \u201call or nothing choice\u201d to either accept the driver\u2019s account or accept the officer\u2019s sworn statement. <em>See Karwacki, </em>340 Md. at 289, 666 A.2d at 520 (\u201c[B]y not subpoenaing the arresting officer and offering only his sworn testimony, directly conflicting the arresting officer\u2019s sworn statement on a critical point, the respondent presented the ALJ with an all or nothing choice.\u201d). \u201cClearly, under this scenario, the ALJ [is] under no obligation to believe the [driver].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">According to Thomas, Nemser\u2019s Alcohol Influence Report demonstrates that Nemser never offered him a chemical breath test, a fact that was corroborated by Thomas\u2019s testimony at trial. Thomas alleges that the <em>prima facie </em>evidence of test refusal supplied by the DR-15 certification is destroyed when the DR-15 is compared to the Alcohol Influence Report. Thomas claims that, because this supposed inconsistency is supplied entirely by the officer\u2019s evidence, the ALJ should have interpreted the conflict in Thomas\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Unlike Thomas, we do not see where the two documents are discordant. Rather, each document merely fills any gaps left by the other. In his report, Nemser stated that he read the DR-15 to Thomas, and that Thomas refused to take a breath test: \u201cWhile reading the DR-15 to Thomas, he informed me that he would not sign any paperwork or take a breath test.\u201d As the ALJ observed, and we have already explained, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cform in and of itself requests that an individual take a chemical test.\u201d Moreover, by signing at the bottom of the sheet, Nemser certified that he had read the entire DR-15 to Thomas, meaning that Thomas had been fully \u201cadvised ... of the [requisite] Advice of Rights[.]\u201d Accordingly, we cannot find error with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Thomas was \u201cproperly advised and appropriately requested to take the chemical test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">When stopping or detaining an individual an officer has reasonable grounds to believe is driving under the influence, the officer is not required to arrest or formally charge that person prior to offering him or her a chemical breath test or advising that person of his or her rights pursuant to the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form. Furthermore, an officer does not impermissibly confuse a driver into refusing a chemical breath test by simply failing to administer a previously agreed-upon preliminary breath test. Finally, where the sworn statements of an officer do not conflict internally, an ALJ is not required to accept the testimony of the driver over that of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Our discussion of the alleged arrest requirement was relevant because the <em>Shepard </em>driver argued that, at his suspension hearing, the \"ALJ applied the wrong legal standard in construing the meaning of 'reasonable grounds\u2019 \" and that \" 'reasonable grounds' [meant] \u2018a preponderance of the evidence standard' or at the very least, probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 923 A.2d at 107.
