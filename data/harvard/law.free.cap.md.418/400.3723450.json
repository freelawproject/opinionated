Work, et al., </em>192 Md.App. 438, 995 A.2d 744 (2010), the Court of Special Appeals (COSA) held that the Circuit Court for Baltimore County did not have the authority to enter that Order because it had been entered at a point in time when no Complaint had been filed with the court by or on behalf of two of Mr. Williams\u2019 children. In that reported opinion, the COSA cited with approval an article in which Robert R. Michael, Esq., stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">Maryland has a public policy that a defendant should not be \u201cvexed\u201d by several suits instituted by or on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>different, plaintiffs for the same injury when all the parties could be joined in one proceeding. <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645 (1990). Under modern practice, a plaintiff is required to account for and name in the complaint all potential takers, even those who do not join in the suit. <em>See </em>discussion of Rule 15-1001 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure below. This requirement by statute and case law creates both legal and ethical challenges for the plaintiffs attorney who is compelled by rule to file a lawsuit on behalf of plaintiffs the attorney does not represent and with whom the attorney may have a real or potential conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">The conflict issues are magnified in any settlement of the claim. Where the case is ultimately tried, the jury verdict allocates the wrongful death award among each individual beneficiary which alleviates any conflict as to their respective entitlements. Settlement of the same case may be a completely different proposition. A claim for wrongful death cannot be settled without either the consent of all beneficiaries or the approval of the court. <em>See Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645 (1990) As a practical matter, defense counsel and the insurers will almost always insist that all primary and secondary beneficiaries be identified and made a part of every wrongful death suit. In addition, defense counsel and insurers will also require that all potential plaintiffs execute a release as part of any settlement of the case. Remember that the case law, <em>Walker v. Essex; </em>the wrongful death statute (section 3-904(f)); and Rule 15-1001 bolster the position that defense counsel and the insurers have a legal right to insist that everyone be accounted for and that each party sign off before settlement of any case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Robert R. Michael, <em>The \u201cUSE\u201d Plaintiff in Maryland Wrongful Death Cases: Some Ethical Observations, </em>Trial Reporter, Fall 2008, at 9 and 15 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>At this point in these tortured proceedings, the Respondents are the two children who were never parties to the case designated as <em>\u201cWilliams I\u201d </em>in which the May 19, 2005 Order had been entered, while the Petitioners are Ace American Insurance Company (Ace), Charles Beatty, III, American Sprinkler Systems, Inc., and Zurich American Insurance Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who were among the defendants subsequently sued by the Respondents in the case designated as <em>\u201cWilliams II.\u201d </em>The Petitioners\u2019 \u201cJOINT PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIO-RARI\u201d presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that there was no final judgment in <em>Williams I </em>because [the Respondents] were not joined in that case under Rule 15-1001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in interpreting and applying <em>Walker </em>[v. <em>Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645 (1990) ] in concluding there was no final judgment in <em>Williams I </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">3. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in denying Ace recovery of legal expenses incurred in <em>Williams II </em>where the filing of <em>Williams I </em>was in bad faith and without substantial justification, thereby condoning the conduct of the attorney who filed both cases?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">We granted the Petition. 415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to each question, and we shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Decedent\u2019s Widow v. Ace</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, on May 14, 2003, the decedent\u2019s widow, Lori Williams (Mrs. Williams), filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201cCOMPLAINT AND PRAYER FOR JURY TRIAL\u201d that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>STATEMENT OF FACTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">5. On or about September 12, 2002, the Decedent, Michael Williams, had stopped his motor vehicle along the right hand shoulder of northbound 1-95 near the Waterloo Road overpass and had carefully and prudently exited his motor vehicle and was in the process of walking along the shoulder of the roadway to speak with another stopped motorist, when the motor vehicle operated by William C. Work, also heading northbound on 1-95, suddenly and without warning, made an unsafe lane change and entered the shoulder of the roadway and struck and killed the decedent, Michael Williams, thereby causing a collision. William C. Work is insured by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and they have tended their policy limits of $100,000.00. The plaintiff will not accept that tender until this issue is resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">8. That at all times relevant hereto, the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, and the Decedent, Michael Williams, were covered by a policy issued by the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, which provides for uninsured motorists coverage, whereby Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, is obligated to make payments for the personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff and the Decedent, Michael Williams, that were proximately caused by the negligence of the operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">18. The Plaintiff has complied with the terms of said policy of insurance and demand has been made for payment for the personal injuries sustained that were proximately caused by the negligence of the operator of the uninsured and underinsured motor vehicle namely, William C. Work, but that the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>has wrongfully refused to honor said claim, and has not paid the outstanding bills, and has thereby breached its obligations to the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Mrs. Williams\u2019 Complaint was assigned Case No. 03-C-005338. On July 22, 2003, Mrs. Williams filed an \u201cAMENDED COMPLAINT\u201d that included the following additional assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">18. The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, was the wife of Michael Williams, Deceased, who was born on December 29, 1967, and who died on September 12, 2002. The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, is a primary beneficiary in this action pursuant to Section 3-904(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">19. In addition to the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, the following [persons] may be entitled by law to recover damages: Jeremy Williams, son of the Deceased, born November 23, 2001[ ]; Shane Williams, son of the Deceased, born November 9,1998[ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, Surviving Wife of Michael Williams, Deceased, and on behalf of the minor children of the Deceased, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, Surviving Sons of Michael Williams, Deceased, demands judgment against the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, in the amount of Five Millionf ] Dollars ($5,000,000.00), in compensatory damages to be proportioned pursuant to Section 3-904(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, plus interest and the costs of this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">ACE filed an Answer to Mrs. Williams\u2019 Amended Complaint, and a \u201cTHIRD PARTY COMPLAINT\u201d against Mr. Work. During the legal skirmishing that followed, Mrs. Williams and Ace reached a settlement agreement that would resolve the claims of Mrs. Williams and her two children. This settlement was to be placed \u201con the record\u201d at a settlement conference scheduled to be held on March 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Prior to this date, Ace had agreed to pay $750,000 in settlement of Mrs. Williams\u2019 claims, and Mrs. Williams had agreed to accept that amount, but her counsel refused to sign a release that would require her \u201cto save said Releasees harmless from any further claim or liability including tort and contractual claims, and [ ] indemnify and satisfy on behalf of Releasees any claim for and/or decree, judgment, or award for any and all damages, including but not limited to, any workers compensation hens, compensatory damages and punitive damages.\u201d In a March 28, 2005 letter to Ace\u2019s counsel, Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">[A]ll is fine, except I cannot have Mrs. Williams agree to hold your client, Ace American Insurance Company, harmless from any other future claims for several reasons: a) this was not agreed to by [the adjustor] and myself, who negotiated the settlement [ ]; and b) Mrs. Williams simply has no control over what anyone else may do and cannot, therefore, be responsible for their actions. She will not agree to pay back or apportion any funds to Ace if other claims are made. We all realize that the Decedent had two other older children with his first wife, Donna [S] (Williams). I believe the oldest child (Michael Williams) is an adult now and the other child (Steven Williams) is fifteen. We do not represent them and will not agree to hold Ace American harmless from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">It is my understanding that we are to appear before [the Circuit Court] tomorrow, March 29, 2005 at 1:30 p.m., to place the settlement on the record. I\u2019ve prepared a Motion to Accept Settlement and have attached it for your review. If you agree to remove the objectionable language on page 2 of the Confidential Settlement and Release Agreement (\u201cAs further consideration ...\u201d to the end of that paragraph), then I will modify the attached Motion to become a joint motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The Motion prepared by Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel included the following assertions and requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">2. The Decedent died leaving a spouse, the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, and four (4) children. Only two (2) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Decedent\u2019s children, however, are Plaintiffs in this action, i.e. Jeremy Williams (age 7) and Shane Williams (age 3), because they are the minor children of the marriage between the Decedent and the Plaintiff, Lori Williams. The Decedent had two other children, i.e. Michael Williams (age 18) and Steven Williams (age 15) as a result of an earlier relationship with Donna [S]. Michael Williams and Steven Williams are not Plaintiffs in the present action and neither present counsel nor the present Plaintiffs are able to represent their interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">A. That the Motion to Approve Settlement be granted, without any requirement by the Plaintiffs to save and hold harmless the Defendant from any further claims, including but not limited to the potential claims of Michael Williams and Steven Williams, additional children of the Decedent[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">On March 29, 2005, the Circuit Court held a settlement conference, at which Mrs. Williams and Ace\u2019s counsel appeared in person, and during which Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel participated via telephone. This conference concluded with the understanding that Mrs. Williams would not sign a release until her counsel had the opportunity to review it, and with the Court stating, \u201cCase will be dismissed with prejudice upon approval of language of release by [Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel]. As soon as I hear from him I will dismiss it with prejudice.\u201d In response to this statement, Ace\u2019s counsel said \u201cOkay. Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d Mrs. Williams never did sign the release that Ace\u2019s counsel brought to the Settlement Conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">While Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel continued to object to the \u201chold harmless\u201d language in the release, Ace\u2019s counsel discovered that their proposed settlement would likely be declared invalid if challenged by the Respondents. In a letter to Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel dated April 6, 2005, Ace\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Based on the discussions at the settlement conference and your adamant refusal to have your client execute a release with a hold harmless and indemnification provision, and your insistence on removing the language in the release indicating that Lori Williams is acting as mother and/or next of friend of the children of Michael Williams, my office and I reviewed in detail Maryland\u2019s Wrongful Death Statute and rules relating thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Although you represent that you are not counsel for two of Mr. Williams\u2019 children, Michael Williams and Steven Williams, from a prior marriage, \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, subsection (f), limits to one (1) action only in respect to the death of a person. Additionally, Maryland Rule 15-1001 mandates that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">All persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action. The words \u201cto the use of\u2019 shall precede the name of any persons named as a plaintiff who does not join in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Further, Rule 15-1001 also sets forth that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">Any party bringing the action shall mail a copy of the complaint by certified mail to any use plaintiff at the use plaintiffs last known address. Proof of mailing shall be filed as provided in Rule 2-126.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">Rule 2-126 requires that proof of service, if any, be filed with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">The captions of the Complaint and Amended Complaint do not indicate any \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs, nor do the Complaints mention that notice was given to all individuals entitled to recover under Maryland\u2019s Wrongful Death Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">Please advise what notice, if any, has been given to Michael Williams\u2019 former wife, Donna [S], as mother of the two children in question, to comply with Rule 15-1001. Upon review of my file, it does not reflect any such notice but you may have filed it with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">Case law, <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 51[6, 569 A.2d 645] (1990), specifically mandates that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>When a Maryland death action is settled by the personal representative, the proceeds are distributed according to statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">The statute and rules relating thereto \u201cimplicitly require mutual consent or Court approval.\u201d Have you or the P.R. obtained the mutual consent of all beneficiaries under the statute to settle this action and to distribute the proceeds as you and the P.R. propose to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">There is no doubt that [Ace\u2019s claims adjuster] intended to resolve all claims for $750,000. [Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel], the $750,000.00 is still on the table, but my client and I need assurance and evidence that there has been compliance with all applicable statutes, rules, and case law or we need to have the proposed settlement be approved by [the Circuit Court] with the full and complete knowledge of all relevant facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel responded to the letter from Ace\u2019s counsel by preparing a \u201cSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\u201d that did not include the Respondents in the caption,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but did \u201cname\u201d the Respondents as \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs. The Second Amended Complaint included the following assertions and requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>18. The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, was the wife of Michael Williams, Deceased, who was born on December 29, 1967, and who died on September 12, 2002. The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, is a primary beneficiary in this action pursuant to Section 3-904(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">19. In addition to the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, the following persons may be entitled by law to recover damages: Jeremy Williams, son of the Deceased, born November 23, 2001, 3107 Trellis Lane, Abandon, Maryland 21009; Shane Williams, son of the Deceased, born November 9, 1998, 3107 Trellis Lane, Abandon, Maryland 21009; Michael C. Williams, son of the Deceased, born August 13, 1986, 435 South Taylor Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21221, and Steven L. Williams, son of the Deceased, born October 24, 1992, 435 South Taylor Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21221. The minor Plaintiff, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams are children of the marriage between the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, and the deceased. Michael C. Williams and Steven L. Williams are believed to be sons of the Deceased and are believed to be sons of the Deceased and are believed to be children of the Deceased and Donna [S]. The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, is identifying Michael C. Williams and Steven L. Williams as children of the Deceased because of the requirement of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 9-104, but is not seeking compensation for those children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, Surviving Wife of Michael Williams, Deceased, and on behalf of the minor children of the Deceased, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, Surviving Sons of Michael Williams, Deceased, demands judgment against the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, in the amount of Five Million[ ] Dollars ($5,000,000.00), in compensatory damages, to be proportioned pursuant to Section 3-904(c) of the Courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article, plus interest and the costs of this action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Although the record shows that Michael Williams and Steven Williams were served with a copy of the Second Amended Complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the original of that pleading was not filed with the Circuit Court. It is clear, however, that a copy of this pleading was mailed to Ace\u2019s counsel, because Ace\u2019s Answer to the Second Amended Complaint was received by the Circuit Court on April 15, 2005. The Certificate of Service that accompanied this Answer shows that a copy was mailed only to Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel, rather than to \u201ceach of the parties\u201d as is required by Md. Rule l-321(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On May 17, 2005, Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel and Ace\u2019s counsel presented to the Circuit Court a \u201cJOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT\u201d that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">The Plaintiff, Lori Williams, Individually, and as personal representative for the Estate of Michael Williams, and as mother and next friend for Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, minor children, by and through her attorneys, ... and the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, respectfully files this Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement and Entry of Judgment, and states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">2. At the time of his death, the Decedent died leaving a spouse, Lori Williams, and four (4) minor children. Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>two (2) of the Decedent\u2019s children, i.e., Jeremy Williams (age 7) and Shane Williams (age 3), are the minor children of the marriage between the Defendant and Lori Williams. The Decedent has two other children, i.e., Michael Williams (now age 18) and Steven Williams (now age 15) as a result of an earlier relationship with Donna [S]. Michael Williams and Steven Williams are named as \u201cUse\u201d Plaintiffs in the present action, pursuant to the requirements of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 3-904, and Rule 15-1001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">4. On the same day the service of process as obtained upon Donna [S] and the \u201cUse\u201d Plaintiffs, Ms. [S] telephoned Plaintiffs counsel\u2019s office staff, took a message from Ms. [S] that Ms. [S] wanted to know what she should do about the pleadings that she received and that she would appreciate a return call from Plaintiffs counsel. Ms. [S] also indicated, after being asked by Ms. Hunt, that her sons, Michael Williams and Steven Williams, were presently living with her at her home. Ms. [S] also left her telephone number for [Mrs. Williams\u2019] counsel to return her call. Ms. [S]\u2019s telephone number was given[.] There has not been, however, any additional contact from or to Donna [S] and/or Michael Williams and/or Steven Williams, since Ms. [S]\u2019s initial telephone call to [Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel\u2019s] office on April 11,2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">5. On or about February 3, 2004, counsel for the Plaintiff and the adjuster,[], for the Defendant, Ace American Insurance company, tentatively settled the above-captioned underinsured motorist action for $750,000 (Defendant William Work previously settled his portion of the claim to the extent of his policy limits of $100,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">6. The parties in this case are seeking this court\u2019s approval of the proposed settlement and entry of judgment pursuant to the requirements of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 3-904(c). The proposed settlement does not provide compensation to the \u201cUse\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Plaintiffs, i.e., Michael Williams and Steven Williams, or to the Estate of Michael Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">13. A Confidential Release and Settlement Agreement has been prepared by Defendant\u2019s, Ace American Insurance Company, counsel. The parties wish to enter into such an agreement, and request prior court approval because of the requirements of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 3-904(c), regarding the proportionment of funds to potential \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d, i.e. Claimants and/or \u201cUse\u201d Plaintiffs, and of the instructions of <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516[, 569 A.2d 645] (1990), requiring the joinder of all potential beneficiaries to this single wrongful death action and their mutual consent to settlement or this court\u2019s approval of the settlement. In this case, all Plaintiffs, including \u201cUse\u201d Plaintiffs, Michael Williams and Steven Williams, have been formally notified of the pendency of this action, both by certified mail and by personal service of process; more than 30 days elapsed since the service of that process; and the \u201cUse\u201d Plaintiffs have not sought or done any act to join this action. The Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, individually and on behalf of her minor children, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, along with the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, seek to foreclose the possibility that the \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs, Michael Williams and Steven Williams, shall make future claims against either Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company or William Work or Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, Jeremy Williams, Shane Williams and/or the Estate of Michael Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Lori Williams, Individually, and as Personal Representative of Michael Williams, and as mother and near friend for Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, and the Defendant, Ace American Insurance Company, jointly request:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">A. That the Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement and Entry of Judgment be granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>B.

The Plaintiffs are the children of the marriage of Michael Dwayne Williams, the Plaintiffs\u2019 father who died on September 12, 2002, and their mother, Donna [S].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">23. At the time of this accident, the Deceased was the father of the Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, but were at that time both minor children and living with their mother and legal custodian, Donna [S]. The Plaintiff[s] nevertheless are persons eligible for the benefits of the Defendant, American Automatic Sprinkler Systems, Inc.\u2019s motor vehicle insurance policy with either or all of the Defendants, State Auto Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company and Ace American Insurance Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">24. The Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, have duly made a claim against the applicable provisions of the policy of insurance provided by the Defendants, State Auto Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company and Ace American Insurance Company, for the losses sustained by Plaintiffs as a result of the death of the Deceased, their father, that were proximately caused by the negligence of the uninsured/underinsured driver, the Defendant, William Charles Work.

Said denials constitute a breach of the obligations due the Plaintiffs under the policies of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, Surviving Children of Michael Dwayne Williams, Deceased, demand judgment against the Defendants, William Charles Work, Charles Oliver Beatty, 3rd, American Automatic Sprinkler Systems, Inc., State Auto Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company and Ace American Insurance Company, in the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), in compensatory damages, to be proportioned pursuant to Section 3-904(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, plus interest and the costs of this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Thereafter, in both Case No. 03-C-05-007925 and Case No. 03-C-03-005338, Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel filed a \u201cMOTION TO REOPEN AND CONSOLIDATE\u201d that included the following assertions and request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">2. In both of the above captioned cases, the claimants are \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d as that term is defined in Section 3-904(a) of the Courts Article. The Plaintiffs in <em>Steven Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-05-007925, are Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams children of the decedent as a result of the decedent\u2019s first marriage to Donna [S]. That marriage ended in divorce prior to the decedent\u2019s death. See the attached Judgment of Absolute Divorce dated March 9,1998. There is no question that this action was filed within the limitations period. The initial Plaintiffs in <em>Lori Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-03-005338, were Lori Williams, the wife of the decedent at the time of his death and Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, children of the decedent as a result of the decedent\u2019s marriage to Lori Williams. Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams were not initially named as Plaintiffs in that action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>4. In regard to the case of <em>Lori Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-03-005338, the parties in that case agreed as part of their settlement discussions that the Plaintiffs would and did file an amended complaint adding as \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, and filed the attached JOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT in May of 2005. The amended complaint adding the \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs was mailed by certified mailed to the \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs, i.e. Donna [S] for the minor child, Steven Louis Williams, and to Michael Christopher Williams, pursuant to Rule 15-1001(c). A private process server also served the use Plaintiffs. See the attached Affidavits of Private Process Service. The \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs did not either file an Answer or other type of response to the amended complaint or attempt to contact counsel for any party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">5. The JOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OR SETTLEMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, however, specifically did not provide anything for the claims of Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams. In addition, the Joint Motion was filed by the parties and granted by [the Circuit Court] on May 17, 2005. Apparently, the JOINT MOTION was not served on the \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs. The \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs, however, did not either file an Answer or other type of response to the amended complaint or attempt to contact counsel for any party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">6. Rule 15-1001 itself does not specifically provide a time limit by which the \u201cuse\u201d Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, were to respond to the amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">7. Pursuant to <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516[, 569 A.2d 645] (1990), a settlement by some of the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d to a wrongful death suit requires either the consent of all primary beneficiaries or court approval. Obviously, neither Steven Louise Williams, a minor, or Michael Christopher Williams, consented to the settlement in the case of <em>Lori Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-03-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>005838. This court approved the settlement knowing explicitly that the claims of Steven Louis Williams, a minor, and Michael Christopher Williams were not addressed. The case of <em>Steven Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-05-007925, was filed to specifically address those unprovided for and legitimate claims of Steven Louis Williams, a minor, and Michael Christopher Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">8. Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, are mindful that Maryland\u2019s Wrongful Death Statute, specifically Section 3-901 of the Courts Article, and Rule 15-1001(b) specifically require a single action to address that claims of all beneficiaries to a potential claim. This Motion to Reopen and to Consolidate is being filed to address that issue, but not to disturb the previous funds allocated to settle the claims of Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">9. Plaintiffs Steven Louis Williams, a minor, and Michael Christopher Williams do not believe that the interests of justice and due process were/are served if it is determined that their claims were terminated by the Order dated May 17, 2005. The Plaintiffs would have consented to the settlement of the claims made by Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, exactly on the terms identified provided that their own claims would have remained open to adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">10. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs, Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, submit that not all potential claims were pursued against all of the potential Defendants in the case of <em>Lori Williams, et al. v. William Work, et. al., </em>03-C-03-005338, i.e., State Auto Insurance Company, a second underinsured motorist carrier. The Plaintiffs further submit that not only is their room for the settlement of their claims in regard to the policy limits of Defendant Ace American Insurance Company but that Defendant State Auto Insurance company has exposure as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">11. Consequently, the above-captioned cases share identical issues of fact and law and it would be in the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>justice and due process to reopen the case of Lori <em>Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-03-005338, and to consolidate into it the case of <em>Steven Williams, et al. v. William Work, et al., </em>03-C-05-007925, for purposes of compliance with Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b), Section 3-901 of the Courts Article and <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. [516] 515[, 569 A.2d 645] (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs Steven Louis Williams and Michael Christopher Williams, request that the cases be consolidated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In Case No. 03-C-05-007925, Ace filed a \u201cTHIRD PARTY COMPLAINT\u201d against Mrs. Williams, which required that she be represented by counsel other than the lawyer who (1) represented her and her children in <em>Williams I, </em>and (2) now represented the Respondents in <em>Williams II. </em>In a series of rulings, the Circuit Court ultimately (1) denied the Motion to Reopen Case No. 03-C-03-005338, (2) granted summary judgment against the Respondents and in favor of every defendant in Case No. 03-C-05-007925, and (3) denied the requests for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expenses filed by Ace and American Sprinkler. The Respondents noted appeals from (1) the denial of their Motion to Reopen, and (2) the summary judgments entered against them. Ace and American Sprinkler noted appeals from the denial of their requests for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">As stated above, while Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel continued to object to the \u201chold harmless\u201d language in the release, Ace\u2019s counsel discovered that any settlement would be invalid unless it complied with the requirements of (1) \u00a7 3-904(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, (2) Md. Rule 15-1001(b), and (3) <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645 (1990), in which this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">When looking to the direction of \u00a7 3-904(b), we are told that \u201conly one action under this subtitle lies in respect to the death of a person.\u201d We are also instructed that, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>recovery or verdict is obtained in this one action, the amount recovered shall be \u201cdivided among the beneficiaries in shares directed by the verdict.\u201d The statutory language does not allow a judgment for one of the beneficiaries to be made a matter of record, as by its very nature, other claims are forever foreclosed or barred. The trial judge in this case considered the claims of the beneficiaries to be severable. The statute does not. A judgment should not have been entered in the circuit court unless it included the interests of all of the known beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 523-24, 569 A.2d at 648. Unfortunately, Mrs. Williams\u2019 counsel and Ace\u2019s counsel attempted to solve these problems with action that violated Md. Rules l-321(a), 1-323, and 1-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The \u201cJOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT\u201d was presented to the Circuit Court on May 17, 2005 should not have been presented on that date because neither of the Respondents had been (1) served with a copy of the \u201cJOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT,\u201d or (2) notified that Mrs. Williams and Ace would be applying for the entry of a judgment that \u2014 if valid\u2014 would operate to extinguish Respondents\u2019 rights. In fact, this Motion should not have been accepted for filing because it was not accompanied by a Certificate of Service required by Md. Rule l~321(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, as a result of an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding that violated Md. Rule 1-351, the Circuit Court entered a judgment that purported to satisfy \u201cany and all claims and potential claims stemming from the death of Michael Williams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In <em>Williams, et al. v. Work, et al., </em>192 Md.App. 438, 995 A.2d 744 (2010), after consolidating the appeals, designating as <em>\u201cWilliams I </em>\u201d the action filed by Mrs. Williams, and designat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ing as <em>\u201cWilliams II </em>\u201d the action filed on behalf of the Respondents, the COSA rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments that (1) the judgment entered in <em>Williams I </em>was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d because the Respondents had been \u201ceffectively protected\u201d in that case, (2) the summary judgments entered in <em>Williams II </em>were legally correct, and (3) because <em>Williams II </em>\u201cwas brought in bad faith and without substantial justification,\u201d the Petitioners were entitled to recovery of all legal expenses incurred in defending the claims asserted in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">While concluding that no final judgment had been entered in <em>Williams </em>/, the COSA explained why the Respondents had been prejudiced by the failure to include them as use plaintiffs in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">Nowhere are Steven and Michael identified on the record as use plaintiffs or as parties of any kind. Ace\u2019s answer to the Second Amended Complaint was included in the record, but there is no docket entry reflecting its filing. Had they been designated as use plaintiffs, Steven and Michael, presumably, would have been entitled to receive a copy of the judgment recorded on May 19, 2005, and that, in turn, would have provided them with an opportunity to file a timely motion to vacate that judgment under Rule 2-535(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMQW\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 995 A.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The COSA next explained why there is no merit whatsoever in the argument that, merely because the Respondents had been provided with \u201cnotice\u201d of the fact that the case designated as <em>Williams I </em>actually existed, they were prohibited from seeking the relief that they sought in <em>Williams II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">As we see it, Rule 15-1001 is in the nature of a joinder rule or a condition precedent that requires that all known statutory beneficiaries, <em>ie., </em>the real parties in interest, be identified as parties to the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">Although Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b) does not require formal joinder, the failure to include a known statutory beneficiary as a plaintiff or a \u201cuse plaintiff\u2019 in a wrongful death action and to settle without providing for that beneficiary can be analo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>gized to the failure to join a necessary party in an action where joinder is required. In our view, because of the one action rule, the failure to do so is a \u201cdefect\u201d or \u201cmistake\u201d of jurisdictional proportions in the proceeding, which may be raised at any time. <em>See S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Kevin Willes Constr. Co., </em>382 Md. 524, 550[, 856 A.2d 626, 641] (2004) (\u201cFailure to join a necessary party constitutes a defect in the proceedings that cannot be waived by the parties, <em>and may be raised at any time, including for the first time on appeal\u201d). </em>That would be true whether the failure to name the statutory beneficiary as a plaintiff or use plaintiff is attributed to a failure to file or to a clerk\u2019s error in docketing a filed pleading. In a situation where no financial provisions were made for known beneficiaries, the former is in the nature of a jurisdictional mistake and the latter is an irregularity of process or procedure. Either would permit, and, in the circumstances of this case, require, opening the judgment to protect the interests of those beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Had Steven and Michael been properly designated as plaintiffs or \u201cuse plaintiffs,\u201d a settlement between Lori, State Farm, and Ace that excluded them from sharing in the settlement proceeds would clearly prejudice them and, as explained, would not constitute a final judgment under <em>Walker. </em>Here, the denial of the Motion to Reopen and Consolidate effectively denied Steven and Michael \u201cthe means of further prosecuting\u201d their claims in <em>Williams I. Id. </em>That would permit entry of a final judgment on our own initiative under Rule 8-602(e)(l), as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Walker, </em>in order to \u201cconsider the important issue[s] involved\u201d and to preclude the claims of Steven and Michael \u201cfrom being barred from further consideration\u201d in <em>Williams I.Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Ace further contends that the settlement in <em>Williams I </em>must be upheld because Steven and Michael \u201cdid not wish to disturb the settlement in <em>[Williams </em>/] upon which the final settlement was based.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Although Steven and Michael indicated that it was not their goal to \u201cdisturb the previous funds allocated to settle the claims of Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, Jeremy Williams, and Shane Williams,\u201d Ace overlooks the fact that Steven and Michael expressly stated that they \u201cwould have consented to the settlement of the claims made by Plaintiffs, Lori Williams, Jeremy Williams and Shane Williams, exactly on the terms identified <em>provided that their own claims would have remained open to adjudication.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">Ace argues that notice to Steven and Michael of the suit itself was all that was required, and that Steven\u2019s and Michael\u2019s decision not to \u201cjoin\u201d the suit forecloses both their participation in the <em>Williams I </em>settlement and any subsequent action on their own behalf. This argument rests on the premise that Steven and Michael had been properly designated as use plaintiffs and that Rule 15-1001 is simply a \u201cnotice\u201d rule. It is satisfied by giving use plaintiffs notice of the action. Under this theory, once the use plaintiffs are notified, the burden falls upon them to join or intervene in the wrongful death action to protect their interests in the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">To interpret the Rule as simply a notice rule disregards: (1) the representative nature of wrongful death actions; (2) the language of Rule 15-1001(b), requiring that \u201call persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action[;]\u201d and (3) the provisions of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c) relating to the award of damages to the statutory \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d \u201cproportional to injury resulting from the wrongful death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">$ \u00ed \u00cd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">____ We do not understand \u201cmutual consent or court approval\u201d to mean that the circuit court could approve a settlement denying benefits to Steven and Michael, without, at least, some demonstration that a good faith effort had been made to gain their fully informed and knowing consent. <em>See Stone v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>10 F.Supp.2d 602, 605 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(S.D.W.Va.1998) (interpreting <em>Walker </em>to \u201cpermit settlement of wrongful death actions only if all the beneficiaries knowingly consent to a release\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">Rather, we believe the language \u201cor court approval\u201d speaks to exceptional circumstances, such as, but not necessarily limited to, instances where the beneficiaries cannot be located or agreement as to appropriateness of settlement or the allocation of the settlement proceeds cannot be reached among the beneficiaries. In other words, \u201ccourt approval\u201d becomes an option only when there has been some effort to achieve the knowing consent of all the known beneficiaries. Here, not only did counsel for Lori and her children purposefully avoid any contact with the use plaintiffs, neither party notified Steven and Michael of the terms of the settlement, much less actively sought Steven\u2019s and Michael\u2019s consent to the Settlement Agreement[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">Although their respective motivations, and, perhaps, even their understandings of the effect of settlement, may have differed, the objective of Lori and Ace was to settle <em>Williams I </em>without providing for Steven and Michael, both minors at the time of their father\u2019s death and when <em>Williams I </em>was initiated, and to foreclose Steven and Michael from bringing claims against Work, Ace, Lori, or decedent\u2019s estate. Neither Lori nor Ace nor the circuit court had the authority to deny Steven and Michael a recovery for their father\u2019s death under the Wrongful Death Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">On remand, the circuit court must vacate the judgment and the settlement approved in <em>Williams I </em>and grant the motion to consolidate the cases, keeping in mind that all statutory beneficiaries are to be either plaintiffs or use plaintiffs in the consolidated case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 452-463, 995 A.2d at 753-760. (Italicized emphasis in the original, emphasis otherwise supplied, footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The COSA then reversed the summary judgments entered in <em>Williams II </em>on the ground that \u201cthe [Circuit] court\u2019s grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of summary judgment in <em>Williams II </em>were based on the mistaken belief that a wrongful death action had been finally adjudicated [in <em>Williams I],\u201d </em>and thereafter explained why the \u201cone action\u201d rule did not apply to any of the <em>Williams II </em>defendants who had not been sued in <em>Williams I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Moreover, Beatty, American Sprinkler, and Zurich were not named as defendants in <em>Williams I, </em>and, therefore, the grant of summary judgment in their favor based on the \u201cone action\u201d rule was error. As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>State use of Bashe v. Boyce, </em>72 Md. 140, 143-144 [19 A. 366] (1890), \u201c[the wrongful death statute] never contemplated depriving a plaintiff of the right to sue separately different joint tort-feasors, though, of course, there can be but one satisfaction, no matter how many judgments may be recovered.\u201d More recently, the <em>Walker </em>Court explained, \u201c[T]he purpose of the one action rule is to protect <em>a defendant </em>from being vexed by several suits instituted by or on behalf of different equitable plaintiffs for the same injury, when all the parties could be joined in one proceeding.\u201d 318 Md. at 523, 569 A.2d 645. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 995 A.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The COSA\u2019s opinion concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">In conclusion, we hold in <em>Williams I </em>that the proposed settlement agreement between Ace, Work, Lori, and her children, and the judgment based on that settlement, must be vacated and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings. In <em>Williams II, </em>we affirm the denial of attorney\u2019s fees to Ace but reverse the grants of summary judgment in favor of all defendants. We instruct the circuit court to consolidate <em>Williams I </em>and <em>Williams II </em>in any further proceedings. Our decision in this case is without prejudice to any claims of release and estoppel between and among the various parties in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">We feel the obligation to comment that these cases present what appear to us to be clear conflict issues for [Mrs. Williams\u2019 trial counsel] in his continued representation of parties to this litigation. In doing so, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>recognize that we are not privy to the engagement and possible conflict disclosure agreements that might exist between Donna, Michael, and counsel in <em>Williams I. </em>Nor are we privy to any agreement that might exist between Lori and counsel related to <em>Williams II </em>and counsel\u2019s efforts to reopen <em>Williams I. </em>It would appear, however, that both Lori\u2019s settlement and Steven and Michael\u2019s potential recovery have been compromised by counsel\u2019s successive representations of Lori and her children in negotiating the settlement with Ace and then of Stephen and Michael in attempting to vacate the settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 467-68, 995 A.2d at 762.

We also share the COSA\u2019s concerns about the yet to be resolved issues that have arisen as a result of the procedural violations in <em>Williams I </em>and the \u201csuccessive representations\u201d of plaintiffs who may well have a \u201cconflict as to their respective entitlements.\u201d We shall therefore adopt the above quoted portions of the COSA\u2019s opinion and affirm the judgment of that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; 70% OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER ACE AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY; 20% OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER AMERICAN AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS, INC.; 10% OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER ZURICH AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-13\">.
