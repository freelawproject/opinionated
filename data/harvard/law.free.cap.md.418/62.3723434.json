Those convictions were based, in part, on the admission into evidence of two statements he made to the police during their investigation of the crimes. Petitioner sought suppression of the statements before trial, claiming that both statements were obtained in violation of Maryland\u2019s common law rule that a statement by the accused that is the product of improper police inducement is involuntary and, thus, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Petitioner challenged the denial of the suppression motion on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court, finding no merit in the claim, affirmed the convictions in an unreported opinion. We granted a writ of certiorari, <em>Hill v. State, </em>411 Md. 740, 985 A.2d 538 (2009), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAZK\">Do statements made by an interrogating officer to a suspect implying a victim\u2019s inclination not to prosecute if the suspect were to apologize constitute an improper inducement under Maryland common law where the suspect relied on those statements in making admissions to the police?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that Petitioner\u2019s statements to the police were indeed the product of an improper inducement, entitling him to a new trial at which the statements may not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Because the legal question we decide involves the correctness of a ruling on a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence, it is unnecessary to discuss in detail the evidence that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>developed at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is sufficient to note that the young victim of the incidents in question, whom we shall refer to simply as \u201cRandy,\u201d met Petitioner at the church where Petitioner, an ordained minister, was involved in the church\u2019s Youth Department. Over time, Randy and Petitioner grew close and, during the summer of 2004, Randy became Petitioner\u2019s godson. Randy\u2019s mother occasionally allowed Randy to spend weekends with Petitioner at his home in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In April 2006, the Anne Arundel County Police Department began investigating Petitioner concerning allegations that he sexually abused Randy approximately a year and a half earlier, when Randy was eight or nine years old. In the course of that investigation, the police interviewed Petitioner at the police station. At that time, Petitioner disclosed that he had engaged in sexual contact with Randy on a number of occasions and, at the suggestion of the interrogating officer, he drafted a hand-written note to Randy apologizing for the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Petitioner was later arrested and charged in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County with the various sexual offenses we have mentioned. He filed a motion to suppress the oral and written statements that Detective McLaughlin obtained during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\n<em>The Motion Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Detective Patrick McLaughlin, a sixteen-year veteran of the police department with more than three years\u2019 experience in the child abuse unit, testified to the following at the hearing on the motion. Shortly after being assigned to investigate the case, he interviewed Randy, then twelve years old, at his home in Baltimore City. Following the interview, Detective McLaughlin suggested that Randy place a one-party consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>telephone call<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Petitioner, to \u201celicit some type of admission or acknowledgment that the abuse occurred.\u201d Randy and his mother agreed to make the phone call. The relevant portions of the call between Randy and Petitioner are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuW\">[Randy]: But you know I, I missed you and I wanted to call to say hi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">[Petitioner]: I miss you too. Oh my, God.

I just wanna let God do his work.

When Petitioner returned the call later that morning, Detective McLaughlin notified <em>him </em>that \u201chis name came up in an investigation\u201d and \u201cit wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d Detective McLaughlin asked Petitioner to come to the police station for an interview. Petitioner agreed to take part in the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>When Petitioner arrived at the police station he was greeted by Detective McLaughlin, who asked Petitioner to accompany him to the interview room. The interview room measured twelve feet long and six feet wide and contained three chairs and a table. Detective Tracy Morgan, who, like Detective McLaughlin, was dressed in business attire, assisted Detective McLaughlin in the interview. Both detectives secured their weapons in a lockbox outside of the interview room. The door to the interview room was closed but unlocked. Petitioner sat closest to the door, with the two detectives seated opposite him. The interview started at 11:30 a.m. and lasted \u201capproximately for a half an hour.\u201d Following the interview, Petitioner left the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Detective McLaughlin began the questioning by asking Petitioner \u201cif he knew why [Detective McLaughlin] had asked him to come to the office.\u201d Petitioner replied that \u201che was surprised that he received a call, but had a suspicion as to why [the detective] called him.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Detective McLaughlin advised Petitioner that the police had recorded the telephone call from Randy to Petitioner, during which Petitioner apologized to Randy for touching him inappropriately. Detective McLaughlin informed Petitioner that \u201cRandy and his mother did not want to see him get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology.\u201d He then questioned Petitioner about the frequency of the sexual encounters between Petitioner and the victim. Petitioner responded that he had \u201cmasturbated Randy\u201d on six occasions. Detective McLaughlin then suggested that Petitioner write an apology note to Randy and provided Petitioner with writing materials. Petitioner presented Detective McLaughlin with the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">Hi Randy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">I am very sorry for everything that happened between us, God knows! I wish this had never happened and it will never happen again. God is blessing both of us greatly and since we have forgiven each other, I know God has forgiven us to [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">/s/ Rev. Enoch Hill</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>At the conclusion of the interview, Detective McLaughlin informed Petitioner that the Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reviews all of the police department\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Petitioner, in turn, testified that he went voluntarily to the police station and was not threatened by the police before or during the interview. Moreover, he suspected at the time of the telephone call that it was being recorded, and he was aware at the time of the interview that people who sexually abuse children face criminal charges. Petitioner confirmed Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement that \u201cRandy and his mother did not want to see him get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology,\u201d adding that Detective McLaughlin had also said something like \u201cthey don\u2019t want to go through a long trial.\u201d Petitioner further testified that, when asked by Detective McLaughlin to \u201cjust write a letter,\u201d he did so because he is \u201ca minister, and all [he] wanted to do was have this over and not be brought to shame because of a lie.\u201d In addition, he believed supplying an apology letter \u201cwould just end the nightmare and what [he] was going through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The court heard arguments of counsel, then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">[I]n terms of the [statement by Detective McLaughlin concerning the victim\u2019s family\u2019s desire not to see Petitioner get into any trouble and to receive an apology], I think the detective was very careful in his questions. And [defense attorney], while it walks right up to the line of what appears to be an inducement, I think that the detective was extremely careful to make sure that the detective did not make any specific threats, promises or inducements of State action which would be the Police Department won\u2019t charge or the State\u2019s Attorney won\u2019t charge, or the detective would make sure that no charges take place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">And you know, when I consider the voluntariness of the statement, I have to look at the totality of the circumstances. The gentleman was invited there by way of a phone call. He went there on his own. He drove. The gentleman tells me that he knew that there were these allegations, and these possible charges. The gentleman told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>me that he believed his earlier phone call was recorded. The gentleman told us there were no threats. The detective indicates no weapons were present. He is not in uniform. There is no alcohol. It is not late at night. There is not extended questioning for 24 to 36 hours, like Prince George\u2019s County is well known for. The gentleman has a college degree. I don\u2019t think the officer implied that the State or the police, or anyone, would not prosecute. And I think he walked carefully to that line and never crossed the line. So the Court is going to deny the request to suppress the statements....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>The Trial and Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Petitioner was tried before a jury. The State introduced, among other evidence, the oral and written statements Petitioner gave to the police during the interview. As mentioned, the jury found Petitioner guilty of sexual abuse of a minor, second degree sexual offense, and unnatural or perverted sexual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued that the Circuit Court erred by denying his motion to suppress the oral and written statements because they were induced by Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement that the \u201cvictim\u2019s family did not want to see Petitioner get into any trouble and only wanted an apology\u201d for his sexual abuse of Randy. Petitioner relied on <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), and its progeny, <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 765 A.2d 97 (2001), and <em>Knight v. State, </em>381 Md. 517, 850 A.2d 1179 (2004). Those cases stand for the proposition that, if an accused is induced to make a statement in reliance on a law enforcement officer\u2019s express or implied assertion that the accused would receive some sort of special help or consideration in connection with a subsequent prosecution, then the accused\u2019s statement is deemed involuntary and therefore inadmissible at the accused\u2019s trial. <em>See, e.g., Knight, </em>381 Md. at 533-34, 850 A.2d at 1188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The State countered that Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement concerning the family\u2019s desire for an apology was not an improper inducement. The State focused on the facts that, during the interview, the detective did not expressly promise Petitioner that he would avoid criminal prosecution, and he informed Petitioner at the end of the interview that the Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reviews all of the police department\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, upheld the motion court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion. Based on its interpretation of <em>Hillard </em>and its progeny, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the motion court\u2019s reasoning that an improper inducement would have required an offer by Detective McLaughlin to dismiss the charges or otherwise assist Petitioner in the criminal case. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that, \u201c[ujnder the cases cited herein, including <em>Winder </em>and <em>Knight, </em>the evidence was sufficient to support the motions court\u2019s ruling.... Appellant may have believed that he was going to avoid prosecution, but he was never so informed by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cOnly voluntary confessions are admissible as evidence under Maryland law.\u201d <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 531, 850 A.2d at 1187. A confession is admissible only \u201cif it is freely and voluntarily made and the defendant making the confession knew and understood what he [or she] was saying....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531-32, 850 A.2d at 1187-88 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To be voluntary, a confession must satisfy federal and state constitutional strictures as well as the Maryland common law rule that a confession is involuntary if it is the product of an improper threat, promise, or inducement by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 850 A.2d at 1187-88. Petitioner relies only on the common law in support of the claim that his oral and written statements during the police-station interview should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cWhen a criminal defendant claims that his or her confession was involuntary because of a promise made to him or her by interrogating officers, the State must present evidence in order to refute the claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>850 A.2d at 1188; <em>see generally Taylor v. State, </em>388 Md. 385, 400-01, 879 A.2d 1074, 1083-84 (2005) (discussing improper inducements). The voluntariness of a confession is first litigated at a hearing on a motion to suppress the confession, at which the State must prove the voluntariness of the confession by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Knight, </em>381 Md. at 532, 850 A.2d at 1188. Courts that are asked to determine at a suppression hearing whether a confession was made voluntarily must examine the totality of the circumstances affecting the interrogation and the confession. <em>See id., </em>850 A.2d at 1188. A non-exhaustive list of factors to consider in that analysis includes the length of interrogation, the manner in which it was conducted, the number of police officers present throughout the interrogation, and the age, education, and experience of the suspect. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>375 Md. 404, 429, 825 A.2d 1078, 1092 (2003); <em>see also Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 596-97, 655 A.2d 370, 377-78 (1995) (listing additional factors to be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Although a totality of the circumstances analysis is standard practice for determining whether an accused\u2019s statement to the police was voluntarily made, not all of the factors that bear on voluntariness are of equal weight; certain factors are \u201ctranscendent and decisive.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>375 Md. at 429, 825 A.2d at 1092. Thus, \u201ca confession that is preceded or accompanied by threats or a promise of advantage will be held involuntary, notwithstanding any other factors that may suggest voluntariness, unless the State can establish that such threats or promises in no way induced the confession.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 533, 850 A.2d at 1188 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>375 Md. at 429, 825 A.2d at 1092-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Petitioner argues that the statements he gave during the interview were induced by the statement of Detective McLaughlin that \u201cRandy and his mother did not want to see [Petitioner] get into trouble, but they wanted an apology\u201d for what happened. Petitioner\u2019s argument triggers application of the principles outlined in <em>Hillard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In <em>Hillard, </em>we established a two-pronged test for determining whether a confession is the result of an improper inducement by law enforcement. Under that test, an inculpatory statement is involuntary and must be suppressed if: (1) any officer or agent of the police force promises or implies to a suspect that he will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession, and (2) the suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s explicit or implicit inducement. <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. \u201cBoth prongs of the <em>Hillard </em>test must be satisfied before a confession is deemed to be involuntary.\u201d <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310, 765 A.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test is an objective one. <em>See Winder, </em>362 Md. at 311, 765 A.2d at 116. In other words, when determining whether a police officer\u2019s conduct satisfies the first prong, the court must determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the accused would be moved to make an inculpatory statement upon hearing the officer\u2019s declaration; an accused\u2019s subjective belief that he will receive a benefit in exchange for a confession carries no weight under this prong. <em>See Knight, </em>381 Md. at 534, 850 A.2d at 1189. Ultimately, the court must determine \u201cwhether the interrogating officers or an agent of the police made a threat, promise, or inducement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>850 A.2d at 1189. The threat, promise, or inducement can be considered improper regardless whether it is express or implied. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 308, 765 A.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>If the suppression court finds that the law enforcement officer improperly induced the accused, then the second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test requires the court to determine whether the accused relied on that inducement in making the statement he or she seeks to suppress. <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420; <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 534, 850 A.2d at 1189. Specifically, the court must examine \u201cwhether there exists a causal nexus between the inducement and the statement....\u201d <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 534, 850 A.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The accused is not required, however, to prove his or her reliance on the improper inducement. Rather, the State bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused did not make the inculpatory statement in reliance on the improper inducement. <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420; <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310, 765 A.2d at 116. Factors relevant to the reliance analysis include the amount of time that elapsed between the improper inducement and the confession, <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 312, 765 A.2d at 117; whether any intervening factors, other than the officer\u2019s statement, could have caused the confession, <em>see id., </em>765 A.2d at 117; and the testimony of the accused at the suppression hearing related to the interrogation, <em>see Knight, </em>381 Md. at 535, 850 A.2d at 1189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether a confession was made voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 535, 850 A.2d at 1189 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The suppression court\u2019s ruling that a confession is voluntary is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, with credit given to the suppression court\u2019s first-level factual findings. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 310-11, 765 A.2d at 116. We review \u201cevidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion.... \u201d <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 375 n. 3, 993 A.2d 25, 33 n. 3 (2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). As mentioned, <em>see supra </em>note 1, appellate review of a suppression court\u2019s ruling is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the record developed at the suppression hearing. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 311, 765 A.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Petitioner contends that he was improperly induced to inculpate himself by Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement that \u201cRandy and his mother did not want to see [Petitioner] get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology\u201d for what happened. He argues in connection with the first prong of <em>Hillard </em>that he reasonably believed he could avoid criminal charges by making the inculpatory oral and written statements. Not surprisingly, the State responds that Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement did not constitute an improper inducement because the detective did not make an express or implicit promise either to assist Petitioner in avoiding prosecution or to dismiss any potential criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We have said that the first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test requires an objective analysis. The question, therefore, is whether a reasonable layperson in the position of Petitioner would have inferred from Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement that he could gain the advantage of non-prosecution or some other form of assistance, upon making an apology to the victim and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Detective McLaughlin, after informing Petitioner that he had recorded Petitioner\u2019s conversation with Randy, told Petitioner that the victim\u2019s family \u201cdid not want to see him get into any trouble, but they only wanted an apology.\u201d In this context, an objectively reasonable interpretation of the word \u201ctrouble,\u201d is trouble with the law. <em>See Biscoe v. Maryland, </em>67 Md. 6, 8-9, 8 A. 571, 571 (1887) (stating that the detective\u2019s telling the accused \u201cto tell the truth [] and have no more trouble about it\u201d was an inducement \u201cof the strongest kind\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Moreover, a reasonable layperson in Petitioner\u2019s position, hearing Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement, would not necessarily understand that the State could prosecute him or her, even against the wishes of the victim or victim\u2019s family. To the contrary, it is reasonable for a layperson in that position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>infer from the officer\u2019s statement that the victim\u2019s family, upon receipt of an apology, would either recommend to the prosecutor that criminal charges not be pursued or decline to participate in any prosecution. We therefore conclude that Petitioner had an objectively reasonable belief, based on the detective\u2019s statement, that by making an inculpatory statement that included an apology to the victim\u2019s family he might avoid criminal charges or, at the least, lessen the likelihood of a successful criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">To be sure, Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement in this case differs from the statements we have held in previous cases to be improper inducements under the <em>Hillard </em>test. Here, the detective implied that the victim and his family, not the interrogating officer, would assist Petitioner in avoiding prosecution. Our previous cases involved promises made by the interrogating officers to exercise their own discretion or tell prosecutors to exercise their discretion in favor of the accused. In <em>Hillard, </em>we held that a detective improperly induced the suspect to make a statement by promising that he would \u201cgo to bat\u201d for the suspect with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and the court. 286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. Similarly, in <em>Winder, </em>we held that a detective improperly induced the accused to make a statement by saying, \u201cI can make a promise, okay? I can help you. I could try to protect you.\u201d 362 Md. at 314, 317, 765 A.2d at 118, 120. We reasoned in <em>Winder </em>that the interrogating officer \u201coffered [the suspect] an apparent means to garner leniency from the state prosecutors and the trial court and protection from an angry mob.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>317, 765 A.2d at 120. And in <em>Knight </em>we held that the statement, \u201cif down the line, after this case comes to an end, we\u2019ll see what the State\u2019s Attorney can do for you, with your case, with your charges,\u201d was an improper inducement because it was \u201cclearly a promise [by the interrogating officer] to exercise advocacy on Knight\u2019s behalf to convince the prosecutor to exercise discretion in Knight\u2019s favor.\u201d 381 Md. at 537, 850 A.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We disagree with the State, however, that only statements offering or implying the officer\u2019s assistance in avoiding prosecution qualify as inducements under <em>Hillard </em>and its progeny. The thrust of the <em>Hillard </em>test is to ensure that an incriminating remark is \u201cfree of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u201d <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d at 418. \u201cCoercive barnacles\u201d can take many forms and are not limited to instances in which interrogating officers promise <em>their </em>assistance to the accused. Thus, it is of no consequence that Detective McLaughlin neither promised nor suggested that he would help Petitioner avoid prosecution. It matters only that Detective McLaughlin promised or suggested such assistance by one or more persons who, from the perspective of a layperson in Petitioner\u2019s position, could reasonably provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">This case differs significantly from <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), upon which the State relies. In <em>Reynolds, </em>we held that a detective\u2019s statement to the accused that telling the truth about a molestation would \u201chelp\u201d the accused\u2019s daughter was not an improper inducement because the detective implied merely a collateral benefit unrelated to the possibility of a criminal prosecution. 327 Md. at 511-12, 610 A.2d at 790-91. Here, by contrast, the detective, by informing Petitioner that the victim\u2019s family \u201cdid not want to see him get into trouble, but they only wanted an apology,\u201d implied a direct benefit to Petitioner that he could avoid criminal prosecution by making inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Turning to the second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test, we conclude that the State failed to meet its burden of showing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence, that Petitioner\u2019s inculpatory statements were not made in reliance on Detective McLaughlin\u2019s improper inducement. Petitioner testified at the suppression hearing that \u201call he wanted to do was have this over and not be brought to shame over a lie,\u201d and that he was under the impression that confessing would \u201cjust end this nightmare.\u201d That testimony reflects Petitioner\u2019s belief that providing the inculpatory statements and an apology would end the matter without criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The State characterizes Petitioner\u2019s testimony as \u201cself serving.\u201d Self-serving though Petitioner\u2019s testimony may have been, the suppression court gave no indication that the testimony was unworthy of belief. Detective McLaughlin\u2019s testimony, moreover, did nothing to suggest the contrary. In any event, it was up to the State, at the time of the suppression hearing, to persuade the court that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not to be believed. The State did not even attempt to do so, in effect abandoning any argument that, assuming an improper inducement, Petitioner\u2019s subsequent statement was not made in reliance on it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Furthermore, the State has not pointed to any facts suggesting that the taint of the improper inducement was cured by intervening attenuating circumstances, as was the case in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>348 Md. 337, 703 A.2d 1267 (1998). In <em>Johnson, </em>we held that the State had established that the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements were not the result of reliance on improper inducements because the defendant confessed two days after the inducements; he confessed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>location different from the one in which the inducements were made; he initiated contact -with the police officer to whom he confessed; and he confessed to an officer who was not present at the time of the inducements and who did not offer any other inducements. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 703 A.2d at 1275. In contrast to the facts presented in <em>Johnson, </em>Petitioner made the inculpatory statements directly to Detective McLaughlin on the heels of the detective\u2019s offering the inducement, in the midst of an interrogation that was prompted by the detective\u2019s request that Petitioner come to the police station to be interviewed. The timing of Petitioner\u2019s inculpatory statements and the lack of any intervening attenuating events further support the conclusion that Petitioner relied on Detective McLaughlin\u2019s inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s arguments that Petitioner did not rely on the inducement because Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement \u201cpromised him nothing whatsoever\u201d and merely restated what the victim had already requested from Petitioner via telephone, that is, an apology. For all the reasons we have discussed, we reject the first of these arguments. As for the second, it is one thing for Randy to request Petitioner\u2019s apology in a recorded telephone conversation. It is entirely another for Detective McLaughlin, in a formal police interview setting, to request an apology on behalf of the family, while stating in the same breath that the family does not want to see Petitioner get into any trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In sum, we hold that both prongs of the <em>Hillard </em>test are satisfied, rendering involuntary Petitioner\u2019s oral and written statements to Detective McLaughlin. The suppression court erred when it determined that those statements were admissible at trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court with directions to reverse the judgments of conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF ANNE ARUNDEL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>COUNTY AND REMAND FOR A NEW TRIAL.

In deciding that issue, we are limited to the facts that were developed at the hearing on Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the statements. <em>Longshore v.

If the State satisfies that burden and the motion to suppress is denied, then the confession is admissible at trial.

The dissent by Judge Harrell bases in part its conclusion that Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement was not an improper inducement on the fact that the detective informed Petitioner that the State\u2019s Attorney made all charging decisions. 418 Md. 62, 12 A.3d 1193 (2011) (Harrell, J., dissenting). The dissent overlooks, however, that Detective McLaughlin testified at the suppression hearing that he informed Petitioner of that fact at the end of the interview, only <em>after </em>Petitioner had provided the inculpatory statements. Consequently, Detective McLaughlin\u2019s statement concerning the charging decision is of no relevance either to whether the detective earlier made an improper inducement or to whether Petitioner relied on that inducement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. For this reason, we reject the State\u2019s contention that, because the suppression court did not reach the second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test, the only relief to which Petitioner is entitled is a limited remand for the suppression court's consideration of the reliance prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test. Our cases make plain that, when a defendant testifies that the police used coercive tactics to obtain inculpatory statements, the State must rebut the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 532, 850 A.2d at 1188; <em>Gill v.

The verbal guile exhibited by Detective McLaughlin in his thirty-minute questioning of Hill, which followed Hill\u2019s recorded telephone conversation with the victim, did not cross the line into the prohibited territory of promises, threats, or inducements, such as would render Hill\u2019s interview statements involuntary under Maryland common law principles. The suppression judge and the Court of Special Appeals got it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">During cross-examination of Hill at the suppression hearing, Hill<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> acknowledged that he apologized to the victim in the recorded telephone call, a fact that he was reminded of, with no surprise, by the Detective at the inception of the face-to-face interview. Hill admitted that McLaughlin never said \u201cThis [apology] will end it [the police investigation],\u201d and conceded that he understood that persons who commit sex crimes against children usually get arrested and charged criminally.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">During oral argument at the suppression hearing, defense trial counsel emphasized as the improper inducement McLaughlin\u2019s statement to Hill that \u201cRandy and his mother did not want to see [Hill] get into trouble; they only wanted an apology.\u201d Predicated on this, the defense asserted that Hill believed that \u201call he needed to do was make an apology and that would end the case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing judge saw it otherwise, as revealed in the following exchange with defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>[The Court]: Suppose the officer said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure this case ends if you apologize.\u201d What do you think of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">[Defense Counsel]: I think that would be the same, and just stronger, for Mr. Hill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">[The Court]: You don\u2019t see it as more of a dividing line? I mean, suppose the officer tells him, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019d want to reconcile with your God. It may help you in terms of your relationships [sic] with your God if you apologized,\u201d and at that point the gentleman says, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I want to apologize.\u201d Is that an improper inducement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">[Defense Counsel]: No, that is different because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">[The Court]: Okay. How is that different from say, \u201cIf you apologize, you\u2019ll make the world well between you and your God, and if you apologize, you\u2019ll make the world well between you and the victim\u201d? Where is the promise that the detective is making him that with the apology will come the inducement which is, no prosecution, dismissal of the charges, or something like that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The court noted further that \u201cthe detective is not saying, T will make sure you don\u2019t get in trouble.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, it was made clear to Hill by McLaughlin, in the course of the interview, that only the State\u2019s Attorney would or could make any charging decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u201cA mere exhortation to tell the truth is not enough to make a statement involuntary.\u201d <em>Reynolds v.

State, </em>381 Md. 517, 525, 535, 850 A.2d 1179, 1183, 1190 (2004), the officer told the accused, in the course of administering <em>Miranda </em>advisements, that the \u201cprosecutor would be made aware of his cooperation.\u201d This was found by us to be \u201cnot a promise of help or special consideration.... \u201d <em>Knight, </em>381 Md. at 535, 850 A.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">I would conclude that Detective McLaughlin\u2019s relevant statement to Hill fell on the continuum leading to improper inducements well short of the point of no return. Rather, a mere exhortation appealing to a suspect\u2019s shame, such that he or she should apologize to a victim (and his/her family), amounts to no more than the mere exhortation to tell the truth found by our cases not to be improper. The tension between the true \u201ccoercive barnacles\u201d described in <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 150, 406 A.2d 415, 418 (1979), and the permissive appeals to a suspect approved in <em>Reynolds, Ball, Ralph, </em>and <em>Knight </em>is maintained best by affirming here the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA (pronounced Ba-tal-ia) and Judge MURPHY authorize me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissent.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\">.

This is the response of a \u201creasonable lay person,\u201d as claimed by the Majority opinion? Please!</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\">. The Majority opinion (at 79 n. 4, 12 A.3d at 1203 n.4) suggests that McLaughlin advised Hill about the State's Attorney\u2019s role \"only after Petitioner had provided the inculpatory statements.\u201d The record, I think, is not so clear as the Majority maintains. McLaughlin, during cross-examination at the suppression hearing, stated: \"I told him at the end of the interview that our State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reviews all of our cases.\u201d In the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case, however, the panel stated that \u201d[t]he questioning ended with [Hill], at the detective\u2019s request, writing the following \"apology\u201d letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">Hi Randy [the victim]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">I am very sorry for everything that happened between us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>God knows!

Enoch Hill /s/</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Thus, one reasonable interpretation of the record is that McLaughlin advised Hill of the State's Attorney's role <em>before </em>Hill wrote out the inculpatory written statement. Whatever interpretation of this point one adopts is not so material as would change my view of the proper disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>MURPHY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arb\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">While I join Judge Harrell\u2019s dissenting opinion, I would also affirm the judgment on the well settled ground that an incriminating statement made subsequent to an improper inducement is nonetheless admissible <em>if </em>the trier of fact is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the inducement did not, in any way, cause the defendant to make the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In the case at bar, before being told about what the victim allegedly wanted, Petitioner was well aware that (1) the officers had \u201ctaped\u201d his telephone conversation with the victim, and (2) he had made incriminating statements during his interrogation. Under these circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner\u2019s -written apology was not made in reliance upon the officer\u2019s statement about what the victim allegedly wanted, but rather in a strategic effort to avoid criminal charges. I would therefore hold that, although Petitioner was entitled to a jury instruction to the effect that the jurors must \u201cdisregard the apology unless you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the inducement did not in any way cause the defendant to make the apology,\u201d Petitioner (who did not request such an instruction) was not entitled to exclusion of his apology.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
