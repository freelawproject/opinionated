Insurance Co. v. P.T.P. Inc., </em>331 Md. 406, 628 A.2d 223 (1993). As the trial judge observed, this involves \u201cquite a workout.\u201d Sherwood Brands, Inc. (\u201cSherwood\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County \u2014 granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee, Great American Insurance Company (\u201cGreat American\u201d) \u2014 concluding that Great American acted properly in denying coverage under a third-party liability policy it issued Sherwood because Sherwood neglected to notify Great American of claims made against Sherwood within ninety days of the expiration of the policy period, as the policy required. Great American\u2019s entitlement to judgment was not dependent on it demonstrating how it may have been prejudiced by Sherwood\u2019s tardy notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We hold that, for reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>pursuant to Maryland Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Insurance Article \u00a7 19-110 (\u201cDisclaimers of coverage on liability policies\u201d), which provides that \u201c[a]n insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured ... has breached the policy ... by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes ... that the lack of ... notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer,\u201d Great American is required to demonstrate how it was prejudiced by Sherwood\u2019s late-bestowed notice. This is so notwithstanding that the policy at issue is a \u201cclaims-made policy.\u201d Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand the case to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Sherwood,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a North Carolina corporation with its principal office in Rockville, Maryland, is a manufacturer of confections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and specialty gifts. Great American issued Sherwood a series of annual \u201cDirectors\u2019, Officers\u2019, Insured Entity and Employment Practices Liability Insurance\u201d policies, the most relevant one of which (Policy DOL5741758) was effective 1 May 2007 to 1 May 2008 (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). Section I of the Policy, \u201cInsuring Agreements,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">A. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Insured Persons all Loss which the Insured Persons shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a Claim ... first made against the Insured Persons during the Policy Period ... for a Wrongful Act, except for any Loss which the Company actually pays as indemnification</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">B. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Company all Loss which the Insured Persons shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a Claim ... first made against the Insured Persons during the Policy Period or the Discovery Period for a Wrongful Act, but only to the extent the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify the Insured Persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">C. The Insurer shall pay on behalf of the Insured Entity all Loss which the Insured Entity shall be legally obligated to pay as a result of a Securities Claim first made against the Insured entity during the Policy Period or the Discovery Period for a Wrongful Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Section III of the Policy, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">A. \u201cClaim\u201d shall mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">(1) a written demand for monetary or non-monetary relief made against any Insured and reported to the Insurer ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">(2) a civil, criminal, administrative or arbitration proceeding made against any Insured seeking monetary or non-monetary relief and commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading, the return of an indictment, or the receipt or filing of notice of charges or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>similar document, including any proceeding initiated against any Insured before the [EEOC] or any similar governmental body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Finally, Section VIII, \u201cNotice of Claim,\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">A. The Insureds shall, as a condition precedent to their rights under this Policy, give the Insurer notice in writing of any Claim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">(1) as defined in Section III.A.(1) which is made during the Policy Period. Such notice shall be given prior to the end of the Policy Period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">(2) as defined in Section III.A.(2) <em>[supra </em>] which is made during the Policy Period. Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the end of the Policy Period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">On 11 December 2007, one Gerald D. Koelsch filed claims against Sherwood and its subsidiaries with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, alleging breach of contract, wrongful termination, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, fraudulent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He filed a related complaint in the Plymouth County (Massachusetts) Superior Court on 28 March 2008 against Sherwood and its subsidiaries, asserting similar counts and related statutory violations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We treat as undisputed for the purposes of this opinion that both of these actions were filed and served on Sherwood during the time period that the 2007-08 Policy was in effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sherwood did not notify Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>American of the Koelsch claims until 27 October 2008, a date concededly greater than ninety days after the expiration date of the Policy (1 May 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On 26 November 2008, Barbara Bryan (\u201cBryan\u201d), a Senior Claims Attorney with Great American, wrote to Sherwood, explaining why the insurer denied coverage for the Koelsch claim. Although the Massachusetts lawsuit \u201cconstitutes an action as defined under the policy\u201d and the \u201cClaim made date is ... within the May 1, 2007 \u2014 May 1, 2008 Policy Period,\u201d Bryan pointed to Section VIII.A. of the policy \u2014 the ninety-day notice requirement \u2014 and explained that, because the Policy ended on 1 May 2008 and Great American did not receive notice of the suit until 27 October 2008, \u201cthere is no coverage for this Claim under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Meanwhile, across the globe, on 17 October 2007, Plastic Magen Ltd. and Plasto Kit Ltd. filed suit (unrelated to the Koelsch suit) against Sherwood, its officers, and other entities in the Tel-Aviv Jaffo (Israel) District Court, alleging breach of contract, \u201cdeceit and conspiracy,\u201d \u201clack of good faith,\u201d \u201cillegal enrichment process,\u201d \u201cfalse presentation,\u201d and other counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties to the present case agree that service of process on Sherwood was made in the Israeli suit sometime in December 2007, and thus it appears undisputed that notice of this action was filed against and served on Sherwood during the effective period of the 2007-08 Policy. Sherwood notified Great American of this suit on 6 November 2008, a date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>conceded again to be greater than ninety days following the expiration date of the 2007-08 Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Bryan wrote again to Sherwood, on 16 December 2008, explaining the insurer\u2019s denial of coverage of the claim represented by the Israeli lawsuit. As with the Massachusetts suit, Great American conceded that the Israeli lawsuit is a \u201cClaim made within the May 1, 2007 \u2014 May 1, 2008 Policy Period,\u201d but denied coverage because notice to Great American of the claim was not given until 6 November 2008, more than ninety days after the end of the 2007-08 Policy. Bryan continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">In acknowledging the tendering of this matter would involve a late notice issue, you mentioned having previously litigated the issue in Maryland, winning a case now cited on the late notice-prejudice issue. I have had the opportunity to view the case you mentioned,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] which unfortunately is inapplicable to the Great American policy at issue, as your previous litigation involved your general liability carrier and did not involve a claims made a reported Director and Officers policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On 10 February 2009, Sherwood, its officers and subsidiaries filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, a \u201cComplaint for Breach of Contract and Declaratory Relief\u2019 against Great American, alleging that the Massachusetts and Israeli actions were \u201cclaims\u201d under the 2007-08 Policy and Great American breached the Policy when it \u201crefused to pay any losses Plaintiffs may or are obligated to pay as a result of the lawsuit filed by Mr. Koelsch and the law suit filed by Plastic Magen Ltd. and Plasto Kit Ltd.\u201d Sherwood also averred, regarding the Massachusetts and Israeli actions, that Great American \u201chas not been prejudiced by any alleged delay in notification. No relevant documents have been lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>or destroyed. No known witnesses are missing. No evidence has been lost or destroyed. No adverse rulings have [been] obtained in the underlying suit for wrongful termination.\u201d Accordingly, Sherwood requested the Circuit Court enter a judgment declaring that Great American \u201cis obligated to pay all losses the Plaintiffs become legally obligated to pay in the underlying suit[s]\u201d and that Sherwood \u201cis obligated to pay all costs incurred in bringing this Complaint for Breach of Contract and Declaratory Relief____\u201d Joined with its complaint, Sherwood filed a motion for summary judgment, urging arguments similar to those it makes to this Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In its answer, Great American denied that it breached the policies with Sherwood, and denied that the respective notices of the Massachusetts and Israeli actions were timely. Further, Great American tendered twenty affirmative defenses, only one of which is relevant to the present appeal: \u201cCoverage for the Underlying Actions under the 2007[-08] Policy is barred due to [Sherwood\u2019s] failure to give written notice to Great American as soon as practicable and no later than within ninety (90) days after the end of the Policy Period.\u201d Shortly after filing its answer, on 22 May 2009, Great American filed an opposition to Sherwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and a cross-motion for summary judgment, advancing arguments similar to those it offers to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On 14 July 2009, the Circuit Court heard oral argument on the motions. Denying Sherwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Great American\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">[I]t all turns on what type of policy this is going to be construed to be, whether it\u2019s a straight'-up claims made, or is it a claims made with a reporting period. If it is the latter, then the insurance company would have to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>actual prejudice for the late notice before it would not have to pay benefits under the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">But here, in section 8 of the actual policy, it says \u201cThe insureds shall, as a condition precedent to their rights under the policy, give the insurer notice in writing of any claim.\u201d In this case we drop down to 2, as defined in, it\u2019s actually a civil proceeding, \u201cwhich is made during the policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201cSuch notice shall be given as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the end of the policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">So I base my decision based on that section. And I find that this particular policy is analogous to the policy that was construed in the <em>[T.H.E. Ins. Co. v. P.T.P. Inc., </em>331 Md. 406, 628 A.2d 223 (1993) ] case. And so I find that the policy, the Great American policy in question here is a claims made with reporting period, and therefore that the defendant is not required to show actual prejudice to deny coverage for claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">So bottom line is I am granting the defendant, Great American Insurance Company\u2019s, cross-motion for summary judgment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Sherwood noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On our initiative, we issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Sherwood Brands v. Great American Ins., </em>415 Md. 114, 999 A.2d 179 (2010), before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal, to consider \u201cwhether the lower court erred by ruling that [Great American] was not required by Section 19-110 of the [Maryland] Insurance Code to show actual prejudice in order to deny coverage based on the [Sherwood]\u2019s failure to comply with the notice condition of the 2007[-08] insurance policy at issue____\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is <em>de novo, </em>that is, whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions were legally correct. Under this standard, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the law, considering the same material from the record and deciding the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u201d <em>Messing v. Bank of America, N.A., </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22, 28 (2003) (internal citations omitted); <em>see Tyler v. City of College Park, </em>415 Md. 475, 498, 3 A.3d 421, 434 (2010) (\u201cWhether a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is proper in a particular case is a question of law, subject to a non-deferential review on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">I. Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Insurance Article \u00a7 19-110: Its Origin and Application</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The first seed, leading ultimately to the development of Md.Code (1997, 2006 RepLVol.), Insurance Art., \u00a7 19-110, was sown in <em>Watson v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 189 A.2d 625 (1963). In <em>Watson, </em>the carrier issued an insurance policy to an individual, Watson, that \u201crequired the insured, as a condition precedent, to give written notice of an accident to the insurer \u2018as soon as practicable\u2019 following an accident.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>231 Md. at 269, 189 A.2d at 626. Watson was involved in an automobile accident on 5 March 1961, but did not notify the insurer until 8 April 1961. A few days later, the insurance company informed Watson that, \u201cin view of the fact that prompt notice of the accident had not been given to it,\u201d it denied the claim. <em>Watson, </em>231 Md. at 270, 189 A.2d at 626. On appeal, the insured argued \u201cthat the modern view which holds that the insurer must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>actual prejudice in order to be relieved of its obligations under a policy is clearly the better view, and the one now being followed by a majority of jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>231 Md. at 272,189 A.2d at 627. The Court, rejecting Watson\u2019s argument that \u201ceven though the notice condition ... involved is a condition precedent, it is unavailable to the Company as a denial of liability ... unless the Company was prejudiced by the failure to give prompt notice,\u201d held that \u201c[t]his contention is not in accord with the Maryland decisions, nor with the weight of authority elsewhere in the country,\u201d holding ultimately that, because the insured did not contest that he had not given notice \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d the insurer was within its rights to deny coverage. <em>Id.; see Prince George\u2019s County v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. 162, 181, 879 A.2d 81, 93 (2005) (\u201cIn <em>Watson, </em>we held that an insurer need not show prejudice in order to deny coverage to an insured who breached the notice provision of an insurance policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The Legislature\u2019s response to <em>Watson </em>was prompt and decisive. At the legislative session immediately following <em>Watson, </em>the General Assembly enacted former Maryland Code (1957, 1972 RepLVol.), Article 48A, \u00a7 482. <em>See </em>Chapter 185 of the Acts of 1964; <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 181, 879 A.2d at 92-93 (\u201cIn passing the statute, the Legislature apparently aimed to abrogate the common law rule as articulated in Watson____\u201d); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins., Co. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 352, 554 A.2d 404, 416 (1989) (\u201cSection 482 ... appears to have been enacted to remedy the harsh result of the <em>Watson </em>case.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Following a 1966 amendment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u00a7 482 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Disclaimer of coverage because of lack of notice or cooperation from insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">Where any insurer seeks to disclaim coverage on any policy of liability insurance issued by it, on the ground that the insured or anyone claiming the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving requisite notice to the insurer, such disclaimer shall be effective only if the insurer establishes, by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that such lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">One commentator offered three potential reasons the General Assembly moved so quickly responding to <em>Watson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">First, an aura of unfairness emanates from a situation in which an insurance company is permitted to disclaim liability when it is not prejudiced by the insured\u2019s breach of a condition precedent. In such a situation, the insurer receives an unjustifiable windfall. Second, the <em>Watson </em>rule allows an unreasonable forfeiture by permitting the insurer\u2019s assertion of a technical irregularity to deny protection for which the insured has paid. Finally, allowing an insurer to disclaim liability has the undesirable effect of leaving victims of automobile accidents uncompensated by their paid-for insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em>A Legal Process Analysis for a Statutory and Contractual Construction of Notice and Proof of Loss Insurance Disclaimers, </em>38 Md. L.Rev. 299, 309-10 (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Chronologically, the next case shaping Maryland\u2019s modern notice-prejudice jurisprudence is <em>House, supra. </em>In <em>House, </em>an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>insurer issued a \u201cphysicians and surgeons professional liability policy\u201d providing that \u201c[a] claim is made on the date you <em>first </em>report an incident or injury to us or our agent.\u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 331, 554 A.2d at 405. House had a series of annual policies the last of which ended on 1 January 1986. <em>See House, </em>315 Md. at 330, 554 A.2d at 405. Allegedly, House performed surgery on a patient and left part of a needle in her knee; St. Paul, however, declined to defend House, claiming that it did not receive notice of the claim until February 1986, after the policy had expired. <em>See House, </em>315 Md. at 331, 554 A.2d at 405-06. \u201cWe granted certiorari ... to determine whether \u00a7 482 applies when an insurer asserts that there is no coverage under a \u2018claims made\u2019 policy because the claim was not made while the policy was in effect.\u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 330, 554 A.2d at 405. Ultimately, we declined to reach that question, holding instead that the \u201cissue arises only if the policy here involved is construed as the insurer contends .... [but], we do not accept the policy construction on which the insurer\u2019s argument is premised.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Although the Court could not have known it at the time, in advancing Maryland\u2019s notice-prejudice jurisprudence, of greater significance in <em>House </em>was Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy\u2019s dissent, which was joined by Judges McAuliffe and Blackwell. The dissent began by disagreeing with the Majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that the policy was ambiguous as to when a claim was made; in his view, \u201c[i]t is ... clear that reporting is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>prerequisite to coverage____\u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 342, 554 A.2d at 411 (Murphy, C.J., dissenting).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The dissent proffered potential policy rationales for the adoption of approaches, like Maryland\u2019s, requiring insurers denying coverage of claims for reasons related to notice deficiencies to make a showing of prejudice. <em>See House, </em>315 Md. at 345-47, 554 A.2d at 412-13. First, the dissent noted that many \u201ccourts have found that the strict contractual condition precedent approach creates a forfeiture,\u201d explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">[Although the policy may speak of the notice provision in terms of \u201ccondition precedent,\u201d ... nonetheless what is involved is a forfeiture, for the carrier seeks, on account of a breach of that provision, to deny the insured the very thing paid for.... Thus viewed, it becomes unreasonable to read the provision unrealistically or to find that the carrier may forfeit the coverage, even though there is no likelihood that it was prejudiced by the breach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 345, 554 A.2d at 413 (quoting <em>Cooper v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>51 N.J. 86, 237 A.2d 870, 873-74 (1968)). Second, the dissent explained that another rationale \u201cis based upon the purpose and function of the notice provision\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">The purpose of a policy provision requiring notice of an accident or loss to be given within a certain time is to give the insurer an opportunity to acquire, through an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>investigation, full information about the circumstances of the case, on the basis of which, it can proceed to disposition, either through settlement or defense of the claim____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">[A] reasonable notice clause is designed to protect the insurance company from being placed in a substantially less favorable position than it would have been in had timely notice been provided, e.g., being forced to pay a claim against which it has not had an opportunity to defend effectively. In short, the function of a notice requirement is to protect the insurance company\u2019s interests from being prejudiced. Where the insurance company\u2019s interests have not been harmed by a late notice, even in the absence of extenuating circumstances to excuse the tardiness, the reason behind the notice condition in the policy is lacking, and it follows neither logic nor fairness to relieve the insurance company of its obligations under the policy in such a situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 346-47, 554 A.2d at 413 (quoting <em>Brakeman v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>472 Pa. 66, 371 A.2d 193, 197 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In addition to offering potential policy reasons undergirding the Legislature\u2019s passage of former \u00a7 482, Chief Judge Murphy explained the distinction between \u201coccurrence\u201d policies and \u201cclaims-made\u201d policies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Coverage in an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy is provided no matter when the claim is made, subject, of course, to contractual and statutory notice and limitations of actions provisions, providing the act complained of occurred during the policy period. Because the insurer\u2019s liability in such policies ordinarily relates to a definite, easily identifiable and notorious event such as an automobile accident, a fire, a slip and fall injury, or a ship collision, the insurer is ordinarily able to conduct a prompt investigation of the incident and make an early assessment of related injuries and damages with the result that actuarial considerations permit relative certainty in estimating loss ratios, establishing reserves, and fixing premium rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 349, 554 A.2d at 414 (quoting <em>Stine v.

Occurrence policies differ from claims-made policies, the latter of which are \u201cof relatively recent origin and were developed primarily to deal with situations in which the negligent act is difficult to pinpoint and may have occurred over an extended period of time.\u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 349, 554 A.2d at 414. Regarding claims-made policies, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">[T]he error or omission may be a discrete act or failure to act, or it may consist of a lengthy process and remain latent and undiscoverable for a number of years. Examples include a physician\u2019s misdiagnosis, an attorney\u2019s fraudulent concealment, or an architect\u2019s defective design. From an underwriting perspective, occurrence policies are unrealistic for such risks because of the long or open \u2018tail\u2019 exposure which results. When the \u2018event\u2019 intended to be covered cannot easily be fixed and the liability for the consequent injury extends long into the future, often well after expiration of the policy, considerations of inflation, upward spiraling jury awards, and legislative and judicial adoption of newly developing concepts of tort law mean that actuarial factors, including fixing premium rates and establishing adequate reserves, are highly speculative. The result, logically, is the establishment of a premium rate schedule sufficiently high to accommodate \u2018worst scenario\u2019 jury verdicts returned years after the error, omission, or negligent act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 349-50, 554 A.2d at 414-15 (quoting <em>Stine, </em>349 N.W.2d at 131).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The dissent de-constructed claims-made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>policies even further, distinguishing between \u201cpure\u201d claims-made policy, and \u201creporting-type\u201d claims-made policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">So-called \u201cpure\u201d claims made policies generally define \u201cclaims' made\u201d as all claims brought against the insured within the policy period.

The policy may also be of a \u201creporting\u201d type, defining \u201cclaims made\u201d as all claims made against the insurer by the insured during the policy period. Thus, the claim made against the insurer is the event invoking coverage in a \u201creporting\u201d type of claims made policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 350-51, 554 A.2d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Chief Judge Murphy applied the aforementioned principles to former \u00a7 482 and the insurance policy in <em>House. </em>First, the dissent disagreed with the majority\u2019s determination that the policy was ambiguous as to when a claim is made, concluding that \u201c[i]t is ... clear that reporting is a prerequisite to coverage----\u201d Regarding whether \u00a7 482 applied to the policy, Chief Judge Murphy explained that, although \u00a7 482 states that it applies to \u201cany policy of liability insurance,\u201d the statute only <em>\u201cpotentially </em>applies to \u2018any\u2019 liability insurer or policy,\u201d considering that \u201cthe statute [also] requires that the basis for the disclaimer or denial of coverage be that \u2018the insured has <em>breached </em>the policy ... by not giving the requisite notice to the insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 355, 554 A.2d at 417 (emphasis in original). The dissent framed next the possibly penultimate or even dispositive question as whether \u00a7 482 applied to the policy in <em>House: </em>\u201cThe fundamental question now is whether, at the time [House] reported the ... claim, there existed a contract between the parties, <em>for one cannot breach a contract </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>which is not in existence </em>.... \u201d <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 355-56, 554 A.2d at 418 (emphasis added). As the dissent explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJe\">To answer this question, I look again to the nature of claims made and occurrence policies. Both types of policies include provisions which define (1) the events for which coverage is provided and (2) when and how coverage can be initiated. For example, an occurrence policy has a fixed time period defining what specific events or occurrences will be covered. When this time period ends, however, the insurer\u2019s responsibilities under the policy do not end, for it may be held liable for the covered events, barring statutes of limitations, at any time thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">Claims made policies are almost the mirror image of occurrence policies in that they often cover claims based on events which occurred many years before the policy came into effect, but limit the scope of coverage to claims based on these events which are made within the limited time period of the policy. Unlike the occurrence policy, the insurer\u2019s potential liability ends when the policy expires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Therefore, <em>when the claims made policy at issue here expired there was nothing left. The policy could not be breached because there was no longer a policy to be breached. Any claim made after its expiration is of the same effect as an accident or event which occurs after the \u201cexpiration\u201d of an occurrence policy. There was no breach; there was simply no coverage. I therefore think that \u00a7 482 is inapplicable to a \u201creporting\u201d type of claims made policy when the claim is made after the expiration of the policy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoU\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 356, 554 A.2d at 418 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">For clarity purposes, we think it important to restate Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s \u201choldings,\u201d had he been writing for a majority of the Court at the time. First: In a \u201cpure\u201d claims-made policy, a claim is \u201cmade\u201d when a claim (typically a lawsuit) is brought against the insured during the policy period. Second: In a \u201creporting-type\u201d claims-made policy, a claim is \u201cmade\u201d when, in addition to a claim being brought against the insured during the policy period, the insured reports or notifies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>insurer of the claim made against the insured. Third: In a claims-made policy, there can be no breach of the policy where a claim is \u201cmade\u201d after the policy\u2019s expiration (whether by (1) the insured having a claim filed against it during the policy period, as in a \u201cpure\u201d claims-made policy, or, (2) the insured having reported or notified the claim lodged against the insured to the insurer, as in a \u201creporting-type\u201d claims-made policy) as one cannot \u201cbreach\u201d a policy that is no longer in existence. Fourth: In a claims-made policy, then, where a claim is \u201cmade\u201d after the policy expiration, \u00a7 482 does not apply to require the insurer to show prejudice, as the statute, on its face, applies only when an \u201cinsured has breached the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The importance of the dissent in <em>House </em>became manifest four years later in <em>T.H.E. Insurance Co. v. P.T.P. Inc., </em>331 Md. 406, 407, 628 A.2d 223, 223 (1993), in which \u201cwe applied], in substance, the analysis presented in Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s dissent in <em>House.\u201d </em>In <em>T.H.E., </em>P.T.P., the owner of a go-kart track, was insured by T.H.E. under a claims-made comprehensive general liability policy running from 2 April 1987 to 2 April 1988, and which required P.T.P. to \u201csee to it that [T.H.E.] receive \u2022written notice of the claim as soon as practicable,\u201d and that included a \u201cBasic Extended Reporting Period\u201d of sixty days. <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 412, 628 A.2d at 225-26. Importantly, the policy provided that \u201c[a] claim ... seeking damages will be considered to have been made <em>when written notice of such claim is received and recorded by </em>[T.H.E.]....\u201d <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 411-12, 628 A.2d at 225 (emphasis added). A patron was injured at P.T.P.\u2019s track on 27 August 1987. On 6 June 1988 \u2014 after the policy and the sixty-day extended reporting period expired \u2014 counsel for the injured patron made a claim against P.T.P. for damages. <em>See T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 408-09, 628 A.2d at 223-24. T.H.E., upon learning of the claim against P.T.P., denied coverage of the claim. <em>See T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 409, 628 A.2d at 224. P.T.P. filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, arguing that T.H.E. had a duty to defend and indemnify against the patron\u2019s claim. The Circuit Court declared that the T.H.E. policy obligated T.H.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to defend the claim, considering that \u00a7 482 required T.H.E. to show it had been prejudiced by the late-delivered claim, which it failed to do. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">On appeal, T.H.E. argued that, because its policy with P.T.P. applied only to claims \u201cfirst made against any insured during the policy period,\u201d or during the sixty-day extension, where the injured patron did not file a claim against P.T.P. until after the policy and extension period, there was simply no coverage for that claim. <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 413, 628 A.2d at 226. In response, P.T.P., relying on \u00a7 482, argued that the statute required T.H.E. to show actual prejudice resulting from the delay. <em>See id. </em>The Court, through Judge Rodowsky, relying on the dissent in <em>House </em>and the \u201coverwhelming weight of authority, measured both numerically and by persuasiveness,\u201d held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">Here, T.H.E. does not deny coverage because of an alleged material failure by P.T.P. to perform a covenant to give notice, or to satisfy a policy provision that might be phrased as a condition that must be satisfied to prevent the loss of coverage that otherwise would apply. In this case the extended reporting period under the original policy had expired before P.T.P. reported the Buckley claim to T.H.E. The original policy had come to an end with respect to newly reported claims. Section 482 could no more revive the original policy to cover the Buckley claim than \u00a7 482 could reopen an occurrence policy to embrace a claim based on an accident that happened after the end of the policy period.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 415, 416 628 A.2d at 227, 228. Judge Rodowsky explained further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In the case before us the original policy had expired before a claim was asserted against P.T.P. That expiration resulted from the terms of coverage and is not attributed to a \u201cbreach by P.T.P.\u201d The problem at which \u00a7 482 is directed is not presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 421, 628 A.2d at 230.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Judges Eldridge and (now Chief Judge) Bell dissented in <em>T.H.E. </em>Their first quarrel with the Majority opinion was that it did \u201cnot distinguish between the provisions of a claims made policy which establish coverage and the provisions which require notice.\u201d The dissent explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Section 482 deals with a liability policy\u2019s <em>notice </em>provision, <em>i.e., </em>notice by the <em>insured to the insurer </em>of the happening of an event triggering coverage. It does not apply to the portion of the policy which establishes the essential terms for coverage, <em>i.e., </em>an accident/occurrence or the making of a claim by the injured third party. In a claims made policy the requirement that a claim against the insured be made during the policy period essentially defines the coverage available. The <em>notice </em>of which \u00a7 482 speaks, in a claims made policy, is the notice by the insured to the insurer that a claim against the insured has been made during the policy period. Both the language and purpose of \u00a7 482 require that it be applied to the clause in a claims made policy providing for notice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The majority, however, contends that, because T.H.E. Insurance Co. defined the time at which a claim is made as \u201cwhen written notice of such claim is received and recorded by us,\u201d this claims made policy makes the reporting of the claim by the <em>insured </em>to the <em>insurer </em>the insurable event. By allowing the insurer to define claims made in terms of notice to the insurer, and by holding that \u00a7 482 does not apply to this provision in a claims made policies, the majority opens the door for insurers to circumvent the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 425, 628 A.2d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">II. Development of Notice-Prejudice Law After <em>T.H.E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In 1996, in codifying the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code, the Legislature recodified former \u00a7 482 to Maryland Code (1997, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Insurance Article \u00a7 19-110. <em>See </em>Chapter 11 of the Acts of 1996. After a minor 1997 revision,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u00a7 19-110 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">An insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured or a person claiming the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The revisor\u2019s note to the 1996 codification notes that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 48A, \u00a7 482.\u201d Aside from moving the statute from former Article 48A to the Insurance Article, Maryland\u2019s notice-prejudice jurisprudence went dark largely after <em>T.H.E.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The growth of notice-prejudice jurisprudence nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>wide, however, was not stunted similarly.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">It now may be said fairly that, although some courts have held that their respective notice-prejudice rules apply to claims-made policies, \u201ca majority of courts that have addressed the issue have found that the prejudice requirement does not apply equally to claims-made policies.\u201d 1 Jeffrey E. Thomas, New Appleman on Insurance Law Library Edition \u00a7 4.04[4][d][i] (2010). One further aspect of the jurisprudence developed in the nearly-two decades since <em>T.H.E. </em>is the distinction first mentioned in Maryland in Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s dissent in <em>House, supra </em>\u2014 namely, that of \u201cpure\u201d claims-made policies and \u201cclaims-made-and-reported\u201d policies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">The major distinction between a claims-made and a claims-made and reported policy is just as the names suggest. Under a claims-made policy, a claim must be made against the insured during the policy period, but need only be reported to the insurer \u201cpromptly,\u201d or \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d but not necessarily during the policy period. By contrast, a claims-made and reported policy requires the claim both be made against the insured and reported to the insurer during the policy period, or any extended reporting period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Beck, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 33.05; <em>see Jones v. Lexington Manor Nursing Ctr., LLC, </em>480 F.Supp.2d 865, 868 (S.D.Miss.2006) (quoting <em>Chicago Ins. Co. v. Western World Ins.

Applying Maryland law, the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States District Court for the District of Maryland \u2014 relying on T.H.E.\u2014 held that \u00a7 19-110\u2019s provisions do not apply to claims-made- and-reporting policies. <em>See Janjer Enters., Inc. v. Executive Risk Indem., Inc., </em>97 Fed.Appx. 410, 414 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cMaryland courts have held that \u2018claims made and reporting\u2019 policies ... are not subject to its prejudice requirement.\u201d); <em>Maynard v.

The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Sherwood contends first that, under a plain reading of \u00a7 19-110, the statute applies to all liability policies, regardless of whether deemed \u201cpure claims made policies\u201d or \u201cclaims-made- and-reported policies.\u201d Further, Sherwood asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASp\">under <em>House </em>and <em>T.H.E., </em>whether Section 19-110 comes into play turns on the basis for the denial of coverage. If there is no coverage because a claim was not \u201cmade\u201d during the policy period [as Sherwood argues was the case in <em>T.H.E., </em>where the injured patron did not make a claim for damages against the insured until after expiration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>relevant policy], then the statute is not involved because the claim was never a covered claim. If a claim was \u201cmade\u201d during the policy period [as Sherwood argues is the case at present, where both the Massachusetts and the Israeli actions were filed when the 2007 Policy was in effect], and the denial is based on the insured\u2019s breach of a notice condition or covenant, then under the statute an insurer must show actual prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Sherwood distinguishes the insurance policy in <em>T.H.E. </em>\u2014 ultimately held to be outside the scope of what is now \u00a7 19-110\u2014 from the Policy in the present case. That is, Sherwood contends that, although the policy in <em>T.H.E. </em>provided that a claim was not \u201cmade\u201d until \u201cwritten notice of [a] claim is received and recorded by us,\u201d the 2007-08 Policy provided that a \u201ccivil, criminal, administrative or arbitration proceeding made against any Insured\u201d is made when suit is brought against Sherwood, not when it is reported to Great American.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the alternative, Sherwood avers that the 2007-08 Policy is ambiguous and thus, should be construed against Great American as the drafter. Finally, if necessary, Sherwood would have us overrule <em>T.H.E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Great American, on the other hand, urges that \u201cMaryland courts consistently have held that the statute does not apply to \u2018claims made plus reporting\u2019 policies, like the Great American Policy at issue here,\u201d citing <em>Janjer, Maynard, </em>and <em>Rouse, supra. </em>As the argument goes, Great American\u2019s policy is clearly a claims-made-and-reporting policy because it states expressly that, not only must a claim be made during the Policy period, but that notice of claim must be provided to it no later than ninety days after the expiration of the Policy. Such a conclusion, it continues, is \u201cconsistent with the overwhelming majority view of courts in other states, which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>concluded that the prejudice rule does not apply to claims made plus reporting policies.\u201d Accordingly, Great American suggests that <em>T.H.E. </em>\u201cfully supports and, in fact, dictates the trial court\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">It would be simple \u2014 if not lazy \u2014 for us to conclude that <em>T.H.E. </em>held that \u00a7 19-110 does not apply to claims-made policies, pronounce the Policy a claims-made policy, and move on to the next case. We decline to follow that path. <em>T.H.E. </em>is not dispositive wholly of the present case. Further, it would be simple to focus on the portion of the Policy requiring Sherwood to give notice \u201cas soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the end of the Policy Period,\u201d declare the Policy a \u201cclaims-made-and-reported\u201d policy, and jump on the bandwagon of other jurisdictions that decline uniformly to extend notice-prejudice rules to claims-made-and-reported policies. But no, we shall take the path less traveled. Our emphasis should not be on other jurisdictions\u2019 treatment of claims-made and claims-made-and-reported policies vis \u00e1 vis their respective notice-prejudice rules because most of those cases did not confront or construe a statute like Maryland\u2019s. Thus, our emphasis must be on the text of, and policies underlying, \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">As noted, <em>T.H.E. </em>is not dispositive of the issue before us. The Court in <em>T.H.E. </em>was careful to circumscribe its holding by stating that \u201c[i]t would be an incorrect oversimplification to express the issue here to be whether \u00a7 482 applies at <em>all </em>to claims made policies.\u201d <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 414 n. 7, 628 A.2d at 226 n. 7 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> One reading of <em>T.H.E., </em>then, is that it limited its holding to stating that \u00a7 482 \u201cdoes not extend coverage under claims-made policies to include claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>made <em>after the policy expires,\u201d </em>but said nothing about a situation in which claims are made against the insured <em>before </em>the expiration date of the policy (as in the present case).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Wherthey, <em>supra, </em>at 956 (emphasis added). Further, <em>T.H.E. </em>\u201caddressed only one factual situation under a rather ambiguous policy, leaving important issues unresolved.\u201d Wherthey, <em>supra, </em>at 958. As noted by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">There are four temporal variables in late claim suits involving claims-made and hybrid policies: the date of the initial occurrence, the date the insured notifies the insurer of the occurrence, the date the injured party presents a claim against the insured, and the date the insured reports the claim to the insurer. <em>T.H.E. Insurance Co. </em>presented the factual scenario most favorable to the court\u2019s conclusion that section 482 did not apply; the accident occurred after the retroactive date, and neither the insured\u2019s report of the occurrence, nor the injured party\u2019s claim against the insured, nor the insured\u2019s report of the claim to the insurer, took place within the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Wherthey, <em>supra, </em>at 959. The facts of the present case are distinguishable from those in <em>T.H.E., </em>considering that it is undisputed that \u201cthe date the injured party presents a claim against the insured\u201d \u2014 here, the Massachusetts and Israeli actions \u2014 was within the Policy coverage period,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> whereas, in <em>T.H.E., </em>it was not. Accordingly, <em>T.H.E. </em>does not control wholly the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">To the extent the parties attempt to squeeze a square peg\u2014 that is, Maryland\u2019s notice-prejudice statute, as embodied in \u00a7 19-110, and our jurisprudence \u2014 into a round hole \u2014 that is, the notice-prejudice jurisprudence of other states and jurisdictions \u2014 they are unpersuasive. <em>See Bozman v.

Further, neither the Massachusetts nor the Wisconsin statutes require an insured\u2019s failure to abide by a policy\u2019s notice provisions to constitute a breach of the policy before those statutes apply, as Maryland\u2019s does. As we will see infra, this concept is crucial to the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">We turn to the text of, and the policies underlying, \u00a7 19-110. Section 19-110 begins by stating that \u201c[a]n insurer may disclaim coverage ... on the ground that the insured ... <em>has breached the </em>policy----\u201d Accordingly, in order for \u00a7 19-110 to be in play, the insured must breach the insurance policy \u201cby failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See House, </em>315 Md. at 355, 554 A.2d at 417 (stating that, because the statute requires the insured to have \u201cbreached the policy,\u201d the statute only <em>\u201cpotentially </em>applies to \u2018any\u2019 liability insurer or policy\u201d) (emphasis in original). Central to whether \u00a7 19-110 applies to require Great American to show that it was prejudiced by Sherwood\u2019s late-delivered notice is determining whether, in giving Great American notice more than ninety days after the expiration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>date of the 2007-08 Policy, Sherwood \u201cbreached the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If the notice provisions of the 2007-08 Policy are \u201cconditions precedent\u201d to coverage, then Sherwood does not \u201cbreach the policy\u201d by failing to obey the notice provisions; the nonoccurrence of a condition precedent does not constitute a breach, it merely relieves the other party from performing under the contract/policy. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 225 (1981) (\u201cNon-occurrence of a condition is not a breach by a party unless he is under a duty that the condition occur.\u201d); 8 Catherine M.A. McCauliff, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 30.13 (Rev. ed. 1999) (\u201cIf [a] condition consists of a personal action, it may properly be said not to be performed; but nonperformance is not a breach of contract unless the person promised to render the performance \u2014 to perform the condition.\u201d). On the other hand, if the notice provisions are deemed covenants, Sherwood\u2019s failure to give Great American notice no later than ninety days after the expiration date of the 2007-08 Policy would constitute a \u201cbreach of the policy,\u201d such that \u00a7 19-110 would apply to require Great American to show that it was prejudiced by Sherwood\u2019s late-delivered notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">To be sure, the \u201cNotice of Claim\u201d section of the Policy begins by stating that giving requisite notice is a \u201ccondition precedent to [Sherwood\u2019s] rights under this Policy.\u201d If we treat them as such, Sherwood\u2019s failure to give notice timely to Great American would be the non-occurrence of a condition, and not a breach. This language \u2014 explicit and unequivocal as it may be \u2014 does not save the day for Great American when considering the purpose and effect of \u00a7 19-110. \u201c[T]he general rule followed by courts throughout the country and ... certainly the rule followed by this Court prior to 1966\u201d was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">even if the language did not use the word \u201ccondition,\u201d the duty of notification was regarded as creating a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>precedent to the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend or indemnify, and the lack of any prejudice to the insured from the failure to give prompt notice was immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><em>Sherwood Brands, </em>347 Md. at 41, 698 A.2d at 1082; <em>see Lowitt and Harry Cohen Ins. Agency v. Pearsall Chem. Corp. of Md., </em>242 Md. 245, 259, 219 A.2d 67, 76 (1966) (citing <em>Watson, supra, </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]he general rule is that a provision in an insurance policy requiring notice by the insured to the insurer as soon as practicable, when it is made a condition precedent, must be complied with in order to obligate the insurer\u201d); <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 414, 628 A.2d at 227 <em>(\u201cWatson </em>applied a strict condition precedent analysis to the insured\u2019s obligation to give notice of an accident under an ... automobile liability policy.\u201d). Former \u00a7 428 was enacted effectively to overrule <em>Watson, </em>discard the strict condition-precedent approach, and \u201cmake[ ] policy provisions requiring notice to, and cooperation with, the insurer <em>covenants and not conditions.\u201d Sherwood Brands, </em>347 Md. at 42, 698 A.2d at 1082 (quoting <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 332, 554 A.2d at 406) (emphasis added). Therefore, notwithstanding that Great American labeled the notice provisions in the Policy as conditions precedent to coverage, \u00a7 19-110 mandates that the notice provisions of the Policy be treated as covenants, not conditions. By not giving notice to Great American within the time frame stated in the notice provisions, Sherwood \u201cbreached the policy ... by not giving the insurer required notice\u201d as provided in \u00a7 19-110, and, thus, the statute applies to require Great American to show how it was prejudiced by Sherwood\u2019s late-delivered notice in investigating, settling, or defending of the Massachusetts and Israeli actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">This conclusion is consistent entirely with <em>T.H.E</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>T.H.E., </em>the policy provided that \u201c[t]his insurance applies ... if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>a claim for damages ... is first made against any insured during the policy period.\u201d <em>T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 411, 628 A.2d at 225. Thus, a claim being \u201cmade\u201d within the policy period was the functional equivalent of a condition precedent to coverage; if a claim was not made during the policy period, the notice provisions did not come into play, as the insurer was under no obligation to provide coverage for the claim. The facts were such in <em>T.H.E. </em>that the suit was not filed against P.T.P. (the insured) until after the expiration of the policy. <em>See T.H.E., </em>331 Md. at 413, 628 A.2d at 226. The suit not being filed until after the expiration of the policy was not a \u201cbreach\u201d of the policy, but rather, the non-occurrence of a condition precedent, <em>i.e., </em>that a claim be \u201cmade\u201d during the policy period. In the absence of a breach of the policy, as required by the statute, we were correct to hold that former \u00a7 482 did not apply to require T.H.E. to prove that it was prejudiced by the late-delivered notice. In the present case, this condition precedent \u2014 that a claim be \u201cmade\u201d during the policy period \u2014 was satisfied, as it is undisputed that both the Massachusetts and Israeli actions were filed before the expiration of the Policy, putting the present case at odds, in this respect, with <em>T.H.E. </em>Because the two suits were filed against, and service made upon, Sherwood before expiration of the Policy, the notice provision \u2014 treated, under the statute, as a covenant and not a condition \u2014 triggers, and ultimately was breached by Sherwood. Accordingly, Sherwood has \u201cbreached the policy\u201d in the present case, invoking \u00a7 19-110, and requiring Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>American to demonstrate prejudice.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">We hold that \u00a7 19-110 does not apply, as was the case in <em>T.H.E., </em>to claims-made policies in which the act triggering coverage \u2014 usually notice of a claim or suit being filed against and served upon an insured under third-party liability policies \u2014 does not occur until after the expiration of the liability policy, as this non-occurrence of the condition precedent to coverage is not a \u201cbreach of the policy,\u201d as required by the statute. On the other hand, we hold that \u00a7 19-110 does apply, as is the case at present, to claims-made policies in which the act triggering coverage occurs during the policy period, but the insured does not comply strictly with the policy\u2019s notice provisions. In the latter situation, \u00a7 19-110 mandates that notice provisions be treated as covenants, such that failure to abide by them constitutes a breach of the policy sufficient for the statute to require the disclaiming insurer to prove prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Lest one think that this opinion places Maryland\u2019s jurisprudence at odds with the majority of other jurisdictions to decide a similar question, we think it important to emphasize that Maryland\u2019s notice-prejudice jurisprudence was \u201cat odds\u201d with most other jurisdictions\u2019 jurisprudence well before the filing of this opinion. As noted <em>supra, </em>of the more than three-dozen states adopting a notice-prejudice rule, we are aware of only two other states that did so legislatively \u2014 Massachusetts and Wisconsin.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Further, neither the Massachusetts nor the Wisconsin statutes require a breach of the policy as a precondition to the applicability of their respective statutes. Ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>mately, we are guided only \u2014 to the exclusion of other states\u2019 notice-prejudice jurisprudence \u2014 by the text of, and the policies underlying, \u00a7 19-110. Of course, \u201c[i]f the General Assembly did not so intend, it can amend or repeal the statute.\u201d <em>Ali v. CIT Tech. Fin.

As the underlying suit papers were served on Sherwood during the 2008[ \u2014 09] Policy Period, notice was timely\u201d under the 2008-09 Policy. In granting Great American\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denying Sherwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court did not address whether notice was timely under the 2008-09 Policy. Because Sherwood prevails here on the question actually decided by the Circuit Court, we shall not reach Sherwood\u2019s alternative argument. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.

In its brief before this Court, however, Sherwood states that \"[a] separate complaint was subsequently filed in ... Massachusetts Superi- or Court on March 28, 2008, also during the 2007 Policy Period against these same insureds.\u201d Thus, it appears that, for purposes of this appeal, Sherwood waived its argument vis \u00e1 vis the 2008-09 Policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">.

It is unclear from the record the case to which Bryan refers. It well may be <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>347 Md. 32, 698 A.2d 1078 (1997). <em>See Sherwood Brands, Inc., </em>347 Md. at 42, 698 A.2d at 1083 (\"In order to avoid its duty to defend or to indemnify on the ground of delayed notice, the insurer must establish by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that the delay in giving notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. Alternatively, Sherwood argued that, regardless of whether notice was proper under the 2007-08 Policy, \"the 2008[-09] Policy defines the term claim in terms of when a complaint is filed on an insured. As the underlying suit papers were served on Sherwood during the 2008[-09] Policy Period, notice was timely\u201d under the 2008-09 Policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">. In its certiorari petition and brief, Sherwood frames another question, \"whether the lower court erred by not entering summary judgment declaring that appellee is required to defend and indemnify appellant in both underlying lawsuits.\u201d Because Sherwood \u2014 in its opening brief, reply brief, or at oral argument before this Court \u2014 has not marshaled support for this question with any argument, we deem this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>abandoned. <em>See, e.g., Klauenberg v.

Missouri promulgated its notice-prejudice rule by regulation, not statute. <em>See </em>Mo.Code Regs. Ann. tit. 20, \u00a7 100-1.020(1)(D)(2009) (\"No insurer shall deny any claim based upon the insured's failure to submit a written notice of loss within a specified time following any loss, unless the failure operates to prejudice the rights of the insurer.\u201d). Further, the recent decision by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Prodigy Communications Corp. v. Agricultural Excess &amp; Surplus Insurance Co., </em>288 S.W.3d 374, 388 (Tex.2009), cites to a Texas State Board of Insurance Order (No. 23080, 13 March 1973), that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">As respects bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage, unless the company is prejudiced by the insured\u2019s failure to comply with the requirement, any provision of this policy requiring the insured to give notice of action, occurrence or loss, or requiring the insured to forward demands, notices, summons or other legal process, shall not bar liability under this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Finally, at oral argument before this Court, Great American offered that Michigan adopted a notice-prejudice statute. Although Great American does not cite to the statute in its brief, it well may be that it refers to Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 500.3008 (2010), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">In such liability insurance policies there shall be a provision that notice given by or on behalf of the insured to any authorized agent of the insurer within this state, with particulars sufficient to identify the insured shall be deemed to be notice to the insurer; and also a provision that failure to give any notice required to be given by such policy within the time specified therein shall not invalidate any claim made by the insured if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">This statute, however, does not require an insurer, disclaiming on grounds of late-filed notice, to show how it was prejudiced by such a delay; rather, it requires the insured to show that it was not \"reasonably possible to give such notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible.\u201d <em>See State Bar of Mich. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>2008 WL 4901108, at 14-15, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94029, at *50 (E.D. Mich. 10 November 2008) (citing, not a statute, but the <em>case </em>of <em>Wendel v. Swanberg, </em>384 Mich. 468, 185 N.W.2d 348 (1971), for the proposition that \u201c[pjrejudice to the insurer is a material element in determining whether notice is reasonably given\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">.

Wis. Stat. \u00a7 631.81 (2010), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">Provided notice or proof of loss is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and within one year after the time it was required by the policy, failure to furnish such notice or proof within the time required by the policy does not invalidate or reduce a claim unless the insurer is prejudiced thereby and it was reasonably possible to meet the time limit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">.

At argument before this Court, Great American cited <em>Stachowski </em>v. <em>State, </em>416 Md. 276, 291, 6 A.3d 907, 916 (2010), for the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue. Under these circumstances, it is particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We agree that the General Assembly, in not changing substantively the text of the statute in its 1996 codification of the Insurance Article, acquiesced to our holding in <em>T.H.E. </em>We need not, however, \"overrule our prior interpretation of the statute\u201d because, as explained <em>infra, </em>the present case is distinguishable from the facts with which we dealt in <em>T.H.E.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\">. One commentator notes that \"had the court [in <em>T.H.E.] </em>applied section 482 to claims filed after the termination date of claims-made policies, it would have extended indefinitely the time period of potential liability for claims-made policy issuers in Maryland.\u201d Wherthey, <em>supra, </em>at 958. We think it important to note that our holding does not \"extend indefinitely the time period of potential liability\u201d for insurers, as we limit application of \u00a7 19-110 to circumstances in which notice of a claim, triggering the requirement to give notice to the carrier, occurs before expiration of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">. <em>See supra </em>notes 25-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
