Administrative Law Judge Kathleen Chapman had suspended Najafi\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 120 days, after determining that Najafi was subject to administrative sanctions, stemming from Najafi\u2019s refusal to submit to a chemical breath test, after being detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Najafi then filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After the Circuit Court Judge affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, Najafi filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in its affirmance of the decision of the ALJ, finding that the Petitioner\u2019s right to consult with counsel prior to an election on submitting to a chemical breath test, as established in <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702 [481 A.2d 192] (1984), did not apply to the administrative license suspension hearing, and in denying his motion for \u201cno action\u201d on those grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">2. Did the circuit court err in affirming the decision of the ALJ, finding that the Petitioner had refused to submit to a chemical breath test when: A) there is no evidence that the Petitioner ever refused; and B) the police officer assumed that the Petitioner had refused after the Petitioner was unable to reach an attorney with one attempted phone call?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Najafi v. MVA, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010). We shall hold that were, in the context of an administrative license suspension hearing, an individual to have a right to consult counsel prior to an election on whether to submit to a chemical breath test, in the present case, the Petitioner was afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel and, further, there was substantial evidence that he refused to submit to a chemical breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In 2009, Najafi had been detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol by a Montgomery County police officer and subsequently had his license suspended for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. Najafi requested an administrative hearing, pursuant to Section 16 \u2014 205.1(f) of the Transportation Article, Maryland Code (1977, 2006 RepLVol., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>2008 Supp.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during which he was the only one to testify. The Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) presented Najafi\u2019s DR-15A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and DR-15<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> forms; the detaining officer was not present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Najafi\u2019s counsel made a motion that \u201cno action\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> be taken by the ALJ, contending that Najafi was denied a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>opportunity to consult counsel because, at the police station, the officer failed to give Najafi privacy when he attempted to contact his attorney on the phone. The ALJ denied the motion, determining that, in the context of an administrative hearing, there is no right for an individual to consult with counsel before making an election of whether to submit to a chemical breath test, and that, even if there were a right, Najafi was given a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuM\">The right to counsel, which is found at the Fourteenth Amendment, the due process right, the right to have an attorney, does not exactly, necessarily extend to administrative proceedings---- The officer\u2019s not required then to make sure that the person\u2019s made an election for an attorney, whether they did or not. And so while Mr. Najafi had certainly asked for an attorney, this police officer wasn\u2019t required, for purposes of an administrative hearing to allow you the opportunity to talk to an attorney and yet the officer still did that. And you did have the opportunity to talk to an attorney. It is unfortunate that [Najafi\u2019s attorney] was not available to chat with you that day. And it\u2019s also unfortunate that all you got was his answering machine. At that point, the request for an attorney was made; the officer gave you your cell phone, you asked for yellow pages. There was some confusion over the yellow pages, but he\u2019s handed you yellow pages, and you made the phone call. You actually made it through to the office, you just didn\u2019t make it to a live voice____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">[B]ecause there is no absolute right to an attorney in the first place, there\u2019s no absolute right to privacy for that attorney. And then, even if he did beyond that point, he didn\u2019t get to talk to a live attorney. There was no live attorney on the other end of that line. Even if he had privacy, he wasn\u2019t going to have a conversation short of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201chey I\u2019ve been arrested and I don\u2019t know what to do and I don\u2019t know which way I\u2019m going to elect on this breathalyzer,\u201d and at that point, he needed to make an election and the officer doesn\u2019t need to guess what that election is going to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Thereafter, the ALJ made the following findings regarding the traffic stop that led to Najafi\u2019s detainment and eventual license suspension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[T]he officer that stopped or detained you on June 12th, 2009 at 1:16 a.m. had reasonable grounds to believe that you were driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or impaired by alcohol. When you were stopped for not stopping at a stop sign and then the officer observed you cross over lane markings on numerous occasions. The officer did stop to interact with you and when he did, he did note evidence of use of alcohol in that he wrote in his report that there was strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from your person, you had blood shot, watery eyes, your clothes appeared to be disheveled and when he asked you to perform standard field sobriety tests, it was the officer\u2019s observations that those tests did indicate a level of intoxication. You were asked to submit to a preliminary breath test[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] You did and it came back indicating an alcohol concentration level of .12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">ALJ Chapman then found that, once Najafi was detained and taken back to the police station, Najafi was properly advised of the administrative sanctions that he could face should he refuse to submit to a breathalyzer test by his being provided the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form and having read it twice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Based upon that, the officer did fully advise you of the administrative sanctions to be imposed. As I had mentioned earlier, the officer may either do one of two things. Hand you the form in order for you to read or in the alternative he may read the form. Here the record would reflect that you read the form and in fact you said you read the form twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Thereafter, the ALJ found that, after being properly advised of the possible administrative sanctions, Najafi did, in fact, refuse to submit to the breathalyzer test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">I also find ... that you did refuse to take the breathalyzer test when it was offered to you and that in doing so it was considered failure to make an election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">With regard to the conflict between Najafi\u2019s testimony at the hearing that he did not refuse to take the breathalyzer test and the officer\u2019s certifications on the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form that he did refuse, the ALJ observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">In these hearings where there is a conflict concerning your testimony and the record before me, and that there has been no request for a subpoena for the officer to come and testify prior to the hearing. The court has indicated in the case of <em>[MVA </em>v.] <em>Karwacki[, </em>340 Md. 271, 666 A.2d 511 (1994) ] that when I am faced with a confined set of conflicting evidence such as that of the Advice of Rights form and your contrary testimony, that I am allowed to make a credibility determination on which I believe is more credible. Now here today, I have taken into account all of the testimony you have provided and in doing so I matched it against the Advice of Rights form and they\u2019re not entirely inconsistent from one to the other. The only difference is your interpretation of what may have occurred that night. And that is that you wanted privacy to speak to an attorney, you didn\u2019t get it and at that point things fell apart. And based on your testimony and based on the documents before me, I would find that an election was not made and that it was reasonable for the officer to make the inference that you refused to take the breathalyzer at that time. Now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>based on that, I would conclude that you violated Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In determining that Najafi was subject to sanctions under Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the ALJ suspended Najafi\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 120 days but modified the sanction so that Najafi could have an ignition interlock system placed in his car.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Najafi filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the ALJ\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, pursuant to Section 10-222(a) of the State Government Article, Maryland Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>affirming the ruling below, Judge Marielsa Bernard of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County determined that there was substantial evidence to support ALJ Chapman\u2019s findings that Najafi was given a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and that he had refused to elect to take a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, explicated the proper standard of review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKC\"><em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 873 A.2d at 1154-55 (footnote omitted) (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Section 10-222(h) of the State Government Article, Maryland Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">With regard to the first question presented, Najafi argues that a violation of the right to consult counsel prior to making an election of whether to submit to a chemical breath test, applicable in a criminal case under <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 481 A.2d 192 (1984), is also applicable in an administrative license suspension hearing as grounds to invalidate a refusal to take a breathalyzer test or to otherwise grant a motion for no action. He contends that, during the incident in question, his right to have a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel was violated, due to the police officer\u2019s alleged failure to give Najafi privacy when he attempted to contact his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The MVA argues, conversely, that the right to counsel, as articulated in <em>Sites, </em>is only applicable in criminal matters and does not apply in the context of an administrative license suspension hearing. The MVA further contends that, even if there were such a right, in the administrative context, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>no remedy available for an alleged violation of a right to consult counsel. Nonetheless, MVA asserts, Najafi was clearly afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel and, furthermore, any issue regarding privacy is moot because Najafi never spoke with an attorney during the incident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article governs the administrative license suspension process and embodies the concept that individuals who drive vehicles in Maryland are deemed to have consented to take a chemical breath test should they be detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented ... to take a [chemical breath] test [to determine alcohol concentration] if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Section 16-205.1(a)(2). Once a person is detained for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, the officer must advise the person of the possible administrative sanctions for refusing to take a chemical breath test. Section 16-205.1(b)(2). If the person refuses to take the test, the police officer shall, <em>inter alia, </em>seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license and personally serve an order of suspension on the person. Section 16-205.1(b)(3). Although Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article does not address whether an individual has a right to consult counsel before deciding whether to submit to a chemical breath test, we have had occasion to broach this subject in <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 481 A.2d 192 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In <em>Sites, </em>we addressed whether the results of a chemical breath test should have been suppressed in a criminal trial on the grounds that the defendant had not been afforded a right to consult counsel before deciding whether to submit to the test. Sites was stopped for drunk driving, and at the scene, the officer read Sites a standardized statement of his rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and the penalties for Sites\u2019s refusal to submit to a chemical breath test under the implied consent statute, Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, Maryland Code (1977, 1984 Repl.Vol.). Sites agreed to take a chemical breath test and signed the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">According to Sites\u2019s testimony at trial, then, after arriving at the police station, he asked to speak with his attorney three times, but the arresting officer informed him that he had no right to counsel. A chemical breath test was administered, resulting in a finding of 0.17 percent blood alcohol content. Sites was thereafter formally charged with driving while intoxicated. In his criminal trial, Sites filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the results of the test on the grounds that he was denied his right to counsel prior to the administration of the test, but the circuit court judge denied his motion, finding that, as a matter of law, Sites was not entitled to an attorney at that time. Sites was convicted by a jury of driving while intoxicated. We granted certiorari prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We determined that, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in a criminal case, a drunk driving suspect should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to communicate with counsel prior to submitting to a chemical sobri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ety test, as long as it does not substantially interfere with the timely and efficacious administration of the testing process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">Considering all the circumstances, we think to unreasonably deny a requested right of access to counsel to a drunk driving suspect offends a sense of justice which impairs the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. We hold, therefore, that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, requires that a person under detention for drunk driving must, on request, be permitted a reasonable opportunity to communicate with counsel before submitting to a chemical sobriety test, as long as such attempted communication will not substantially interfere with the timely and efficacious administration of the testing process. In this regard, it is not possible to establish a bright line rule as to what constitutes a reasonable delay, although the statute itself mandates that in no event may the test be administered later than two hours after the driver\u2019s apprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALq\"><em>Sites, </em>300 Md. at 717-18, 481 A.2d at 200. <em>See also McAvoy v. State, </em>314 Md. 509, 519, 551 A.2d 875, 880 (1989) (observing that, in <em>Sites, </em>we recognized \u201cneither a right of counsel in the Fifth nor Sixth Amendment sense, but rather a deprivation of the right of due process by the unnecessary denial of a specific request for counsel\u201d). We held, nonetheless, that \u201cthere [wa]s nothing in the record to show whether, in the circumstances, the refusal of the police to permit a phone call (if in fact that occurred) constituted a violation of Sites\u2019 due process right,\u201d and thus declined to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test. <em>Sites, </em>300 Md. at 718-19, 481 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The implications of <em>Sites </em>were discussed in <em>MVA v. Atterbeary, </em>368 Md. 480, 796 A.2d 75 (2002), in which we explored whether an individual\u2019s invocation of his or her right to consult counsel could be treated as a refusal of the detainee to take a chemical sobriety test, in the context of an administrative license suspension hearing. In <em>Atterbeary, </em>Montgomery County Police responded to a call requesting assistance with an individual, Atterbeary, who was slumped behind the wheel of his car in front of an automobile dealership, with keys in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ignition and the engine running. One of the responding officers noticed Atterbeary\u2019s slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and a strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. After Atterbeary failed several field sobriety tests, the officer took him to a police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At the police station, the officer read the DR-15 Advice of Rights Form to Atterbeary, and Atterbeary indicated that he was willing to take the breathalyzer test. When the officer asked Atterbeary to sign the consent provision on the DR-15 Form, however, Atterbeary stated that he did not understand the DR-15 Form and wanted to read the Form, a request that the officer obliged. Atterbeary informed the officer that he wanted to speak with an attorney but, thereafter, acknowledged that he did not have one at that moment. At that point, the officer asked \u201chim again to sign [the form] and he refused to sign it, which to me he refused to take the breath test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 796 A.2d at 79 (alteration in original). In response to Atterbeary\u2019s repeated requests for an attorney, the officer indicated on the form that Atterbeary refused the breathalyzer test, issued a citation to Atterbeary for driving while intoxicated, and released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Atterbeary requested an administrative hearing, in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he never refused to take the breathalyzer test. Atterbeary sought judicial review after the ALJ suspended his license, based, in part, on the determination that Atterbeary did, in fact, refuse to take the breathalyzer test. The circuit court judge reversed, finding that the invocation of the right to counsel could not be treated as a test refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">On certiorari, in affirming the circuit court, we limited our analysis to \u201cwhether [the officer\u2019s] conclusion that Atterbeary\u2019s unwillingness to sign the form and his repeated requests for an attorney constituted a refusal to submit to the test, [was] correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 796 A.2d at 85. In determining that Atterbeary\u2019s request to speak with an attorney could not be treated as a <em>per se </em>refusal of the breathalyzer test, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>[T]he ALJ concluded that based on Atterbeary\u2019s repeated requests to speak with an attorney that he thereby refused to take the breathalyzer test. Logical reasoning simply cannot be strained in order to support such a leap, for when an individual chooses to exercise his or her right to contact counsel under <em>Sites, </em>the decision to do so is, at that point, neither necessarily a conditional nor a <em>per se </em>refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test____ [T]he DR-15 Form addresses many matters in addition to the consent to take the test. Atterbeary\u2019s request to speak to an attorney, without more, may not logically or exclusively be construed to relate only to the testing reference in the form advisement and, thus, be interpreted as an implied refusal of consent to be tested or a withdrawal of consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 499, 796 A.2d at 86-87. In reaching this conclusion, we recognized that, \u201c[t]he exercise of the <em>Sites </em>right may be treated separately and distinctly from the assessment of whether an individual has refused to submit to a breathalyzer test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 796 A.2d at 87. Based on the fact that Atterbeary had initially consented to take the breathalyzer test and that the exercising of one\u2019s <em>Sites </em>right to counsel may not be treated as a <em>per se </em>refusal, we determined that there was insufficient evidence to determine that Atterbeary refused to submit to the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Obviously, based upon our jurisprudence, it is incumbent upon an officer to afford a detained driver the opportunity to consult counsel prior to having to decide whether to take a chemical breath test. The spectre of the possibility of a criminal sanction to be imposed is omnipresent, and it would be impossible for an officer to determine whether potential test results could be limited only to administrative penalties. If a detained driver is not given the right to consult counsel, there may be implications in a criminal case, such as the suppression of test results; although, in the administrative context, similar remedies do not exist. <em>See MVA v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 366, 739 A.2d 58, 64 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In <em>Richards, </em>we addressed whether the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment applies in an administrative license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>suspension proceeding to bar introduction of evidence based on a purportedly unlawful motor vehicle stop. Addressing this issue, we first recognized that \u201cthe General Assembly made a deliberate effort in drafting \u00a7 16-205.1 to keep the criminal and administrative proceedings resulting from a suspected drunk-driving incident wholly separate,\u201d and that \u201csubsection (f)(7)[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] [of Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article] makes paramountly clear that the constitutionality of the stop giving rise to the test request is not one of the issues to be presented at the hearing, nor is the possible exclusion of unconstitutionally seized evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 739 A.2d at 64. <em>See also id. </em>at 367 n. 7, 739 A.2d at 64 n. 7 (noting that, \u201c[i]n 1989, the MVA alerted the Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Drivers as to the purposeful non-inclusion of constitutional protections for Maryland drivers with respect to license suspension hearings under \u00a7 16-205.1, either in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>pre-amended form or under the proposed (and later adopted) amendment\u201d). We further explained that the purpose of Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article was to protect the public rather than the accused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">This Court has on several occasions addressed the purposes behind this State\u2019s legislation against \u201cdrunken driving.\u201d It is true that \u201c[t]he General Assembly\u2019s goal in enacting the drunk driving laws ... is \u2018to meet the considerable challenge created by this problem by enacting a series of measures to rid our highways of the drunk driver menace. These measures ... are primarily designed to enhance the ability of prosecutors to deal effectively with the drunk driver problem.\u2019\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

Nevertheless, as we emphasized in <em>Shrader, </em>\u00a7 16-205.1 and related statutory provisions \u201cwere enacted for the protection of the public and not primarily for the protection of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 597 A.2d at 943 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cFrom the licensee\u2019s perspective, it is certainly true that suspension or revocation of a license may feel like \u2018punishment.\u2019 <em>A licensing system\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is to prevent unscrupulous or incompetent persons from engaging in the licensed activity. </em>To this end, revocation or suspension of a license clearly prevents a wrongdoer from further engaging in the licensed activity, at least temporarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 372-73, 739 A.2d at 67-68, quoting, in part, <em>State v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 235, 252, 666 A.2d 128, 136 (1995). Holding that the \u201cexclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment should not be extended to [administrative license suspension proceedings],\u201d we observed that the \u201cthe MVA is a separate and independent agency from the police department and has no control over the actions of police officers, [and that] imposing the exclusionary rule in license suspension proceedings would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>add little force to the deterrence of unlawful police action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-77, 739 A.2d at 69, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Najafi, nevertheless, urges us to limit <em>Richards </em>such that the denial of an individual\u2019s right to have a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel, as articulated in <em>Sites, </em>may be raised in the administrative context, as a result of an individual\u2019s interest in his or her license, which he alleges has due process implications. In <em>Brosan v. Cochran, </em>307 Md. 662, 516 A.2d 970 (1986), we alluded to due process protections prior to license suspensions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">The continued possession of a driver\u2019s license may become essential to earning a livelihood; it is, therefore, an entitlement that may not be taken away without the due process mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Sites </em>further makes clear that revocation of a driver\u2019s license may burden the ordinary driver as much or more than the traditional criminal sanctions of fine or imprisonment. By affording a drunk driver suspect the power to refuse chemical testing, the Maryland statute \u201cdeliberately gives the driver a choice between two different potential sanctions, each affecting vitally important interests.\u201d Thus, drunk driving suspects have a significant interest at stake in deciding whether to submit to the State-administered chemical sobriety test. If they refuse, their licenses are suspended, and they may also be convicted based on other evidence of drunk driving. For drunk driving suspects who would \u201cpass\u201d the State\u2019s test, therefore, the pre-election administration of a private breathalyzer would likely encourage them to submit to the test and thereby avoid the automatic license suspension and possibly criminal prosecution as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 672, 516 A.2d at 975-76 (citations omitted). The due process protection prior to license suspension acknowledged in <em>Brosan, </em>however, is satisfied by the procedural due process afforded by Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, as we most recently addressed in <em>Hill v. MVA, </em>415 Md. 231, 999 A.2d 1019 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In that case, Hill challenged the content and structure of the DR-15 Form and alleged that his due process rights had been impugned. In addressing this issue, we observed that an individual facing the possible suspension of his or her license, indeed, has a \u201csignificant interest at stake in deciding whether to submit to [a] State-administered chemical sobriety test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 999 A.2d at 1025, quoting <em>Brosan, </em>307 Md. at 672, 516 A.2d at 975. We noted, however, that this \u201cinterest is balanced against the State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting its citizens from drunk drivers, including an interest in encouraging suspects to submit to alcohol concentration tests so as to improve administrative efficiency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hare v. MVA, </em>326 Md. 296, 303, 604 A.2d 914, 917 (1992), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>1993 Maryland Laws, Chapter 407. In the administrative context, we recognized that \u201c[a] detaining officer\u2019s compliance with the protections of due process requires that an officer advise a driver of the applicable sanctions under the governing statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 999 A.2d at 1025 (citation omitted). This \u201crequire[s] only that the State \u2018not mislead the defendant or construct [metaphorical or semantic] road blocks, thus unduly burdening\u2019 the driver\u2019s decision making process when considering whether to submit to the State\u2019s test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243^14, 999 A.2d at 1026, quoting <em>Hare, </em>326 Md. at 304, 604 A.2d at 918 (alteration in original). A determination of whether Hill\u2019s due process rights were impinged rested solely, then, on whether the DR-15 Form \u201ccorrectly advised Hill of the proper sanctions applicable under the statute without being misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 999 A.2d at 1026, which, as we held, it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Prior to <em>Hill, </em>we certainly also had occasion to determine that the implied consent statute provides sufficient due process for a detained driver. <em>See MVA v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 71, 821 A.2d 62, 82 (2003) (in finding that driver was afforded sufficient due process, noting that driver\u2019s \u201csuggested additional procedure [of requiring that margin of error be factored into the calculation of a tested person\u2019s BAC] would result in a burden on the State disproportionate to the benefits to the individual\u201d); <em>Forman v. MVA, </em>332 Md. 201, 214, 630 A.2d 753, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>760 (1993) (observing that \u201cdue process does not require a detaining officer to provide any advice other than that which the statute requires\u201d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; <em>MVA v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 323 &amp; n. 11, 604 A.2d 919, 927 &amp; n. 11 (1992) (holding that, where the driver was properly advised of the \u201csanctions that shall be imposed,\u201d the police officer fully comported with the requirements of due process), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>1993 Maryland Laws, Chapter 407. Similarly, in the present case, the requirements of due process were met when Najafi was properly advised of the possible administrative sanctions when, as ALJ Chapman found, he was afforded the opportunity to read the DR-15 Form twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Ultimately, however, our discussion in the instant case as to the effect, in the administrative context, of the applicability of a right to consult counsel prior to making a test election is really dicta, because Najafi clearly was given an opportunity to contact counsel. As the ALJ determined, the officer gave Najafi a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney telephonically. Najafi\u2019s allegation that he was denied a right to privacy during his attempted consultation with counsel, moreover, is somewhat facetious because he did not engage in a dialogue for which privacy may have been necessary as a result of the aborted telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Najafi also argues that the ALJ erred in determining that Najafi refused to take a breathalyzer test, essentially that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding. Najafi alleges that he did not refuse because the officer failed to ask him to make an election, after Najafi unsuccessfully attempted to contact his attorney. The MVA argues, conversely, that Najafi was properly advised of his rights through the DR-15 form and that the officer had asked him to make an election. Accordingly, MVA contends, Najafi\u2019s failure to make an election, after his unsuccessful attempt to contact his attorney, constituted a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">With regard to the proof regarding the refusal, the ALJ found persuasive the DR-15 and DR-15A Forms, which included, <em>inter alia, </em>the officer\u2019s certification that he advised Najafi of the possible administrative sanctions as stated in the Advice of Rights and that Najafi refused to take the breathalyzer test. Based on this evidence, the ALJ determined that Najafi refused to take the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>MVA v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 273, 666 A.2d 511, 512 (1995), we addressed whether an ALJ \u201cmay give greater credit to the sworn written statement of an absent police officer, who was not subpoenaed by either party, than to the conflicting testimony of the motorist.\u201d In <em>Karwacki, </em>during the administrative hearing, Karwacki testified that the officer requested that he take a chemical breath test and also advised him that he could refuse the test. Karwacki testified, however, that he had no recollection of the officer advising him of the consequences of a failure of the alcohol test or of the consequences of a second refusal of an alcohol test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Karwacki also testified that he did not read either of the forms he signed and he did not believe that the officer had read them to him. In suspending Karwacki\u2019s license for one year, the ALJ found the certification of the officer to be more credible than Karwacki\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In our analysis, we described the contents of the DR-15 and DR-15A forms certified by the officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The certification and order of suspension contained the officer\u2019s sworn statement of the reasons the respondent was stopped and detained. In it, the officer also certified that \u201cafter being fully advised of sanctions that shall be imposed as provided in the advice of rights form DR-15, [the respondent] refused to take a test to determine alcohol concentration by this officer.\u201d The advice of rights form, to which the officer\u2019s certification referred, contains a detailed summary of the provisions of the implied consent statute. It was signed by both the police officer and the respondent. More importantly, the respondent\u2019s signature acknowledged that he read or had read to him the information in the advice of rights form, that he had been advised of the administrative sanctions that \u201cshall be imposed\u201d for a test refusal or a test failure, and that he refused the test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 282, 666 A.2d at 516. We recognized that, under Section 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(ii) of the Transportation Article, the sworn statement of the arresting officer is prima facie evidence of a test refusal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We further noted that \u201cthe advice of rights form \u2018accurately and adequately conveys to the driver the rights granted by the [implied consent] statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Forman v. MVA, </em>332 Md. 201, 218, 630 A.2d 753, 762 (1993). As a result, we determined that, \u201c[b]eing prima facie evidence of a test refusal, the sworn statement of the officer, unless explained or contradicted, was sufficient to establish that the respondent refused to take an alcohol concentration test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 666 A.2d at 516. In finding that the \u201cofficer\u2019s sworn statement provide[d] adequate support for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion,\u201d we noted that \u201ccredibility findings of the agency representative who sees and hears witnesses are entitled to great deference on further agency review and should not be reversed absent an adequate explanation of the grounds for the reviewing body\u2019s disagreement with those findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 666 A.2d at 517-18. In so holding, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The respondent\u2019s testimony was intended to rebut and contradict the officer\u2019s sworn statement as to the advice he gave the respondent. Indeed, had the ALJ found the respondent\u2019s testimony reliable, <em>i.e. </em>he believed the respondent\u2019s testimony, then the sufficiency of the evidence as to the adequacy of the advice that the officer gave the respondent would have been undermined and the sworn statement no longer would have been sufficient to establish the fact that the respondent refused the test. The ALJ did not find the respondent\u2019s testimony to be reliable, however. Instead, he considered that the documentary evidence was more persuasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Undoubtedly, it is that reference to the credibility of the documentary evidence that prompted the issue this case presents. The only issue before the ALJ involving a credibility determination was the evaluation of the respondent\u2019s testimony to determine whether it successfully and adequately rebutted or contradicted the <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the respondent refused the test, which already was in the case. Because the ALJ determined the documentary evidence was more credible than the respondent\u2019s testimony, it is absolutely clear that the ALJ did not find the respondent\u2019s testimony to be sufficient to negate the fact the officer\u2019s sworn statement established. Having concluded that the respondent\u2019s testimony did not rebut the officer\u2019s sworn statement that the respondent refused the test after having been fully advised, the ALJ set forth the basis for those conclusions, as he was required to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 666 A.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In the present case, the ALJ specifically cited <em>Karwacki </em>when making her finding that the officer\u2019s certification that Najafi refused to take the breathalyzer test was more credible than Najafi\u2019s testimony. She further noted that Najafi had read the Advice of Rights Form twice and concluded that, \u201cbased on [Najafi\u2019s] testimony and based on the documents before [her] ... an election was not made and ... it was reasonable for the officer to make the inference that [Najafi] refused to take the breathalyzer at that time.\u201d Like the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>in <em>Karwacki, </em>ALJ Chapman was entitled to find that Najafi\u2019s testimony \u201cdid not rebut the officer\u2019s sworn statement that [he] refused the test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 666 A.2d at 517. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Najafi refused the breathalyzer test was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">To conclude, we avoid having to determine whether or not a police officer must afford the right to counsel to a detained driver in the administrative license suspension hearing, because the detaining officer afforded Najafi a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel, and there was substantial evidence to support ALJ Chapman\u2019s finding that Najafi refused to take the breathalyzer test.

In <em>Forman, </em>however, we were clear that the \"ALJ has the obligation of determining at the hearing whether the detaining officer has misstated the consequences of refusal, or whether the officer has clearly made the refusal option more attractive.\u201d <em>Forman, </em>332 Md. at 219, 630 A.2d at 763.

Twenty-three pages into the opinion there appears a paragraph beginning with this sentence: \u201cUltimately, however, our discussion in the instant case as to the effect, in the administrative context, of the applicability of a right to counsel prior to making a test election <em>is really dicta, </em>because Najafi <em>clearly </em>was given an opportunity to contact counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, in the last paragraph of the Majority opinion (op. at 188, 12 A.3d at 1270), it is stated that \u201cwe avoid having to determine whether or not a police officer must afford the right to counsel to a detained driver in the administrative license suspension hearing.... \u201d I construe these statements as conceding that: (1) the considerable discussion devoted to Petitioner\u2019s first question on certiorari is unnecessary to decide this case; and, (2) the first question is a moot one, on this record.
