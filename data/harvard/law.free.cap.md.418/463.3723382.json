Costs to be paid by the Appellees. Mandate to issue forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axc\">We now set forth our reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">On May 21, 2010, the Montgomery County Council signed into law Bill 13-10, establishing an Emergency Medical Services Transport Fee. Appellant, the Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Association (\u201cthe Association\u201d) sponsored a petition to challenge the bill through a referendum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To that end, the Association submitted a local petition for an advance determination of adequacy and Appellee, the Montgomery County Board of Elections<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cCounty Board\u201d) advised the Association that the format of the petition was acceptable. The County Board concurrently informed the Association that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>pursuant to Sections 114 and 115 of the Montgomery County Code, 50% of the total signatures required to place the referendum on the ballot were due by August 4 with the remaining signatures to be filed by August 19. On August 3 and 4, the Association submitted signature pages containing 33,740 signatures of which the Board accepted 13,021, or approximately 42% of the required signatures, thus failing to satisfy the 50% requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, on or before August 19, the Association submitted 18,937 signatures of which 5,317 were accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">On August 23, 2010, the Election Director for the County Board informed the Association that the August 4 filing would not be certified, pursuant to Md.Code (2003, 2010 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 6-208(a) and 6-210(d) of the Election Law Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because of the failure to comply with the 50% threshold signature requirement of Section 115. Consequently, the referendum question would not be placed on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Subsequently, on August 31, 2010, the Association filed a \u201cComplaint for Judicial Review and Declaratory Judgment\u201d in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, pursuant to \u00a7 6-209, in order to challenge the Board\u2019s refusal to certify the referendum petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The review was expedited due to the impending general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">According to the stipulation of facts submitted to the Circuit Court, the Board reviewed the entries on the petition for legal sufficiency using \u201camong other things the \u2018State of Maryland Petition Acceptance and Verification Procedures: Statewide or Public Local Law Referendum Petition (Rev. March 2009).\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Using criteria cited therein, the Board rejected 20,719 of the petition entries that were submitted on August 4 and 13,620 of the signatures that were submitted on August 19. The Association identified 15,287 signatures among the 23,111 entries that were rejected because of \u201clegibility\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> issues with the signature itself, and both parties stipulated to the placement, or \u201cbucketing,\u201d of those contested signatures into six categories distinguished by degrees of legibility, summarized <em>infra. </em>At oral argument before this Court, the Board conceded that if we agree with the Association\u2019s interpretation of the validation requirements of \u00a7 6-203, there would be sufficient signatures to meet the requirements under \u00a7 115 of the County Code without resorting to an independent review of the \u201cbucketed\u201d signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">On September 24, 2010, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Board concluding that it had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting illegible or partially legible signatures pursuant to the requirements of Maryland statutory and common law, particularly this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doe v. Board of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 962 A.2d 342 (2008). Subsequently, the Association and the County Board noted an Appeal and Cross-Appeal, respectively, to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals, we granted the petition for writ of certiorari filed by the Association and Mr. Bernard to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Is a signature on a local petition valid under Md.Code (2003, Supp.2010) \u00a7 6-203(a) of the Election Article if (i) an individual provides all the required printed information and that information is consistent with Maryland\u2019s voter registration list, (ii) the signer executes what she believes to be her lawful signature, legible or otherwise, and (iii) the petition circulator attests, as required by \u00a7 6-204, that the individual signed in his or her presence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Association and Eric N. Bernard v. Montgomery County Board of Elections and Montgomery County, Md., </em>415 Md. 610, 4 A.3d 514 (2010) (denying the County Board\u2019s conditional cross-petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In this case, the Board\u2019s determination that the Petition was ineligible for certification because of an insufficient number of valid signatures, made pursuant to its interpretation of \u00a7 6-203 (addressing petition signer information and validation) and our opinion in <em>Doe, </em>presents an issue of statutory construction and consequently one of law. <em>E.g. Opert v. Criminal Injuries, </em>403 Md. 587, 593, 943 A.2d 1229, 1232 (2008) (noting that in determining whether the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board had interpreted correctly an operative word in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act \u201c[t]he issue before us is, indeed, one of statutory construction and therefore one of law.\u201d); <em>see e.g. Malick v. Athenour, </em>37 Cal.App.4th 1120, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 281, 285-86 (1995) (holding that \u201c[t]he question of the validity of the disqualification of those signers who did not print separately each letter of their names was one of law \u2014 an issue to be resolved by the court. The trial court was not required to defer to the election department\u2019s interpretation of the law or ... adoption of a policy contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In the instant case, we conclude that the particular statutory provision at issue, i.e. \u00a7 6-203(a)(l), is clear and unambiguous, notwithstanding the utility of judicial gloss, and therefore we do not defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation. <em>Fire Fighters v. Cumberland, </em>407 Md. 1, 9, 962 A.2d 374, 378-79 (2008) (\u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d); and cases cited therein. (\u201cWhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u201d). <em>Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145, 1155 (2005) (quoting <em>Board of Physi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>cian v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-69, 729 A.2d 376, 380-381, fn. 2 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In <em>Doe, </em>this Court addressed whether the requirements of \u00a7 6-203 were mandatory or directory. The issue in <em>Doe was:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">Did the Circuit Court [for Montgomery County] err in ruling, contrary to the strict compliance standard dictated by this Court in an unbroken line of decisions, that specific signature requirements prescribed under the election laws for referenda petitions need not be met, with the result that a referendum petition carrying an insufficient number of valid signatures was certified for the ballot?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">406 Md. at 704, 962 A.2d at 346. Ultimately, we answered that question affirmatively, holding that the Circuit Court had erred in concluding that \u201cthe dictates of Section 6-203 were suggestive rather than required.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 727, 962 A.2d at 360. In <em>Doe, </em>we held that the plain meaning of \u00a7 6-203 was that the signature requirements in subsection (a)(1) were mandatory, as indicated by the direction that the signer \u201cshall\u201d provide a signature and other required printed or typed information. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 728, 962 A.2d at 360. To reach our decision in <em>Doe, </em>we relied upon our prior decision in <em>Barnes, etc. v. State, ex rel. Pinkney, </em>236 Md. 564, 571-72, 204 A.2d 787, 790-91 (1964), in which this Court held that the statutory provisions regarding referendum petitions within Code (1964 Supp.) Article 33, \u00a7 169, namely, address, precinct of registration, signature, and printed name \u201cpertain[ed] only to the identification of the signer\u201d and \u00a7\u00a7 169A-E provided \u201ccollateral measures to prevent fraud[.]\u201d Consistent with <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Doe, </em>we shall construe \u00a7\u00a7 6-203 and 6-204 (addressing the circulator\u2019s affidavit) together, in harmony, and in the context of the entire statutory scheme. In <em>Doe, </em>we concluded that when read together \u00a7\u00a7 6-203 and 6-207 (addressing verification of the petition entries) are not ambiguous. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 731-32, 962 A.2d at 362-63. Today, we emphasize that \u00a7 6-203 requires the Board to validate signatures placed on a petition for referendum, and we answer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>question that we were not asked to address in <em>Doe. </em>The question is whether a signature must be \u201clegible,\u201d when there is other information identifying the signer, in order to be counted pursuant to the petition validation and verification process. We hold that a signature on a petition for referendum is but one component of the voter\u2019s identity that is to be considered in the validation process, and that if the signer\u2019s entire entry is statutorily sufficient under \u00a7 6-203, an illegible signature, on its own, does not preclude validation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u201cIn statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision\u2019 ... We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute.... \u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 712, 962 A.2d at 350-51 and cases cited therein. Section 6-203 of the Election Law Article states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u00a7 6-203. Signers; information provided by signers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 To sign a petition, an individual shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(1) sign the individual\u2019s name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or the individual\u2019s surname of registration and at least one full given name and the initials of any other names; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(2) include the following information, printed or typed, in the spaces provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">(i) the signer\u2019s name as it was signed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">(ii) the signer\u2019s address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>(iii) the date of signing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">(iv) other information required by regulations adopted by the State Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">(b) <em>Validation and counting. </em>\u2014 The signature of an individual shall be validated and counted if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">(1) the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been satisfied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">(2) the individual is a registered voter assigned to the county specified on the signature page and, if applicable, in a particular geographic area of the county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">(3) the individual has not previously signed the same petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">(4) the signature is attested by an affidavit appearing on the page on which the signature appears;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">(5) the date accompanying the signature is not later than the date of the affidavit on the page; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">(6) if applicable, the signature was affixed within the requisite period of time, as specified by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">\u00a7 6-203(a) \u2014 (b). The parties contest the meaning of \u00a7 6-203(a)(1) that directs a petition signer that he or she shall: \u201csign the individual\u2019s name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or the individual\u2019s surname of registration and at least one full given name and the initials of any other names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Petitioner contends that a person\u2019s ordinary signature, notwithstanding illegibility, can satisfy \u00a7 6-203(a)(l). Specifically, Petitioner asserts that if the election authority is presented with printed information identifying the petition signer that is consistent with the information in the voter registration record, then \u00a7 6-203(b)(l) does not require rejection of the signature because of illegibility. The Board\u2019s misinterpretation of the statute, Petitioner argues, imposes a \u201cpenmanship\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requirement, thereby making the \u201csignature\u201d require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ment superfluous because the signature is required to \u201cmatch\u201d the printed name. Petitioner contends, further, that the Board\u2019s requirements nullify the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit, which \u201cis designed to assure the validity of the signatures.\u201d \u00a7 6 \u2014 204(b). Additionally, Petitioner notes the absurdity of an interpretation whereby the Board will reject signatures identical, or nearly identical to those on file with the Board\u2019s voter registration records. Finally, Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s interpretation does not prevent or enable detection of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Respondent counters, contending that the phrase \u201cas it appears on the statewide voter registration list\u201d means that the signature should be exactly as the printed name appears on the petition, i.e., that they should match. In basic terms, says Respondent, the Board cannot validate a signature it cannot read. The Board claims that it construed the Petition in strict compliance with \u00a7 6-203, as directed by this Court\u2019s interpretation of that provision as espoused in <em>Doe, </em>noting that there we stated, \u201cthe provisions [of \u00a7 6-203] are mandatory, not suggestive.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 728, 962 A.2d at 360. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that <em>Doe </em>compelled it to err on the side of exclusion, while prior to <em>Doe, </em>the Board had been more lenient and erred on the side of validation. Finally, Respondent maintains that it did not reject any signatures that were partially legible, only those it could not determine to be in compliance with \u00a7 6-203.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Plainly, the overarching goal of the entire Petition Subtitle is to ensure that only eligible voters sign petitions, hence the requirement for identifying information including name and address, including zip code. We now hold that \u00a7 6-203(b)(1) directs the election authority to validate a petition signer\u2019s entry if there is sufficient cumulative information on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the face of the petition, e.g., a signature, a printed name, address, date of signing, and other information required by regulation, evidencing compliance with \u00a7 6-203(a), to determine the identity of the signer. The Board should not stop the validation process merely because the signature is itself illegible. If the signature field is illegible, as may often be the case, the election authority is able pursuant to \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-204<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to validate a signature and \u201censure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 6-207.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">A. <em>Doe v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Doe, </em>this Court was asked to address, among other things, whether there was error in the certification of a referendum petition that allegedly failed to carry the required number of signatures because of non-compliance with the signature requirements of \u00a7 6-203. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 704, 962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>A.2d at 346. The trial judge in <em>Doe </em>held that \u00a7 6-203 was directory, not mandatory, and therefore \u201c10,876 signatures challenged on the basis of alleged violations of \u00a7 6-203 [were] valid, because [the County Board] determined that all non-disqualified signatories were registered voters and residents of Montgomery County.\u201d First, he reasoned that because the validation and verification provisions, namely \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-207, when read together, created ambiguity about the meaning and purpose of validation under \u00a7 6-203, the statute did not require strict compliance. Moreover, the trial judge said that the responsibility of the Board under the statute was to ensure \u201conly that signatories to the petition were registered voters and ... detecting cases of patent fraud.\u201d We held in <em>Doe </em>that the challenged signatures were invalid as a matter of law, reasoning that the trial judge had misconstrued \u00a7 6-203 to be directory based on his erroneous conclusion that \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-207 created ambiguity about the validation process. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 733, 962 A.2d at 363-.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Doe, </em>the State Board altered the manner in which it approached signature review on submitted petitions as evidenced by the revised \u201cState of Maryland Petition Acceptance and Verification Procedures: Statewide or Public Local Law Referendum Petition.\u201d (Revised March 2009). According to the guidelines, the validator must first determine if the printed name matches the signature exactly. If not, the signature is invalidated. If the signature and the printed name match, the validator must consult a schedule of examples that show acceptable and unacceptable names.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>As reflected in the present case, the County Board, following the State Board\u2019s instructions, has put an unduly burdensome emphasis on the signature component of the petition entry, by requiring an exact \u201cmatch\u201d between a signature on the petition and printed name, as it appears on the voter registration list, all in the name of compliance with our decision in <em>Doe.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> See Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 573, 204 A.2d at 791-92 (noting that the legislation implementing the constitutional right to referendum must not be unduly burdensome on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>exercise of the right). The necessary inference from the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6-203 is that the petitioning party would essentially be compelled to obtain a copy of the statewide voter registration list and advise persons prior to signing the petition that they should consult the list and sign and print their name precisely as it appears on that list. Otherwise, the likelihood of certification would be very slim. There is no indication in the statute that this collateral process is required when exercising the right to referendum. The validation guidelines, excerpted <em>supra </em>in footnote 14, which the State Board revised subsequent to our decision in <em>Doe, </em>distort the purpose of \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) that is to provide one element among many that the Board must use to satisfy the requirements of validation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">B. Legibility</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Section 6-203(a)(l) does not address \u201clegibility,\u201d or \u201cpenmanship,\u201d of the signature, and for the Board to impose such a strict requirement reaches beyond the scope of the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the instant case, the Board specifically rejected signatures based on varying degrees of illegibility. As noted in the Circuit Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">The parties stipulate that the challenged, [not valid] signatures fall into six categories: a) legible, full name \u2014 the signature is legible, and includes all letters in their surname, one given name, and another name or initial. Total category signatures: 457; b) legible, not full name \u2014 the signature is legible and includes all letters for the given name and one surname, but no additional name or initial. Total category signatures: 3,091; c) partially legible, full name \u2014 the signature appears to include the signer\u2019s sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>name, one given name, and one additional name or middle initial, but not all the letters in one or more of the names are discernible. Total category signatures: 851; d) partially legible, not full name \u2014 the signature includes at least one name, though the letters in that name are not all discernible. Total category signatures: Total category signatures: 4,455; e) partially legible, discernible letters\u2014 the signature includes some discernible letters. Total category signatures: Total category signatures: 3,456; f) illegible \u2014 the signature includes no or virtually no discernible letters. Total category signatures: 2,977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County held particularly that the County Board had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting categories (e) and (f) <em>supra </em>reasoning that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doe </em>\u201ccertainly suggests that the Court of Appeals believes that indecipherable signatures ought to be disallowed without further consideration.\u201d To the contrary, our holding in <em>Doe </em>did not address \u201clegibility,\u201d and we disavow that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The printed or typed name, as we held in <em>Barnes, </em>was one piece of evidence, in addition to voter address and voter \u201cprecinct or district\u201d that would be used to ensure \u201cthat only qualified persons have signed.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d at 791. Plainly the statutory description of a signature in \u00a7 6-203(a) is different than the statutory description under review in <em>Barnes, </em>however, the signature has not now become uniquely controlling. An illegible signature, therefore, is not dispositive within the validation process, but should be considered as part of the entire petition entry, that must be used to identify the individual signer under \u00a7 6-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">C. Sections 6-203 and 6-204 \u2014 Validation</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">When read together, \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-204 are not ambiguous. Section 6-204 requires that every signature page of a petition include \u201can affidavit made and executed by the individual in whose presence all of the signatures on that page were affixed and who observed each of those signatures being affixed.\u201d The purpose of the circulator\u2019s attestation is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cassure the validity of the signatures and the fairness of the petition process.\u201d \u00a7 6-204(b). This statutory provision for the affidavit of a circulator who attests under penalty of perjury that the signer affixed his or her information in the circulator\u2019s presence clearly addresses prevention of fraud in the petitioning process and is plainly intended to bolster the validity of the signature entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">D. Sections 6-203 and 6-207 \u2014 Validation and Verification</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As we held in <em>Doe, </em>when read together \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-207 are not ambiguous. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 731-32, 962 A.2d at 362-63. Plainly, the purpose of the signature requirement in \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) is to provide a personal attestation, as a signature is often used, to evidence support for the petition and to provide a unique identifier in conjunction with the printed name, address, date, and other information required by the State Board. The later information is used to subsequently verify the eligibility of the petition signer to support the petition. In <em>Barnes, </em>this Court said that the statutory requirements of the predecessor to \u00a7 6-203, Code (1964 Supp.), Article 33, \u00a7 169,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> namely the \u201cresidence of each signer and the precinct or district wherein he is registered as a voter ... and below his signature his name ... either printed or typed ... pertain only to the <em>identification of the signer.\u201d Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571, 204 A.2d at 791 (emphasis added). Therefore, we restate our conclusion in <em>Barnes, </em>that the signature provided under \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) is but one of many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>pieces of identifying information that the Board must assess to determine the validity of a petition entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Plainly, however, \u201c[t]he purpose of signature verification under paragraph (1) of this subsection [\u00a7 6-207] is to ensure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter.\u201d \u00a7 6-207(a)(2). Pursuant to \u00a7 6-207, the election authority must verify and count the validated signatures of persons that are listed as registered voters. Section 6 \u2014 207(b) authorizes the State Board to \u201cestablish the process ... for verifying and counting signatures,\u201d but that authority does not permit the Board to impose any additional elements relating to validation under \u00a7 6-203, e.g., legibility of a signature. Here, when the Board was confronted with an illegible signature, it should have consulted the additional identifying information provided in accordance with \u00a7 6-203(a)(2), and then compared that information against the statewide voter registration list, instead of invalidating the entry. The signature alone, when reading \u00a7\u00a7 6-203 and 6-207 together, is not meant to be. dispositive on the issue of validity, because all the required information is used both to validate and then to verify in order that only eligible voters sign petitions. That is the goal of the validation and verification process.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-5\">HARRELL and BATTAGLIA, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\">. <em>See </em>Article 16 of the Maryland Constitution; Md.Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 25A, \u00a7 8 (power of referendum in chartered counties of Maryland); Montgomery County Charter \u00a7 114-115; <em>Doe v.

Perfecting the use of our thumbs, modern descendants of the first Homo Sapiens, unlike other primates, are able to sign their names, in cursive, in a legible manner. This skill requires focus and practice, as the Nuns and others taught us. Today, the Majority opinion strikes a de-evolutionary blow by rewarding failure to put into practice that skill. From this day, our progeny will be able to measure the inevitable decline of our opposable thumbs into vestigial limbs. As a sign to our posterity that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>among us those who sought to avert that result, Judge Battaglia and I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Montgomery County Board of Elections (\u201cthe Board\u201d) rejected 34,339 signatures on the petitions circulated and submitted by or on behalf of the Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Association (\u201cthe Association\u201d). Of that amount, 23,111 were for signature-related reasons. The Association challenged 15,287 of those 23,111 signatures, each of which it placed, for purposes of appeal, into one of six categories or \u201cbuckets,\u201d reflecting varying degrees of legibility (or illegibility). To prevail, the Association\u2019s task was to persuade this Court to conclude that at least 12,395 of the 15,287 \u201csignatures\u201d were excluded improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The Majority opinion, crowning with success the Association\u2019s effort, replaces Title 6 of the Election Law Article with a newly-formulated guideline, explained <em>infra. </em>Regrettably, the Majority neglects to instruct the Board how to apply that guideline. Mimicking minimalism, it states simply that, as \u201cconceded\u201d by the Board at oral argument, if this Court \u201cagree[d] with the Association\u2019s interpretation of ... \u00a7 6-203,\u201d we need not engage in \u201can independent review of the \u2018bucketed\u2019 signatures.\u201d Majority op. at 468, 15 A.3d at 801.

This conclusion cuts against the clear language of the statute. <em>Doe v.

Judge Battaglia and I agree certainly with this principle. This does not give the Majority free rein, however, to look beyond the plain words of the statute, where those words are clear and unambiguous. Rather, when the Legislature says what it means, <em>i.e., </em>what it intends, <em>see Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles v. Greyhound Corp., </em>247 Md. 662, 668, 234 A.2d 255, 258 (1967) (\u201cThe legislative intent is to be sought in the first instance in the words used in the statute ....\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the Court is duty-bound to carry into effect \u201cclear and unambiguous [statutory] language,\u201d \u201ceven if [we] might be of the opinion that the policy of the legislation is <em>unwise, or even harsh or unjust, </em>if no constitutional guarantees are impaired by the legislation.\u201d <em>Greyhound Corp., </em>247 Md. at 668-69, 234 A.2d at 258 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

An illegible handwritten signature is not compliant with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>After today, however, a voter no longer need sign his or her name. Rather, a voter may provide a single illegible, indiscernible, unintelligible and otherwise meaningless mark, which may (or may not) be close to his or her actual signature. In effect, the Majority opinion has read the signature requirement out of the statute. It collapses the \u201chandwritten signature\u201d requirement of \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) and the \u201cadditional information\u201d requirements of \u00a7 6-203(a)(2) into a totality of the circumstances test: \u00a7 6-203(b)(l) authorizes validation \u201cif there is <em>sufficient cumulative information </em>on the face of the petition, e.g. a signature, a printed name, address, date of signing, and other information required by regulation----\u201d Majority op. at 474, 15 A.3d at 804 (emphasis added). In doing so, the Majority articulates its desired statutory scheme, not that of the Legislature. At bottom, the General Assembly enumerated specific requirements, from which the voter is not free to pick and choose. That is especially true with the \u201chandwritten signature\u201d \u2014 a requirement which the Legislature placed first in the panoply, separate from the rest of the requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The Majority is clear that, in its view, \u201c[\u00a7] 6-203(a)(l) does not address legibility, or penmanship, of the signature, and for the Board to impose such a strict requirement reaches beyond the scope of the statute.\u201d Majority op. at 477, 15 A.3d at 806. We submit, however, that the Legislature would have not installed a \u201chandwritten signature\u201d requirement, which describes two detailed ways a voter may sign, unless it expected (i.e., presumed) that the voter sign legibly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Majority opinion highlights also that \u201cother States have specifically addressed legibility in their election laws, but the Maryland General Assembly has not.\u201d Majority op. at 477, 15 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>806 n. 15 (citations omitted.)

To do so, the group\u2019s representatives acquired handwritten signatures on its petitions, some of which were challenged as \u201cfailing] to mirror the voter\u2019s identity on the statewide voter registration list.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 709, 962 A.2d at 349.

Such an \u201cexact \u2018match\u2019 \u201d is not so required, the Majority holds, because \u201c[t]he necessary inference ... is that the petitioning party would essentially be compelled to obtain a copy of the statewide voter registration list and advise persons prior to signing ... that they should consult the list and sign and print their name[s] precisely as [they] appear[ ] on that list.\u201d Majority op. at 476-78, 15 A.3d at 806-07.

The Court was not confronted with whether the handwritten signatures had to match the printed names; the question was whether the handwritten signatures had to \u201cmirror the voter\u2019s identity on the statewide voter registration list.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 709, 962 A.2d at 349. In <em>Doe, </em>voters\u2014 who had two possible ways to \u201csign\u201d the petition \u2014 chose the \u201cas it appears on the ... registration list\u201d route and failed to comply. Those voters <em>could have </em>signed with their \u201csurname of registration,\u201d etc. and, thereby, avoided most of the \u201cmirroring\u201d obligations, but they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The present case raises the same issue as in <em>Doe. </em>As such, our conclusion in <em>Doe\u25a0 </em>\u2014 that the <em>\u201cspecific </em>signature requirements\u201d in \u00a7 6-203 are mandatory \u2014 should be dispositive of the present case. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 704, 962 A.2d at 346 (emphasis added) (quoting the relevant question presented). The primary shortcoming of the bucketed signatures, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>is <em>not </em>that voters failed to print their names exactly as they had signed it under \u00a7 6-203(a)(2)(i); it is that voters failed to sign legibly, so that the Board could not discern whether the signature (1) \u201cmirror[ed]\u201d the statewide voter registration list under \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) or, in the alternative, (2) fulfilled the tenets of the second manner of signing\u2014 \u201csurname of registration,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The Majority opinion acknowledges that the \u201c[t]he parties contest the meaning of \u00a7 6-203(a)(l),\u201d the signature requirement, as opposed to the \u201cmatching\u201d requirement of \u00a7 6-203(a)(2)(i). Majority op. at 472, 15 A.3d at 803. In its Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the present case, the Board clarified that it did not reject any signature unless it was illegible because then \u201cit could not be discerned whether the person \u2018sign[ed their] name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or the ... surname of registration\u2019,\u201d etc. (quoting \u00a7 6-203(a)(l)). Thus, the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>opined that \u201c[t]he voter must sign his name as it appears on the voter registration list....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">For its part, the Association sought to make this case about the Board rejecting signatures which did not match printed names. The first step in the validation process is, no doubt, to examine \u201cif the printed name matches the signature exactly.\u201d The second step, according to the Board\u2019s guidelines, however, asks whether the name mirrors the statewide voter registration list or is acceptable under part two of \u00a7 6-203(a)(l), \u201csurname of registration,\u201d etc. In <em>either </em>case \u2014 if an election official finds that a signature does not match the printed name or that a signature does not fulfill the handwritten signature requirements \u2014 he or she must invalidate it using the <em>same </em>code, RS (\u201cRegistration Signature does not meet criteria\u201d). Using this encompassing RS code, the Board rejected 22,447 signatures here. Even the Association recognized, in its Petition for Writ of Certiorari, that the printed names are relevant to the extent they represent \u201cadditional information\u201d that \u201cconfirm[s]\u201d the voters were \u201cregistered ... in Montgomery County ... and had executed their lawful, normal signatures.\u201d In other words, the Association hopes that the printed names mitigate the signatures\u2019 illegibility, rather than satisfy the matching requirement of \u00a7 6-203(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B. \u201cRequirements\u201d are Required.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the primary focus should be on the matching of the handwritten signatures to the printed names, the Majority opinion remains flawed. In <em>Doe, </em>we held relevantly that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the words \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018requirements\u2019 in [$ ] <em>6-203 </em>reflect that ... the provisions are mandatory, not suggestive.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 728, 962 A.2d at 360. As a result, \u201cwe decline[d] the invitation to reverse our past holding that a signer is required to comply with the signature requirements governing petitions for referendum.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 732-33, 962 A.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Among the signature requirements, to which we referred in <em>Doe, </em>is the mandate that a voter print his/her name \u201cas it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>signed.\u201d \u00a7 6-203(a)(2)(i). As \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) instructs voters to sign in a specific way, their printed names should also appear in a specific way. Without a legible handwritten signature, election authorities are left unable to ascertain if voters fulfilled the printed name requirement. It must be fulfilled because voters are not free to pick and choose among the mandatory requirements of \u00a7 6-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">C. The Majority Opinion\u2019s \u201cNecessary Inference\u201d is Unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The Majority opinion bases its conclusion on the happening of an event which has not happened, <em>ie., </em>the institution of a collateral process whereby a \u201cpetitioning party would ... be compelled to obtain a copy of the statewide voter registration list and advise persons prior to signing the petition that they should consult the list and sign and print their name precisely as it appears on that list.\u201d Majority op. at 476-78, 15 A.3d at 806-07. Its concern for the development of such a process is fallacious, although perhaps a petition-gatherer would be wise to advise solicited voters that there are two ways of signing by hand, one of which entails the voter recalling how his or her name appears on the statewide voter registration list and the other requires much less recollective retention and should be executable by most.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As the trial court noted, the solution is as simple as instructing voters that \u201c\u2018[w]hen in doubt [as to your registration name], write your full name and sign your full name.\u201d After all, \u201che [or she] cannot err by inscribing more information than necessary.\u201d Perhaps that is why one Association petition solicitor achieved a signature-acceptance rate of 84 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The Majority opinion\u2019s conclusion also contradicts the Legislature\u2019s intent. The Majority opinion asserts that \u201cthe overarching goal of the entire Petition Subtitle is to ensure that only eligible voters sign petitions.... \u201d Majority op. at 473, 15 A.3d at 804. We disagree. The express goal of <em>\u00a7 6-207 </em>\u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>to ensure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter.\u201d \u00a7 6-207(a)(2). The goal of \u00a7 6-203 \u2014 the provision at issue in the present case \u2014 is related, but distinct. Its goal is to root out fraud and other irregularities.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Because the Majority opinion assumes the general purpose of Title 6 of the Election Law Article is to identify registered voters, it is able to conclude more easily that a handwritten signature is \u201cbut one component\u201d to be considered. Majority op. at 471,15 A.3d at 802. As such, \u201can illegible signature does not preclude validation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Majority reaches its holding \u2014 regarding the \u201cbut one component\u201d description of the handwritten signature requirement \u2014 by relying upon <em>Barnes, etc. v. State, ex rel. Pinkney, </em>236 Md. 564, 204 A.2d 787 (1964). <em>See </em>Majority op. at 480, 15 A.3d at 808 (\u201c[W]e restate our conclusion in <em>Barnes </em>[ ] that the signature provided under \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) is but one of many pieces of identifying information that the Board must assess to determine the validity of a petition entry.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Barnes </em>considered the question of whether the Legislature could demand that each petition signer provide not just his or her handwritten signature, but also his or her address, precinct, and printed name. At the time the facts of <em>Barnes </em>occurred, some forty-seven years ago, the applicable statute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">In every petition (including an associated or related set of petitions) under the provisions of Article XVI of the State Constitution, there shall be appended to the signature of each signer his residence, the precinct or district wherein he is registered as a voter, and immediately below the signature of any such signer, there shall be either printed or typed, the name of such signer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Maryland Code (1941, 1962 Repl. Vol, 1964 Supp.), Article 33, \u00a7 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">At that time, the Maryland Constitution stated, however, that \u201cno other verification shall be required,\u201d aside from the handwritten signature. MD. CONST, art. XVI, \u00a7 4 (amended 1976; 1982). We held that the additional requirements of \u00a7 169 did not conflict with the constitutional right to referenda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>because they \u201cpertain[ed] only to the identification of the signer.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571, 204 A.2d at 791 (\u201cClearly, the provisions of the [constitutional] Article will be furthered if ... a referendum petition is to be put upon the ballot only if it has the requisite number of genuine signature of <em>registered voters. \u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The Majority opinion here concludes from <em>Barnes </em>that all the requirements outlined in \u00a7 6-203 \u2014 from handwritten signature to additional information \u2014 exist for identification purposes solely. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 478, 15 A.3d at 807 (\u201cAn illegible signature ... should be considered as part of the <em>entire </em>petition entry, that must be used to <em>identify </em>the individual signer under \u00a7 6-203.\u201d) (emphasis added). According to the Majority, these requirements should be considered collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Since <em>Barnes, </em>the Legislature enacted in 1998 the current version of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where previously we noted a distinction between \u201cidentification\u201d and \u201cverification,\u201d the current statute equates the two. <em>See </em>\u00a7 6-207(a)(2) (\u201cThe purpose of signature verification ... is to ensure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a <em>registered voter.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, where the former statute in <em>Barnes </em>separated the \u201chandwritten signature\u201d requirement from the other information, the current statute requires that voters actually \u201csign\u201d the petition by providing their signature <em>and </em>the additional information. Thus, the additional information is no longer merely for identification purposes; it is needed, in the first instance, to \u201csign\u201d the petition, then for \u201cvalidation,\u201d and ultimately for identification, or \u201cverification.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The 1998 statutory changes underscore two important observations. First, the Majority opinion misses the mark when it equates signing and \u201cvalidation\u201d with identification, <em>i.e., </em>it collapses the \u201cvalidation\u201d and \u201cverification\u201d processes, respectively. In \u00a7 6-203, the Legislature discusses the process of signing and \u201cvalidation.\u201d At this stage, the General Assembly is concerned with rooting out fraud and other irregularities. For example, \u00a7 6 \u2014 203(3)\u2014(5) instruct validators to examine whether: (3) the voter has previously signed the same petition, (4) the circulator attests to the entry, and (5) the signature date is not later than the attestation date. <em>Compare Doe, </em>406 Md. at 732, 962 A.2d at 363 (\u201cThe purpose of validation, relating to whether the signature is sufficient, is to \u2018provide additional means by which fraudulent or otherwise improper signatures upon a referendum petition may be detected.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bames, </em>236 Md. at 574, 204 A.2d at 793) <em>with id. </em>(\u201c[T]he purpose of signature verification, relating to the existence of [the] <em>registration of the voter </em>and the signature count, is to \u2018ensure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a <em>registered voter.\u201d\u2019) </em>(quoting \u00a7 6-207(a)(2)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>By assuming that the requirements in \u00a7 6-203 serve only the purpose associated with \u00a7 6-207, <em>i.e., </em>identification or \u201cverification,\u201d the Majority opinion is able to conclude that \u2014 to achieve adequately the goal of identification \u2014 the election authority, realistically speaking, does not need each piece of information required by \u00a7 6-203. Rather, just some pieces, taken together, may supply the election authority with enough to determine whether a voter is registered properly. Unfortunately, the Majority opinion overlooks the fact that the requirements of \u00a7 6-203 dictate how a voter actually \u201csign[s]\u201d a petition in the first instance. The Legislature provided but one way to \u201csign a petition,\u201d and it required multiple pieces of information. To convey that information, legibility is no doubt an integral ingredient. The Majority overlooks also that \u00a7 6-203 serves an invaluable, independent purpose from \u00a7 6-207\u2014 to detect fraud and other irregularities, as opposed to confirm proper voter registration. Rather, the Majority would allow voters to bypass the Legislature\u2019s statutory safeguards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Second, however one perceives the distinction between validation and verification, we glean from the 1998 enactment of the current statute additional evidence about the importance of the handwritten signature requirement. The statute in <em>Barnes </em>required only that voters sign their name, without specifying <em>how. </em>Presumably, therefore, less or no premium was placed on the legibility of that signature. In \u00a7 6-203(a)(1), the Legislature demanded more from a voter, instructing how he or she should sign his or her name. The Majority opinion eliminates this provision and, instead, resurrects and reinstates the <em>Barnes </em>statute, in direct contravention of the Legislature\u2019s present intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In enacting Title 6, the Legislature weighed the risk of authentic signatures being rejected against the value of rooting out fraud and deceit. The Legislature balanced also the benefit of ensuring registered voters are heard against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>cost of election authorities spending substantial time and money scrutinizing illegible signatures, trying to match them to records. Indeed, Board employees here devoted more than 3,000 hours, over 20 days, reviewing the petitions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Today, this Court dons the cloak of a legislator to readjust these balances. Our job, however, is to say what the statutory law is, not what we wish it to be, even if we think that law \u201cunwise,\u201d \u201charsh,\u201d and \u201cunjust.\u201d <em>Greyhound Corp., </em>247 Md. at 668-69, 234 A.2d at 258 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Majority opinion orders election authorities to disregard otherwise clear legislative instructions and instead conduct, for each petition entry, a painstaking analysis to compensate for failed penmanship. It does not instruct the election authorities, however, how much weight they should give each completed requirement, or what combination of requirements satisfies the statute, or if they must exhaust all identification efforts before invalidating a signature. How does a voter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201csign\u201d a petition? After today, there is no clear answer. The Majority makes the individual requirements suggestive and, in the process, renders <em>Doe </em>a dead letter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed in this Dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">.

The Majority opinion does not suggest that the fulfillment of any other requirement in \u00a7 6-203 may be illegible, except for the \"handwritten signature.\u201d The Legislature, however, required each provision of \u00a7 6-203 to be met by specific information provided in a specific way (e.g., \"printed or typed\"). The Legislature did not omit, expressly or impliedly, the \"handwritten signature\" requirement from the same type of particularity or legibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">. In anticipation of a comprehensive revision of the Election Code, the General Assembly authorized a Commission to Revise the Election Code.

We pause to question just what does the Majority opinion hold on this point? We said in <em>Barnes </em>that \"legislation to implement the referendum provisions of the Constitution must be reasonable and must not place any undue burden on the exercise of that constitutional right.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Barnes, etc. v. State, ex rel. Pinkney, </em>236 Md. 564, 573, 204 A.2d 787, 791-92 (1964). Even though the State Board\u2019s guidelines, in the present case, merely restate (nearly verbatim) the requirements of \u00a7 6-203, the Court appears to hold today that those guidelines, rather than \u00a7 6-203, impose an unreasonable and undue burden. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 476, 15 A.3d at 805-06 n. 14; <em>see also Dutton v.

The General Assembly did not state in the Election Code that purported signers are merely required to provide enough information for the [Board of Elections (\"BOE\u201d) ] to determine that a person bearing at least a similar name is registered. It demanded that more detailed information be provided than what the BOE relied upon here, which, frankly, is no more than could be pulled from a local telephone directory. Without the information the General Assembly wisely required, an overly-zealous petition circulator could simply leaf through a phonebook and sign for County residents using the name and address information provided. Based on the standards the BOE admits it applied, these \"signatures\u201d would all pass muster, even though only partial name information was provided, so long as there was overlap with some of the data in the voter registration list. The General Assembly's simple expedient of requiring signers to identify themselves by their full names and/or initials is an important safeguard against the fraud that can easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>occur in a referendum petition process. <em>See, e.g., Citizens Comm. for D.C.

[The Board's] counsel represented at argument that where the first letters of required names were discernible, the signature was counted. It is difficult to believe that the average person, with a modicum of effort, cannot impress upon a paper at least a rudimentary signature that would meet the statute\u2019s requirements. While not all of us have the talent to be calligraphers, surely most are able to sign legibly enough that a match with a printed name can be made.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
