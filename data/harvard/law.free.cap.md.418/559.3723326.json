The first of those is TR \u00a7 16-117.1, which provides in relevant part that, upon satisfaction of certain requirements, a licensee may \u201cappl[y] for the expungement of the licensee\u2019s public driving record.\u201d We must decide how that section is to be applied, given a separate provision of that subtitle, TR \u00a7 12-lll(b)(2), which authorizes the MVA to maintain \u201cconfidential\u201d records. We also must interpret TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1), which provides in relevant part that the MVA \u201cmay not\u201d issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual whose privilege to drive is \u201crevoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state[.]\u201d And, we must decide whether a licensee who is disqualified for licensure under TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1) is entitled to an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that TR \u00a7 16-117.1, the expungement provision, when read in harmony with TR \u00a7 12-lll(b)(2), authorizes the MVA, after five years, to remove from a licensee\u2019s public driving record any record of drunken driving convictions and probation before judgment dispositions, rendering the records of those convictions and dispositions no longer part of the licensee\u2019s public driving record and therefore not subject to expungement. We further hold that the MVA properly denies an individual\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license without an administrative hearing when the applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license is suspended, revoked, refused, or canceled in another state. That is so even if the MVA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>through mistake or oversight, has previously granted the individual a Maryland driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Petitioner Thomas Headen\u2019s record of drunken driving offenses spans three decades and involves drunken driving dispositions in two states, Maryland and Florida. In Maryland, Petitioner was convicted in 1976, 1978, and 1982 of driving while impaired by or under the influence of alcohol. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and received probation before judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In October 1994, Petitioner moved to Florida and was issued a Florida driver\u2019s license. As required by that state\u2019s law, Petitioner surrendered his Maryland license. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 322.03(l)(b) (LexisNexis 2011). Nine months later, Petitioner was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Pursuant to Florida\u2019s administrative process (analogous to Maryland\u2019s administrative process, set forth in TR \u00a7 16-205. 1), Petitioner\u2019s license was suspended administratively for one year upon his refusal to submit to an alcohol concentration test. In September 1995, a Florida court convicted him of driving under the influence of alcohol. Pursuant to Florida law, the court ordered the permanent revocation of Petitioner\u2019s Florida license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Petitioner later returned to Maryland and, in 2001, applied for a Maryland driver\u2019s license. On November 1, 2001, the MVA summarily denied the application, in light of the permanent revocation of Petitioner\u2019s Florida driver\u2019s license. The MVA\u2019s action was based on Article V, subsection (2) of the Driver License Compact (\u201cthe Compact\u201d), and TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1). The Compact, which is codified at TR \u00a7 16-703, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the applicant if: ... (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of 1 year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1) prohibits the MVA from issuing a license \u201c[d]uring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked ... in this or any other state.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Petitioner requested and was granted an administrative hearing to challenge the MVA\u2019s summary denial of his license application. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disagreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>with the MVA\u2019s interpretation of the Compact and ordered the MVA to \u201cprocess [Petitioner\u2019s] application for a driver\u2019s license, and conduct an appropriate investigation to determine whether it is safe to grant [Petitioner] a Maryland driver\u2019s license.\u201d The MVA did not seek judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. On March 8, 2002, the MVA issued Petitioner a \u201cMaryland Only\u201d license. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-113(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Three years later, this Court issued its opinion in <em>Gwin v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822 (2005). We held in <em>Gwin </em>that the plain language of TR \u00a7 16-103.1 prohibits the MVA from issuing a driver\u2019s license to an individual whose driving privileges, at the time of application, have been suspended or revoked by any jurisdiction. We explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alf\">[T]here is no conflict between [TR \u00a7 16-103.1], which permits the MVA to deny a driver\u2019s license to an individual whose driver\u2019s license has been revoked in Maryland or any other state, and the Driver License Compact.... The clear legislative intent of these two statutes indicates that Maryland law recognizes extraterritorial license revocations and the MVA is not permitted to issue a license to an individual whose license has been permanently revoked in another jurisdiction, even after a period of one year of the revocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 445, 869 A.2d at 824 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On November 15, 2006, the day that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMaryland Only\u201d driver\u2019s license was to expire, Petitioner applied for renewal of it. The MVA summarily denied the application. Petitioner spoke by telephone to MVA officials, seeking an explanation for the summary denial. He later memorialized that conversation in a letter to the MVA dated January 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The MVA responded to Petitioner\u2019s correspondence by letter dated February 13, 2007. The MVA advised Petitioner that the permanent revocation of his Florida driver\u2019s license automatically disqualified him from renewing his Maryland license, pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1). The MVA further advised Petitioner that, because he was automatically disquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>fied, he was not entitled to a hearing to contest the MVA\u2019s denial of his application for license renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Petitioner, evidently in an attempt to remove from his driving record the Maryland drunken driving convictions that precipitated the permanent revocation of his license in Florida, applied for expungement of his Maryland driving record, pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-117.1. By letter dated June 20, 2007, the MVA notified Petitioner that it had expunged certain of Petitioner\u2019s driving records by removing several motor vehicle violations and various other notations. The MVA, however, did not expunge any of Petitioner\u2019s 1976, 1978, and 1982 Maryland drunken driving convictions or his 1993 probation before judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">By letter dated August 20, 2007, Petitioner, through counsel, sought a hearing on the MVA\u2019s refusal to renew Petitioner\u2019s license and \u201cfailure to expunge [Petitioner\u2019s] driving record pursuant to his request under [TR] \u00a7 16-117.1.\u201d The MVA responded by letter dated May 1, 2008, explaining that, under <em>Gwin, </em>385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822, and TR \u00a7 16-103.1, Petitioner was disqualified automatically from obtaining a Maryland driver\u2019s license and therefore not entitled to a hearing. The MVA also explained in the May 1, 2008 letter that the drunken driving convictions and probation before judgment dispositions remained only on Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d driving record and were not part of his \u201cpublic driving record.\u201d The MVA further explained that, unlike a \u201cpublic driving record,\u201d a \u201cconfidential\u201d record of a conviction or probation before judgment disposition for driving under the influence is never subject to expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Pursuant to TR \u00a7 12-lll(b)(2), about which we shall say more later in this opinion, the MVA \u201cmay classify as confidential and not open to public inspection any record or record entry: (i) That is over 5 years old; or (ii) That relates to any happening that occurred over 5 years earlier.\u201d Government agencies, though, have access to those records that the MVA has classified as confidential, pursuant to TR \u00a7 12 \u2014 111 (b) (3). As a consequence, even though Petitioner\u2019s public driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>record was expunged, he presumably remains subject to permanent revocation in Florida, because the Florida licensing authority continues to have access to Petitioner\u2019s confidential driving record and, hence, his Maryland drunken driving convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The MVA advised Petitioner in the May 1, 2008 letter that his only avenue of redress would be through appropriate action in a court of law. Acting pursuant to that suggestion, Petitioner sought judicial review of the MVA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Judicial Review in Circuit Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Petitioner initiated judicial review on May 22, 2008, by filing in the Circuit Court for Charles County a petition for judicial review of the MVA\u2019s actions, pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2009 ReplVol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government . Article (\u201cSG\u201d). On June 20, 2008, he \u201camended\u201d the petition to a complaint for issuance of a writ of administrative mandamus, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rules 7-401 through 7-403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">At the hearing on the complaint for issuance of the writ, Petitioner challenged both the MVA\u2019s summary denial of his application for renewal of the 2002 license and the MVA\u2019s refusal to expunge the \u201cconfidential\u201d record of Petitioner\u2019s drunken driving convictions. With regard to his challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the summary denial of his license-renewal request, Petitioner conceded that, if he was subject to the holding of our 2005 <em>Gwin </em>decision, he would not be entitled to license renewal. Petitioner argued, though, that, because he was granted a Maryland license in 2001 despite, at that time, the permanent revocation of his Florida driver\u2019s license, he was entitled to an administrative hearing to determine whether, in fact, he was subject to <em>Gwin. </em>The MVA countered that the plain language of the automatic disqualification section, TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1), states (in the words of counsel for the MVA): \u201cif you\u2019re suspended or revoked in another State[,] [then in] Maryland you can\u2019t get a license.\u201d Moreover, argued the MVA, <em>Gwin </em>unquestionably applies to Petitioner and he therefore is not entitled to an administrative hearing, which in any event would be a \u201cpurely ministerial act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">With regard to his challenge to the MVA\u2019s refusal to expunge his prior drunken driving convictions and probation before judgment disposition, Petitioner made a statutory construction argument. He contended that the MVA is permitted to maintain only one class of driving records, which, upon satisfaction of the statutory criteria listed in TR \u00a7 16-117.1, must be expunged in their entirety. The MVA disagreed. The MVA argued that, when TR \u00a7 16-117.1 (which requires expungement of the licensee\u2019s \u201cpublic driving record\u201d under certain circumstances) is read together with TR \u00a7 12-111(b)(2) (which authorizes the MVA to classify certain records as \u201cconfidential\u201d), it is evident that the MVA is authorized, after 5 years, to maintain as confidential some or all of a licensee\u2019s driving records, and only that portion, if any, of the licensee\u2019s record that remains \u201cpublic\u201d is subject to expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the Circuit Court agreed with Petitioner that he was entitled to an administrative hearing to determine whether his license revocation in Florida precluded him from licensure in Maryland. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">What I\u2019m going to do is ... I\u2019m going to grant the remand [for an administrative hearing] ... and, again, it may be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>no import, but I am going to order remand to allow him to have that hearing that was denied, and the reason given was you\u2019re not going to win it anyway.- I think that\u2019s still procedurally the right thing to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The Circuit Court rejected Petitioner\u2019s contention regarding expungement. The court noted that the MVA \u201cdid expunge\u201d Petitioner\u2019s driving record \u201cto some extent---- They did expunge ... the public record aspect.\u201d The court added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of the definition of what\u2019s the expungement. And, so I\u2019m going to deny that portion of\u2019 Petitioner\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Petitioner petitioned this Court for further review, as did the MVA by way of cross-petition. We granted both the petition and cross-petition to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">(1) Whether the Circuit Court erred in affirming the MVA\u2019s refusal to expunge selected traffic convictions based on its interpretation of TR \u00a7 16-117.1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">(2) Whether the Circuit Court erred in ordering the MVA to provide Petitioner a hearing to contest the MVA\u2019s refusal to issue him a driver\u2019s license, after the agency refused his application pursuant to \u00a7 16-103.1?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Resolution of the two questions presented involves statutory interpretation, \u201cthe cardinal rule of [which] is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 314, 987 A.2d 48, 52 (2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Under the rules of construction, \u201cwe neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute; nor [do we] construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v. Md. Dept. of the Env\u2019t, </em>410 Md. 326, 339, 978 A.2d 702, 709 (2009) (internal quotation and citation marks omitted). We must \u2018\u201cread a statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superflu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>414 Md. 556, 570, 996 A.2d 382, 390 (2010) (quoting <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 275, 983 A.2d 138, 153 (2009)). \u201cThe plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 577, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">When applying these rules of statutory construction, we give deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes it administers. <em>See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999). We have said in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">[A] court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381 (emphasis and citations and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Weller, </em>390 Md. 115, 142, 887 A.2d 1042, 1058 (2005) (citing, with approval, <em>Banks </em>for the proposition that reviewing courts should give deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of statutory directives).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the questions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The Circuit Court, in denying Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the MVA\u2019s denial of his application for license renewal, ruled that, once the MVA classified as \u201cconfidential\u201d the records of his 1976, 1978, and 1982 drunk driving convictions and his 1993 probation before judgment disposition, the MVA properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>declined to expunge those records from Petitioner\u2019s \u201cpublic driving record.\u201d Petitioner challenges the Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning and ruling. His challenge implicates TR \u00a7\u00a7 12-111 and 16-117.1, both of which provisions warrant further examination before we tackle the parties\u2019 specific contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Guidelines for maintaining and disclosing MVA records are provided in TR \u00a7 12-111, entitled \u201cRecords of Administration \u2014 In General.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Referring to the MVA as the \u201cAdministration,\u201d subsection (a) states: \u201cThe Administration shall keep a record of each application or other document filed with it and each certificate or other official document that it issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Subsection (b) of TR \u00a7 12-111 is central to the issues before us. Paragraph (b)(1) provides: \u201cSubject to \u00a7 10-616(p) of the State Government Article [i.e., the \u201cRequired denials \u2014 Specific records\u201d section of Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act], and except as otherwise provided by law, all records of the Administration are public records and open to public inspection during office hours.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Paragraph (b)(2) provides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>MVA \u201cmay classify as confidential and not open to public inspection any record or record entry\u201d \u201c[t]hat is over 5 years old\u201d or \u201c[t]hat relates to any happening that occurred over 5 years earlier.\u201d Paragraph (b)(3) provides, though, that the confidential record \u201cshall be open to inspection by authorized representatives of any federal, State, or local governmental agency.\u201d Subsection (b)(4), which was added to TR \u00a7 12-111 a number of years after subsection (b)(2), in turn provides: \u201cSubject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Administrator may not open to public inspection any record or record entry that is: (i) All or part of a licensed driver\u2019s public driving record; and (ii) Over 3 years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">TR \u00a7 16-117.1, entitled \u201cExpungement of certain driving records,\u201d of course, is also a focus of our analysis. TR \u00a7 16-117.1(a) simply notes that, for purposes of this section, \u201c \u2018criminal offense\u2019 does not include any violation of Maryland Vehicle Law.\u201d Subsection (b) is of particular importance to the present case. That subsection provides in pertinent part that, \u201cif a licensee applies for the expungement of the licensee\u2019s <em>public driving record,\u201d </em>(emphasis added), then the MVA \u201cshall expunge the record if, at the time of application[,]\u201d the following conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">(1) The licensee does not have charges pending for allegedly committing a moving violation or a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">(2)(i) The licensee has not been convicted of a moving violation or a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle for the preceding 3 years, and the licensee\u2019s license never has been suspended or revoked;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(ii) The licensee has not been convicted of a moving violation or a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle for the preceding 5 years, and the licensee\u2019s record shows not more than one suspension and no revocations; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(iii) Within the preceding 10 years:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1.

The licensee has not been convicted of any other moving violation or criminal offense involving a motor vehicle, regardless of the number of suspensions or revocations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Also relevant to our discussion is subsection (d), which requires the MVA to expunge automatically the driving record of an individual \u201cfrom [the MVA\u2019s] driver record data base\u201d if that individual is one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">(1) Who has not been convicted of a moving violation or criminal offense involving a motor vehicle for the preceding 3 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">(2) Who has not been convicted of, or been granted probation before judgment for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">(i) A violation of \u00a7 20-102 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">(ii) A violation of \u00a7 21-902 of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">(iii) A moving violation identical or substantially similar to \u00a7 20-102 or \u00a7 21-902 of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">(3) Whose license or privilege to drive never has been suspended or revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The key to our analysis lies in a construction of TR \u00a7 16-117.1 and TR \u00a7 12-111 such that each is in harmony with the other and no word or provision is rendered nugatory or surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">We begin that endeavor with examination of the language and legislative history of the expungement provision, TR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u00a7 16-117.1. That section contains two provisions of relevance here. First is TR \u00a7 16-117.1(b), which, as we have explained, requires the MVA to expunge the licensee\u2019s \u201cpublic driving record\u201d upon the application of the licensee and satisfaction of certain statutory criteria. Applicable to Petitioner is paragraph (b)(2)(iii), which requires a driver to wait ten years before expungement of his or her public driving record, during which time the driver cannot have been convicted of any moving violations or have any traffic-related charges pending at the time of application. Because Petitioner meets those criteria, he contends that he is entitled to expungement of the record of his prior drunken driving convictions and probation before judgment disposition. That contention, however, is premised upon Petitioner\u2019s flawed construction of \u201cpublic\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cpublic driving record\u201d in subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Transportation Article does not contain a definition of \u201cpublic driving record.\u201d Petitioner urges this Court to construe \u201cpublic\u201d as defined in the Maryland Public Information Act, found at SG \u00a7\u00a7 10-611 through 10-630. According to SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 611(g), a \u201cpublic record\u201d includes any document \u201cmade by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business[.]\u201d Based on that definition, Petitioner maintains (1) that any record made or received by the MVA is a \u201cpublic driving record,\u201d which would necessarily include records classified by the MVA as \u201cconfidential,\u201d and (2) the use of \u201cpublic\u201d in the phrase \u201cpublic driving record\u201d merely reflects that. For several reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">First, Petitioner\u2019s construction defies common sense. Any record created or received by the MVA is, by the very definition Petitioner relies upon, \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense that it \u201cis made by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision.\u201d <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-611(g). Were we to accept Petitioner\u2019s argument, we would render repetitive and nugatory the General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cpublic\u201d in \u201cpublic driving record.\u201d If Petitioner\u2019s interpretation carried the day, then any record referred to throughout the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>that is not preceded by the word \u201cpublic\u201d would indicate an intent by the General Assembly that such record <em>not </em>be open to public inspection. Such a construction would yield absurd results. \u201cPublic driving record\u201d must, then, mean something more specific than simply any record made or received by the MVA, or pertinent here, any \u201cdriving record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Second, the legislative history of TR \u00a7 16-117.1(b)(2) makes clear that the General Assembly intended the term \u201cpublic\u201d to have a meaning different from that suggested by Petitioner. The expungement process and the term \u201cpublic driving record,\u201d as employed in TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 117.1(b)(2), appeared for the first time in a 1972 amendment to what was then Art. 66 <em>1/2 </em>\u00a7 6-117(e) (1957, 1970 Repl.Vol.), entitled \u201cRecords to be kept by Department.\u201d <em>See </em>SB 658, 1972 Md. Laws Ch. 106. Prior to the amendment, Art. 66 <em>1/2 </em>\u00a7 6-117(e) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqV\">(e) If a <em>driver's record </em>shows only one suspension and he has had no subsequent motor vehicle convictions for a period of 5 years, or if his record shows only one revocation and it resulted from a violation of the provisions of former section 104(b) of this article, ... and he has no subsequent motor vehicle convictions for 5 years, the <em>driving record </em>of the driver may be destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We pause here to emphasize that, pursuant to the above-quoted provision, the decision of whether to destroy a record, subject to the one limitation described below, was within the discretion of the MVA. <em>See </em>Art. 66 !\u00e9 6-117(e) (1957, 1970 RepLVol.) (providing that the \u201cdriving record of the driver may be destroyed\u201d). To like effect was an earlier provision, also related to the destruction of records, found at Art. 66 <em>1/2 </em>\u00a7 16 (1957, 1967 RepLVol.), and entitled \u201cDestruction of records.\u201d That provision provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">The Commissioner may microfilm any records of the Department at any time he deems proper or destroy any records of the Department, which have been maintained on file for three (3) years, which he may deem obsolete and of no further service in carrying out the powers and duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the Department except records of criminal and motor vehicle violations which show refusal, or revocation of license and/or registration as a result of a conviction under the provisions of \u00a7 104(a) of this article, showing mandatory refusal or revocation. If an operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s record shows only one suspension and there have been no subsequent motor vehicle convictions for a period of ten years, the driving record of such driver may be destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7z\">Particularly relevant for our purposes is that, common to both provisions, the MVA\u2019s discretion was limited in that the agency was not authorized to destroy records of drunken driving convictions. <em>See </em>Art. 66 \u00a7 117(e) (1957, 1970 RepLVol.) (stating that the MVA may not destroy a record of a licensee whose driver\u2019s license was revoked, unless that revocation was related to \u00a7 104(b), which at the time, referred to driving-related convictions of a minor); Art. 66 <em>% </em>\u00a7 16 (1957, 1967 RepLVol.) (specifying that the MVA may not destroy the record of a licensee who was convicted of an offense listed under \u00a7 104(a), which at the time, set forth several criminal offenses, including \u201c[d]riving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug\u201d). Therefore, pursuant to those provisions, the MVA was prevented from destroying records of drunken driving convictions. That limitation is consistent, as will be seen, with our interpretation of TR \u00a7\u00a7 16-117.1(b) and 12-111, through the latter of which the MVA has exercised its authority to maintain, as confidential, drunken driving convictions that are at least five years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We now return to the 1972 amendment that created what has become present-day TR \u00a7 16-117.1. The section was codified at Art. 66 \u00a16 \u00a7 6-117(e) (Cum.Supp.1972) and entitled <em>\u201cExpunging Certain Drivers Driving Records.\u201d </em>It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai_\">The Administration may expunge the <em>public driving record </em>of any person, who at the time of application possesses a valid driver\u2019s license, when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">(1) He has had no moving motor vehicle convictions or convictions of a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>for a period of three years and has never been suspended or revoked;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">(2) He has had no motor vehicle convictions or convictions of a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle for a period of five years and his record shows not more than one suspension and no revocations^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">(3) He has had no motor vehicle convictions or convictions of a criminal offense involving a motor vehicle for a period of ten years regardless of the number of suspensions or revocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">(Emphasis added.) Art. 66 <em>1/2 </em>\u00a7 6-117(e), pursuant to the 1977 re-codification, became TR \u00a7 16-117.1 and, through subsequent amendments not at issue here, evolved into present-day TR \u00a7 16-117.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The expungement provision of Art. 66 <em>\\ </em>\u00a7 6-117(e) (the ancestor of today\u2019s TR \u00a7 16-117.1) was added to the Code two years after the enactment of Art. 66/6 \u00a7 2-312, what is today TR \u00a7 12-111 (b)(2). As we explained <em>supra, </em>under TR \u00a7 12-111(b)(1), driving records are presumed to be \u201cpublic records and open to public inspection during office hours.\u201d The General Assembly saw fit, however, to limit public access. Pursuant to TR \u00a7 12 \u2014 111(b)(2), the MVA <em>\u201cmay </em>classify as confidential and not open to public inspection any record or record entry\u201d that is more than 5 years old. (Emphasis added.) Paragraph (b)(2) began as SB 10,1970 Md. Laws Ch. 534, \u00a7 1, by which the General Assembly repealed, reenacted, and amended provisions of the then-existing Art. 66 <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Relevant here, the General Assembly amended what was then Art. 66 <em>% </em>\u00a7 14 (1957,1967 RepLVol.), entitled \u201cRecords of Department.\u201d Former \u00a7 14 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">(a) <em>Confidential. </em>\u2014 The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall keep a record of all statements filed with him and all certificates issued by him, and all records of the Department, other than those declared <em>by law </em>to be confidential for the use of the Department shall be open to public inspection during office hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>(Emphasis added.) That provision, as amended and renumbered, became Art. 66/t \u00a7 2-312 (1957, 1970 RepLVol.). Art. 66 <em>1/2 </em>\u00a7 2-312, much like former Art. 66/t \u00a7 14, provided that: \u201cAll records of the Department, other than those declared by law to be confidential for use of the Department, shall be open to public inspection during office hours[.]\u201d Importantly, Art. 66 <em>f </em>\u00a7 2-312 went on to add the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">[B]ut the Commissioner <em>in his discretion may declare any record or entry therein which is more than 5 years old, or which relates to any happening which occurred more than 5 years previously, to be confidential and not open to public inspection. </em>Any existing record or entry therein, no matter what its age, shall be open to inspection by duly authorized representatives of any State, federal, or local government agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">(Emphasis added.) This modification later became TR \u00a7 12-111(b)(2), pursuant to SB 14, 1977 Md. Laws Ch. 14, \u00a7 2 (re-codification without substantive changes). Importantly, the 1970 amendment provided the MVA, for the first time, the discretionary authority to determine which records to classify and maintain as \u201cconfidential.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The absence from Art. 66/\u00e9 \u00a7 6-117(e) (or today, TR \u00a7 16-117.1(b)(2)), of any reference to records classified in the MVA\u2019s discretion as \u201cconfidential\u201d indicates that \u201cpublic driving record\u201d means something different from \u201cdriving record\u201d and does not include a \u201cconfidential\u201d record. The change in phraseology reflects that driving records that are classified as \u201cconfidential\u201d by the MVA, pursuant to the authority granted the agency under TR \u00a7 12-lll(b)(2), are not \u201cpublic driving records\u201d subject to expungement under TR \u00a7 16-117.1(b)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Viewing TR \u00a7\u00a7 16-117.1 and 12-111 together and so that each section is in harmony with the other, it is plain that, although the General Assembly provided in TR \u00a7 16-117.1(b) for the <em>possibility </em>of expungement of drunken driving convictions, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, the General Assembly also gave the MVA discretion, under TR \u00a7 12-111, to classify as \u201cconfidential\u201d any record, five years in age or older, that ought to be exempt from expungement. Put differently, the General Assembly, through TR \u00a7 12-111, has delegated to the MVA the determination of which records (in Petitioner\u2019s case, drunken driving convictions) are sufficiently serious that they should remain part of the licensee\u2019s driving record, albeit confidential, and thus not subject to expungement. The discretion granted the MVA is consistent with that previously granted \u201cthe Commissioner,\u201d in Art. 66]\u00e9, in connection with the destruction of records according to certain criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The conclusion to which we have come is buttressed by language employed in TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 117.1(d), which was added in 1992 by way of HB 44. <em>See </em>1992 Md. Laws Ch. 541, \u00a7 1. Subsection (d) requires the MVA, upon satisfaction of the criteria listed there, to expunge automatically a driver\u2019s records from the \u201cdriving record data base.\u201d Noticeably absent from subsection (d) is the term \u201cpublic,\u201d indicating that ex-pungement under that subsection, reserved for the safest of drivers, is broader in scope than that provided by subsection (b). We presume that the General Assembly\u2019s use within the same section of the two terms, \u201cpublic driving record\u201d and \u201cdriving record data base,\u201d was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">For all these reasons, we hold that TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 117.1(b) authorizes the expungement of \u201cpublic driving records,\u201d i.e., those records that have not yet been classified by the MVA as \u201cconfidential\u201d pursuant to TR \u00a7 12-lll(b)(2). It was by exercise of discretionary authority granted by that paragraph that the MVA lawfully classified Petitioner\u2019s drunken driving convictions as \u201cconfidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In sum, Petitioner was not entitled to expungement of the records of his 1976, 1978, and 1982 drunken driving convictions and 1993 probation before judgment disposition. The Circuit Court correctly reasoned as much when it denied Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Still to be resolved is whether the Circuit Court erred by ordering the MVA to provide Petitioner with a hearing to determine whether he should be issued a driver\u2019s license. Because Petitioner is barred, as a matter of law, from obtaining a license in Maryland under TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1), we agree with the MVA that the Circuit Court erred in remanding the case for an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Under TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1), the MVA may not issue a license to an individual \u201c[djuring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state[.]\u201d The MVA argues that, under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>provision, it need not grant Petitioner a hearing to determine his fitness for a license, because his license is permanently revoked in Florida and thus, he is barred as a matter of law from obtaining a Maryland license.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The MVA\u2019s argument is directly supported by <em>Gwin, </em>385 Md. 440, 869 A.2d 822, and subsequently, <em>Alavez v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>402 Md. 727, 939 A.2d 139 (2008). We need not discuss at length our holdings in either of those cases. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that, in <em>Gwin, </em>we explained that TR \u00a7 \u201c16-103.1 authorizes the State of Maryland to recognize non-Maryland issued suspensions, revocations, refusals or cancellations\u201d as automatic grounds for the denial of a driver\u2019s license application. <em>See Gwin, </em>385 Md. at 463, 869 A.2d at 835. We held that, because Gwin\u2019s license was permanently revoked in Florida, the MVA properly denied Gwin\u2019s application for a Maryland license based on the plain language of TR \u00a7 16-103.1. <em>See id. </em>at 465, 869 A.2d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Similarly, in <em>Alavez, </em>the MVA denied Alavez\u2019s driver\u2019s license application pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-103.1, because, at the time of application, his license to drive was suspended in New Jersey for having submitted forged documents related to his citizenship status. We affirmed that denial, despite the fact that Alavez\u2019s citizenship status would not preclude licensure in Maryland, noting \u201cthere is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about the pertinent part of TR \u00a7 16-103.1.\u201d <em>Alavez, </em>402 Md. at 734, 939 A.2d at 144. Alavez was precluded, therefore, from licensure as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 939 A.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Petitioner contends that, despite the plain language of TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1) and our cases enforcing that plain language, he is entitled an administrative hearing to determine whether, under a theory sounding in collateral estoppel, the provision is inapplicable to him. This may be the case, suggests Petitioner, given that the MVA issued him a driver\u2019s license in 2002, despite that his Florida revocation was in existence at that time. Petitioner, however, provides no authority in support of his contention. Nor can we ascertain any reason why our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>holdings in <em>Gwin </em>and <em>Alavez </em>do not directly control here. Merely because Petitioner defeated the system in his 2002 hearing does not mean that he has the absolute right to a license in 2006 and beyond. Stated differently, the MVA is not forever bound by one erroneous ruling and may act appropriately under law in response to each new licensure application.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Accordingly, there is no doubt that, if an administrative hearing was held, Petitioner would be denied a license based on the \u201c[ ]certain [and] [unambiguous\u201d language of TR \u00a7 16-103.1. The only question, then, is whether TR \u00a7 16-103.1 or some other provision grants to Petitioner the right to an administrative hearing at which, as we have explained, his application would be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We start with the licensing provision at issue, TR \u00a7 16-103.1. Absent from that provision is any language entitling Petitioner to a hearing. Had the General Assembly intended to provide for administrative hearings to contest licensure denials under TR \u00a7 16-103.1, it would have done so specifically, as it has elsewhere in provisions throughout Title 16.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The General Assembly\u2019s silence in TR \u00a7 16-103.1, therefore, stands in stark contrast to the express statutory authorization for administrative hearings or reviews found elsewhere, indicating that the General Assembly did not intend to provide driver\u2019s license applicants the ability to contest at administrative hearings licensure denials pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">There is, additionally, a generally applicable set of provisions relevant here, TR \u00a7 12, subtitle 2, entitled \u201cHearings,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>which sets forth notice provisions and general procedures to be followed by the MVA in conducting administrative hearings. The Circuit Court ruled that under those provisions Petitioner was entitled to an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Pursuant to TR \u00a7 12-202, an individual is entitled to an administrative hearing when \u201cthe Maryland Vehicle Law or a rule or regulation of the Administration provides that a license or privilege may be suspended or revoked <em>only </em>after a hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we have explained above, the relevant statute at issue, TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1) has no such mandate. In fact, the statute explicitly reads \u201cthe Administration <em>may not </em>issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual during any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, TR \u00a7 12-202 provides no relief for Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">TR \u00a7 12-203 requires the MVA to give notice to an applicant of his or her right to request a hearing when \u201cthe Maryland Vehicle Law or a rule or regulation of the Administration provides that an applicant or licensee may request a hearing on refusal, suspension, or revocation of a license or privilege[.]\u201d That section does not entitle Petitioner to a hearing because there is no statute, rule, or regulatory provision that grants Petitioner that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The MVA, therefore, is not required to provide Petitioner a hearing when, as a matter of law, he is disqualified from obtaining a license in Maryland under TR \u00a7 16-103.1(1). The Circuit Court erred in ruling to the contrary. Accordingly, we reverse the part of the judgment of the Circuit Court that directs a remand for an administrative hearing. We remand the case to the Circuit Court with the direction that it enter an order affirming the summary denial by the MVA of Petitioner\u2019s application for renewal of his \u201cMaryland Only\u201d license.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>SIONS OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.

Among the records the MVA is required to maintain are driver\u2019s license applications, each driver's license issued, accident reports, court dispositions, convictions, probation before judgment dispositions for violations of the Motor Vehicle laws, and records of administrative sanctions imposed pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-205.1 (Maryland\u2019s so-called Implied Consent Statute). <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-117(a), (b). Under TR \u00a7 16-117(b)(2)(i), the MVA must \"segregate\u201d a driver\u2019s record of probation before judgment dispositions and/or first TR \u00a7 16-205.1 violation for driving with a blood alcohol concentration over 0.08. This segregated record is available only to the MVA, the courts, authorized officials, the driver, and the driver\u2019s attorney. TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 117(b)(2)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. Section 616(p) of the State Government Article (\"SG\u201d) is entitled <em>\u201cMotor Vehicle Administration records containing personal information.\u201d </em>The subsection provides, inter alia: \"[A] custodian may not knowingly disclose a public record of the Motor Vehicle Administration containing personal information\u201d to authorities other than those authorized by law, absent written consent of the individual. Personal information, as defined by SG \u00a7 10-611(0(1), is \"information that identifies an individual including an individual\u2019s address, driver\u2019s license number or any other identification number, medical or disability information, ... Social Security number, or telephone number.\u201d Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sonal information \"does not include an individual's driver's status, driving offenses, 5-digit zip code, or information on vehicular accidents.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(f)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">. The second limitation under TR \u00a7 12-111 is set forth in (b)(4), by which the MVA \"may not open to public inspection any record or record entry that is\u201d \"[a]ll or part of a licensed driver\u2019s public driving record\u201d and \u201d[o]ver 3 years old.\u201d That provision was added in 1988, eighteen years after the addition of Art. 66 \u00a14 2-312 (what is today, TR \u00a7 12-111(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The order of enactment is significant. As we have mentioned, paragraph (b)(4) of TR \u00a7 12-111 directs the MVA not to make \"open to public inspection any record entry\" that is part of the \"public driving record\u201d and over three years old. Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s suggestion, the phrase \"not open to public inspection\u201d cannot reasonably be read to mean the equivalent to \"confidential,\u201d as that term is used in paragraph (b)(2). Indeed, the General Assembly chose to use both \"confidential\u201d and \"not open to public inspection\u201d in paragraph (b)(2). Had the two terms carried the same meaning for the General Assembly, only one would have been used. And, had the General Assembly intended \"not open to public inspection,\u201d as used in paragraph (b)(4), to mean \"confidential,\u201d then surely the General Assembly would have chosen the latter term, already employed for purposes of (b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. We note that the Transportation Article does not contain a definition of \"expungement.\u201d Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-101(d) of the Criminal Procedure (\"CP\u201d) Article, however, defines \"expunge\u201d as \"to remove information from public inspection____\u201d And CP \u00a7 10-101(e) defines expungement as \"removal from public inspection\u201d by, inter alia, \"obliteration\u201d or <em>\u201cremoval to a separate secure area to which persons who do not have a legitimate reason for access are denied access.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Were we to apply the latter definition to the case at hand, the MVA would have \"expunged\u201d \u2014 as the term is used in the CP Article \u2014 Petitioner\u2019s records by classifying them as \"confidential\u201d and thus accessible only to certain government authorities. This further demonstrates that \"public\u201d does not merely reflect, as Petitioner contends, that the record was made or received by the MVA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. For example, under TR \u00a7 16-110.3(c) (vision requirements), an applicant who is denied a license based on his vision may appeal to a Medical Board for review and \"the Board shall offer the applicant an opportunity to appear before the Board to present medical information pertinent to the Board's review\" of the applicant\u2019s vision. <em>See also </em>TR \u00a7 16-113(f) <em>(\u201cSuspension or revocation for violation of </em>restriction.\u2014 After receiving satisfactory evidence of any violation of a restricted or provisional driver\u2019s license, the Administration may suspend or revoke the license.
