The trial judge and County Administrative Judge collectively denied four motions for postponement of the case. We hold that the judges abused their discretion in denying the requests for a continuance of the trial where the movant\u2019s religious beliefs prohibited any appearance or advocacy on his behalf in the pending civil court proceeding. Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Petitioner filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Capital Internal Medicine, LLC, Dr. Ahmed Nawaz, MD, and Holy Cross Hospital of Silver Spring (\u201cHoly Cross\u201d) alleging negligent medical care of his father, Israel Neustadter, who died on March 27, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 20, 2006, the Circuit Court scheduled the case for a ten-day trial to commence on February 11, 2008. At a pre-trial hearing on January 24, 2008, the trial judge rescheduled the ten day trial, on a motion to continue by Respondent, to begin instead on June 2, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the trial judge appointed a Special Master to resolve ongoing discovery disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Between January and May, 2008, counsel for the parties communicated on several occasions about an anticipated scheduling conflict due to Petitioner\u2019s anticipated religious observances, which would fall on the fifth and sixth days of the, then, ten-day trial. Subsequently, on May 6, 2008, Petitioner filed a \u201cMotion to Suspend Trial Days for Religious Holidays\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cMay 6th motion\u201d) stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Mr. Neustadter is an Orthodox Jew who is one of the most observant followers of Jewish principles and requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><em>During Shavous he is (1) prohibited from doing any work including attending trial on these days [June 9 and 10, 2008] and (2) his attorney is prohibited, as his agent, from doing work on his behalf </em>.... On the Sabbath, Orthodox Jews ... strictly observe the requirement that work is prohibited ... and an agent is also prohibited from doing work on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Petitioner\u2019s motion also summarized the attempts that had been made with opposing counsel to resolve the scheduling conflict without the intervention of the court. Dr. Nawaz opposed the motion. In his opposition motion, Dr. Nawaz suggested that rather than suspend the trial, if the trial court was \u201cinclined to accommodate Plaintiffs religious beliefs, the entire case should be continued to a future date where any conflicting religious commitments can be known in advance and avoided.\u201d An order denying Petitioner\u2019s first motion was entered May 7, 2008. Subsequently, Petitioner raised the scheduling conflict at a discovery hearing on May 14, 2008, at which point Respondent expressed an interest in maintaining the current trial schedule. The trial judge denied Petitioner\u2019s request to alter the trial schedule. At that hearing, Petitioner notified the court that he would file a motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>On May 19, 2008, Petitioner filed a second postponement motion entitled, \u201cMotion to Reconsider Motion to Suspend Trial Days for Religious Holidays.\u201d Petitioner reiterated his argument from the May 6th motion and submitted an affidavit from the Assistant Rabbi of his congregation citing the specific prohibitions of the Sabbath and concluding that it would be impossible for either Petitioner, or his attorney, to participate in any way in a legal proceeding on June 9th and 10th. Furthermore, Petitioner contended that conducting his trial on the Sabbath violated his First Amendment Rights, that he had a right to attend and appear at trial, and that he would be prejudiced if the trial were held in his absence. When the Motion to Reconsider was discussed at the pre-trial hearing on May 22, 2008, Petitioner asked the court to consider the \u201cconstitutional issues ... when deciding not to honor somebody\u2019s religious requirements.\u201d The Motion to Reconsider was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">On June 2, 2008, the day before trial was to begin, Petitioner filed a third \u201cMotion to Postpone Trial for Religious and Fairness Reasons,\u201d which was opposed by Respondent. Petitioner stated two grounds for the motion: (1) prejudice and (2) fairness because of an earlier accommodation to Respondent. Petitioner stated in the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">This case was rescheduled on January 24, 2008 ... due to pending discovery matters and other issues that still had to be resolved. ... At that time, the Plaintiff consented to the postponement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">At that time, it was about two weeks before trial when the defense attorneys\u2019 scheduling problem was raised for the first time at the pretrial conference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Respondent opposed the Motion to Postpone arguing that the court had already denied Petitioner\u2019s request on three occasions, that there was no mention at the January pre-trial conference of a scheduling conflict, and that only one of their four expert witnesses could be rescheduled to testify on June 11th. The Administrative Judge denied the Motion to Postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>On June 3rd, before the trial judge, Petitioner raised the issue of postponement \u201cone more time.\u201d The trial judge declined to postpone the trial stating, \u201c[w]e\u2019ve addressed that issue numerous, this issue, particular issue, numerous times and I have explained numerous times why the case is not going to be continued or suspended and that\u2019s really the ruling of the case at this point. So I have to deny the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The trial began on June 3, 2008. Petitioner presented his case, which consisted of 13 witnesses, from June 3rd through June 6th. At the conclusion of Mr. Neustadter\u2019s case on June 6, 2008, Holy Cross moved for judgment, which the court denied. After the jury was dismissed for the day, the trial judge asked Mr. Neustadter\u2019s counsel, \u201c[i]t\u2019s my understanding you\u2019re not going to be here [on Monday]?\u201d Counsel for Petitioner responded affirmatively and then objected to the trial continuing on Monday and Tuesday. Court proceedings were set to begin mid-morning on Wednesday so that Petitioner could listen to a recorded transcript of the trial proceedings. The parties also discussed that a defense witness, Dr. Geckler, who had previously agreed to move his appearance to Wednesday, would actually testify on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">On Monday and Tuesday, June 9 and June 10, 2008, in Mr. Neustadter\u2019s absence, Holy Cross Hospital put on its entire case-in-chief, which included the testimony of four expert witnesses and one of Israel Neustadter\u2019s treating physicians, all offered to refute the Hospital\u2019s liability for damages. On June 9, 2008, Holy Cross offered the testimony of Dr. Richardson, qualified as an expert in geriatric and family medicine, and of Dr. Geckler, qualified as an expert witness in internal medicine and infectious disease. On June 10, 2008, Holy Cross introduced the testimony of Dr. Ball, one of the treating critical care pulmonologists for Israel Neustadter; Ms. McMullen, qualified as an expert in the field of nursing; and Dr. Goldstein, qualified as an expert in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, and critical care medicine. In addition to offering the testimony of the witnesses mentioned, Holy Cross offered as physical evidence a manual on nursing ethics and the curricula vitae for those experts who testified. After-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>wards, Holy Cross rested its case. On June 11, 2008, Mr. Neustadter and his counsel appeared at trial. That day the jury returned a verdict in favor of Holy Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Petitioner appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court asking the intermediate appellate court to consider three questions related to: a possible violation of his right to religious freedom and right to be present at trial; error in refusing to submit a claim of administrative negligence to the jury; and error in refusing an instruction on negligence <em>per se. </em>In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment holding, in pertinent part, that there was no constitutional violation of Petitioner\u2019s right to free exercise of religion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">Given appellant\u2019s delay in alerting the court to the conflict with trial on June 9-10, and given the scheduling conflicts that existed at the time appellant made his requests, as well as counsel\u2019s failure to suggest any other options, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the requests for a postponement of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We granted certiorari, <em>Neustadter v. Holy Cross Hosp., </em>412 Md. 494, 988 A.2d 1008 (2010), to consider the following question, which we have reworded slightly for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s request to suspend a civil trial for two days that Petitioner\u2019s Jewish Orthodox faith required him to strictly observe as days of worship violated Petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to free exercise of his religion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Petitioner urges this Court to scrutinize strictly the trial court\u2019s rulings by positing that his right to engage in religious conduct, protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, was impermissibly infringed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Conversely, Respondent maintains that we should apply an abuse of discretion analysis because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>court\u2019s rulings were discretionary and had no constitutional implications. The intermediate appellate court explicitly declined to apply any particular standard of review stating, \u201c[w]e need not decide the applicable standard. Even applying the higher standard advocated by appellant, we find no error.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Ordinarily,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[i]n reviewing a possible violation of a constitutional right, this Court conducts its own independent constitutional analysis. <em>See Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 526, 784 A.2d 1102, 1106 (2001) (\u201c[W]hen the issue is whether a constitutional right has been infringed, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal\u201d). \u201cWe perform a de novo constitutional appraisal in light of the particular facts of the case at hand----\u201d <em>Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 221, 792 A.2d 1160, 1166 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\"><em>State v. Davis, </em>415 Md. 22, 29, 997 A.2d 780, 784 (2010). Although the issue, briefs and oral argument in this case directed our attention to the various tests employed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>United States Supreme Court upon claims of violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, we conclude that the issue presented here, i.e., the propriety of repeatedly denying Petitioner\u2019s motions to suspend and/or postpone his civil trial, can be resolved without reaching the constitutional question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, our task is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Petitioner \u00e1 reasonable accommodation when his religious beliefs directed that he and his attorney refrain from any form of advocacy during the two days of the Jewish Orthodox Holiday of Shavuot that fell in the period scheduled for his civil trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Md. Rule 2-508 states that, \u201c[o]n motion of any party or on its own initiative, the court may continue a trial or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>proceeding as justice may require.\u201d Generally, an appellate court will not disturb a ruling on a motion to continue \u201cunless [discretion is] arbitrarily or prejudicially exercised.\u201d <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., </em>272 Md. 15, 28, 320 A.2d 266, 273 (1974) (finding no abuse of discretion in denying a motion where there was an \u201celeventh hour\u201d request to continue a 26 month trial). This Court recently reiterated that the \u201cdecision to grant a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Touzeau v. Deffinbaugh, </em>394 Md. 654, 669, 907 A.2d 807, 816 (2006) (noting in footnote five that the legislative history of Md. Rule 2-508 and the judicial discretion to consider such motions dates back to 1787). We have also affirmed that the trial court has authority over the management of its trial docket. <em>Goins v. State, </em>293 Md. 97, 111, 442 A.2d 550, 557 (1982) (stating \u201c[e]xcept as limited by statute or rule, a trial court has inherent authority to control its own docket\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Appellate courts do not defer to discretionary rulings of the trial judge, however, when the judge has resolved the issue on \u2018unreasonable or untenable\u2019 grounds. We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">We have defined abuse of discretion as \u201cdiscretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. City of College Park, </em>379 Md. 142, 165, 840 A.2d 139, 153 (2003) (emphasis not included). <em>See also Garg v. Garg, </em>393 Md. 225, 238, 900 A.2d 739, 746 (2006) (\u201cThe abuse of discretion standard requires a trial judge to use his or her discretion soundly and the record must reflect the exercise of that discretion. Abuse occurs when a trial judge exercises discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner or when he or she acts beyond the letter or reason of the law.\u201d) (quoting <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284, 295-96, 825 A.2d 1008, 1015 (2003)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>Touzeau, </em>394 Md. at 669, 907 A.2d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In exercising discretion, the trial court must apply the correct legal standard in rendering its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>[W]here the record so reveals, a failure to consider the proper legal standard in reaching a decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">The \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review is premised, at least in part, on the concept that matters within the discretion of the trial court are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts....\u201d So long as the Circuit Court applies the proper legal standards and reaches a reasonable conclusion based on the facts before it, an appellate court should not reverse a decision vested in the trial court\u2019s discretion merely because the appellate court reaches a different conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Aventis Pasteur, Inc. v. Skevofilax, </em>396 Md. 405, 433, 436, 914 A.2d 113, 130-32 (2007) (citations omitted) (holding that a trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice because the judge considered the proper legal standard as defined by Maryland case law, namely that there was no conflict of interest, fraud, or neglect by a party moving on behalf of a minor). In <em>Edwards v. State, </em>where we undertook an analogous challenge, we stated that \u201cthe ultimate decision, assuming the application of correct principles of law in the balancing process, is a discretionary one with the trial court ..., we look to see whether the court applied correct legal principles and, if so, whether its ruling constituted a fair exercise of its discretion.\u201d 350 Md. 433, 441-42, 713 A.2d 342, 346 (1998) (internal citations omitted) (holding that there was no abuse of discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant after an appropriate balancing test which did not run afoul of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Thus, here, we must consider whether the interests of the court and the Petitioner were properly balanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">This Court has consistently affirmed denials of motions to continue when litigants have failed to exercise due diligence in preparing for trial, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances to cause surprise that could not have been reasonably mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ed, where untimely requests were made, where procedural rules were ignored, where attorneys failed to adequately prepare for trial, where a witness was missing, and where a litigant\u2019s chosen counsel was absent but alternative counsel was available. <em>See Touzeau, </em>394 Md. 654, 678, 907 A.2d 807, 821 (2006) (finding no abuse of discretion when the trial court denied a request to continue where a self-represented litigant did not exercise due diligence to obtain counsel until five days before trial and failed to demonstrate that hardship in obtaining counsel was an unanticipated event); <em>Dart Drug Corp., </em>272 Md. at 28, 320 A.2d at 273 (finding no abuse of discretion where there was an \u201celeventh hour\u201d request to continue a 26 month trial); <em>Abrams v. Gay Inv. Co., </em>253 Md. 121, 124, 251 A.2d 876, 878 (1969) (finding no abuse of discretion where a party failed to follow court procedural rules); <em>Cruis Along Boats, Inc. v. Langley, </em>255 Md. 139, 142-44, 257 A.2d 184, 186 (1969) (finding no abuse of discretion where an unavailable lead attorney could be replaced with associate counsel at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In contrast, this Court has found reversible error in the denial of a motion to continue in certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">We have found that it would be an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to deny a continuance when the continuance was mandated by law, <em>see Mead v. Tydings, </em>133 Md. 608, 612, 105 A. 863, 864 (1919), or when counsel was taken by surprise by an unforeseen event at trial, when he had acted diligently to prepare for trial, <em>Plank v. Summers, </em>205 Md. 598, 604-05, 109 A.2d 914, 916-17 (1954), or, in the face of an unforeseen event, counsel had acted with diligence to mitigate the effects of the surprise, <em>Thanos v. Mitchell, </em>220 Md. 389, 392-93, 152 A.2d 833, 834-35 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Touzeau, </em>394 Md. at 669-670, 907 A.2d at 816. The intermediate appellate court has also reversed a denial of a motion to continue when a wife sought more time to obtain counsel in a contentious and complex divorce proceeding, <em>Reaser v. Reaser, </em>62 Md.App. 643, 650, 490 A.2d 1315, 1319 (1985), and when a mother could not attend a custody hearing because the child whose welfare was in issue was ill, <em>In re McNeil, </em>21 Md.App. 484, 499-500, 320 A.2d 57, 66 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We hold that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying the May 6th Motion and discretion was unreasonably exercised with regard to Petitioner\u2019s three subsequent pleas for a suspension of the proceeding, and finally for a postponement on May 16, June 2, and June 3, 2008, because the articulated rationales, discussed <em>infra, </em>failed to reasonably accommodate Petitioner\u2019s right to engage in religious conduct and to meaningfully participate in his trial. In this case, the absence of the plaintiff and his counsel from trial could not have been and indeed was not meaningfully mitigated. Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s notice to the court and opposing counsel of the scheduling conflict was not so untimely as to preclude accommodation or indicate an utter lack of diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the instant case, the trial judge concluded that Petitioner\u2019s repeated request to suspend trial for two days was impossible to accommodate in light of the court\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of the court proceedings. Essentially, the court\u2019s reasons included: lack of approval from the County Administrative judge, inconvenience to jurors and witnesses, prior rescheduling,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> double-booking the judge and defense counsel for a speculative third week of trial, untimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s first motion, a crowded trial docket, and that the court was \u201cdown two judges.\u201d In our view, these rationales do not indicate the impossibility of offering a reasonable accommodation to Petitioner and therefore the decision misses the mark and implicates prejudice to the movant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On May 14th, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">[The] difficulty I have is, and I did discuss this with our administrative judge before I ruled on that motion, is that when this trial date was set in February this issue was not raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>And I cannot, the administrative judge will not let me, hold up jurors for an extra two days because of something that was not brought to our attention. And the case has already been rescheduled once, and I simply cannot suspend the trial for those two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">If we had depositions de bene esse that were already \u201cin the can,\u201d as they say, or on film, we could play those and then it wouldn\u2019t matter. But I don\u2019t know that we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">And, you know, our trial calendar is extremely heavy right now. I\u2019m down two judges, and I\u2019m simply not authorized to suspend the trial for two days. Because, it affects a lot of people not just us in ... this room, it affects the witnesses, but if affects jurors, members of the community, and the entire docket if I don\u2019t finish the trial within a time that\u2019s allowed for it. So, I cannot suspend the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">But you can file a motion to reconsider if you want, but I won\u2019t be suspending the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">At the pre-trial hearing on May 22, 2008, the trial judge considered Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Reconsider stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">The concern, the Court\u2019s concern is that when this trial was scheduled to back in, I believe it was the end of January when a motion to continue the February trial date was discussed and this trial date was picked, there was, at that time, no request that this trial be suspended for two days. It was set for nine days to begin on Tuesday the 3rd. And had there been a request to suspend it for two days it would have been addressed when the trial was set. And either, if it couldn\u2019t be accommodated, you know, if that wasn\u2019t agreeable a different date would have been picked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">But the problem is that the request comes less than a month before trial in a very crowded trial docket for the court system itself, because we are short two judges. We are already having a lot of problems juggling trials and so forth, so it\u2019s very difficult on the Court. It also carries the trial over to next week for jurors who are greatly imposed on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>And it may seem like a relatively short trial to a federal court if they typically have six, eight, 14 week trials, but for a circuit court an eight, nine, 10 day trial is a long trial and it ties up a lot of, it ties up myself, it ties up all the courtroom personnel, it ties up a lot of people, but also jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">Not to mention ... expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Petitioner interjected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Your Honor ... you\u2019ll recall that there was tremendous difficulty finding a date at all for the two defense firms, that they could not find when the primary counsel had to be here, and that was a date that was taken out of the only time frame that could be accepted. So the fact that is if you had known that an earlier date, I don\u2019t think there would have been an easier way to set this trial unless it was next year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">But the fact is that we did, and I laid out in my motion that I did contact pretty promptly, in February, the two defense firms and said to them, \u201cLook, we got this problem, and here\u2019s what the problem is. Would you consent?\u201d And I think I laid out the dates in my motion. And I got a response back from Mr. Ceppos [Counsel for Dr. Nawaz], and I, some time passed I had to contact Ms. Ward [Counsel for Holy Cross] again and she responded. And the fact is that, you know, we couldn\u2019t reach agreement on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">With the, with the dropping of Dr. Nawaz from the case, this case is now going to be three or four days shorter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Therefore, by extending this trial, by having a two-day, two days off it\u2019s really not going to be any longer than the original court trial schedule, was scheduled for anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiv\">Petitioner maintained that June 9th and 10th could be removed from the trial calendar because the case was going to involve significantly fewer witnesses because of the dismissal of Dr. Nawaz. Respondent disagreed, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t possibly see how Dr. Nawaz not being in this case is going to shorten this trial three to four days.\u201d The court restated its position from the first motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The motion to suspend was filed May 6th. And I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t look at when the e-mail correspondence started. There was some attached, I just didn\u2019t notice the date. But the motion itself as we got it May 6th was ruled on promptly, because I immediately called, after I realize that the defense counsel were saying their witnesses were lined up and couldn\u2019t consent I did immediately check with the administrative judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">So, as of this point, it\u2019s still my position I do not have authority to suspend the trial for two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On May 22, 2008, the trial judge denied Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On June 2, 2008, the Administrative Judge denied a third Motion to Postpone, without a hearing. Subsequently, the trial judge declined to postpone the trial upon an oral motion on June 8, 2008, stating, \u201c[wje\u2019ve addressed that issue numerous, this issue, particular issue, numerous times and I have explained numerous times why the case is not going to be continued or suspended and that\u2019s really the ruling of the case at this point. So I have to deny the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">At the most, six jurors, possibly eight including two alternates, would have been asked to stand by, while trial proceedings were suspended for two days. This would not have been an unprecedented scenario. The double-booking issue similarly fails because there is no indication that the trial judge was specially assigned to hear the merits of this particular case, judges are double-booked not infrequently, and in the present case, another judge stepped in for the trial judge, to handle another medical malpractice case set for the same ten-day period as Petitioner\u2019s case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The threat of a third week of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>trial does not follow from the facts of the case, which indicate that the trial was originally set for ten days, was then shortened to nine days because the trial judge would not be available on the first day, shortened further when Dr. Nawaz was dismissed from the suit on May 22, 2008 (along with an estimated 29 witnesses and substantial number of exhibits), and ultimately was completed in seven days. The record indicates that Petitioner did try to obtain the consent of defense counsel prior to bringing the conflict to the court\u2019s attention through e-mails dated January 28, April 22, April 28, and May 1, 2008. When no consent was given, Petitioner filed a motion with the trial court, approximately one month prior to the start of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">This Court is not unsympathetic to the need for trial courts to efficiently and effectively manage overflowing dockets and judicial resources. There is no evidence on the record, however, that suspending court proceedings for two days of a nine day trial would unreasonably or substantially burden the docket or squander resources. Pursuant to the record, the trial judge could have taken a two day break and resumed the proceedings on Wednesday, June 11, 2008, and still finished the trial by the end of the second week. We have indicated on prior occasions that if a request for a continuance is predicated upon a circumstance that may be \u201cobviated within a brief period of time,\u201d then the fact that the trial may resume progress \u201cwithin a reasonable, rather than a protracted, period of time is an important consideration in a continuance decision.\u201d <em>Touzeau, </em>394 Md. at 671-72, 907 A.2d at 818 (citing <em>King v. Mayor of Rockville, </em>249 Md. 243, 246, 238 A.2d 898, 900 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The only attempt at any alternate means for adapting the trial schedule to accommodate Petitioner was an ineffective attempt to reschedule Respondent\u2019s witnesses for June 11th when Petitioner would return to court. At the pre-trial hearing on May 22, 2008, Counsel for Holy Cross stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An2\">Additionally, which my four experts, either three or four of them are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. So, to say that it wouldn\u2019t affect anything is, is, frankly, not true. Even though I\u2019m, I understand that there\u2019s not multiple defendants anymore, I still have experts that I\u2019ve prepaid and prearranged with to be here to testify on those two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The trial judge then inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">I would ask counsel if you can contact your expert witnesses to see if any of them are available to reschedule ... Wednesday or Thursday____If enough witnesses were rescheduled so that we didn\u2019t need to sit either Monday or Tuesday I would then not sit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">But ... I can\u2019t do it the third week, either. [T]he Court\u2019s calendar is, I mean, I\u2019m already, frankly, double booked the second week of this trial ... they are bringing another judge in to cover [another malpractice case]. But that\u2019s how, I mean, we\u2019re just double and triple booked every week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">So it is important that this trial end that second week. But if defense counsel can reschedule any of their experts, I am asking them to attempt to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">On May 28, 2008, Petitioner wrote the trial judge stating that he and Respondent had communicated about rescheduling some of Respondent\u2019s expert witnesses, but only one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>four could possibly move. Ultimately, the defense did not move any of its witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The trial judge stated that her denials \u201chad nothing to do with the fact\u201d that the nature of the request was religious, which we accept. Taking an objective view of Petitioner\u2019s predicament, however, it is difficult to imagine that a trial court would have refused to accommodate a litigant or counsel who requested a continuance because of family or personal illness, or in order to observe a time of bereavement upon the death of a family member. We note an apt reflection by the intermediate appellate court in <em>In re McNeil </em>wherein that court stated, \u201cmyopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to due process an empty formality.\u201d 21 Md.App. at 499, 320 A.2d at 66. The trial court did not give sufficient weight to the impact on Petitioner of being absent from trial for the Respondent\u2019s entire case-in-chief. Moreover, the court unreasonably juxtaposed the convenience of jurors, witnesses, and attorneys against Petitioner\u2019s request for a religious accommodation, prejudicially assigning more value to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">While the trial court has broad discretion under Md. Rule 2-508 to continue a trial, the facts of this case gave rise to an exceptional circumstance that warranted a continuance. <em>E.g. Thanos, </em>220 Md. at 392,152 A.2d at 834-35 (stating \u201c[i]n some instances, however, refusal to grant a continuance has been held to be reversible error ... We think the case before us is one of the exceptional instances where there was prejudicial error\u201d) (citation omitted). Under the circumstances of the present case, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to make a reasonable accommodation, given the exceptional circumstance raised by the movant, whereby both he and his counsel were prohibited from participating in court proceedings for two days as a result of an asserted and uncontroverted religious tenet.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">When an appellate court determines that a trial court has abused its discretion in ruling on a motion to continue, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the prejudice of the movant, the appropriate appellate action is to overturn such a ruling. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>214 Md. 454, 459, 135 A.2d 638, 640 (1957) (noting that a discretionary-ruling on a motion to continue should not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse that was prejudicial to the movant); <em>see also Thanos, </em>220 Md. at 392, 152 A.2d at 834-35; <em>Plank, </em>205 Md. at 605, 109 A.2d at 917. Prejudice means an \u201cerror that influenced the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Harris v. David S. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 319, 529 A.2d 356, 360 (1987) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Petitioner contends that prejudice should be presumed in the instant case because he was \u201cwrongfully excluded\u201d by the trial judge, citing our decision in <em>Safeway Stores v. Watson, </em>317 Md. 178, 562 A.2d 1242 (1989). In <em>Safeway Stores, </em>we held that a corporate entity had a right under Md. Rule 2-513 to designate a representative to be in the courtroom and that the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of Safeway\u2019s expert designee was wrongful and presumptively prejudicial so that Safeway did not have to prove both error and the prejudice. 317 Md. at 184, 562 A.2d at 1245-46. Relying on our decision in <em>Safeway Stores, </em>we stated more recently that \u201c[w]hat emanates from these cases is that there is a right of presence, that the right is not absolute, and that a determination of whether exclusion of a party constitutes sufficient prejudice, either presumed or actual, to warrant a new trial depends, to some extent, on the circumstances.\u201d <em>Green v. N. Arundel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>366 Md. 597, 620, 785 A.2d 361, 375 (2001) (citing <em>Gorman v. Sabo, </em>210 Md. 155, 122 A.2d 475 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In the instant case, we hold that conducting the trial in Petitioner\u2019s absence was presumptively prejudicial and requires reversal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s absence from court is analogous to the \u201cwrongful exclusion\u201d in <em>Safeway Stores, </em>and pursuant to <em>Green, </em>while some exclusions are appropriate given the dr<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cumstances of the case, others are reversible error. In essence, the trial court precluded Petitioner from effectively litigating his case when it created a circumstance in which Respondent presented its entire case in the Petitioner\u2019s absence. Moreover, upon the presumption of prejudice, the non-complaining party must prove that the error did not impact the outcome of the case, which Holy Cross has failed to do. <em>See e.g. Harris, </em>310 Md. at 319-20, 529 A.2d at 361 (noting that an erroneous disqualification of an attorney must be shown, by the advantaged party, to have had no influence on the outcome of the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Mr. Neustadter urges this Court to scrutinize strictly the case pursuant to either: (1) the balancing test of government conduct as weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>against the \u201csubstantial burden\u201d imposed upon an individual espoused by the Supreme Court in <em>Sherbert v.

Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1601, 108 L.Ed.2d 876, 887 (1990), in which the Court held that a neutral and generally applicable criminal law is applicable even if it imposes a burden upon religious conduct and noting that the only cases in which the Court has struck down such a law was when other constitutionally protected rights were contemporaneously infringed, i.e. \"freedom of speech and of the press ..., or the right of parents to direct the education of their children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">. The Court of Special Appeals used a test that Petitioner asserts and we agree was a \"free-floating balancing test,\u201d which apparently combined elements of a constitutional analysis with those of an abuse of discretion analysis. That court held that Petitioner\u2019s religious beliefs were sincere and caused a bona fide conflict, nevertheless it held that the trial court had a compelling interest in the \"efficient and orderly administration of justice,\u201d the tardiness of Petitioner's request \u201cweighed against\u201d him, and that the trial court had no ability to adjust its schedule to accommodate the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. \u201c[T]his Court has regularly adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d <em>In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 667, 967 A.2d 776 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 403 n. 13, 631 A.2d 453, 463 n. 13 (1993) (declining to consider the constitutionality of actions by defendants when the case was found to be moot)); <em>Montrose Christian Sch.

Moreover, because the Supreme Court has not addressed the impact of its <em>Smith </em>decision, <em>supra </em>note 6, on judicial determinations such as the one in the instant case, there is no applicable constitutional precedent that must be applied in this case. At least one of our sister states has applied a strict scrutiny analysis to discretionary judicial rulings even after the apparent limitation on that analysis as enunciated by the <em>Smith </em>Court. Given that it is unclear how <em>Smith </em>impacts such discretionary rulings, we prefer to resolve this case according to well-settled Maryland non-constitutional law relating to Md. Rule 2-508 (Continuances). <em>See, e.g., People v.

Upon termination, the individuals applied for unemployment benefits, which were denied ultimately by the Oregon Employment Division because the claimants were ineligible, having been terminated for work-related \u201cmisconduct.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 874, 110 S.Ct. at 1598,108 L.Ed.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The question before the Supreme Court was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aer\">whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment permits the State of Oregon to include religiously inspired peyote use within the reach of its general criminal prohibition on use of that drug, and thus permits the State to deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of such religiously inspired use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\"><em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 874, 110 S.Ct. at 1597, 108 L.Ed.2d at 882. Rejecting the claimants\u2019 argument that \u201ctheir religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>criminal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice,\u201d the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Scalia, held that \u201cif prohibiting the exercise of religion ... is not the object of the [governmental action] but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. at 1600, 108 L.Ed.2d at 878. Further, in holding that <em>Sherbert\u2019s </em>\u201csubstantial burden test\u201d need not be applied, the Court distinguished <em>Sherbert, </em>stating that <em>Sherbert </em>dealt with unemployment compensation cases, which, with their accompanying eligibility criteria and \u201cgood cause\u201d exception, \u201ccreate[] a mechanism for individualized exemptions\u201d that \u201cinvite consideration of the particular circumstances behind an applicant\u2019s unemployment....\u201d <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. at 1603, 108 L.Ed.2d at 884. Thus, <em>Smith </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cgenerally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 886 n. 3, 110 S.Ct. at 1604 n. 3,108 L.Ed.2d at 890 n. 3, even if the effect of the governmental action is to substantially burden the challenger\u2019s religious practice. <em>See Neutral Rules of General Applicability: Incidental Burdens on Religion, Speech, and Property, </em>115 Harv. L.Rev. 1713,1721 (2001) <em>{\u201cSmith </em>... held that the state has no duty to exempt people whose religions are substantially burdened as a result of a neutral and generally applicable law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Because <em>Smith </em>held <em>Sherbert\u2019s </em>\u201csubstantial burden\u201d test inapplicable to cases involving neutral laws of general applicability, our first task in the present case unquestionably is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Petitioner\u2019s requests for a postponement due to a religious conflict results from application of a neutral law of general applicability, or an analog thereto \u2014 a task that I undertake <em>infra. </em>Assuming <em>arguendo </em>(for a moment) that the trial court\u2019s decision does not fit there, the next inquiry is whether application of <em>Sherbert\u2019s </em>\u201csubstantial burden\u201d test is appropriate, and if so, whether the test necessitates the standard of review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the present case to be strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Answering this second group of questions requires a closer examination of the effect of <em>Smith </em>on <em>Sherbert, </em>an analysis over which much ink has been spilled already.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">One school of thought holds that <em>Smith </em>limited <em>Sherbert </em>only to those cases involving individualized exemptions vis \u00e1 vis a system of unemployment benefits. Language from <em>Smith </em>supports arguably this narrow reading, <em>see Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 883, 110 S.Ct. at 1602, 108 L.Ed.2d at 888 (\u201cWe have never invalidated any governmental action on the basis of the <em>Sherbert </em>test except the denial of unemployment compensation. Although we have sometimes purported to apply the <em>Sherbert </em>test in contexts other than that, we have always found the test satisfied. In recent years we have abstained from applying the <em>Sherbert </em>test (outside the unemployment compensation field) at all.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). <em>See also Gary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., </em>374 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cThe <em>Smith </em>majority expressly limited ... <em>Sherbert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to the unemployment compensation field.\u201d); <em>Miller v.

Language in <em>Smith </em>hints at this conclusion, <em>see Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. at 1603, 108 L.Ed.2d at 889 (\u201cEven if we were inclined to breathe into <em>Sherbert </em>some life beyond the unemployment compensation field ____\u201d), and language from published opinions embraces this view. <em>See, e.g., In re Hofer, </em>329 Mont. 368,124 P.3d 1098, 1110 n. 2 (2005) (\u201cDespite its expressed reluctance, the Supreme Court in fact has applied the <em>Sherbert </em>test outside the unemployment benefits context.\u201d). This view is best exemplified, perhaps, by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. 520, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993), in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to certain municipal ordinances it held to be non-neutral and not generally applicable, but did not involve unemployment benefits. Specifically, <em>Hialeah </em>dealt with the Santerian religion, which practices animal sacrifice as a principle form of devotion, a branch church of which leased land in the city of Hialeah to establish itself there. <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 524-26, 113 S.Ct. at 2222-23, 124 L.Ed.2d at 484-86. Expressing concern over the religious practices\u2019 effect on public morals and safety, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>City passed various enactments which declared the City\u2019s commitment to proscribing animal sacrifices. <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 526, 113 S.Ct. at 2223, 124 L.Ed.2d at 486. After holding the ordinances to be neither neutral nor generally-applicable, the Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny (\u00e1 la Sherbert) to strike down the ordinances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 546, 113 S.Ct. at 2233, 124 L.Ed.2d at 498-98. Thus, the Supreme Court has applied <em>Sherbert </em>to scenarios other than those involving unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In subscribing to the latter understanding of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>effect on <em>Sherbert, </em>I do not write on a clean slate. In <em>Trinity Assembly of God of Baltimore City, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>407 Md. 53, 87 n. 13, 962 A.2d 404, 424 n. 13 (2008), discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>I wrote for a unanimous Court (albeit as dicta) that <em>\u201cSmith </em>left open the possibility that the substantial burden test still applies to Free Exercise Clause challenges where the government made an individualized assessment.\u201d We did not see <em>Sherbert </em>in <em>Trinity </em>as limited merely to unemployment compensation scenarios, but rather, to all individualized assessment situations. Therefore, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the trial court\u2019s denial in the present case of Petitioner\u2019s motion to postpone the trial for the two-days of Shavuot was not the result of a neutral and generally-applicable government action, my reading of <em>Smith </em>and its progeny requires a <em>Sherbert-type, </em>\u201csubstantial burden,\u201d analysis. If I determine that a substantial burden analysis is required, this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Trinity, supra, </em>becomes relevant more so.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">To summarize the road map I believe should be followed in determining the appropriate standard of review to be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>in the present case: (1) determine whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial for the Shavuot holiday was the result of a \u201cneutral, generally applicable\u201d governmental action such that application of <em>Sherbert </em>is inapposite (stated differently), determine whether the trial court\u2019s denial of the motions was an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d which necessitates application of <em>Sherbert\u2019s </em>substantial burden test; (2) assuming the denial is not a neutral and generally applicable governmental action, apply <em>Sherbert\u2019s </em>substantial burden test \u2014 with <em>Trinity\u2019s </em>gloss \u2014 to determine whether strict scrutiny or abuse of discretion is the pertinent standard of review; and (3) assuming abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard of review, decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial for the Shavuot holiday. As will be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>one of the outcomes, I believe, is that application of strict scrutiny is inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">II. Neutral and Generally-Applicable Governmental Conduct, or Individualized Assessment?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As noted <em>supra, </em>\u201cgenerally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 886 n. 3, 110 S.Ct. at 1604 n. 3, 108 L.Ed.2d at 890 n. 3. While neutrality and general-applicability \u201care interrelated, and ... failure to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication that the other has not been satisfied,\u201d <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 531, 113 S.Ct. at 2226, 124 L.Ed.2d at 489, each requires its own analysis ultimately. In this regard, <em>Hialeah </em>is instructive. <em>See Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, </em>366 F.3d 1214, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cHialeah </em>presented an opportunity for the Supreme Court to elaborate upon what was meant by neutrality and general applicability.\u201d). Briefly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">[i]n <em>Hialeah, </em>the Court reviewed various ordinances of the City of Hialeah that effectively prohibited members of the Santer\u00eda religion from sacrificing animals, a traditional practice of Santer\u00eda Worship.... The Court ... examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Hialeah City ordinances and found that they were neither neutral nor of general applicability. Instead, the ordinances were written in such a way as to target only those animal killings that occurred attendant to Santer\u00eda religious worship. The Court found additionally that the city had no compelling governmental interest to support the ordinances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>State v. Green, </em>99 P.3d 820, 826 (Utah 2004) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">A. Neutrality</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Under <em>Hialeah, </em>a law (or rule) is, by definition, not neutral \u201cif the object of the law [or rule] is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation____\u201d <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 533, 113 S.Ct. at 2227, 124 L.Ed.2d at 490. The starting point in determining whether the object or purpose of the government action is to suppress religious conduct \u201cmust begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face. A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernible from the language or context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s explanation of the denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone is devoid of any language that could be construed as having a purpose or object of denying the motions because of Petitioner\u2019s religious convictions. As the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">[T]he administrative judge will not let me, hold up jurors for an extra two days because of something that was not brought to our attention. And the case has already been rescheduled once, and I simply cannot suspend the trial for those two days----And, you know, our trial calendar is extremely heavy right now. I\u2019m down two judges, and I\u2019m simply not authorized to suspend the trial for two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A54\">The record, therefore, reveals that the denial stemmed (at least in part), not from any religious animus, but rather from the lack of authorization from the administrative judge, apparently because Petitioner was raising an issue that, theretofore, was not brought to the attention of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Although the trial court\u2019s decision was neutral facially, \u201c[flacial neutrality is not determinative,\u201d as the \u201cFree Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked as well as overt.\u201d <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 534, 113 S.Ct. at 2227, 124 L.Ed.2d at 491. In <em>Hialeah, </em>the Supreme Court scrutinized the record for evidence of covert discrimination, concluding ultimately the object of the City of Hialeah\u2019s ordinances was to infringe upon the Church member\u2019s Free Exercise rights, considering that the only conduct subject to the ordinances was the expression of the religious exercise (animal sacrifice) of the Church members. <em>See Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 535,113 S.Ct. at 2228,124 L.Ed.2d at 492. The record in the present case is devoid of any evidence from which one could infer reasonably that the trial court was acting in a manner other than a neutral arbiter. The trial court articulated the following reasons for denying the motion to postpone the trial, none of which suggest that the judge\u2019s decision would have been any different had Petitioner been Christian, Muslim, or a member of any other religious faith (or an agnostic or atheist): lack of authorization from the administrative judge; busy trial calendar; lack of judges; effect on witnesses, jurors and members of the community; and Petitioner\u2019s delay in bringing the problem to the court\u2019s attention. Unlike <em>Hialeah, </em>in which the legislative history of the City\u2019s ordinances revealed concern \u201cthat certain religions may propose to engage in [religious] practices which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety,\u201d <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 526,113 S.Ct. at 2223, 124 L.Ed.2d at 486, the record here is devoid of even a hint of religious animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Finally, the Court in <em>Hialeah </em>stated that \u201c[i]n determining if the object of a law is a neutral one ..., we can also find guidance in our equal protection cases.\u201d <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. at 540, 113 S.Ct. at 2230, 124 L.Ed.2d at 495. In undertaking this mode of analysis, the Court noted that \u201c[r]elevant evidence includes ... the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the ... official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>by members of the decisionmaking body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A judicial determination to deny a continuance or a postponement (as opposed to a legislative act), has no legislative history, but the \u201cspecific series of events leading to\u201d the judge\u2019s ruling in this case is telling. The relevant facts of the present case are that the parties became aware of the 3 June 2008 trial date on 24 January 2008, yet Petitioner waited until 6 May 2008 \u2014 less than a month prior to the commencement of trial \u2014 to inform the trial court that neither Petitioner nor his counsel would be present on the two days of trial that fell out on the Shavuot holiday. <em>See </em>Pirkei Avot \u2014 Ethics of Our Fathers \u00a7 1:14 (\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d). The trial judge mentioned at the 14 and 22 May 2008 hearings on the matter Petitioner\u2019s tardiness. Whether the trial court abused its discretion to rely on this delay is discussed <em>infra; </em>however, it appears clear to me that this justification, alone or in conjunction with the balance of the record, in no way evinces an \u201cobject\u201d on the part of the trial court to infringe upon Petitioner\u2019s Free Exercise rights. According to Judge Sykes of the federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, \u201cthe point of <em>[.Hialeah </em>]\u201d was that \u201ceven a facially neutral law of general applicability might be discriminatory in violation of the Free Exercise Clause because of its design, operation ... or in the manner in which it is enforced.\u201d <em>River of Life Kingdom Ministries v. Vill. of Hazel Crest, Ill., </em>611 F.3d 367, 387 (7th Cir.2010) (Sykes, J., dissenting). Concluding that the record is devoid of any evidence from which one could conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial was either designed to, or operated to, infringe upon Petitioner\u2019s Free Exercise rights, I would hold that the judicial determination in the present case was \u201cneutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">B. General Applicability</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">One federal district court detailed <em>Hialeah\u2019s </em>analysis of the \u201cgeneral-applicability\u201d prong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Discussing the requirement of general applicability, the <em>Lukumi </em>[CJourt observed that \u201call laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice.\u201d The \u201cgovernment ... cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.\u201d The ordinances at issue in <em>Lukumi </em>were so deficient that the court declined to \u201cdefine with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general application.\u201d However, the <em>Lukumi </em>[C]ourt made clear that a law is not generally applicable if it was purportedly adopted to protect certain interests, yet \u201cfails to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater degree than [the banned religious conduct] does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><em>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, </em>282 F.Supp.2d 1236, 1244-45 (D.N.M.2002) (internal citations omitted); <em>see Green, </em>99 P.3d at 828 (employing a similar analysis).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The governmental action at issue here \u2014 the denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial for the Shavuot holiday \u2014 has no \u201ccategories of selection.\u201d Being a judicial determination, the trial court\u2019s ruling is made on particular motions, and facts, applicable to two unique parties,; but, there is nothing in any of the judge\u2019s rulings that suggests that she \u201cselected\u201d Petitioner\u2019s motions for denial on the grounds that they were based on Petitioner\u2019s intent to observe a religious holiday. Further, the judge\u2019s rulings do not \u201cfail to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers the[ ] interests\u201d sought to be protected by the ruling. That is, as mentioned <em>infra, </em>the trial court denied the motions, citing interests of docket efficiency and the effect a delay would have on jurors and witnesses; nowhere in the rulings, however, did the judge suggest that she would have granted the motions to postpone if they were based on nonreligious reasons <em>{e.g., </em>the Bowl Championship Series title game,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the World Series,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>To be sure, judges and courts decide cases and controversies. <em>See Thom v.

Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 653, 16 S.Ct. 132, 133, 40 L.Ed. 293, 293 (1895)) (\u201cThe duty of this [C]ourt, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies ----\u201d). Accordingly, the judge\u2019s ruling on a motion affects generally only the litigants to the particular case. Thus, a judicial ruling does not have the same generally-applicable effect as a legislative act. That said, I believe the judge\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial was the judicial analog to a generally-applicable legislative act, in that there is no evidence in the record from which one could conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling would have been any different if faced with nonreligious justifications for the requested postponement. <em>See State v. Blackmon, </em>130 Ohio App.3d 142, 719 N.E.2d 970, 975 (1998) (holding that appellant\u2019s Free Exercise rights were not violated where there was no evidence that the trial court considered anything other than \u201cgenerally applicable factors\u201d in considering a motion for a continuance, including: length of delay requested, inconvenience to litigants and witnesses, whether the moving party contributed to the circumstances for which the request was made, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">C. Individualized Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Notwithstanding my view that the judge\u2019s rulings on Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial constitute a judicial analog to a neutral and generally-applicable legislative act, I must undertake another inquiry, namely, whether the judge\u2019s determination constitutes an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d sufficient to trigger a <em>Sherbert </em>analysis. <em>See Kissinger v. Bd. of Trustees of Ohio State Univ., </em>5 F.3d 177, 179 (6th Cir.1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(employing a \u201cthree-part analysis\u201d: whether the governmental action \u201cwas generally applicable, was not aimed at particular religious practices, and did not contain a system of particularized exemptions\u201d). <em>But see First Covenant Church v. City of Seattle, </em>120 Wash.2d 203, 840 P.2d 174, 181 (1992) (appearing to conflate the \u201cindividual assessment\u201d analysis with the \u201cneutral/generally-applicable\u201d analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Smith </em>said, vis-\u00e1-vis individualized exemptions/assessments, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The <em>Sherbert </em>test, it must be recalled, was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct. As a plurality of the Court noted in <em>[Bowen v.] Roy </em>[476 U.S. 693, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986) ], a distinctive feature of the unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind an applicant\u2019s unemployment: The statutory conditions ... provided that a person was not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, without good cause, he had quit work or refused available work. The \u201cgood cause\u201d standard created a mechanism for individualized exemptions. As the plurality pointed out in <em>Roy, </em>our decisions in the unemployment cases stand for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of \u201creligious hardship\u201d without compelling reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. at 1603, 108 L.Ed.2d at 884 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">To be sure, and as mentioned <em>supra, </em>because trial courts deal with discrete controversies between the parties before them, each ruling or determination in the case is somewhat \u201cindividualized.\u201d The rub, though, is whether a judicial ruling is cut from the same cloth as the individualized exemptions with which the Supreme Court in <em>Sherbert </em>and its progeny dealt. In formulating an answer to this question, I proceed along the following path:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The determination of whether the <em>Sherbert </em>exception <em>[i.e. </em>application of <em>Sherbert </em>] is triggered proceeds in two steps. The first focuses on whether a law contains a mechanism similar to the \u201cgood cause\u201d criterion that is open to unfettered discretionary interpretation. If such a mechanism exists, the second step requires courts to determine whether it is enforced in a discriminatory manner. Absent evidence of discrimination in the actual enforcement of the [governmental action], ... <em>Sherbert </em>... is not triggered, and there is no need to apply the compelling state interest test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYm\">Carol M.

State, </em>206 Md. 261, 265, 111 A.2d 587, 589 (1955) (\u201cIt has long been a well settled rule in this State that the granting or refusing of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be set aside on appeal unless the exercise of that discretion has been arbitrary.\u201d). Although the abuse of discretion standard does not leave judges with \u201cunfettered discretionary interpretation,\u201d appellate review of this type of judicial determination is highly deferential and gives judges a substantial degree of discretion in granting such motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Whether the abuse of discretion standard of review that insulates, to a degree, a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to postpone or continue a trial is akin to the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard with which <em>Sherbert </em>and the other unemployment compensation cases deal, absent from the record here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>any evidence that this ruling specifically, rulings from this particular judge, or rulings from this particular court, were in any way discriminatory. Absent such evidence, I conclude <em>Sherbert </em>to be inapposite and inapplicable to the present factual situation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">One final observation on this point is in order. I do not believe that the legislative ills that strict scrutiny protects against in the Free Exercise sphere are applicable with equal force to the judicial branch. <em>See </em>Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 609 (1969) (concluding that separation of powers was intended to \u201censure the protection of individual rights against all governmental encroachments, <em>particularly by the legislature, </em>the body which Whigs ha[d] traditionally cherished as the people\u2019s exclusive repository of their public liberty\u201d) (emphasis added). That is, a concern of any democratic society is that an oppressive or tyrannical electorate will emerge and elect similarly minded legislative representatives, who, in turn, will enact laws that will oppress certain disfavored groups. <em>See Riley v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Hosp., </em>196 F.3d 514 (5th Cir.1999) (Stewart, J., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>252 F.3d 749 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe branch thought to constitute the greatest danger ... was the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>tive; during the operation of the Articles of Confederation, the legislature, in the view of many of the Framers, intruded impermissibly into the sphere of liberty and private property.\u201d). To protect against laws whose object is to restrict religious practice, strict scrutiny in the Free Exercise realm acts as a judicial check against this legislative possibility, placing the burden on the government to prove that the legislative enactment is tailored narrowly to further a compelling governmental interest. If the government fails to shoulder this burden with respect to laws that place a substantial burden on one\u2019s Free Exercise rights, it is the courts\u2019 duty to invalidate such a law or action.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The judiciary, then, \u201c[i]n our system of checks and balances ... by its very nature, is and is supposed to be the antidemocratic branch.\u201d <em>Porter v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 96, 109, 421 A.2d 985, 992 (1980) (Moylan, J., concurring). Or, stated differently, the judiciary was envisioned as the branch of government that would curb a legislature\u2019s attempts to oppress the minority (or, in this case, oppress one\u2019s religious beliefs and/or practices), and not the branch that, itself, would engage in the oppressing. The possibility of a \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d in legislative enactments \u2014 perhaps best exemplified in <em>Hialeah </em>\u2014 does not exist to the same degree in isolated judicial rulings or determinations. Of course, it is possible for a judge to decide the outcome of a case or of a motion based on religious animus; strict scrutiny, however, does not apply inevitably to all judicial determinations invoking the word \u201creligion.\u201d The abuse of discretion standard provides adequately a proper check against such a possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">III. Substantial, or Mere Incidental, Burden?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">If one disagrees with my view that the judge\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial for Shavuot constitutes a neutral and generally-applicable governmental action, it does not follow necessarily that strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review. As discussed <em>supra, </em>to the extent a governmental action is an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d or is not neutral and generally applicable, under <em>Sherbert, </em>strict scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ny applies only if the governmental action in question places a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on one\u2019s Free Exercise rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In this regard, our opinion in <em>Trinity, supra, </em>becomes relevant. Accordingly, a brief reiteration of the relationship between <em>Trinity </em>and Free Exercise jurisprudence is in order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZg\">In 1993, Congress enacted ... the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (the \u201cRFRA\u201d), in response to what it perceived to be an erosion of religious liberty reflected in Supreme Court jurisprudence interpreting and applying the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. [42 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 2000bb(a). Three decades before Congress enacted the RFRA, the Supreme Court decided <em>Sherbert v. </em>Verner .....The substantial burden test (the <em>Sherbert </em>test) remained the law of the land governing claims under the Free Exercise Clause until 1990 .... [when it decided] <em>Employment Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Or. v. Smith </em>.... The Court [in <em>Smith </em>] turned its back on the substantial burden test, noting that it \u201cwas developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct,\u201d namely unemployment compensation. Congress enacted the RFRA to respond to <em>Smith. See City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 513 [117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624] (1997) (noting that \u201cCongress enacted RFRA in direct response to ... <em>Smith </em>\u201d).... Congress disagreed that application of the substantial burden test would invite anarchy, finding instead that it \u201cis a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior government interests.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000bb(a)(5). Congress found further that neutral, generally applicable laws nonetheless may have the effect of burdening religious exercise to the same degree as laws intended to stifle such exercise. Accordingly, the RFRA announced that \u201c[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion[,] even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability ... [unless] it demonstrates that application of the burden ... is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest[ ] and is the least restrictive means of furthering that ... interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00a7 2000bb-l (a) &amp; (b). An attack on the RFRA, however, was quick and decisive. In <em>City of Boeme v. Flores, </em>the Supreme Court partially invalidated the RFRA, holding that the enforcement power granted to Congress by the Fourteenth Amendment did not empower Congress to impose universally the substantial burden test on state and local governments.... After three years of hearings, Congress found that actions by state and local governments, in these two areas [land use and institutionalized persons] particularly, threaten religious exercise. To ensure that the RLUIPA did not suffer the same fate as the RFRA, Congress circumscribed the reach of the substantial burden test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><em>Trinity, </em>407 Md. at 86-89, 962 A.2d at 423-425.

Had the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to postpone placed such a burden on Petitioner\u2019s Free Exercise rights (or Petitioner perceived truly such a burden), Petitioner, I suspect, would have informed the trial court at some point during the period between 24 January 2008 \u2014 when the final trial dates were scheduled \u2014 and 6 May 2008 \u2014 the date on which Petitioner first and ultimately informed the trial court of the Shavuot conflict, less than a month before commencement of trial. <em>See United States v.

That is not to say that the exercise of Petitioner\u2019s religion was not affected in any way by the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion; of course, neither he nor his counsel was able to attend trial on either day of Shavuot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Yet, governmental action \u201cthat merely inconvenience^] the exercise of religion do[es] not create a substantial burden.\u201d <em>First Vagabonds Church of God v.

An amicus here asks rhetorically: \u201cIf Jews could not hold public office in Maryland until 1825, is it an unfair stretch \u2014 or an unconscionable reality \u2014 to suggest that they cannot freely observe their holidays in 2010?\u201d Brief for Interested Professors of Law as Amici Curiae Supporting Petitioner, at 31. Simply put, Petitioner <em>was </em>free to celebrate Shavuot as he deemed fit; the trial court did not compel his presence in court in violation of the Jewish faith. Accordingly, because Petitioner was with \u201creasonable means\u201d to observe the holiday of Shavuot, I do not think a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d was placed upon his Free Exercise rights. <em>See State v.

Applying the Abuse of Discretion Standard of Review to the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">According to the Majority opinion, the trial court abused its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motions to postpone the trial \u201cbecause the articulated rationales ... failed to reasonably accommodate Petitioner\u2019s right to engage in religious conduct and to meaningfully participate in his trial.\u201d 418 Md. 231, 244, 13 A.3d 1227, 1235 (2011). That is not the abuse of discretion that I would find.

[A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, is included within the notion of \u201cuntenable grounds,\u201d \u201cviolative of fact and logic,\u201d and \u201cagainst the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\"><em>Gray v.

Although we are reticent (because of the highly deferential nature of the standard) to find an abuse of discretion in a trial court\u2019s denial for a request for a postponement or continuance, I would hold here that a trial court is required to make an on-the-record explanation of the reasons supporting a decision to deny. <em>See Baumann v.

While the trial court, in this case, did make an on-the-record findings, I would hold that her denial is \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined\u201d by this Court and that she abused her discretion in denying the motion, not because her ruling does not flow logically from the findings upon which it rests, but rather because the record extract <em>does not support </em>the articulated findings upon which it rests. <em>See Grant v. State, </em>414 Md. 483, 995 A.2d 975 (2010) (holding that it is an abuse of discretion for a court to \u201cexercise that discretion without preserving the evidentiary basis for its decision\u201d and finding that \u201c[t]he fact that the trial court\u2019s bases for its decision ... are beyond our reach makes it untenable to sustain the trial court\u2019s ruling as a permissible exercise of its discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">As mentioned <em>supra, </em>the trial court offered the following reasons for delaying Petitioner\u2019s motion to postpone the trial: lack of authorization from the administrative judge; busy trial calendar; lack of judges; effect on witnesses, jurors and members of the community; and delay in bringing the issue to the court\u2019s attention. At bottom, however, the judge, at various points throughout the relevant motions hearings, stated that she was willing to work around the two-day Shavuot holiday if defense counsel was able to reschedule the expert witnesses scheduled originally for those two days. For example, during the 22 May 2008 hearing on Petitioner\u2019s motion to postpone the trial, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">[JUDGE] I would ask [defense] counsel if you can contact your witnesses to see if any of them are available to reschedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">[COUNSEL] I wifi do that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">[JUDGE] <em>If enough witnesses were rescheduled so that we didn\u2019t need to sit either Monday or Tuesday I would not sit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>[COUNSEL] I will certainly do that.

I will make my best efforts to explain the holiday situation and see what we can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">[JUDGE] [T]he Court\u2019s calendar is ... double booked the second week of this [trial]. I at one point had five trials that Monday, we\u2019re now down to only two, this, and another malpractice trial which they are bringing in another judge to cover. But that\u2019s how, I mean, we\u2019re just double and tripled booked every week. So it is important that this trial end that second week. <em>But if defense counsel can reschedule any of their experts, I am asking them to attempt to do that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">(Emphasis added.) Similarly, Respondent, in its brief, argues: \u201cBy that time [May 5 \u2014 when Petitioner first sought redress from the Circuit Court] counsel for both of the Defendants had already begun scheduling their expert and fact witnesses to testify at trial. Incidentally, as with most medical malpractice cases, the expert witnesses were physicians or other health care providers. In order to secure these witnesses five at trial, several months notice is often required to ensure their availability. Furthermore, once confirmed, schedules are extremely difficult to adjust within a month\u2019s timeframe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In support of these contentions, Respondent cites to the record extract and the appendix in support of the above assertions. The record extract at the cited-to page, however, merely quotes Respondent\u2019s counsel as saying that \u201cI am trying to get my experts and witnesses set in for trial.\u201d Furthermore, the cited-to pages in the appendix merely show that Respondent\u2019s counsel informed the experts of the June 3 commencement of trial \u2014 not that they were either (a) officially scheduled to testify on June 9 or 10 of the trial scheduled to run through June 13; or (b) asked about their availability to testify at another time during that period. Further, while Respondent argues on appeal that \u201c[o]nly one of Respondent\u2019s experts (Dr. Geckler) could accommodate moving his trial appearance\u201d and \u201cRespondent\u2019s experts were unable to change their trial appearances,\u201d Respondent offers no citation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>record extract to support these statements. My review of the record extract proved fruitless in finding support for Respondent\u2019s appellate advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">While the abuse of discretion standard appreciates that \u201c[questions within the discretion of the trial court are much better decided by trial courts than by appellate courts,\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003), the phrase \u201cstandard of review\u201d suggests that appellate courts nevertheless have some duty to review. Where, like here, the reasons upon which a trial court bases his or her denial of a motion to postpone a trial \u2014 especially where the tendered and undisputed reasons for a brief postponement is the practice of genuinely held religious beliefs \u2014 are not supported by an adequate evidentiary predicate in the record extract, it is my view that the judge abused his or her discretion. <em>See United States v.

Instructive on this point is <em>Rector, Wardens, and Members of the Vestry of St. Bartholomew's Church v. City of New York, </em>914 F.2d 348 (2d Cir.1990), in which members of a church alleged violations of their Free Exercise rights when the Landmark Preservation Commission of New York City applied the City\u2019s \"Landmarks Law\u201d \u2014 which protects buildings deemed \"landmarks\u201d from being altered or demolished \u2014 to prevent them from replacing the church's activities building with an office tower. <em>See St. Bartholomew, </em>914 F.2d at 350-352. <em>St. Bartholomew </em>is particularly apt because the plaintiffs did not assert that the law itself infringed upon their Free Exercise rights; rather, they alleged that the decisionmaker's <em>(i.e., </em>the Board's) application of the statute caused the constitutional violation. The church members, in support of their argument that the Commission\u2019s application of the Landmarks Law infringed impermissibly on their Free Exercise rights, \"cite[d] commentators ... who are highly critical of the Landmarks Law on grounds that it accords great discretion to the Commission....\u201d <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>914 F.2d at 354. In responding to this argument, however, the Second Circuit held that \"absent proof of the discriminatory exercise of discretion, there is no constitutional relevance to these observations.\u201d <em>St. Bartholomew, </em>914 F.2d at 355.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b311-6\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOa\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Although the majority is correct that we should avoid addressing constitutional issues when unnecessary, I write separately because I think we should reach the constitutional issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The doctrine under which we avoid unnecessary Constitutional issues is most applicable when the constitutional issue is moot, or when there are two independent grounds on which we can resolve the case, one of which does not require constitutional analysis. This is illustrated by the cases cited by the majority. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 240 n. 7, 13 A.3d at 1232-33 n.7 <em>(citing In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 667, 967 A.2d 776 (2009) (constitutional issue was moot)); <em>Montrose Christian </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Sch. Corp. v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 578, 770 A.2d 111, 119 (2001) (analyzing court\u2019s order to seal courtroom under common law principle of openness); <em>Baltimore Sun v. Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 659, 755 A.2d 1130, 1133-1134 (2000) (case determined on issues of conflict of laws and on \u201ccharitable immunity\u201d). Unlike those cases, this appeal raises the <em>threshold question </em>of which of the levels of scrutiny is required for this claimed violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The level of scrutiny demanded by the Constitution depends upon whether the action at issue was an individualized government action, or a neutral action of general applicability, as explained in <em>Employment Division, Dep\u2019t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990). This is not a separate issue which may be avoided, but a threshold question. <em>See Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>268 F.3d 275, 292 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cthe opt-out policy enacted by Forney is neutral and of general application[, thus] [a]s a threshold matter ... the [policy] survives constitutional scrutiny under <em>Smith.\u201d); First Assembly of God v. Collier County, </em>20 F.3d 419, 423 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cthe threshold questions in analyzing a law challenged under the Free Exercise Clause are (1) is the law neutral, and (2) is the law of general applicability?\u201d); <em>Hyman v. City of Louisville, </em>132 F.Supp.2d 528, 537 (W.D.Ky.2001) <em>(Smith </em>requires a court to determine as a threshold matter whether the challenged regulation is \u201ca \u2018valid and neutral law of general applicability^]\u2019 \u201d) <em>vacated on other grounds by Hyman v. City of Louisville, </em>53 Fed.Appx. 740 (6th Cir.2002). The majority\u2019s conclusion that the refusal to postpone the trial was an abuse of discretion does not reheve of us of our obligation to identify which is the appropriate constitutional standard. <em>Cf. Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 631-32, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 1627, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (in analyzing law targeted at homosexuals, the Court first identified \u201crational basis\u201d as the correct level of scrutiny, and then held that the law \u201cfails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry.\u201d) An action is only entitled to the more deferential \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review, and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>lieved from higher constitutional scrutiny, if it qualifies as a neutral, generally applicable action under the threshold test.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Turning to this question, I agree that the trial court\u2019s refusal to postpone was neutral and of \u201cgeneral applicability,\u201d and not an individualized action that demands the higher scrutiny of <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). On this point, I am persuaded by Judge Harrell\u2019s detailed analysis of the nature of the trial court\u2019s action, in light of <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I would therefore hold that the correct level of scrutiny is <em>Smith\u2019s </em>lower level of scrutiny, which means that we apply our usual standard of review when considering trial court discretionary decisions, <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court abused its discretion. On this point, the majority opinion convincingly explains why the trial court\u2019s action should fail. I join the majority\u2019s analysis regarding why it was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Because I believe this discussion resolves the question, I would decline to wade into the thorny issue of whether the court\u2019s action imposes a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d as Judge Harrell does. This is partly because I consider some of Judge Harrell\u2019s reasoning regarding \u201csubstantial burden\u201d to be inapposite. Judge Harrell faults Neustadter for faffing to raise the issue regarding his religion earlier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Had the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to postpone placed such a burden on Petitioner\u2019s Free Exercise rights (or Petitioner perceived truly such a burden), Petitioner, I suspect, would have informed the trial court at some point during the period between 24 January 2008 \u2014 when the final trial dates were scheduled \u2014 and 6 May 2008 \u2014 the date on which Petitioner first and ultimately informed the trial court of the Shavuot conflict, less than a month before commencement of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Although I agree that a party\u2019s failure to raise such an objection timely is important, and often dispositive, that delay invokes an issue of \u201cwaiver,\u201d not \u201csubstantial burden.\u201d Clearly, whether or not a state action imposes a \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>burden\u201d on a party is an independent question from how adequately that party enforces his rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Furthermore, I would not address the intriguing issue Judge Harrell raises of whether the Free Exercise clause is \u201capplicable with equal force to the judicial branch.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-15\">. A party's failure to make a timely assertion of the claimed infringement on his religious beliefs <em>may </em>reflect on his sincerity, and in that sense diminish the infringement. But the level of sincerity was resolved favorably to Neustadter by the trial court, and I see no reason to disturb that factual finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
